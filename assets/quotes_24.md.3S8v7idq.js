For other uses, see Newtown (disambiguation). Newtown is a hamlet in the civil parish of Holme St Cuthbert in Cumbria, United Kingdom. It is located approximately two miles north-east of the village of Mawbray, a little over half-a-mile as the crow flies to the south-east of Beckfoot, and twenty-five miles west of the city of Carlisle. The B5300 coast road runs approximately three-quarters of a mile to the west of the hamlet, which goes to Maryport, nine-and-a-quarter miles to the south-west, and Silloth-on-Solway, approximately four miles to the north. History and etymology Newtown was first recorded in a 1538 survey of the Manor of Holm Cultram, and in the past has been known as New Mawbray. The name \\"Mawbray\\" comes from the Old English mæge-burh, meaning \\"the maidens' stronghold\\", or \\"maidens' castle\\",Armstrong, A. M.; Mawer, A.; Stenton, F. M.; Dickens, B. (1950). The place-names of Cumberland. English Place-Name Society, vol.xxi. Part 2. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 296. and the \\"New\\" prefix was added to distinguish the settlement from its namesake. Additional variant spellings include New Mawbrough, Newton, Newtowne, and Newtowene. The hamlet was created after the sea shifted sands near Beckfoot in the 16th century. This resulted in many residents having to leave their homes (or their homes being destroyed by the encroaching sea). Defence against Scottish incursions across the Solway was a concern of the Lord and Steward of Holm Cultram when planning the new settlement. Residents of Newtown in this era would have been expected to take part in the \\"seawake\\", a night watch to guard the Solway coast against Scottish raids. In 1828, a farmer named John Ostle was born at Newtown. His diaries recorded farming life on the Solway Plain in the 19th century, and have given local historians a great deal of information about Newtown and surrounding communities during that period. The hamlet today The hamlet itself has no public transportation links or amenities. The nearest primary school is at Holme St. Cuthbert, one-and-a-quarter miles to the south-east, as is the parish church. There is a pub, the Lowther, in Mawbray, but perhaps the closest attraction to Newtown is a farm park and tea room called the Gincase. The nearest railway station is Aspatria, and the nearest bus stops are at Beckfoot and Mawbray, on the B5300 coast road. Newtown is situated very near to the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which encompasses much of the shoreline to the west of the hamlet. Also along this section of the shoreline, Mawbray and Wolsty banks are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The hamlet is within the civil parish of Holme St. Cuthbert, and the borough of Allerdale. The parliamentary constituency is Workington, and the MP as of 2015 is Sir Tony Cunningham.

It is widepread in rivers and lakes except where the water is very soft. Description Potamogeton × angustifolius is a hybrid between shining pondweed Potamogeton lucens and various-leaved pondweed Potamogeton gramineus. It is a perennial, growing from robust rhizomes. The stems are variable: slender to robust, terete, and branching, usually reaching 1.2 m but rarely up to 2m. The submerged leaves are reduced to phyllodes at the base of the stem, but elsewhere are broad and translucent, yellowish to dark green, sometimes with a pinkish tinge. The leaves measure 50-130 × 10–25 mm on the stems and main branches, but may be much smaller on the side branches; they have 4-5 (rarely 6) veins either side of the midrib and are usually sessile but some clones may have a few petiolate leaves. Turions are absent. Unlike P. lucens, Potamogeton × angustifolius sometimes produces floating leaves, which are opaque and typically 55-105 × 22–40 mm. The stipules are persistent, open, green when fresh, drying to olive or brownish. The inflorescences are 20–50 mm long and have inconspicuous greenish flowers on robust peduncles 45–190 mm long. Fruits are not always produced; if present they are approximately 3 × 2 mm. Identification of Potamogeton × angustifolius may require experience. It is larger and more robust than P. gramineus but more slender and graceful than P. lucens. There is a tendency for main stems to more closely resemble P. lucens, and side branches P. gramineus. There is however no single character to identify this hybrid, and accurate determination is likely to rely on a combination of characters. Herbarium specimen of Potamogeton x angustifolius, detail. Taxonomy Potamogeton × angustifolius was first described by the Czech botanist Jan Svatopluk Presl in 1821. The species name means 'narrow- leaved'. Until recently the synonym P. x zizii was widely used and is likely to be encountered in the literature. Distribution Potamogeton × angustifolius is one of the most frequent pondweed hybrids, and is widespread globally. It has been recorded from Europe to the western Himalayas, including Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, France, Portugal, Italy, former Yugoslavia, European Russia, western Siberia, and the western Himalayas. Ecological Requirements and Conservation P. × angustifolius occurs in the same kind of habitats as its parents: standing or slow-flowing waters with a basic influence, often growing in the absence of one or both parents. There is evidence for a decline in south and east Britain but it remains widespread elsewhere. In Ireland it is widespread in waters that are too base-poor to support P. lucens; in Poland it is one of the most widespread pondweed hybrids. P. × angustifolius is classified as Endangered by the German Red List and Vulnerable by the Welsh Vascular Plant Red List. Cultivation P. × angustifolius is not in general cultivation, though like both of its parents it is an attractive plant and easy to grow. It tends to be smaller than P.lucens, which may be an advantage in smaller ponds, but retains the large, netted leaves. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Good water quality is needed to reduce the risk of turbid water or growth of blanket weed.

The site of the fortification was the confluence of the Gelbach and the Lahn rivers. As a result, the castle is designed as a lowland type, which is unusual for this region. In 1243 the castle was first mentioned in the will of Countess Mechthild of Sayn who left it to the Archbishopric of Cologne. The archbishop enfeoffed the fortress shortly thereafter to the noble family of Langenau, cousins of the counts of Laurenburg and thus of the House of Nassau. The family kept the castle as a joint inheritance or Ganerbschaft for centuries. The original fortress was turned into a water castle on the construction of a dyke. Today, of the 13th century fortification, only the square Romanesque style bergfried is left. The remaining fortifications, an enceinte and an eight-metre-high shield wall with two flanking towers, show elements of Gothic architecture and appeared in the 14th or 15th centuries. Presumably by the middle of the 14th century, when the Langenaus built New Langenau Castle as their main residence, the castle no longer served as a noble seat, but primarily as a base from which to manage the estate. In 1613 the Langenau family died out. The castle changed ownership several times in the years that followed. In the 17th century, a large timber-framed domestic building was built. In 1696 the mercantile and industrialist family of Marioth purchased the site as their residence and had it converted into a schloss in 1698. In 1847, Countess Giech, a daughter of Prussian reform minister, vom und zum Stein, became the new occupant. She had the schloss converted in 1851 into a hospital and home for children of the poor.

It was published by Ralph Beebe Blackman in 1943, was connected to signal-flow analysis by John Choma, and was made popular in the extra element theorem by R. D. Middlebrook and the asymptotic gain model of Solomon Rosenstark. Blackman's approach leads to the formula for the impedance Z between two selected terminals of a negative feedback amplifier as Blackman's formula: :Z = Z_D \\\\frac {1+T_{SC}}{1+T_{OC}} \\\\ , where ZD = impedance with the feedback disabled, TSC = loop transmission with a small-signal short across the selected terminal pair, and TOC = loop transmission with an open circuit across the terminal pair. The loop transmission also is referred to as the return ratio. Blackman's formula can be compared with Middlebrook's result for the input impedance Zin of a circuit based upon the extra-element theorem: :Z_{in} = Z^{\\\\infty}_{in} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1+Z^0_{e}/Z}{1+ Z^{\\\\infty}_{e}/Z}\\\\right] where: :Z\\\\ is the impedance of the extra element; Z^{\\\\infty}_{in} is the input impedance with Z\\\\ removed (or made infinite); Z^0_{e} is the impedance seen by the extra element Z\\\\ with the input shorted (or made zero); Z^{\\\\infty}_{e} is the impedance seen by the extra element Z\\\\ with the input open (or made infinite). Blackman's formula also can be compared with Choma's signal-flow result: :Z_{SS}=Z_{S0}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1+T_I}{1+T_Z}\\\\right] \\\\ , where Z_{S0}\\\\ is the value of Z_{SS}\\\\ under the condition that a selected parameter P is set to zero, return ratio T_Z\\\\ is evaluated with zero excitation and T_I\\\\ is T_Z\\\\ for the case of short-circuited source resistance.

He has set numerous American and World records over his career. He still holds the current M55 American record for the 10,000 metres. In 1996 he was elected into the inaugural class of the USATF Masters Hall of Fame, the first long distance runner. For more than a decade, Green was the director of the Hall of Fame. Green began running at Piedmont High School, running a 4:31.6 mile. He was the North Coast Section champion in the mile in 1950 which qualified him for the CIF California State Meet, but he didn't place in the final. He ran for two years at the nearby University of California, Berkeley, improving to 4:24, but he stopped running to concentrate on his studies. He wouldn't run competitively again for almost 30 years. After Baptist Divinity School he found his way to work for American Baptist National Ministries in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. On the road racing circuit, starting in 1981 he found himself far ahead of any other 50-year- olds. He still holds masters records in the M60 8 km, M50, M55 and M60 in the 15 km run, M50 and M60 10 mile run, M50, M55 and M60 20 km and half marathon, M50 25 km and M50 Marathon running sub-2:30 with a 2:29:11 at age 51. Those are just the official records, other marks not so recognized include a 2:25:52 marathon at age 52 and a 2:27:42 marathon at age 55, making him the oldest American to run under 2:30. A bout with prostate cancer in 1995 and injuries kept him out of running for almost 11 years but he returned to the competitive scene at age 74. After retiring as a demographer for the Baptist National Ministries, he worked for his local Association of USATF and led the Hall of Fame Committee. Spending a reported 70 hours a week, he would prepare detailed dossiers of each candidate for the vote by the other members of the Hall of Fame, plus the nationwide administrators who elect members. His dramatic, sermon like speeches announcing each inductee's qualifications were legendary until his sudden retirement in 2011. In addition to the Masters Hall of Fame, he is also a member of the Piedmont High School Hall of Fame.

Launched by Hmong tribal soldiers backed by the Central Intelligence Agency, it was based on the usage of overwhelming air power to clear the path for the guerrillas. The guerrillas were faced with the largest concentration of Vietnamese communist troops stationed outside Vietnam, and hoped to spoil that imminent attack. In the event, the promised air power allotment was halved and curtailed. Intermittent foul weather also restricted air operations. Nevertheless, the Hmong assault against communists on the mountain of Phou Pha Thi nearly carried the position in mid-December. However, a communist night raid that destroyed an ammunition dump, followed by the arrival of a relief column from the 316th Division, tipped the balance of battle against the assailants. On 7 January 1969, the Hmong retreated while pressed hard by the communists. Both sides took heavy casualties. However, the Vietnamese had abundant manpower to be trained as replacements. By contrast, the Hmong replacement pool was scanty. Moreover, the communists ended their follow-up drive within ten kilometers of the Hmong main bases at Long Chieng and Sam Thong. Overview After World War II, France found itself in the First Indochina War. As part of its loss of that war at Dien Ben Phu, it freed the Kingdom of Laos. Laotian neutrality was established in the 1954 Geneva Agreements. When France withdrew most of its military in conformity with the treaty, the United States filled the vacuum with purportedly civilian paramilitary instructors.Castle, pp. 7–12, 15–18. A North Vietnamese-backed communist insurrection began as early as 1949. Invading during the opium harvest season of 1953, it settled in northeastern Laos adjacent to the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.Dommen, pp. 30-34. As the Laotian Civil War flared, the Central Intelligence Agency established a secret guerrilla army in the Plain of Jars. Interposed between the communist settlement around Xam Neua and the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane, the Hmong military irregulars fought to hold on to their traditional territory, and to preserve Laos.Warner, pp. 44–47 Background The Royal Lao Army having been rendered essentially useless in the wake of the Battle of Nam Bac, the brunt of fighting the Laotian Civil War fell upon the Hmong guerrillas led by General Vang Pao. These Royalist irregulars faced a formidable force equivalent to 16 battalions of enemy troops clustered around the Pathet Lao capital of Xam Neua. Also arrayed against the guerrillas were two People's Army of Vietnam battalions near Nakhang, plus the 2 Pathet Lao Battalion augmented by two 82mm mortars and a 12.7mm machine gun. At this time, this was the strongest communist military concentration outside the borders of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This concentration was already threatening the strategic Plain of Jars at the end of the wet season; the upcoming dry season was the usual time for communist offensives.Conboy, Morrison, p. 201. The operation By October 1968, with the dry season pending, Vang Pao plotted a spoiling attack to be launched 1 November. He anticipated increased air support from American fighter-bombers because the Operation Rolling Thunder air campaign against North Vietnam had stood down, freeing up those air strikes for use in Laos. Additionally, the 56th Special Operations Wing based at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand had three A-1 Skyraider squadrons available. The Royal Lao Air Force would also be flying its T-28s from Vientiane; debuting in combat were Hmong pilots. These latter pressed home their undisciplined pointblank attacks with reckless courage, often returning in an aircraft holed by the backblast of their own dropped ordnance.Anthony, Sexton, p. 295. This larger air effort could be controlled through a new Air Operations Center dedicated to backing the Hmong. Newly trained forward air guides would help coordinate close air support. Because of this available airpower, Vang Pao planned to commit his guerrillas to a spoiling attack ranging out from forward bases at Nakhang and Houei Hinsa to sweep across Route 6. The Central Intelligence Agency section stationed in the American embassy believed that by disrupting the communists' expected usual dry season offensive, Vang Pao could gain the initiative in the struggle for northern Laos.Ahern, p. 310. Supply difficulties delayed the start of the operation for a week. Then the guerrilla forces launched their assault against heavy communist resistance. Poor weather hampered Hmong progress. Only in the third week of November did the guerrillas begin to gain ground, their way cleared by heavy use of air strikes. At this point, Vang Pao enlarged his spoiling attack into a full-fledged off-season offensive aimed at Phou Pha Thi, dubbing it Operation Pigfat. He claimed the recapture of this mountain was essential to Hmong morale, as they considered it sacred.Ahern, p. 308. At the same time, the captured radar installation at Lima Site 85 could be regained.Conboy, Morrison, p. 202. Vang Pao asserted he wished to recover the bodies of the U.S. airmen killed in action at the radar site.Warner, p. 263. The offensive would also serve the purpose of disrupting enemy moves on the guerrilla base of Nakhang. Pigfat was an eight battalion undertaking. One guerrilla battalion would defend Nakhang. Three more would be the offensive force. Four Royalist militia battalions would also support the attack. An air requirement of 100 daily U.S. Air Force strike sorties was slated for cover. The three battalion assault force was due to move out on 26 November. However, Vang Pao refused to launch the attack until 6 December. Despite reconnaissance showing no enemy around the landing zone, Vang Pao insisted that his ancestor had appeared in a dream to warn him that the enemy awaited him, although intelligence reports insisted the landing zone was clear.Ahern, p. 309. After landing on 6 December, the attack force formed four columns to advance on Phou Pha Thi. They found themselves with only half the U.S. air sorties planned upon, and that commitment for five days only; the brand new Operation Commando Hunt truck killing campaign on the Ho Chi Minh Trail was absorbing the rest. The push soon reached the hamlet of Houei Ma, six kilometers southwest of the Lima Site 85 objective. At this point, 10,000 refugees from the communists flooded the village, clogging the Hmong offensive. A few of the refugees were randomly picked for questioning by CIA agents accompanying the guerrillas. They verified that during the previous week, when the original assault was supposed to land, just as the ancestral dream had predicted, a large transient contingent of Vietnamese soldiers returning from the Luang Prabang front had been near the landing zone. The civilian populace had to be evacuated while enemy mortar shells rained in. The communist mortars took counterfire from 105mm howitzers, and air strikes from both U.S. and Lao fighter-bombers. On 6 and 7 December, the 11th and 12th days of Pigfat, air strikes hit Phou Pha Thi with rocketry, bombs, and napalm. On 8 December, a hand grenade was accidentally detonated in an incoming helicopter, destroying the copter and killing all hands aboard. That same day, a Republic F-105 Thunderchief and two A-1E Skyraiders were also lost. On 13 December, as the available air sorties dwindled, a Hmong guerrilla company assaulted Phou Pha Thi from the southeast. Shunning guerrilla tactics, the hill tribesmen surged up the hill in a frontal assault. Trapped on a trail on the southeast face by enemy fire, they spent 24 hours pinned down before retreating under 12.7mm machine gun fire from the summit. The machine gun was subsequently knocked out of action by artillery fire, but the Hmong were unable to regain the hill. With another 12.7mmm machine gun on the summit, plus an 82mm heavy mortar, the communists showed enough strength to stall the Hmong. Vang Pao was informed by a North Vietnamese defector that his former comrades were dubious about holding the hilltop position. However, the Hmong general began to doubt his troops' ability to continue. It was at this juncture that three days of air strikes, including napalm, were laid upon the ridge top. The 82mm mortar was disabled by an F-4 Phantom strike. Circling Hmong attacks curled about Phou Pha Thi to both east and west; the latter cut the communist-held supply line to the ridge, Route 602. From questioning prisoners, and from intercepted radio messages, Vang Pao learned that the enemy was also dubious of success; one of their defending battalions had lost half its manpower. Then, as Hmong probes tested for weaknesses in PAVN Group 766's defenses, the weather went bad. Two days of cloudy weather stifled air support for the Hmong. Then, as flying weather improved and air support once again increased, on 18 December the Hmong renewed their attack up Phou Pha Thi. As they reached the top, they ran into a heavy machine gun that drove them back off the summit.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 202–203. By 21 December, the action was stalemated. The PAVN broke the tie with a night raid on Houei Ma that blew up an ammunition depot and a howitzer. On 25 December, the 148 Regiment of the 316th Division launched an relief expedition from Xam Neua. Vang Pao attempted to counter that by having an appeal for surrender taped by a communist prisoner; he hoped to spark mass desertion before the relief column arrived. On 26 and 27 December, he had the appeal broadcast at the enemy via Helio Courier. An RLAF forward operating base at Muang Soui was stockpiled with ordnance; Thai mercenary pilots were slated to fly short strike missions from there against northerly Plain of Jars targets. However, PAVN sappers infiltrated at 02:00 on 1 January 1969, killing one of the onsite U.S. advisors and 11 of the local troops. The defenders trickled away.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 207–208. In the interim, Vang Pao was scheming a renewal of the offensive in a week, on 3 January. However, this new assault was never launched. Instead, the 148 Regiment survived air strikes to arrive on 5 January as communist reinforcements. Bullpup missiles fired from U.S. fighter-bombers were used in a vain try at breaking the communists. They failed, at the cost of a friendly fire incident. On 7 January 1969, Vang Pao ended Operation Pigfat.Conboy, Morrison, p. 203. The retreat began. Aftermath Operation Pigfat had killed hundreds of communist troops; the relief column's 148th Regiment was committed only 13 days and suffered 120 killed in action and 280 wounded. Group 766, which they aided, ended the campaign with fewer than 480 men in its three battalions.Conboy, Morrison, p. 205. These casualties would have to be replaced. According to the U.S. Air Force, the Royalists suffered 40 killed and 131 wounded in action.Anthony, Sexton, p. 285. According to another source, out of the 1,800 Hmong guerrillas committed to battle, there were about 300 killed in action, 500 wounded, and 400 gone missing. They had never before taken a casualty rate of over 50 percent.Warner, pp. 263-264 In either case, Hmong replacement for casualties was difficult, due to their limited pool of recruits. The Hmong withdrew with the PAVN pressing them. The PAVN communists captured Nakhang and dispatched the commanding officer, who doubled as both commander and province governor; this cemented communist control over the province. Nakhang would remain in communist hands henceforth.Warner, p. 264. Pushing down further into the Plain of Jars with their heaviest yet forces of the war, the communists bore down on the main Hmong bases of Long Chieng and Sam Thong. When they came within ten kilometers of the bases, all able-bodied males within them were armed. Dependent Hmong families began to sleep in the woods at night, hoping to evade any ground assault. Secretive meetings began among the hill tribes, Lao Theung as well as Hmong. Various bands packed up for dispersal into Sayaboury Province or elsewhere. The tribal leaders told Vang Pao that escape routes had been picked. However, they still relied on the general's advice. General Vang Pao considered other unexpected preemptive attacks, eventually leading to Operation Off Balance six months later.Warner, pp. 264–265. Endnotes References * Ahern, Thomas L.

This maneuver and the head- tilt/chin-lift maneuver are two of the main tools of basic airway management, and they are often used in conjunction with other basic airway techniques including bag-valve-mask ventilation. The jaw-thrust maneuver is often used on patients with cervical neck problems or suspected cervical spine injury. The maneuver is used on a supine patient. It is performed by placing the index and middle fingers to physically push the posterior aspects of the lower jaw upwards while their thumbs push down on the chin to open the mouth. When the mandible is displaced forward, it pulls the tongue forward and prevents it from obstructing the entrance to the trachea. Traditionally, the jaw-thrust maneuver has been considered the better alternative (rather than the head- tilt/chin-lift maneuver) when a first aider suspects that the patient may have a spinal injury (especially one to the neck portion of the spine). The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation has reviewed various studies that found no spine-protecting advantage to the jaw-thrust maneuver. Its \\"Treatment Recommendation\\" under \\"Opening the Airway\\" says, \\"Rescuers should open the airway using the head tilt–chin lift maneuver.\\" If the patient is in danger of pulmonary aspiration, he or she should be placed in the recovery position, or advanced airway management should be used.

The French surname Tanet could be toponymic or a sobriquet in origin. Spelling variations of this family name include: Tanat, Tannat, Tanet, Tanett, Tanatt, Tannatt, or even Danet due to apophony, and many more. In the case of 'Tanet' several interpretations are possible. The surname can be traced back to the Old Breton \\"tanet\\" meaning \\"aflame\\", that could be a nickname for a nervous or irritated trait or as a corruption of the Common Celtic 'tan-arth' \\"high fire\\", derived from the place where the original bearer once resided, suggesting in this case \\"one who dwelt on the beacon or lighthouse\\". Tanet could also be a corruption of the toponymic tanouët meaning oak grove (tannoed, which underwent a consonant mutation to tann-eto in Common Brittonic), and has the same root as Gaulish tanno- (oak tree), Latin tannum (oak bark) used in the tanning of leather, Old High German tanna (oak, fir, akin) from proto-Germanic tan, (needle, what sticks out) and Breton tann (oak tree). In Old French speaking regions it also meant brown cloth or the color of the tan and designated the manufacturer. This surname is now spread all over France with concentrations in Brittany and Aquitaine, though the Aquitanian origin may differ. A toponymic term tannet is also found in Savoie, Switzerland, Alpes-Maritimes: tanne, tune, tannaz, taverno or tuna (cave, hole, den or vault). Tanné is also commonly found in Finistère.

It was designed by Atkinson & Conrad and built from 1922 to 1938. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 1999.  History  A modest, functional civic building, the former Wynnum Fire Station is a prominent landmark on Mountjoy Terrace in Wynnum. Between 1860 and 1868 there were five attempts to form a fire fighting service for Brisbane. Each brigade struggled to survive, unable to attract a viable subscription base and hampered by inadequate equipment and an unreliable water supply. The establishment of an effective fire service did not enjoy a high priority among civic and government leaders. A fifth brigade, the City Volunteer Fire Brigade, was established in 1868 under rules which provided for better financial control and management through the Fire Brigade Board. These arrangements were consolidated by the Fire Brigades Act 1881 under which it was established that the Brigade was to be funded for fire services from contributions by the Queensland State Government, Brisbane Municipal Council, insurance companies and subscriptions. In 1889 the first full-time firemen were employed and a permanent fire brigade was established. A new headquarters, designed by Henry Wallace Atkinson, was completed on the corner of Ann and Edward streets (on a corner of the Normal School site) in 1890. This began a long association between the Fire Brigade and the various architectural firms with whom he was associated. Fire Services in Wynnum In the south-east of Brisbane, Wynnum sits on Moreton Bay. The railway link to Cleveland via Wynnum in 1888 was a major impetus to closer settlement with large areas of land being taken up soon after. The district expanded rapidly over the next twenty years until in 1913 the Town Council of Wynnum was constituted. The area became known as a seaside resort and the Wynnum and Manly foreshore area became increasingly popular with day visitors and holiday-makers. Since that time it has developed as a dormitory suburb of Brisbane, conveniently linked to the city. Wynnum was perceived to be a \\"healthy\\" place to live with its sea breezes, protected beaches, vistas to Moreton Bay, fishing and the availability of fresh local produce. The district continued to expand as the number of permanent residents increased; services and infrastructure were introduced; building activity expanded; and civic and community associations were established. The first fire brigade was established in Wynnum in 1921. Three blocks of land were purchased in Mountjoy Terrace, opposite Wolsey Parade, and a temporary building erected to serve as the fire station and residence. The Wynnum District was included in the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Board's District in 1928 and the brigade continued to operate from this station until the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Board replaced it with a new station under a fire services upgrading program funded by the Queensland Government and instigated by the Minister for Health and Home Affairs, Edward (Ned) Hanlon. The Wynnum Fire Station was opened by Hanlon on 25 May 1938. The new building housed the station facilities on the ground floor and a residence for the superintendent on the first floor. This combination of station and residence was the typical design for fire stations in Brisbane at this time. Similar residential fire stations included Yeronga Fire Station (1934), Coorparoo Fire Station (1935), Nundah Fire Station (1936) and Hamilton Fire Station (1941). A weatherboard-clad, gabled shed was constructed at some time shortly after the new fire station, being visible in a 1943 aerial photograph. The 1938 building continued to operate as a fire station until 2004 when a new facility for the service was built elsewhere and this property was sold into private ownership. Since that time it has served as a residence.  Description  The former Wynnum Fire Station is a two- storey, symmetrical timber-framed building in Mountjoy Terrace opposite the south-western end of Wolsey Parade. The building is clad with fibrous cement sheeting to the first storey, has timber weatherboards to the lower storey and a corrugated, fibro-cement sheeted hip roof. On the first floor a central, open verandah balcony projects over the engine room entrance with \\"Wynnum Fire Station\\" painted in red across the sheeting to the lower part of the balcony. The ground floor of the former fire station accommodates the engine room, watch office, locker room and ablutions area, dormitory, kitchen, laundry and duty officer bedroom. The timber pole connecting the residence to the engine room has been removed and the pole cupboard is now used for storage at ground level. The locker room contains intact purpose-built lockers for the firemen's uniforms and personal effects. The concrete floor to the engine room is marked with red wheel tracks and a concrete footpath crossing connects to the street. The interiors are lined with tongue and groove boarding and the ceilings are sheeted and battened. The laundry now accommodates additional lockers and storage. Windows to the ground level are shaded by horizontal timber hoods on decorative, cantilevered timber brackets. An extension has been inserted between the laundry and the duty officer's bedroom to accommodate a shower to the bedroom and provide additional storage area. A shower has also been added to the ablutions area of the locker room. The rear external timber stairs connect to the former residence above. The residence has a kitchen, living room, dining room, an open verandah balcony, three bedrooms and a bathroom. The living room, dining room and main bedroom open by French doors onto the verandah balcony. There are glazed fanlights above these French doors and side lights to those off the dining room. The pole cupboard housing the pole that connected the residence and the station below is adjacent to the bathroom. The interiors are clad with tongue and groove boarding and the ceilings sheeted and battened. Original fabric remains including kitchen cupboards, linen cupboard, dining room cupboard and main bedroom wardrobe. The bathroom is substantially intact with the terrazzo floor, pressed metal wall sheeting and the original hot water heater remaining. A carved keystone timber archway separates the dining room from the bathroom/bedroom area. There is a gable- roofed timber shed in the south-west corner of the site. Clad in weatherboards and flat sheets at the gable ends, internally the shed is partitioned into two spaces. The grassed and concreted grounds are well maintained. A concrete driveway along the western boundary arrives at the hose drying area and shed to the side and rear of the station. Recently planted palms (Archontophoenix) stand to the front of the station.

It was written for the 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V, being featured on the fictional radio station Radio Mirror Park, which Shadow hosted. To promote the video game, the song was released as a single on September 13, 2013, and Rockstar Games included it on their soundtrack album The Music of Grand Theft Auto V, on the Vol. 1: Original Music side. Musically, \\"Old Love / New Love\\" is a dance and house song with R&B; and Hi- NRG influences, whose lyrics describe the protagonist being confused by a phone call he received from an ex-girlfriend whom he still loves despite his heartache. In 2015, Warner Bros. released Shadow's third studio album Eclipse, where the song was added to the final track list. Upon its release, \\"Old Love / New Love\\" received critical acclaim by music critics; it was selected by most of them as a highlight from both albums; being lauded because of its composition, which was different from other Shadow songs, and reviewers named it a song suitable for the dance floor. In the same year, the song was promoted by the singer in multiple concert shows, and it was remixed by American DJ Armand Van Helden. Background On September 17, 2013, Rockstar Games published the action-adventure game videogame Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). Its soundtrack contained 214 songs when it was released, including the track \\"Old Love / New Love\\", that was written for the videogame by George \\"Twin Shadow\\" Lewis Jr., D'Angelo Lacy and Dennis Herring. In an interview for Ouch, My Ego! Shadow, who also hosted the in-game radio station named Radio Mirror Park, explained he was involved in the project because he \\"kind of become friends with\\" some developers and they wanted to work with him \\"for a long time\\". They contacted him and asked if he \\"wanted to host the radio show and do songs for the soundtrack\\", and he agreed. In a conversation with Preston Barta from Fresh Fiction TV, Shadow considered the lyrics to be \\"a little bit about someone trying to get back into your life and have you repeat what has happened but then again, you know, to the top [he tries and talks] about how sometimes doing everything all over again, even though it's all messed up, it's also important.\\" A music critic from Tiny Mix Tapes said \\"Old Love / New Love\\" portrays \\"a relationship of extremes\\". Ascher Kulich from The Tufts Daily mentioned that regardless of his ex-lover \\"calling and hurting him\\", Shadow continues in love with her. The refrain of \\"Old Love / New Love\\" includes the line \\"Drill me to the floor, this hurts even more than I expected it to do\\", which Christopher Monk from musicOMH considered it a \\"desperate death throe\\", and Andrew Unterberger defined the phone call from the ex- girlfriend to influence \\"evocative and discomfiting lyrics.\\" Composition Both Herring and Shadow Record producer \\"Old Love / New Love\\"; the latter also played bass guitar, drums, guitar and keyboards. Lacy provided featured vocals, Wynne Bennett additional keyboards, Ryan Gilligan audio mixing, and Ted Jensen and Joe LaPorta mastered the track. Musically, while Shadow described it as , music critics labeled it as a dance, dance-pop, and house act, that is influenced by R&B; and '90s Hi-NRG. Tiny Mix Tapes compared the vocals to those of Michael McDonald, and wrote the song features a disco- influenced guitar, a \\"Geiger counter\\" drum program, and a simple house beat. The track has a tempo of 116 beats per minute, and it incorporates piano house elements, guitars, drum beats, combined with a synthesizer. Kulich said the refrain is sung with a \\"catchy, drum-and-piano [sound] in the background\\"; Jamie Milton defined it for DIY as a \\"gigantic trance chorus\\", and Dan Reilly, from Spin, said that during that verse the song becomes \\"an electrifying jam\\". Release and promotion To promote GTA V, \\"Old Love / New Love\\" was released as single, on September 13, 2013. The single cover features the black-and- white face of Shadow sticking his tongue out; music critics Alex Young and Josiah Hughes complimented it. On September 24, Rockstar Games released the soundtrack album The Music of Grand Theft Auto V, and the song was featured on the Vol. 1: Original Music album. In March 2015, Warner Bros. released Shadow's third album titled Eclipse, which included \\"Old Love / New Love\\". In that year Shadow performed the song in different appearances, including the Troubadour, in Los Angeles, the Music Hall of Williamsburg, in New York City, the South Side Music Hall, in Dallas, at Fordham University's WFUV radio station, after a cross-country train trek, and the Landmark Music Festival. In 2015, when asked about if he would film more music videos, Shadow commented about filming one for \\"Old Love / New Love\\", but it was difficult to do it because he was busy touring. In the same year, American DJ Armand Van Helden remixed the song. Critical reception Shadow (pictured in 2011) was praised by music critics for offering a different sound from his previous songs After its 2013 release Dan Reilly called \\"Old Love / New Love\\" \\"soulful\\"; Ian Cohen wrote for Pitchfork that the song's \\"gleaming piano\\" flirts with Shadow's sincere \\"heatseaking lyricism\\". In a Death and Taxes review, Alex Moore praised its introduction as Shadow \\"makes you wade through about 30 seconds of wind-up\\" and the singer chants the hook \\"about 50 seconds [later]\\". According to him, when the hook happens it is \\"good\\", and lauded the conclusion, and that unlike Lorde's \\"Team\\", which was released on the same day, \\"Old Love / New Love\\" \\"is your new fucking jam\\". Jamie Milton penned for DIY it fits to the \\"mass rampages and elaborate bank robberies\\" featured in GTA V, and he compared it to David Guetta's music. Alex Young mentioned in Consequence of Sound the song was more suitable for the dance clubs than \\"six-star killing spree\\"; During The Music of Grand Theft Auto V soundtrack review Gerrit Feenstra noted \\"Old Love / New Love\\", for KEXP-FM, as \\"one of the finest tracks\\" from it, a feeling Pat Levy shared in a Consequence of Sound review, adding it is Shadow's best efforts ever, and marked it as an \\"essential track\\". Feenstra, in a separate review for the same radio station, claimed its \\"over-dramatic [tone]\\" matches without the context of the soundtrack. The song was ranked at number 71 on Rolling Stones 100 Best Songs of 2013, with a commentary comparing it to \\"Get Lucky\\" (2013) by Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams. After the release of Eclipse, Embling for Tiny Mix Tapes praised the song and Shadow. In his analysis for Slant Magazine Jesse Cataldo examined it as cheerful and \\"less focused on grandiloquence\\" so it achieves to \\"[build] up an uncanny, off-kilter momentum\\"; Ian Gormely considered for Exclaim! that Shadow created a \\"sublime catharsis\\"; AllMusic's Heather Phares lauded its contemporary sound; Philip Cosores from Paste commented it is Shadow's funniest song; Jayson Greene from Pitchfork labeled it as \\"sexy\\"; Sand Avidar- Walzer described it for Glide as \\"a straight-up summer house jam\\"; Ryan Leas wrote for Stereogum that it could not be rare to hear \\"Old Love / New Love\\" in a music club, a feeling shared by Andy Battagli, who compared it to Daft Punk in a the Current review; George Schlesinger noted for The Village Voice the song \\"[reminds] of the good stuff, the midnight mystique and inherent sexiness that help pull you back in\\"; and Andrew Unterberger mentioned for Spin that although it is the most aged song from Eclipse, it is \\"the most exciting for Shadow's future\\", as well. However, Samuel Tolzmann from Pretty Much Amazing called it \\"cheesy\\", and Joseph Moore asserted for No Ripcord that its millennial whoop is monotonous. Several music critics graded \\"Old Love / New Love\\" as a highlight from Eclipse. But some of them criticized the album for this reason. In a review for The Observer, Daniel O'Boyle was disappointed of the result it \\"could have been\\"; J. Moore considered the \\"harmonies with Lacy [hinting] at a darkness far greater than what is expressed on\\" the album; Tom Walters named it for DIY \\"an infectious dance floor belter\\" but felt discomforted it became the focal point on a \\"brand new material [record]\\"; and David Turner from Rolling Stone added that \\"Old Love / New Love\\" gives \\"rave- level bliss on an album that more often sticks to cocksure swagger or somber introspection\\".

It encompasses various techniques performed to create an open or patent airway – a clear path between a patient's lungs and the outside world. This is accomplished by clearing or preventing obstructions of airways. Obstructions can be caused by many things, including the patient's own tongue or other anatomical components of the airway, foreign bodies, excessive amounts of blood and body fluids, or aspiration of food particles. Unlike basic airway management such as head-tilt or jaw-thrust maneuver, advanced airway management relies on the use of medical equipment and advanced training. Certain invasive airway management techniques can be performed \\"blind\\" or with visualization of the glottis. Visualization of the glottis can be accomplished either directly by using a laryngoscope blade or by utilizing newer video technology options. In roughly increasing order of invasiveness are the use of supraglottic devices such as oropharyngeal (OPA), nasopharyngeal (NPA), and laryngeal mask airways (LMA). Laryngeal mask airways can even be used to deliver general anesthesia. These are followed by infraglottic techniques, such as tracheal intubation and finally surgical techniques. Advanced airway management is a key component in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, anaesthesia, emergency medicine, and intensive care medicine. The A in the ABC initialism mnemonic for dealing with critically ill patients stands for airway management. Many airways are straightforward to manage. However, some can be challenging. Such difficulties can be predicted to some extent; a recent Cochrane systematic review examines the sensitivity and specificity of the various bedside tests commonly used to predict difficulty in airway management. Removal of foreign objects In advanced airway management foreign objects are either removed by suction or with e.g. a Magill forceps under inspection of the airway with a laryngoscope or bronchoscope. If removal is not possible surgical methods should be considered. Supraglottic techniques Supraglottic techniques include the use of supraglottic tubes, such as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways, and supraglottic devises such as laryngeal masks. Common for all supraglottic devises are that they are introduced into the pharynx, ensuring the upper respiratory tract remains open, without passing through the glottis and thereby entering the trachea. Nasopharyngeal airway Nasopharyngeal airways is a soft rubber or plastic hollow tube that is passed through the nose into the posterior pharynx. Patients tolerate NPAs more easily than OPAs, so NPAs can be used when the use of an OPA is difficult, such as when the patient's jaw is clenched or the patient is semiconscious and cannot tolerate an OPA. NPAs are generally not recommended if there is suspicion of a fracture to the base of the skull, due to the possibility of the tube entering the cranium. However, the actual risks of this complication occurring compared to the risks of damage from hypoxia if an airway is not used are debatable. Oropharyngeal airway Oropharyngeal airways in a range of sizes Oropharyngeal airways are rigid plastic curved devices, which are inserted through the patients mouth. It prevents the patients tongue from covering the epiglottis and thereby obstructing the airway. An oropharyngeal airway should only be used in a deeply unresponsive patient because in a responsive patient they can cause vomiting and aspiration by stimulating the gag reflex. Supraglottic airway Supraglottic airways (or extraglottic devices) are a family of devices that are inserted through the mouth to sit on top of the larynx. Supraglottic airways are used in the majority of operations performed under general anaesthesia. Compared to a cuffed tracheal tube (see below), they give less protection against aspiration but are easier to insert and cause less laryngeal trauma. The best-known example is the laryngeal mask airway. A laryngeal mask airway is an airway placed into the mouth and set over the glottis and inflated. Other variations include devices with oesophageal access ports, so that a separate tube can be inserted from the mouth to the stomach to decompress accumulated gases and drain liquid contents. Some devices can have an endotracheal tube passed through them into the trachea. Infraglottic techniques A cuffed endotracheal tube used in tracheal intubation Indications There are specific indications or guidelines for deciding a more invasive and more secure airway is worth the associated risk:Avva U, Bhimji SS. Airway, Management. [Updated 2017 Dec 15]. In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2018 Jan-. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470403/ * respiratory failure * apnea or the suspension of breathing * decreased or altered level of consciousness, rapid mental status change, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 8 (GCS<8). * major trauma, such as penetrating injury to abdomen or chest * direct airway injury or facial burns * high risk of aspiration Tracheal intubation Tracheal intubation, often simply referred to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic or rubber tube into the trachea to maintain an open airway or to serve as a conduit through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of the lungs, including mechanical ventilation, and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction. The most widely used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is passed through the mouth and vocal apparatus into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. ETTubeandNGtubeMarked Classically tracheal intubation has been performed utilizing laryngoscopic blades to obtain direct visualization of the vocal cords. Even in this category there are multiple different blade styles, shapes and lengths from which to choose. Multiple intubation tools are now available with built-in video technology. A Glidescope utilizes a laryngoscopic blade connected by a cable to a large video screen and requires a slightly different technique than that of a traditional laryngoscope. The McGrath model has a compact design with a smaller screen directly attached to the blade. Studies have shown that video laryngoscopes when compared to classic models resulted in fewer failed intubation attempts, especially in those patients designated as more difficult airways. These devices are quickly finding their way into emergency departments, operating theaters and critical care floors across the world.Lewis SR, Butler AR, Parker J, Cook TM, Smith AF. Videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for adult patients requiring tracheal intubation. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2016, Issue 11. Art. No: CD011136 DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011136.pub2. Alternatives to standard endotracheal tubes includes laryngeal tube and combitube. Confirming placement The absolute gold standard for confirming successful placement of an endotracheal tube is direct visualization of the tube passing through the vocal cords. Other methods used as secondary confirmation include carbon dioxide detectors, capnography, oxygen saturation, chest x-ray, or equal chest rise and equal breath sounds heard on both sides of the chest. Surgical methods alt=In In cricothyrotomy, the incision or puncture is made through the cricothyroid membrane in between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage Surgical methods for airway management rely on making a surgical incision is made below the glottis in order to achieve direct access to the lower respiratory tract, bypassing the upper respiratory tract. Surgical airway management is often performed as a last resort in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Surgical airway management is also used when a person will need a mechanical ventilator for a longer period. Surgical methods for airway management include cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy. A cricothyrotomy is an incision made through the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life- threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed as a last resort in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications. A tracheotomy is a surgically created opening from the skin of the neck down to the trachea. A tracheotomy may be considered where a person will need to be on a mechanical ventilator for a longer period. The advantages of a tracheotomy include less risk of infection and damage to the trachea such as tracheal stenosis. Pediatric considerations Premature infant with ventilator It is always important not to think of children as just small adults. They are unique in far more ways than simply being smaller in size. There are many basic differences in anatomy compared to adults that can affect airway management. For example children's heads are proportionally larger in relation to their overall body size. This can cause alignment issues that have the potential to make it substantially more difficult to obtain good visualization of the appropriate airway landmarks. The differences in a child's anatomy can also affect equipment choices, such as choosing a straight laryngoscope blade instead of a curved one to achieve better control of a more elastic airway. Making the right equipment choices is so important that a color-coded tape measure called the Broselow tape was created to help facilitate rapid and accurate decisions in pediatric emergency situations. Birth complications, congenital syndromes (such as Down syndrome) and even recent illness or nasal congestion can affect how airway management is approached in a child. When ventilation, various airway options and even intubation are unsuccessful, this is a terrifying situation known as \\"cannot ventilate, cannot intubate\\". Typically this is when a cricothyrotomy would be attempted as mentioned above. However, this tricky procedure is even more difficult in kids due to their extra flexible airways. The chance of accidentally puncturing all the way through the trachea to the esophagus increases substantially. The risk is considered so high that the procedure is contraindicated in children under the age of 5–6 years old.Harless J, Ramalah R, Bhananker SM. Pediatric airway management.

Brian Joines of Image Comics suspects that the reason Krampus (specifically, as well as dark aspects of Christmas in general) has not been historically popularized in America is a social artifact resulting from \\"the nature of how we view Christmas in this country, both as a big day for kids and as the birth of a big religious figurehead\\". In some North American depictions, Krampus is an antihero who seeks to prevent children from becoming spoiled by rampant consumerism flowing from the economics of Christmas. Krampus is often mentioned in media related to Christmas,Krampus is briefly mentioned in the Supernatural (U.S. TV series) episode \\"A Very Supernatural Christmas\\" (2007) as being one of the anti- Clauses in folklore. but the following lists instances where the character is featured significantly.

Costumes Costumed characters are a central part of all Krampus celebrations. These characters include: Krampus, Saint Nikolaus, the woodsman, angels, and the old woman. As Krampus is half-goat and half-demon, the costume normally shares certain primary elements such as: a fur suit, horns, demon mask, and hooves. Props commonly used are; bells, a birch switch, basket worn on the back, chains, walking staff, and a horse hair or hemp flogger. The most traditional Krampus costumes are made from goat/sheep skins, animal horns, and hand carved masks. More often they are made with modern and less costly materials, such as: fake fur and latex masks. Several Krampus costume instructional YouTube videos are available.

Many of their works are now heritage-listed. History In 1889, while working as a draughtsman in the office of the Queensland Colonial Architect, Henry Atkinson submitted an entry into a competition for a new Head Fire Station on the corner of Ann and Edward Streets in Brisbane. Having won the competition, he left the Queensland Public Service and started his own private practice. The Head Fire Station was completed in December 1890 but has since been demolished. However, his architectural practice has continued through a series of partnerships. In 1907, he took Charles McLay as his partner creating Atkinson and McLay. That partnership lasted until 1918, when McLay died. Atkinson then partnered with Arnold Henry Conrad (who had joined the firm in 1907) to create Atkinson and Conrad which lasted from 1918 until 1939 (Atkinson having died in 1938). In 2015, the practice founded by Henry Atkinson is known as Conrad Gargett. The University of Queensland Library holds many architectural drawings by Atkinson and his practice.

It can also be found growing near Wellington and the Chatham Islands, although these later plantings are thought to be a result of Maori plantings in the late 18th century and early 19th century.

He was the cashier at the Colombo Kachcheri and was appointed to the titular rank of Gate Mudaliyar. Early life and family Ponnambalam was born in 1814 in Manipay in northern Ceylon. He was the son of Arunachalam and Thangam. Through his paternal line Ponnambalam is believed to be a descendant of Mana Mudaliyar of Thondai Nadu, one of the pioneer settlers of Jaffna peninsula in the late 15th century. Ponnambalam's father died when he was an infant and his mother married Ariyaputhira. In 1830, aged 16, Ponnambalam was sent to Colombo to live with Gate Mudaliyar A. Coomaraswamy and his wife Visalachchi. He studied English at the Regimental School. Ponnambalam married Sellachi Ammai, daughter of Gate Mudaliyar A. Coomaraswamy, on 24 January 1844. They had three sons (P. Coomaraswamy, P. Ramanathan and P. Arunchalam). Career Ponnambalam worked as a volunteer at the Colonial Secretary's office but he could not get a paid position in the office. He took up trade but found business to be slow. He took up coffee cultivation but this too did not succeed. A few months after the death of Gate Mudaliyar A. Coomaraswamy, Ponnambalam was appointed landing waiter and searcher at the Customs Department but the fees he had to pay to various public officials meant that he earned little from the job. However, his devotion to duty and integrity were noted by those in power and on 11 May 1845 he was appointed cashier at the Colombo Kachcheri. He became Deputy Coroner for Colombo in February 1847 and two months later he was appointed Mudaliyar of the Governor's Gate. His investiture took place on 9 April 1847 at Queen's House, Colombo. In October 1847 he was appointed justice of the peace for Colombo District, serving as an unofficial magistrate. Governor Torrington appointed Ponnambalam the native revenue assistant to the Government Agent of the Western Province but the Secretary of State refused to confirm the appointment because the law at that time only allowed the Government Agent to collect taxes, not the Assistant Government Agent. A disappointed Ponnambalam left, along with several relatives, left for pilgrimage to India in January 1850, returning to Ceylon in May 1850. Ponnambalam started losing interest in his work in 1851, and after his wife died in September 1854, he resigned from his position as cashier at the Colombo Kachcheri on 30 November 1854. His three young sons were brought up his mother-in-law Visalachchi. He became a merchant, importing and exporting goods but, not having the callousness needed to succeed in business, failed. In his later years Ponnambalam immersed himself in religious devotion. Influenced by his Hindu pilgrimage to South India, Ponnambalam started building a Sivan temple in Colombo, the Sri Ponnambala Vaneswara Temple at Sea Street in Kochchikade, in 1856. The temple was consecrated on 12 November 1857. Soon after he fell ill and took seven years to recover. In his old age Ponnambalam devoted more and more of his time to running of the temple, to the detriment of his own health. In 1879 he suffered a stroke but recovered and continued with his temple duties. He suffered a second stroke which disabled him. His eldest son Coomaraswamy took over caring for him and Ponnambalam recovered a little. He died on 4 September 1887.

Function  Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). The gene content of the KIR gene cluster varies among haplotypes, although several 'framework' genes are found in all haplotypes (KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR3DL4, KIR3DL2). The KIR proteins are classified by the number of extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2D or 3D) and by whether they have a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic domain. KIR proteins with the long cytoplasmic domain transduce inhibitory signals upon ligand binding via an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), while KIR proteins with the short cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM motif and instead associate with the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules; thus, KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulation of the immune response.

He was married to the dramatist Lillian Hellman. Biography Early life Kober was born into a Jewish family in Brody, Galicia, in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now part of western Ukraine). His family emigrated to the United States when he was 4. They first moved to Harlem before settling in The Bronx. He attended the High School Of Commerce (later known as Louis D. Brandeis High School) for one semester before working at a series of jobs, including as a stock clerk at Gimbels. He then found work as a theatrical press agent for the Shubert brothers, Jed Harris, Herman Shumlin, and Ruth Draper. Kober married Lillian Hellman on December 31, 1925. During their marriage, they often lived apart. They divorced in 1932, after Hellman had started a relationship with Dashiell Hammett. He later married Margaret Frohnknecht in 1941, who died in 1951. They had one daughter, Catherine. Writing career Kober began writing humorous short fiction for The New Yorker in 1926 and became a prolific contributor. Many of his characters, such as the husband-hunter Bella Gross, were based on his Jewish upbringing in the Bronx. His New Yorker stories were later collected in the anthologies Thunder Over the Bronx (1935), Pardon Me for Pointing (1939), My Dear Bella (1941), Parm Me (1945), and Bella, Bella Kissed a Fella (1951). He became a screenwriter in Hollywood, working on about 30 films in the 1930s and 1940s, including The Little Foxes (1938), based on Hellman's semi-autobiographical play. Kober wrote the Broadway play Having Wonderful Time, a comedy set in a Jewish resort in the Catskills. It was staged in 1937 and the following year it was made into a Hollywood film, though the Jewish ethnic humor was sanitized. It was adapted as a stage musical, Wish You Were Here, in 1952. Kober died of cancer in New York on June 12, 1975 at the age of 74. He was portrayed by David Paymer in the 1999 film, Dash and Lilly.

Background Unit 731 was specifically created by the Japanese military in Harbin, China (then part of Japanese-occupied Manchukuo) for researching biological and chemical warfare, by carrying out human experimentation on people of all ages. During the Second Sino-Japanese War and later World War II, the Japanese had encased bubonic plague, cholera, smallpox, botulism, anthrax, and other diseases into bombs where they were routinely dropped on Chinese combatants and non-combatants. According to the 2002 International Symposium on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare, the number of people killed by the Imperial Japanese Army germ warfare and human experiments was around 580,000.Daniel Barenblatt, A Plague upon Humanity, 2004, p.xii, 173. During the first few months at war with the United States following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan planned to use biological weapons against Americans. During the Philippines Campaign in March 1942, the Japanese considered releasing 90 kg (200 lbs) of plague-carrying fleas—about 150 million insects—in each of ten separate attacks, but the Americans surrendered at Bataan before the plan was implemented. Around November 1944, Japan launched a total of 9,300 incendiary and antipersonnel bombs carried by balloons which were designed to rise to 10,000 meters (30,000 ft), swept eastward by the jet stream to the continental United States. These killed six American civilians near Bly, Oregon, crashed into a farm in Medford, Oregon, and caused a short circuit in the power lines supplying electricity for the nuclear reactor cooling pumps in the Manhattan Project's production facility at the Hanford Site in Washington. A backup system restored power.History of the Plutonium Production Facilities at the Hanford Site Historic District, 1943-1990 Retrieved 27 April 2007 During the Battle of Iwo Jima, another biological attack was considered against the invading Americans. Pilot Shoichi Matsumoto later recounted how two gliders carrying pathogens were supposed to be towed over the battle and released, but the gliders that were supposed to take off from mainland Japan to Matsumoto's airfield in Pingfang District in preparation for the attack never reached their destination.Tom Mangold, Jeff Goldberg, \\"Plague Wars: The Terrifying Reality of Biological Warfare, page 24-25, 0-3122-6379-1 Operational plan During the last months of the war, Ishii was preparing for a long-distance attack on the United States with biological weapons. This operation, codenamed \\"Cherry Blossoms at Night\\", called for the use of airplanes to spread plague in San Diego at night. The plan was finalized on March 26, 1945. Five of the new I-400-class long-range submarines were to be sent across the Pacific Ocean, each carrying three Aichi M6A Seiran aircraft loaded with plague-infected fleas. The submarines were to surface and launch the aircraft towards the target, either to drop the plague via balloon bombs, or to crash in enemy territory. Either way, the plague would then infect and kill thousands of people in the area. The mission was extremely risky for the pilots and submariners, likely a one-way kamikaze mission. A pilot under the command of Ishii, Ishio Kobata, recalled the plan in 1998: The plan was scheduled to begin on September 22, 1945, but was not realized because of the surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945. Chief of the Army General Staff Yoshijirō Umezu vetoed the plan at first due to logistics reasons, but he began to re-embrace the idea around early August 1945, once the Imperial Japanese Navy said that they had a few more capable long-range submarines to carry boat planes without encountering significant problems along the way. Arata Mizoguchi, who was a Unit 731 commander in the Imperial Japanese Navy, said that only three I-400 had been built by August 15, but estimated that, by September 2, two or three more would have been built ahead of schedule had the war gone on.

It dates from the mid-15th century and is now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. Most art historians think that Filippo Lippi painted more of the original work, and that it was added to some years after by other artists, as well as including work by assistants in the workshops of both the original masters. It has been known as the Washington Tondo and Cook Tondo after a former owner, and this latter name in particular continues to be used over 50 years after the painting left the Cook collection.For example in 2005 by Kanter and Palladino, 282 The tondo is painted in tempera on a wood panel, and the painted surface has a diameter of 137.3 cm (54 1/16 in.). The National Gallery of Art dates it to \\"c. 1440/1460\\".NGA Art historians are agreed that the painting was produced over a considerable period, with significant changes in the composition, and contributions from a number of hands. While some are critical of the discordances this history has produced,Sale, 10–13; Kanter and Palladino, 282 for John Walker, the second director of the National Gallery of Art, the result was > among the greatest Florentine paintings in the world. It is a climax of > beauty, a summary in itself of the whole evolution of the Italian schools of > painting in the first half of the fifteenth century. For it stands at a > crossroad of art. The old style, the gay, colorful, fairy tale painting of > the Middle Ages, is ending in an outburst of splendor; and the new style, > scientific in observation, studious in anatomy and perspective, realistic in > its portrayal of life, is beginning its long development.Walker, 76  Description  Detail of the central area The painting shows the three Magi or \\"kings\\" presenting their gifts to the infant Jesus, who is held by his mother. Saint Joseph stands beside her, and the manger, ox and ass of the usual depiction of the Nativity are behind this main group. Thus far the composition contains the inevitable components in a very standard arrangement.Schiller, 110–114; Palazzo Medici As very often, the subject has been combined with the Adoration of the Shepherds,Schiller, 114 who are represented by three figures in ragged dress, one behind Joseph, and two at the right side of the stable building behind. Only the first of these is looking at Jesus and Mary, from an oblique angle almost behind them. Of the other two, the kneeling one points in the direction of the manger, well behind the sacred figures. The manger is placed outside the stable, and the ox and ass are also in the open air. The interior of the stable is occupied by what are presumably the Magi's horses and their grooms, removing their tack and in one case checking a horseshoe.Palazzo Medici Behind the magi on the left a large procession of their retinues continue to arrive, passing through an arch that is part of a large ruined structure. To the right of the main group the city walls of Bethlehem run up a steep slope, with a road or path running in front of the walls. Down this another large group, presumably more of the Magis' parties, is coming, riding on camels and horses.Palazzo Medici, though they say \\"On the extreme right is a walled city, where the straggling tail of the Magi's cortege is clambering up a steep path with their camels\\", when they are clearly coming down the slope. A number of townsfolk have come out through a gateway in the walls, and are looking and pointing, in one case kneeling in prayer, but all looking in a different direction from the final location of the main figures.Palazzo Medici; Kanter and Palladino, 282 At the top of the hill a large but indistinctly painted group form a crowd, perhaps funnelling down the narrow path. Detail around the arch On the top of the stable a large peacock perches, looking over his shoulder. There are two other birds to his right, which have been identified as a goshawk seizing a pheasant.Sale, 9 Though they look as though they too are on the roof they should be imagined as in flight in mid-air in front of it. This partly explains their discrepancy in scale with the two shepherds below them, though perhaps not entirely. The painting is marked by several such discrepancies, to a degree that is somewhat surprising in a work of this date, and probably mostly explained by the spatial complexity of the composition, and the number of changes as it developed. The peacock's feet clearly grasp the end of a beam from the stable roof, but the bird is far too large compared to the figures and animals below him in the middle ground.Sale, 9–10, 12 Another of the most obvious discrepancies in scale is around the arch to the left, between the size of the figures of the procession coming through the arch, and those of the locals and unmounted horses to the right of the arch. Who the nearly naked youths standing on the ruins are supposed to represent has puzzled art historians,The NGA writes \\"The nudes standing on the walls remain mysterious. Perhaps they are people who were formerly outcasts but who are now brought into the welcoming fold of the new religion\\". but their compositional function seems clearly to be to suggest a grander scale for the building than the procession through the arch would do. They also represent \\"an early indication of that preoccupation with human anatomy, which was to obsess Italian artists until it reached its climax with Michelangelo.\\"Walker, 76  Stages of painting  Detail probably including work from three phases The painting as it now appears is believed to have developed in several stages. In the usual reconstruction, first advanced by Bernard Berenson,Walker, 76; Cavallini to Veronese – Italian Renaissance Art, accessed 21 December 2014 the painting was begun by Fra Angelico and his workshop, probably in the 1440s. The hand of Fra Angelico himself is detected in the face of the Virgin Mary, but other parts of the painting seem to be by assistants. The small figures on the steep path at the right of the painting fit his workshop stylistically, and it has been pointed out that the direction they face, and in which some point, does not relate well to the composition as it is today. The same can also be said of many of the smaller figures on the left side of the work. Angelico's workshop was very busy, and his career was dogged by a number of disputes over uncompleted commissions. Progress on the tondo seems to have stalled. At some point, perhaps upon Angelico's death in 1455, the unfinished work appears to have passed to the workshop of Filippo Lippi, the other main Florentine painter of the period. Both Angelico and Lippi worked on other commissions for the Medici family, then at the peak of their wealth and power.NGA; Sale, 4–7; Kanter and Palladino, 282–283 The whole stable has been described as \\"an awkward later addition\\", perhaps occupying a space once intended for the main figures,Kanter and Palladino, 282–283, 283 quoted and the peacock and other birds on the roof of the stable are painted over finished areas, rather than areas \\"reserved\\" as would be the case if they had been planned from the start. They appear to come from an even later phase of painting, and have been connected with emblems adopted by Cosimo de' Medici's sons Piero (1416–1469) and Giovanni (1421–1463). The former used a falcon holding a ring, with the motto \\"SEMPER\\" (\\"always\\" or \\"for ever\\" in Latin) and the latter a peacock with the motto \\"REGARDE-MOI\\" (\\"Watch me\\" in French).Sale, 7–8 Together with the dog on the grass at the bottom of the painting, they were perhaps added by Benozzo Gozzoli around the time he was working on the famous fresco cycle of the Magi Chapel in the Medici Palace in 1459–61. Gozzoli was a former member of Fra Angelico's workshop who by then ran his own studio. The chapel frescos also centre on elaborate processions of the Magi, and include several birds, and feathers, one of which is a goshawk, and another a peacock in a very similar pose to the one in the tondo.Sale, 7–13  History  Eastern wall of the Medici Magi chapel, The Procession of the Youngest Magi, 1459–1461, Benozzo Gozzoli The painting has been generally identified with one recorded in an inventory of the contents of the Medici Palace made in 1492 after the death of Lorenzo the Magnificent, by which time the painting was several decades old. It was in one of the ground floor \\"grand rooms\\" that also contained the three large paintings of The Battle of San Romano that are the best known works of Paolo Uccello, and are now divided between London, Paris and Florence. It was given a larger value than these, or any other painting in the palace:NGA > A large tondo with a gilt frame depicting our Lady and our Lord and the Magi > who come to make an offering, from the hand of fra'Giovanni: f. > 100.Stapleford, 71 From at least the late 16th century it belonged to the Florentine Guicciardini family, but it was sold in July 1810 to Chevalier François-Honoré Dubois, chief of police in Florence during the Napoleonic occupation, described as by Botticelli. It was sold again in London in 1826 and then remained in England until World War II, passing through a number of collections, and attributed to a number of artists: Fra Angelico in 1826, Filippo Lippi in 1849, Filippino Lippi in 1874. It ended in the important collection of Sir Francis Cook and subsequent Cook Baronets in Doughty House, Richmond, Surrey. In 1941 it was one of 25 pictures from the Cook collection sent to the United States for safe-keeping during the war. It was due to return in 1947 but was sold just before the voyage.Walker, 41; Cavallini to Veronese – Italian Renaissance Art, accessed 21 December 2014 It was bought by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, New York (attributed to Filippo Lippi), and in 1952 it was donated to the National Gallery of Art.NGA Provenance; Palazzo Medici Iconography and context Domenico Veneziano, Adoration of the Magi, Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, probably a Medici commission of c. 1439–1442 A high quality Florentine tondo featuring the Magi would be suspected of originating with a Medici commission even without the evidence of the inventory, as the family had a very particular interest in both the subject and the form. The Magi had been the key Medici devotion for decades, apparently beginning with the papacy of Antipope John XXIII (1410–1415) when they had become the main bankers of the Papacy, or at least those parts John controlled. The Medici belonged to the Compagnia de' Magi, a Florentine confraternity based at the San Marco complex just by the Medici Palace, both of which Cosimo de' Medici rebuilt a few years before the tondo was painted. An annual procession on the feast of the Epiphany on January 6 was organized by the confraternity, and passed in front of the Medici Palace. It was a costumed re-enactment of their arrival at the nativity, with the main parts taken by the leading members, including the Medici and their associates.Sale, 6–7; NGA The Magi were regarded as saints, and so in the tondo have rather unusual halos of gold dots, unlike the discs of the Holy Family. Their combination of sainthood with the possession and giving of luxury goods may have been a factor in their attraction for the Medici. The tondo shape for large paintings may itself have been a Medici innovation, possibly representing the gold ring with a diamond that became used as a device by the family from the 1440s.Sale, 6 The shape probably represents an inflation of the far smaller painted desco da parto or \\"birthing-tray\\", a decorated wooden tray, round or twelve-sided, that was traditionally presented by a Florentine husband to his wife after childbirth, and then used for serving refreshments to her visitors as she lay in state for a period of days after. The same 1492 inventory that probably records the tondo shows that Lorenzo de' Medici kept the desco da parto presented on his own birth in 1449 hanging on his bedroom wall until his death. These desci were typically decorated with allegorical or mythological scenes, while the large tondo was mostly used for religious subjects. But the shape was not found in paintings for churches, and may have carried a deliberate suggestion of a commission for a palace.NGA Apart from the tondo being discussed, another with a loosely similar composition showing the Adoration of the Magi, by Domenico Veneziano (now Gemäldegalerie, Berlin) is probably a Medici commission of c. 1439–1442; it may also be another painting recorded in the 1492 inventory (though that Magi tondo is there attributed to Pesellino). Among other similarities it also has a peacock perched on the stable roof, and falconry imagery, with hawks attacking cranes both in the air and on the ground. The figure in black and white, behind the Magi and holding a falcon, may be a portrait of Piero de' Medici. There were several other important images of the Magi made for the Medici, apart from these and those in the palace chapel. The 1492 inventory lists four paintings, three probably from the period of Cosimo. Later, Botticelli was to paint several Medici portraits in his 1475 painting in the Uffizi, commissioned by a close associate of the family.Sale, 6–9 A Botticelli Magi tondo in the National Gallery, London of around 1470–75 has a comparable screen of ruined antique buildings running behind the main figures (as well as a peacock). Cosimo's personal cell in San Marco has a fresco Magi scene by Fra Angelico.Sale, 6; NGA The Botticelli Magi tondo in London A number of aspects of the arrangement of the figures and the general composition are probably borrowed from a Magi scene of about 1370–71 by Jacopo di Cione that was then part of his large altarpiece at the nearby church (now destroyed) of San Pier Maggiore.Sale, 8 The altarpiece is now dispersed, but the majority of the panels, including the Magi scene, are in the National Gallery, London.Davies, 48, 45–54 More general meanings that were attached to objects in the painting include the pomegranate held by the Christ child, whose many seeds were regarded as symbolizing the souls in the care of the church. The flesh of the peacock was thought to resist decay, and so the bird symbolized eternity, and the Resurrection of Jesus.NGA The buildings to the rear A grand but \\"crumbling pagan building\\" is a very common feature of Renaissance Nativity scenes, often acting as the stable itself. This generally represents the passing of the era of the Mosaic law and contract, replaced at the birth of Christ by the new Christian covenant. But it also often includes an allusion to the legend that on the night of Christ's birth the \\"Temple of Peace\\" in the Roman Forum fell down, in fulfilment of a prophecy of Apollo that it would stand until a virgin gave birth. This was in the Golden Legend and other sources; it supposedly contained a statue of Romulus.Lillie In the 15th century the \\"Temple of Peace\\" was wrongly identified with the Basilica of Maxentius next door, in fact a building of 308–312 AD. About a third of this building survives today, with the three enormous barrel vaults of the north aisle the largest Roman structures surviving in the Forum. It also contained a colossal statue, that of Constantine, whose head, hand, foot, and other bits are now in the courtyard of the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Hill. Other Nativity paintings draw from the architecture of the ruins of the basilica, including the Botticelli tondo in London, and the Lippi seems to do so too.Lillie Architectural historians remark that the architecture of the basilica drew from the massive public bath complexes of Rome, and possibly some awareness of this similarity led Lippi to represent his nude figures on the ruins as bathers, who might be imagined coming out from a still-functional bathing part of the complex to see what all the noise was about.

The epithet, dissecta is in reference to the thallus repeatedly divided into branches.Spjut, R. W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14. Distinguishing Features Niebla dissecta is recognized by the thallus broader than tall—not more than 4 cm high, divided into many narrow partly subterete but mostly irregular 3-angled branches that arise from a common attachment area, blackened slightly around the base to a short distance above, the 3 longitudinal ridges spirally twisted 90° at frequent but irregular intervals, the primary branches often more compressed and broader where they divide more or less equally into secondary branches that ultimately divide again and spread as much as 180°.World Botanical Associates, Niebla dissecta, retrieved 20 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_dissecta.htm#dissecta Lichen substance are sekikaic acid, with accessory triterpenes, in contrast to divaricatic acid in Niebla testudinaria.

The type (biology) specimen of Niebla dissecta also appears to be a hybrid or intermediate form to Niebla disrupta. It has the relatively broad thallus, the 3-angled branches, the dilated branching node-like areas (plant stem), and the wide spreading terminal branches that characterizes the species, but unlike the Channel Island specimens, its longitudinal ridges are more sharply angled, and the subterminal apothecia have extended branches as seen in N. disrupta. As in most species of Niebla, there is a common set of morphological traits shared throughout the range of a species, while one or more of the individual character features may vary from one location to another; as a result the individual species have been referred to as shape shifters.Niebla and Vermilacinia of Baja California, web page, retrieved 20 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/lichens.htm The variation appears related to the associated species. Niebla dissecta is just one example that also includes a morphMorph: distinct variant of a species. similar to Niebla cornea(Photo 9.4 in Spjut 1996). The association of Niebla species at each geographical location might be viewed as the Niebla collective in that each appears to have a unique set of morphological and chemical features not seen at other locations, the exceptions being the isidiate species and those that appear to be recent colonizers or occur at the extreme range of the genus (see p. 20–24 in Spjut 1996). On San Nicolas Island, for example, are two distinct species of Niebla without intermediate morphological forms. Niebla ramosissima and Niebla dactylifera; both contain despsites, one has sekikaic acid, the other divaricatic acid. However, the morphological variation in Niebla is also viewed has highly “plastic.”Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. Niebla. ‘Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2’: 368–380. The 42 species recognized in the genus are treated as just three species. Two of the species,Niebla homalea and Niebla josecuervoi, are distinguished by chemistry, depsidones (Niebla josecuervoi) and depsides (Niebla homalea), which also includes the acid deficient Niebla homaleoides considered to be more related to species with depsidones;Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert: Book Review, Richard Spjut, web page, retrieved 20 Dec 2014; http://www.worldbotanical.com/lichen%20flora%20review.htm N. dissecta is included in the depside group. This view implies that there are no geographical patterns to the morphological variation; i.e. , the morphological variation is purely random due to genetic and environmental factors. But it is not random; the California Nieblas with sekikaic acid, which are more common in the Channel Islands than on the mainland, exhibit an evolutionary pattern in the Channel Islands from sparingly branched thalli with prismatic branch forms (Niebla siphonoloba), to uniformly dissected thalli (N. dissecta), to thalli more densely branched near apex (N. dactylifera).Niebla and Vermilacinia of Baja California, World Botanical Associates, web page, retrieved 20 Dec 2014; http://www.worldbotanical.com/lichens.htm Taxonomic History Niebla dissecta was recognized as a result of a taxonomic revision of the genus Niebla undertaken for producing a lichen flora of Baja California that began in 1986. A peer review of a manuscript in 1990-1991 led to further study of material in California. Of particular importance was the collection by Charis Bratt from the Channel Islands that are deposited at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. The type (biology) specimen was chosen from the specimens of Niebla at the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution);United States National Herbarium, http://botany.si.edu/colls/collections_overview.htm it was collected from the mainland in San Mateo County.

It was built from 1924 to 1939. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 April 2002.  History  Nazareth House, situated on Tingal Hill, Wynnum, was designed by Brisbane architectural firm, Hennessy, Hennessy, Keesing & Co and JP Donoghue and built by George Turner. Nazareth House was officially opened by Archbishop James Duhig in 1925 as part of the charitable institution established on the site by the Poor Sisters of Nazareth. A Catholic presence in Wynnum was prompted by the establishment of the area as a popular seaside resort. The opening of the Wynnum South railway station in 1898 encouraged further development, and the demand for a religious presence in the area grew. In 1903, the first Catholic masses were held in the Wynnum Shire Hall. The Congregation of the Poor Sisters of Nazareth was founded in London in 1854 by Mother St Basil (born Victoire Larmenier on 21 July 1827 at Liffré, near Rennes, France). The order was established to care for the aged poor at the request of Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, Archbishop of Westminster. The first foundation of the order to be established in Australia was at Ballarat in 1888. At the request of Archbishop Duhig, a Queensland chapter was founded in 1921. Archbishop Duhig had visited Nazareth House in London and subsequently petitioned the Mother-General to send a community of nuns to Queensland. Duhig then proceeded to search for a suitable site. In 1918, Duhig purchased Mt Margaret, a property of around at Tingal Hill, Wynnum, for the purposes of establishing an aged persons and children's home to be run by the Sisters of Nazareth. The property, which included a large villa, was purchased for from the trustees of the estate of the late William Kidston, Premier of Queensland from 1906-07. Kidston had entered into an agreement with Duhig prior to his death for the sale of his property for the purposes of establishing a home for the needy. Due to the difficulties of transport after World War I, it was not possible to secure passages for the sisters until 15 January 1921. On this date, six women, Sister Francis Borgia, Sister St David, Sister M Fulgentia, Sister M Maelisa, Sister Patricia Columba and Sister Joseph Comgall, from Hammersmith, London were joined at Melbourne by Sister Francis Clare (Mother Superior) and Sister Mary Margaret from Ballarat. On first arriving in Brisbane on 3 March 1921, the sisters stayed for three weeks at All Hallows Convent with the Sisters of Mercy. On 4 March, they got their first glimpse of their new home - a dwelling of nine small rooms on rising ground overlooking the sea with Wynnum two miles distant on one side and Brisbane twelve miles on the other. On Good Friday, 25 March 1921, the Sisters arrived to commence charity work at Wynnum. On 1 April, the first Mass was celebrated in the house by Archbishop Duhig, who also blessed the vestments and the house. The Reverend Dean Horan of Ipswich was the first resident. The sisters also took in and cared for seven elderly ladies. In 1922 the neighbouring property of Silversprings was purchased by Archbishop Duhig for . The house and other buildings from Mt Margaret were moved to the new property where they were joined to the existing house to provide accommodation for the Sisters and those in need of care. By Christmas of 1922, the new home had 35 residents. Within a couple of years more accommodation was urgently needed. With the help of their benefactors and supported by the Mother House in London, the task of building a new home was undertaken. Work began on the first section in 1924 with the firm Hennessy, Hennessy, Keesing & Co and JP Donoghue, engaged by Archbishop Duhig, designing the new building. The tender of builder George Turner was accepted for . The foundation stone of what is now the eastern wing of the present building was laid by Archbishop Duhig on 13 April 1924. The building was blessed on 15 August 1925 by Archbishop Duhig and officially opened by then Governor of Queensland, Sir Matthew Nathan, the following day. was subscribed towards the cost of the new building. In April 1926, the first children arrived from England to be cared for by the Sisters of Nazareth House. Local children were admitted in October the same year. The Sisters' objective was to care for orphaned or abandoned children. According to the Sisters of Nazareth House, children cared for at Wynnum during the succeeding forty years included both indigenous and non-indigenous children. Between 1889-1980 some 4000 children including orphans, wards of the State and migrant children were cared for by the Sisters of Nazareth in 8 homes across Australia and New Zealand. The Catholic Advocate in January 1930 described Nazareth House as a \\"stately and impressive brick building...terraced lawns leading up to the front entrance and a fine group of statutory in the drive outside...Wide cloistered balconies surround the new building...The entrance hall has richly coloured leadlight windows and in the sitting-room and dining- room on either side are pictures of Nazareth House, Hammersmith, London, where the Sisters had their training...The pretty chapel in the left wing opens into the Sisters\\" choir room...\\" The second stage of construction of the main building was commenced in January 1938 with the foundation stone laid by Archbishop Duhig on 20 March. The opening was held on 2 July 1939. Comprising a convent, chapel and laundry, this section was completed in April 1939 at a cost of £30,000. According to a contemporary article in the Catholic Leader, the extensions consisted of \\"one million bricks.\\" In 1963, a brick building was constructed in the grounds to provide modern amenities for male residents and a new kitchen block. Two thirds of the cost of the extension was contributed by the Commonwealth Government. At the time of its official opening by Archbishop Duhig, Nazareth House was providing accommodation for 85 \\"senior citizens\\" and 70 children. In 1982 Nazareth House ceased its function as a care facility for children with the move towards placing children in need with foster families. The need for a nursing home unit had long been required and it was decided that a new Nursing Home should be built on the area at the rear of the main building where the children's playground had been, and that the original building should be renovated to make single room accommodation, with ensuite facilities, for hostel residents. The new Nursing Home was blessed by the Most Reverend James Cuskelly, Auxiliary Bishop of Brisbane and opened by Senator, The Hon. Don Grimes, Minister for Social Security, on Sunday 17 June 1984. The new complex connected to the old building via covered passageways and provided four 4-bed wards, seven 2-bed wards and five single rooms. Work on renovation of the old building commenced in February 1985 and comprised the construction of 42 single rooms with ensuites. Nazareth House continues to operate as an aged care facility.  Description  Nazareth House is prominently located on an elevation along Wynnum North Road. The complex consists of a number of buildings including the original building (St Mary's), the Convent and Chapel and two more recent additions, St Joseph's Hostel (1960s) and the nursing home known as Larmeniere (1980s). Nazareth House has sweeping views across the north-east to Moreton Bay. St Mary's St Mary's is an H-shaped two storey brick building with basement and a terracotta tiled roof. Verandahs, some of which have been enclosed along the northern and eastern facades on both the ground and first floors, surround the building. A centrally located projecting entrance is situated along the northern facade of the building. The central section of the entrance rises above the roof line forming a parapet. A recess, in which sits a large rendered statue, is located in the upper section of the facade. The statue and recess are surrounded by rendered high relief moulding. Below the statue are the words \\"NAZARETH HOUSE\\". The parapet is surmounted by a rendered Celtic cross and rendered pedestal. Decorative relief work is located along the parapet and on the piers on either side of the central section. The first floor balcony, where it forms part of the projecting entrance, has a large, rounded arch with a moulded keystone. The ground floor verandah, similarly to the rest of the building, has decorative blue brickwork, including blue brick crosses centrally located along the entire facades. On the northern facade of St Mary's, the western and eastern end of the projecting wings have parapets surmounted by rendered Celtic crosses on a rendered pedestal. This facade as the same decorative blue brickwork and decorative relief work on the underside of the parapet. The western facade, the former rear entrance, is now the main entrance to the building. The gabled parapet has a row of dentils on the underside and a group of five windows, four are narrow and rectangular in shape and the central window is larger with a round arch opening with moulded decorative detail. The parapet is surmounted by a rendered pedestal and Celtic cross. The verandahs on the ground and first floors have been enclosed and the original doorway has been widened and replaced with automatic doors. A number of other paired timber doors are located along the verandahs on both the ground and first floors. The doors are panelled and have glass breezeway and fanlight assemblies. The foundation stone is located near the front entrance along the northern facade of the building. Internally, the ground and first floors of St Mary's are similar in plan. The entrance is made up of an elaborate set of paired timber, panelled doors with large fanlight and breezeway assemblies which contain coloured glass and leadlighting. The front entrance of St Mary's, along the northern facade opens to an entry foyer with a pressed metal ceiling and timber panelled doorway and architraves. Rooms open on either side of the entrance foyer. A corridor runs east–west through the building. A turning, timber staircase with an ornate timber newel and timber rails is located off the corridor on the southern side of the central wing of the building. Rooms for the residents are located on both floors. Rooms containing offices open off the corridor. Pressed metal ceilings remain in many of the rooms including the dining room located in the south-western wing and the hall in the north-western wing. A staircase at the eastern end of the building has been isolated to form a fire stair. Convent and Chapel The convent is a U-shaped two-storey brick building with a basement level. The building has a broken-back roof clad with terracotta tiles. The building has a centrally located projecting entrance with a gabled roof, along the northern elevation. The central section of the entrance rises above the roof line forming a parapet. The parapet is surmounted by a rendered Celtic cross. Decorative relief work is located along the parapet and on the piers on either side of the central section. Paired round arched openings are located in the upper section of the facade. The openings are surrounded by decorative blue brickwork. The convent has verandahs to the ground and first floors and, similarly to the projecting entrance, the orange brickwork is surrounded by decorative blue brickwork. Along the ground level verandah has rounded arches and the first floor verandah squared arches. Double hung sash windows, some of which have been screened, are located along the entire facades of the convent. Internally, the entrance foyer has a pressed metal ceiling and parquetry floor. Large double, timber, panelled doors with coloured glass and leadlighting with breezeway assembly, open to the central corridor. The hallway is rendered with decorative moulded detail along the wall. The Sister's rooms are simple in plan and decorative detail. The rooms have timber doors and architraves with breezeway assembly, painted walls and austere ceilings. Some are slightly larger than others. Hallways leading to bathroom facilities, along with the bathrooms, have terrazzo floors. The modern kitchen is located on the ground floor. The chapel is built of brick with a gabled roof at the northern end and a clad with terracotta tiles. The entrance to the chapel is located in the southern facade. Also located in this facade is the chapel's foundation stone. The gabled parapet has decorative relief work the underside and a group of three round arched windows, A smaller, narrow, rectangular window with louvres is located above these. The parapet is surmounted by a rendered Celtic cross. The chapel is fitted with copper gutters and downpipes. Internally, the chapel is rendered with a marble altar at the northern end of the building. A number of stained glass windows, as well as timber pews, are located in the chapel. A window opens in the upper section of the west wall of the chapel, this same window forms part of the convent wall. From this window, Sisters within the convent are able to have a view of the altar. A rendered statue on a concrete pedestal, depicting the Holy Family, the gift of Thomas Mahon and a grotto are located in front of the northern elevation of St Mary's. The entrance gates are brick with a metal archway. The archway contains the words \\"NAZARETH HOUSE\\" spelt out with original metal lettering. The later buildings, St Josephs and Nursing Hostel, are single storey brick buildings and are located to the south of St Mary's and the convent and chapel. Covered walkways join St Mary's with both buildings. Other buildings which form part of the complex include plant rooms, a laundry and a change room.

Early life  Khalsa was born on 12 December 1965, in Kurukshetra, Haryana to father Ajit Singh and mother Mohinder Kaur. He took primary and Sikh religious education from the Gurdwara Lakhnaur Sahib and was also baptized there. In 1987, he married Jasbir Kaur and had a son. Campaign In November 2013, Khalsa went on a 44-day hunger strike. The campaign was ended after Giani Gurbachan Singh (Akal Thakat Jathedar), said to take up the issue with the State Government. After none of the detained Sikhs was released, Bhai Gurbaksh Singh Khalsa restarted his hunger strike, one year after his 2013 hunger strike. Over the course of the campaign, he got support from various other Sikh bodies. A number of Punjabi singers, actors and other artist visited him and pledged their support for his campaign. His second campaign started on 14 November 2014 at Lakhnaur Gurdwara, Harayana. On 8 January Khalsa, who had entered day 56, had proposed to visit Akal Takht - the highest temporal seat of Sikhs, however, a police blockade just a short distance from the Gurdwara prevented him fulfilling his wishes.

It is a block-shaped building erected to serve as a data center during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Since then it has served as both a museum devoted to the use of computing in the Olympics, and exhibition space for digital technology companies. It was the only major facility on Olympic Green not to be an event venue for the games, and the only major Olympic facility designed by a Chinese architect. That architect, Pei Zhu, was interested in the connections between traditional Chinese design and digital technology. He produced a sustainable building that resembles a circuit board when viewed from either side and a bar code when viewed from either end, in the process using some new materials for the first time in China. It has been both praised for its avoidance of kitsch and criticized as resembling Orwell's Ministry of Truth. At the 2008 World Architecture Festival it was shortlisted in its category. Building Digital Beijing is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of Beichen West, Anxiang North and Huizhong roads in the Olympic Green neighborhood of Beijing's Chaoyang District, a generally level area north of the Forbidden City on the city's central axis. Guihua Third Street is to the north, and Tianchen West Road is to the west. To the southeast is the Beijing National Aquatics Center, colloquially known as the Watercube, the venue for swimming and diving at the Olympics and now an indoor water park; the distinctive Beijing National Stadium, or Birds' Nest, is to the east of the Aquatics Center. East of the building is the Beijing National Indoor Stadium, where gymnastics and several other events were held. Another important Olympic venue, the China National Convention Center, takes up several blocks to the northeast. Directly to the south are several blocks of lightly planted open space buffering the Aquatics Center from Beichen West. On the north a parking lot separates Digital Beijing from National Stadium Road and the InterContinental Beichen Beijing Hotel high-rise on the other side. The buildings of Science Park Nanli are across Beichen to the west, and the Pangu Seven-Star Hotel on the southwest corner of the intersection anchors the buildings of Pangu Plaza, which continue to the south along the west side of Beichen West. Water surrounds the building's on all sides but the east. It consists of four large narrow slabs 11 stories () high but of varying thickness, with the easternmost thickest of all, with gaps between them, with the gap between the eastern slab and the others being wider. All are connected by pedestrian bridges at various heights; those nearer each other have larger bridges, with the two on the west having a two-story glass hyphen. They are faced in a dark stone quarried in northern China, with some inserts of aluminum made to look like stone. Although there is a smooth glass curtain wall (made of a low-energy glass with low thermal conductivity, to save energy with many windows on the east elevation and the interior facades overlooking the gaps, there are no windows on the west face. Instead, it is decorated with irregularly spaced vertical grooves of differing width and that take diagonal turns at different points along their descent and then straighten out again shortly afterwards. At night a series of green LEDs blink in a descending fashion down the east facade. The flat roof has a rainwater collection system. Inside the rooms and hallways are floored in a translucent fiber- reinforced plastic (FRP). Images can be, and are, projected on the undersides of interior pedestrian bridges. There is 98,000 m (1.05 million sq ft) of space, including two underground levels. Lighting is provided by an LED system that uses 60% less energy than other forms. History Once Beijing was awarded the 2008 Summer Olympics in 2001, planning began for the Games, and the Olympic Green area in the city's Chaoyang District that would host the Olympic Village and many major event venues. One theme of the Olympics was to be the \\"Digital Olympics\\", using more new information technology than had ever before been used in the Olympics. Early in 2002, the city's Municipal Informatization Office called for a \\"landmark building\\" to use as the main data center during the Games and for other, related purposes afterwards. A contest was held, and the design by Pei Zhu, then with the Chinese firm Urbanus but in the process of setting up his own Pei Zhu Studio, was chosen from among eight competitors in 2004. It was the only major facility among the 31 new buildings to have been designed by a Chinese architect. It was also the only Olympic Green building that was not an Olympic event venue. \\"If the industrial revolution resulted in modernism, contemporary architecture needs to explore what will form out of the current revolution of information,\\" Zhu wrote later. \\"Conceptually, Digital Beijing was developed through reconsideration and reflection on the role of Chinese architecture in the modern information era. [It] helps to develop a new aesthetic, an architectural language that is thoroughly contemporary, but retains a Chinese texture and sensibility.\\" alt=A view of the building from a different angle, with the gaps between the slabs visible To that end, the building he designed echoes the tools it was designed to house. From the ends it resembles a bar code, rising from the water. Zhu explains: The east and west facades offer a contrast between the windowless western side, continuing to emphasize the building's contents and purpose by being decorated to resemble a circuit board, and the open, glassy easy. This contrast of extremes, according to Zhu, is what the building draws from Chinese culture, specifically the hutong, the narrow mazes of alleyways where much of Beijing's traditional street life and community took place. \\"On the exterior transparency is very rare, where internally the true interaction between nature, open space and building is most evident.\\" He concludes \\"Through the perspective of Chinese philosophy, everything including the advancement of technology has an intimate connection with the natural realm. Aesthetically this perspective continues a dialogue between the past and the future.\\" Construction began in 2005. During that time Zhu and the builders were to take advantage of two newly developed materials. The first, a translucent fiber reinforced plastic, had first been developed for a hotel Zhu was building elsewhere in Beijing as a substitute for jade, which proved too expensive to use in the quantity he had wanted it. Since it held images projected in it well, he also decided to use it for the flooring inside Digital Beijing, where it could become a \\"digital carpet\\", similar to the \\"urban carpet\\" Zaha Hadid created for the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was also strong enough to support the interior footbridges, so Zhu used it there too. On the exterior, a local maker of beverage cans developed the aluminum sheets for the building's facades that gleam in places yet still look like stone from far away. The building was completed and opened on 3 November 2007.Tencent, \\"2007 年11月3 日，由中国建筑师朱锫设计的北京奥运控制中心“数字北京”，作为北京奥林匹克公园中心区第一个竣工验收并投入使用的项目，正式竣工投入使用。\\" It served as the main data center during the Summer Games the following year, as intended (a backup was built in an undisclosed location). Since then it has served, also as planned, as a museum of the Digital Olympics and exhibition space, both concentrated in the public area of the building on the east, where the interior is visible. \\"Digital Beijing accepts this transformation with a capacity for constant renovation, sprinting along side the pace of our time,\\" Zhu wrote. Reception The first public reaction from an architecture critic was positive. \\"If China has set out to impress the world with the 2008 Olympics,\\" The Guardian's Jonathan Glancey wrote in February 2008, several months before the Games and two months after the building's completion, \\"the stadium and its attendant buildings—the Aquatics Centre and Digital Beijing (the Olympics 'command post')—have set a heady precedent.\\" He contrasted them with the tepid reaction to building designs already unveiled for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Glancey likened the four upright slabs to \\"upright 1960s IBM computers\\" and praised Zhu's \\"creative use of unexpected materials\\". Unlike most other prominent contemporary Chinese architects, Zhu had, the critic noted, enjoyed the luxury of time in his work. \\"The result is delightful.\\" However, a few months later, Tom Dyckhoff of The Times was not so impressed. He was the first Western journalist allowed to tour Olympic Green, most of which was still under construction and surrounded with a steel fence under military guard to block it from public view. While he had unmitigated praise for the Birds' Nest, he considered the rest of the buildings \\"a flop\\". He described Digital Beijing as \\"chees[y] ... Four gloomy stone slabs, divided by glass atria, do an excellent Orwellian Ministry of Truth impression.\\" He did allow that it was \\"slightly less spirit-crushing inside\\". Dyckhoff's was the only prominent negative reaction. Two months after the Olympics, at that year's World Architecture Festival, Digital Beijing was shortlisted in its category. The next year, former New York Times critic Paul Goldberger wrote in his book Building Up and Tearing Down: Reflection on the Age of Architecture that while, like the adjacent Water Cube, Digital Beijing \\"steers dangerously close to a kitschy conceit\\", it, too, succeeds. \\"The finished building has a dignity that is surprising ... an austerity that is the opposite of kitsch.\\" In 2011 Harvard professor Peter G. Rowe wrote at length about Digital Beijing in Emergent Architectural Territories in East Asian Cities. \\"Although hardly the fault of architecture under such a presumption,\\", he wrote of Zhu's stated aesthetic intentions for the building, \\"this sort of symbol may seem somewhat at odds with the dispersed and uniquitous character of today's digital media.\\" Nevertheless, he continued, that may have been part of the building's point.

The civil war's aftermath and proliferation of armed groups led to violence and instability across the country, which erupted into renewed civil war in 2014. The ongoing crisis in Libya has so far resulted in tens of thousands of casualties since the onset of violence in early 2011. During both civil wars, the output of Libya's economically crucial oil industry collapsed to a small fraction of its usual level, with most facilities blockaded or damaged by rival groups, despite having the largest oil reserves of any African country. U.S. President Barack Obama stated on 11 April 2016 that not preparing for a post-Gaddafi Libya was probably the \\"worst mistake\\" of his presidency. Libyan oil production collapsed during the two civil wars. Background The history of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi spanned 42 years from 1969 to 2011. Gaddafi became the de facto leader of the country on 1 September 1969 after leading a group of young Libyan military officers against King Idris I in a nonviolent revolution and bloodless coup d'état. After the king had fled the country, the Libyan Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) headed by Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and the old constitution and proclaimed the new Libyan Arab Republic, with the motto \\"freedom, socialism, and unity\\". After coming to power, the RCC government took control of all petroleum companies operating in the country and initiated a process of directing funds toward providing education, health care and housing for all. Despite the reforms not being entirely effective, public education in the country became free and primary education compulsory for both sexes. Medical care became available to the public at no cost, but providing housing for all was a task that the government was not able to complete. Under Gaddafi, per capita income in the country rose to more than US$11,000, the fifth-highest in Africa. The increase in prosperity was accompanied by a controversial foreign policy and increased political repression at home. Events First civil war In early 2011, a civil war broke out in the context of the wider \\"Arab Spring\\". The anti-Gaddafi forces formed a committee named the National Transitional Council, on 27 February 2011. It was meant to act as an interim authority in the rebel-controlled areas. After the government began to roll back the rebels and a number of atrocities were committed by both sides, a multinational coalition led by NATO forces intervened on 21 March 2011, ostensibly to protect civilians against attacks by the government's forces. Shortly thereafter, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against Gaddafi and his entourage on 27 June 2011. Gaddafi was ousted from power in the wake of the fall of Tripoli to the rebel forces on 20 August 2011, although pockets of resistance held by forces loyal to Gaddafi's government held out for another two months, especially in Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte, which he declared the new capital of Libya on 1 September 2011. His Jamahiriya regime came to an end the following month, culminating on 20 October 2011 with Sirte's capture, NATO airstrikes against Gaddafi's escape convoy, and his killing by rebel fighters. Post-revolution armed groups and violence The Libyan revolution led to defected regime military members who joined rebel forces, revolutionary brigades that defected from the Libyan Army, post-revolutionary brigades, militias, and various other armed groups, many composed of ordinary workers and students. Some of the armed groups formed during the war against the regime and others evolved later for security purposes. Some were based on tribal allegiances. The groups formed in different parts of the country and varied considerably in size, capability, and influence. They were not united as one body, but they were not necessarily at odds with one another. Revolutionary brigades accounted for the majority of skilled and experienced fighters and weapons. Some militias evolved from criminal networks to violent extremist gangs, quite different from the brigades seeking to provide protection. After the first Libyan civil war, violence occurred involving various armed groups who fought against Gaddafi but refused to lay down their arms when the war ended in October 2011. Some brigades and militias shifted from merely delaying the surrender of their weapons to actively asserting a continuing political role as \\"guardians of the revolution\\", with hundreds of local armed groups filling the complex security vacuum left by the fall of Gaddafi. Before the official end of hostilities between loyalist and opposition forces, there were reports of sporadic clashes between rival militias and vigilante revenge killings. In dealing with the number of unregulated armed groups, the National Transitional Council called for all armed groups to register and unite under the Ministry of Defense, thus placing many armed groups on the payroll of the government. This gave a degree of legitimacy to many armed groups, including General Khalifa Haftar who registered his armed group as the \\"Libyan National Army\\", the same name he used for his anti-Gaddafi forces after the 1980s Chadian–Libyan conflict. On 11 September 2012, militants allied with Al-Qaeda attacked the US consulate in Benghazi, killing the US ambassador and three others. This prompted a popular outcry against the semi-legal militias that were still operating, and resulted in the storming of several Islamist militia bases by protesters. A large-scale government crackdown followed on non-sanctioned militias, with the Libyan Army raiding several now-illegal militias' headquarters and ordering them to disband. The violence eventually escalated into the second Libyan civil war. Second civil war The second Libyan civil war is an ongoing conflict among rival groups seeking control of the territory of Libya. The conflict has been mostly between the government of the House of Representatives, also known as the \\"Tobruk government\\", which was assigned as a result of a very low- turnout elections in 2014 and was internationally recognized as the \\"Libyan Government\\" until the establishment of GNA; and the rival Islamist government of the General National Congress (GNC), also called the \\"National Salvation Government\\", based in the capital Tripoli. In December 2015, these two factions agreed in principle to unite as the Government of National Accord. Although the Government of National Accord is now functioning and is backed by the UN, its authority is still unclear as specific details acceptable to both sides have not yet been agreed upon. The Tobruk government, strongest in eastern Libya, has the loyalty of Haftar's Libyan National Army and has been supported by air strikes by Egypt and the UAE. The Islamist government of the GNC, strongest in western Libya, rejected the results of the 2014 election, and is led by the Muslim Brotherhood, backed by the wider Islamist coalition known as \\"Libya Dawn\\" and other militias, and aided by Qatar, Sudan, and Turkey. In addition to these, there are also smaller rival groups: the Islamist Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, led by Ansar al-Sharia (Libya), which has had the support of the GNC; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's (ISIL's) Libyan provinces; \\"One is the internationally recognized government based in the eastern city of Tobruk and its military wing, Operation Dignity, led by General Khalifa Haftar. The other is the Tripoli government installed by the Libya Dawn coalition, which combines Islamist militias with armed groups from the city of Misrata. The Islamic State has recently established itself as a third force\\" as well as Tuareg militias of Ghat, controlling desert areas in the southwest; and local forces in Misrata District, controlling the towns of Bani Walid and Tawergha. The belligerents are coalitions of armed groups that sometimes change sides. Since 2015, there have been many political developments. The United Nations brokered a cease- fire in December 2015, and on 31 March 2016 the leaders of a new UN-supported \\"unity government\\" arrived in Tripoli. On 5 April, the Islamist government in western Libya announced that it was suspending operations and handing power to the new unity government, officially named the \\"Government of National Accord\\", although it was not yet clear whether the new arrangement would succeed. On 2 July, rival leaders reached an agreement to reunify the eastern and western managements of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC). As of 22 August, the unity government still had not received the approval of Haftar's supporters in the Tobruk government, and on 11 September the general boosted his political leverage by seizing control of two key oil terminals. Haftar and the NOC then reached an agreement for increasing oil production and exports, and all nine of Libya's major oil terminals were operating again in January 2017. In December 2017, the Libyan National Army seized Benghazi after three years of fighting. In February 2019, the LNA achieved victory in the Battle of Derna. The LNA then launched a major offensive in April 2019 in an attempt to seize Tripoli. On 5 June 2020, the GNA captured all of western Libya, including the capital Tripoli. The next day the GNA launched an offensive to capture Sirte. However, they proved unable to advance.Libya: Haftar's forces 'slow down' GNA advance on Sirte. Published 11 June 2020. On 21 August, the GNA and the LNA both agreed to a ceasefire. Khalifa Haftar, Field Marshal of the LNA, rejected the ceasefire and LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari dismissed the GNA's ceasefire announcement as a ploy. On 23 August, street protests took place in Tripoli, where hundreds protested against the GNA for living conditions and corruption within the government.

It was designed by engineer Eneas Fraser Gilchrist and built in 1933 by relief workers. It is also known as The Great Wall of Manly. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 October 1998.  History  The Manly Retaining Wall is located at the corner of Falcon (formerly known as Spring) and Wellington Streets, forming a cutting in the centre of each road. It was constructed in 1933 and comprises irregularly shaped stones which were quarried at Lytton, bedded in concrete. Manly Beach Estate map, 1887 The first European settlement of the Wynnum-Manly area of Moreton Bay occurred in the 1860s when two sugar mills, Lota and Wyvernleigh were established. The area soon became popular with holiday makers, and holiday homes were constructed along the bay. In 1882 land sales of the Manly Beach Estate (named after the coastal Sydney suburb of Manly) were held, giving the area its present name. The completion of the railway in 1889 provided further impetus for the development of the area as a seaside resort, although the area maintained its connections with the fishing industry. By the late 1920s, access to the area was possible by rail, bus or road, further increasing its popularity as a resort and also as a permanent place of residence for Brisbane businessmen and their families. Street layouts in the area of the retaining wall form a meandering pattern due to the original estate surveys and also the irregular topography. In some places, the slope to the bay was so steep that the road was divided in two to allow access to houses located on either side of the road. Falcon Street is an example of this. It was originally divided by an embankment which was so high and wide that it restricted access for two way traffic. A retaining wall to replace the embankment was much needed; however the cost of construction would have been more than the surrounding properties were worth. The initiative of the Brisbane City Council District Engineer for Wynnum in applying for relief labour made the wall a financial possibility. The Unemployment Relief Scheme was introduced by the Queensland Government in 1932 as a means of providing work projects for the unemployed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Brisbane City Council took advantage of this scheme to construct the retaining wall, providing tools and materials whilst the Queensland Government provided the labour. Other structures in the area, including similar retaining walls and the Wynnum Wading Pool Reserve were also constructed under the relief scheme. The wall was an ambitious project. It is approximately long and meets foundation pressures ranging from per square foot to per square foot. Because of the clay formation of the soil, the foundations of the wall were critical. A plan for the wall was produced by the City Engineer's office in February 1933, and is signed by the Designing Engineer and the City Engineer, Eneas Fraser Gilchrist. On site calculations are said to have been made \\"with the aid of a piece of 4 x 4 placed on end in the clay and loaded with concrete blocks\\". Due to the labour being supplied by the relief scheme, a variety of workers were employed on the project, including an unknown artists who formed figures within the concrete plaster pointing. These figures include kangaroos, emus, boomerangs and human heads, one of which is apparently a likeness of the District Engineer in charge of works. The wall is a locally well-known feature of the area and is included in the Brisbane City Council's heritage walk booklet under the local name of \\"the Great Wall of Manly\\".  Description  Central corner, 2015 Plantings at the base of the wall, 2015 The Manly Retaining Wall is located at the corner of Wellington and Falcon Streets and divides both streets down the centre, forming two levels of access. At the intersection of the two streets the wall is approximately high. It extends approximately along both streets, tapering towards the ends to follow the incline of each street. Concrete steps are located at the end of the wall on Wellington Street, providing access to the upper level. The wall sits on a concrete base, high and is constructed of basalt blue metal stone which was quarried at nearby Lytton. The wall has a backing of of dry stone packing behind the rear face (embedded in the cutting) which steps from at the widest part of the base to at the top. The front face is straight and is capped with a cement coping, wide. The individual stones are irregular in form and size and are laid in a random pattern. Each block is bedded in concrete and the joints are heavily pointed with cement plaster. In various places, the plaster has been formed into shapes depicting Australian native animals, including kangaroos, emus, goannas, and also human heads and boomerangs.  Heritage listing  Manly Retaining Wall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 October 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Manly Retaining Wall is demonstrative of a government scheme which was implemented to assist the unemployed throughout Queensland. It was constructed in 1933 under the Unemployment Relief Scheme which was implemented in the previous year as a means of generating work projects for the unemployed during the Depression of the 1930s. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Due to its size, the Manly Retaining Wall is a prominent landmark in the area. The random pattern of the stonework and the substantial concrete pointing which includes animal figures such as a kangaroo, emu and goanna also contributes to the aesthetic significance of the place. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Manly Retaining Wall demonstrates technical achievement and is a notable engineering accomplishment incorporating high quality of workmanship. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Known locally as \\"The Great Wall of Manly\\", and included in the Brisbane City Council's Heritage Trail for Wynnum-Manly, the place has strong associations with the local community.

Lohja located in section 38, between Kopliku, Reçi, Rjolli. Lohja was a historical Albanian tribe located in a small area of the same name in Malësia, northern Albania.  Geography Lohja is a small region situated in the Malësia e Madhe District, near Dedaj, about 12 km north of Koplik. It borders on the historical regions of Kastrati to the west and north, and on Reç and Rjolli to the south. It includes the settlements of Lohë e Sipërme (Upper Lohja) and Lohë e Poshtme. Many families from Lohja over the centuries have moved to the central settlement of Koplik, where they form part of the local population.\\"Koplik, a brief historical view \\". Municipality of Koplik (in Albanian) After 1990, Lohja saw heavy emigration and depopulation. Less than 500 people live today in upper and lower Lohja.  History  Lohja first appears in historical record in the form of Loho who is mentioned in 1348. In the cadaster of Shkodra (Scutari) in 1416-7 Lohja (Logoa) appears as a village of eight households. The surnames of its inhabitants are all different, an indication that the village was not a settlement based on kinship ties in contrast to other settlements of Albanian tribes that appear in the cadaster. The cadaster also reveals that part of lower Lohja was identified as part of Rrjolli at that time but was part of Lohja administratively. One of the three households in that area was headed by a Jon Gruda. Oral tradition in lower Lohja has maintained that it traces its origin partly to the Old Gruda tribe. As an anthroponym, it doesn't appear in Lohja, but in one of the bigger settlements around Shkodra, in Grizhë, where Andrea Lochoy is found. After the 1479, most of northern Albania fell under Ottoman control. In the first Ottoman defter in 1485, Lohja appears as a village of 40 households. Among the first local timar holders of Shkodra after 1479 an Ali Aga Loha-zade is mentioned. He descended from Lohja, but can't be identified with a specific historical figure who converted to Islam. Lohja itself in 1582 had 31 households and 21 unmarried inhabitants, all Catholic except for one household. The late 16th century also saw the formation of 3/4 major brotherhoods of upper Lohja today. The first brotherhood, the Vukcaj were locals of Upper Lohja. The other three: Ivaj, Kocaj and Ulgjokaj trace their origin from the three brothers Koc, Ul and Iv Gjoka possibly from Koja. Giuseppe Valentini proposed an alternative origin from the Drekali brotherhood of Kuči (about 6 km north of Koja), which itself came from Berisha. Their sister was married into a brotherhood of lower Lohja. Some of the families of lower Lohja come from different neighbouring areas. These include Shllaku, Shala, the Pulati region and Gruda. The Lohja tribe had a population of some 2,500 in the last years of the 19th century.

History  With sharply increased settlement in Montana Territory at the end of the American Civil War, incidents with Native Americans on Montana's Benton Road and the Bozeman Trail increased dramatically. On May 4, 1867, G. S. Townsend of the U.S. War Department wrote to the acting Territorial Governor of Montana Thomas Francis Meagher on behalf of the U. S. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton concerning raising a Montana Territorial Militia: By the end of April 1867, a Volunteer Militia of 80 men had already been organized, and by the end of May, that number had grown to 150, consisting mostly of mounted horsemen. Acting Governor Thomas Francis Meagher commissioned Thomas Thoroughman, an ex-Confederate Lieutenant Colonel, a Brigadier General to command the Montana Militia in spring of 1867, and commissioned Walter W. De Lacy Colonel. In May 1867, the Montana Volunteer Militia under Thoroughman and De Lacy built Fort Elizabeth Meagher at the mouth of Rocky Creek in Gallatin County, Montana to provide settlers protection from \\"hostile\\" Sioux and Crow Indians. By the end of July 1867, the Volunteer Militia force numbered 513 men present for duty, consisting of 32 officers and 481 enlisted men. Desertions were common, and in the summer a detachment of about one hundred men stationed on the Upper Yellowstone River deserted at once. On July 1, 1867, Acting Governor Meagher drowned in the Missouri River at Fort Benton, Montana while receiving a shipment of ammunition for the Montana Militia. Governor Green Clay Smith then demoted Thomas Thoroughman to Colonel, giving him principal responsibility in the Gallatin Valley. At the end of July, Smith issued a proclamation \\"calling for the service of 800 men for six months from the 1st of August, and inviting the old force to reenlist.\\" The arrival of United States Army regiments in Montana Territory from 1866 to 1867, including companies from the 2nd Cavalry, 7th Infantry, First Battalion, 13th Infantry and Second Battalion, 18th Infantry (redesignated the 27th Infantry), relieved the need for a Territorial Militia, and after fighting no battles, the Montana Territory Volunteer Militia was disbanded by January 1868.

Purdy was described by one cultural critic as one of the major \\"legitimate\\" photographers in the United States, \\"The famous Boston photographic artist, who has undoubtedly taken more portraits of really distinguished statesmen, authors, educators, artists, clergymen, diplomats, journalists and persons eminent in various professions than any photographer in New England.\\" Purdy's son, Stanley Blanchard Purdy (d. 1966) joined the business in 1908 and eventually took over the studio after his father's death in 1933.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2000.  History  Michael Brennan Gannon The residence, 150 Kingsley Terrace, Manly was constructed for Michael Gannon and his wife Amy. Estate map for Manly Beach, includes Kingsley Terrace, 1887 The first European settlement of the Wynnum- Manly area of Moreton Bay occurred in the 1860s when two sugar mills, Lota and Wyvernleigh were established. The area soon became popular with holiday makers, and holiday homes were constructed along the bay. In 1882 land sales of the Manly Beach Estate (named after the coastal Sydney suburb of Manly) were held, giving the area its present name. The completion of the railway in 1889 provided further impetus for the development of the area as a seaside resort especially as Wynnum and Manly were the only bayside stations opened with the Cleveland railway line on 1 November 1889. In February 1888, Michael Brennan Gannon, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Toombul, Government Auctioneer and valuator (owner of Arthur Martin & Co), purchased a large portion of land in the Wynnum-Manly area formerly part of Portion 57. Gannon sold off a considerable acreage of land, but retained ownership of that portion on which the residence was to be constructed. It is likely that the house was constructed as, on 30 April of that year, a Bill of Mortgage was registered from Michael Brennan Gannon to the Royal Bank of Queensland. The release for the mortgage was signed in September 1889. The house became the family's holiday home. The Gannon's permanent residence was at \\"Waratah\\", Toorak Road, Breakfast Creek. Gannon's private residence (1885) as well as a villa at Hawthorne (1887–88) were designed by architects John Hall and Son. While the architect of the residence at Manly is not known, given Gannon's prior history with the firm, it is possible that John Hall and Son were the architects for the residence at Manly. Besides his political endeavours, Gannon was actively involved in Brisbane's social and sporting society. In 1888, Gannon was Vice-President of the Albert Cricket Club, Queensland Governor Anthony Musgrave was President; he was involved with the Queensland Rifle Association; the Brisbane Bicycling Club; the Breakfast Creek Rowing Club; a Director of the Federal Building, Land Investors Society Pty Ltd and Deposit Bank and a Justice of the Peace. During the early 1890s Gannon's speculative ventures began to fail. The Land Bank of Queensland was in possession of the land by the early 1890s and sold off smaller allotments from the block. Gannon was eventually declared bankrupt in 1895 with liabilities in excess of . He died in April 1898, aged 48 years. At the time of his death, his widow's place of residence was listed as \\"Manly\\". Later owners continued to use the house as a seaside home. Over the years various portions of the remainder of the estate were sold. In 1927 Thomas and Elizabeth Goodman purchased the property and, for the first time, the house was used as a principal place of residence. The Goodmans remained there until the death of Elizabeth in 1953. The property was vacant until 1955 when the public trustee sold it to an investor who had the house converted into three flats. The house remained as flats until June 1999 when the property was purchased by the current owners. The residence has been identified as a character building in the Wynnum-Manly Local Area Plan.  Description  Front entrance, 2015 The residence located at 150 Kingsley Terrace is sited on three parcels of land that fall gently from the western street frontage toward the rear eastern boundary of the site. The residence is sited close to the street frontage of the property meaning the backyard is quite expansive. Vegetation to the site is quite minimal with only a few mature plantings contained to the boundaries of the site. The residence itself is a two-storey structure of timber construction, elevated well above the ground on a combination of timber and concrete stumps, as well as sections of concrete block wall under the front western verandah. The house is clad with a combination of timber chamferboards to exposed external walls and VJ linings to external walls sheltered by verandahs. A central hip roof covers the core of the house as well as extending over the verandahs to the north, south and west. A separate skillion and hip roof cover the rear verandah and associated rear structure assumed to have once been the kitchen. All roof planes are sheeted with corrugated iron. Enclosed verandahs surround the central core of the house. These enclosures are externally clad with asbestos cement sheeting and include a combination of louvred and awning sash windows. Recent renovation work has revealed that much of the original verandah structure remains intact, simply covered by more recent alterations and additions. Entry to the house is via a central timber stair which leads to the verandah and original front door of the house which is surrounded by patterned coloured glass. Internally a central hall extends from the entry to the rear verandah. This hall is divided centrally by a doorway, creating a formal entry portion and informal rear. Flanking the entry hall is a main bedroom to the north and a formal dining room to the south. These rooms include central bay windows with floor to ceiling double hung windows. In the hallway and the dining room the ceilings are pressed metal reinforcing the formal nature of these entry spaces. Flanking the rear section of the hallway is the billiard room to the south and a store room and bedroom to the north. All rooms, have with the exception of the store room, open onto the verandahs through French doors. The enclosed rear verandah of the house is now used as the main living area. A kitchen is located at the northern end of this verandah and a bathroom at the southern end. The structure adjoining the southern end of the verandah is thought to have once been the kitchen of the house but is now used as a bedroom. Evidence exists within this room and at the ground level to indicate that a fireplace may have once serviced these spaces. More recent additions to the rear of the house include a laundry and deck adjoining the original kitchen and rear verandah. Internally the original pine floors still exist within the core of the house while hardwood flooring lines the verandahs. The walls and ceilings are generally clad with timber tongue and groove boards and the timber joinery to the doors and windows and associated architraves is still intact. Much of the glass within the widows is original as is the door and window hardware, including turned wooden door handles. Other original elements that survive within the house are a claw foot bath and gas lighting pipes within the ceiling cavity. The area under the house is generally enclosed with a combination of timber battens, asbestos cement sheeting and concrete block work. This area serves as a garage and storage area and includes the enclosure to the original earth closet.  Heritage listing  The Michael Gannon residence (c1888) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed , the residence is significant in demonstrating the continued growth of the Wynnum/Manly area in the latter part of the 19th century. It is particularly significant for its association with the growth of Manly as a popular seaside resort following the extension of the railway line to the area in 1889. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Substantial seaside houses still remaining on large areas of land are now uncommon, contributing to the significance of the place. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. As a substantial, two-storeyed timber building with wide verandahs, incorporating decorative timber balustrading and brackets, set on a large block of land with views towards Moreton Bay, the residence is significant as a good example of a late 19th century seaside house. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Constructed for Michael Brennan Gannon, Member of the Legislative Assembly for Toombul and Government Auctioneer and Valuator, the residence is significant for its association with this prominent Brisbane identity.

As a young man he intended to choose the profession of a naval officer in the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Because of a foot injury his application was rejected. In 1888 he opted for studying painting at the Berlin Academy, where he concentrated mainly on marine painting from the start. His teachers were Hans Gude and Hermann Eschke. Kircher made numerous study trips throughout Europa, Asia, North America and Egypt. During these travels, he made several important paintings, drawings and illustrations. In 1893 he worked on the picturesque decoration of buildings at the World Exhibition in Chicago as well as panoramas and dioramas of the marine painter :de:Hans von Petersen. In addition, Kircher worked as an illustrator for popular German and foreign magazines and publishers of which only a few can be mentioned: The Leipziger Illustrierte Zeitung or the modern illustrated weekly Reclams universe (Leipzig), the writings of the Austrian (Vienna) and the German fleet association (Berlin) and the Viennese publisher Philipp & Kramer, for which he designed the postcard series \\"Dalmatia and Istria\\". These include Feldpost, postcards which Kircher created for the Austrian Red Cross, the War Welfare Office or the War Aid Office and also for the London Postcard Publisher Raphael Tuck & Sons and the Swedish Postcards Publisher: \\"Gothenburg Lithographic AB and Meyer & Köster\\" etc. For some time Kircher owned a steam yacht, which he named Romana – this was his wife's name. With this ship he could better motives collect and draw maritime objects from the area. This he did for example in fleet parades.

In 1906 the family moved to Moritzburg. From 1922 the Kirchers occupied a villa at 6 Jagdweg in Niederlößnitz and from 1933 to about 1935 they lived in Kötzschenbroda-Niederlößnitz.Radebeul – Niederlößnitz is today a part of the city of Radebeul/Meißen in Saxony In June 1935, Kircher's wife died.

First of them Emperor Franz Joseph I and Emperor Wilhelm II. On behalf of these two monarchs, Kircher painted numerous images of the Austro-Hungarian Navy and the Imperial German Navy. His paintings were also found on the large passenger ships of the time, as well as in the offices of well known shipping companies and shipyards and of course also in private ownership. During World War II, several images got lost or disappeared. An example of the many lost images is the large oil painting of the steamship Columbus (\\"The Columbus in the Kaiser lock\\"). This painting was given by the North German Lloyd as a gift to the city of Bremerhaven on the occasion of its 100th anniversary in 1927. The painting has disappeared at the end of World War II (1945). Others of his paintings have been preserved for posterity and can be seen in many museums today; see list of locations excerpt.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Early life Gannon was born in Sydney, New South Wales in 1847, the son of James Gannon and his wife Mary (née Phelps).New South Wales Index of Births: 2238/1847 V18472238 133 After working as a clerk at the Christian Brothers' College Sydney and as a commercial agent with his brother, he relocated to Queensland in 1868. He acquired pastoral experience at Warra Warra and acted as manager for Thorn and a stockbuyer for Davenport. In 1880 he became an auctioneer in Ipswich. In partnership with R.A. Ryan, he purchased the produce and auctioneering company of Arthur Martin in 1882. He invested in grazing and real estate. Amy England Gannon (née Pearce) On 6 June 1884, he married Amy England Pearce in Brisbane.Queensland Index of Marriages 1884/B8926 Politics Michael Gannon unsuccessfully contested the electoral district of Ipswich in the 1881 by-election triggered by the resignation of John Malbon Thompson, but was beaten by Josiah Francis, a former mayor of Ipswich. Michael Gannon was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the electoral district of Toombul on 10 May 1888 in the 1888 colonial election. He held the seat until 29 April 1893 when he was defeated by Andrew Lang Petrie in the 1893 election. Michael Gannon unsuccessfully contested the electoral district of Bulimba in the 1896 election, unable to beat the sitting member James Robert Dickson. Later life The Gannon's permanent residence was at \\"Waratah\\", Toorak Road, Breakfast Creek. In February 1888, Michael Gannon purchased a large portion of land in the Wynnum-Manly area formerly part of Portion 57. Gannon sold off a considerable acreage of land, but retained ownership of that portion on which a residence was to be constructed. It is likely that the house was constructed as, on 30 April of that year, a Bill of Mortgage was registered from Michael Brennan Gannon to the Royal Bank of Queensland. The release for the mortgage was signed in September 1889. The house became the family's holiday home. Besides his political endeavours, Gannon was actively involved in Brisbane's social and sporting society. In 1888, Gannon was Vice-President of the Albert Cricket Club, Queensland Governor Anthony Musgrave was President; he was involved with the Queensland Rifle Association; the Brisbane Bicycling Club; the Breakfast Creek Rowing Club; a Director of the Federal Building, Land Investors Society Pty Ltd and Deposit Bank and a Justice of the Peace. During the early 1890s Gannon's speculative ventures began to fail. The Land Bank of Queensland was in possession of the land by the early 1890s and sold off smaller allotments from the block. Gannon was eventually declared bankrupt in 1895 with liabilities in excess of £97,000. Michael Gannon died in Brisbane on 9 April 1898 aged 50 years after a protracted illness that had forced him to retire. He was buried in the Toowong Cemetery on 11 April 1898.Queensland Index of Deaths 1898/C3862 His obituaries described him as \\"universally respected for his outspokenness and the honourable motives which actuated his conduct\\" and that he would be remembered as \\"one of the most honest figures in mercantile circles; ... a man who in turn was most happy when sharing his bounty with others less prosperous. Everybody respected him, everybody trusted him. In politics, too, he was known as the 'straight man' whose first consideration was others ...\\".

The aircraft had been flying in international waters, as was later shown by Madeleine Albright at the United Nations. Killed in the incident were Cessna pilots Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, Jr., Mario de la Peña, and Pablo Morales. Map showing the southernmost positions (prior to the incident) of the three aircraft according to US and Cuban data. Radar data and screen prints were provided by a United States Customs Service Supervisory Detection Systems Specialist who recorded the entire incident as it happened using surveillance data from a U.S. surveillance radar balloon in the Florida Keys. The map shows the locations where the two aircraft were reportedly shot down. Finding many inconsistencies in US and Cuban data, the ICAO investigation determined the most likely location to be that determined from information from the ship Majesty of the Seas. Description On 24 February 1996, two of the Brothers to the Rescue Cessna Skymasters were shot down by a Cuban Air Force Mikoyan MiG-29UB, while a second jet fighter, a MiG-23, orbited nearby. Killed in the shootdowns were pilots Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, Jr., Mario de la Peña and Pablo Morales. A third aircraft, flown by Basulto, escaped. The first aircraft was downed outside Cuban territorial airspace and the second aircraft was downed outside Cuban airspace. The aircraft used were Cessna 337s, a twin-engine civilian light aircraft. A type similar to those owned by Brothers to the Rescue, designated the Cessna O-2 Skymaster, was in use by the United States military until 2010. Cuba claimed that the group used \\"planes previously employed in the wars in Vietnam and El Salvador given to them by the U.S. Air Force from which the \\"USAF\\" signs have not been completely erased.\\" Section III, Paragraph 7 of the REPORT Nº 86/99, CASE 11.589, OEA/Ser.L/V/II.106 Doc. 3 rev. at 586 (1999) Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, issued September 29, 1999 The incident was investigated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Their report concluded that the authorities in Cuba had notified the authorities in the United States of multiple violations of their airspace since May 1994.\\"Report on the shooting down of two U.S.-registered private civil aircraft by Cuban military aircraft on 24 February 1996\\", C-WP/10441, June 20, 1996, United Nations Security Council document, S/1996/509, July 1, 1996. In at least one case (13 July 1995), the pilot had released leaflets over Havana. The United States authorities had issued public statements advising of the potential consequences of unauthorized entry into Cuban airspace and had initiated legal actions against Basulto, but had retained his certification to fly during appeal. After Basulto was warned by an FAA official about the possibility of being shot down, he replied, \\"You must understand I have a mission in life to perform\\", disregarding the potential danger involved.Court testimony from the Cuban spy trial, referred in The Miami Herald March 13, 2001 at \\"Basulto testifies\\". Latin American Studies. He would later say he considered the group's activities to be acts of civil disobedience against the regime, and a demonstration that such disobedience was possible. According to Cuban authorities, two light aircraft entered Cuban territorial airspace on 9 and 13 January 1996, and released leaflets which fell on Cuban territory. According to the pilot of one of the aircraft, half a million leaflets were released on 13 January; he also claims they were released outside the Cuban territorial limit and the wind carried them to Havana. This version of events was detailed by Juan Pablo Roque, the man who had returned to Cuba the day before the shootdown and who was later implicated as having helped organize the shootdown as a Cuban spy placed with the group. According to Roque, Basulto had dropped the leaflets from north of Havana, not the stated , from a high altitude on a day when the winds would carry them south toward Cuba. Specifically, in a Cuban television interview days after the shootdown took place, Roque, from within Cuba, stated, \\"I personally have violated air space, specifically the last was on 9 January 1996, where I got a call the day before to participate in a flight to Havana where thousands of leaflets were going to be released from a height of more than at a distance of less than from the coast.\\" Following that incident, the ICAO report states, the Commander of the Anti- Aircraft Defence of the Air Force of Cuba was instructed to intercept any further flights and was authorized to shoot them down, whether or not they had entered Cuban airspace. On 24 February 1996, the group's aircraft flew another mission. While the Brothers to the Rescue aircraft were still north of the 24th parallel, the Cuban Air Force ordered the scrambling of two military aircraft, a MiG-29 and a MiG-23, operating under ground control. Two of the group's three aircraft flying that day were shot down. The pilots requested authorization from military control, identifying the target as a Cessna 337 who responded with \\"authorized to destroy.\\" According to the OAS report, there was no warning of any kind issued to the planes, nor the opportunity given to land. With the downing of each aircraft, the Cuban pilots could be heard celebrating over the radio. Terms like \\"cojones\\" were repeatedly used by the Cuban fighter pilots. Their radio transmissions included statements such as \\"We blew his balls off!\\" In a reference to the Cuban pilot's understanding that the aircraft they were attacking were the same ones that had been repeatedly and continuously flying directly over the island of Cuba beside all the buildings and over the streets, they also transmitted the following, \\"He won't give us any more fucking trouble.\\" Finally, the Cuban pilots also said, \\"The other one is destroyed; the other one is destroyed. Homeland or death (patria o muerte), you bastards! The other one is also down.\\" Military control stated \\"Congratulations to the pair of you.\\" Transcripts of Cuban Military Radio Communications, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Report on the shooting down of two U.S.-registered private civil aircraft by Cuban military aircraft on 24 February 1996, C-WP/10441, June 20, 1996, pp. 35 ff., United Nations, Security Council, S/1996/509, July 1, 1996 Subsequently, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued a report that concluded, \\"The fact that weapons of war and combat-trained pilots were used against unarmed civilians shows not only how disproportionate the use of force was, but also the intent to end the lives of those individuals. It is claimed the extracts from the radio communications between the MiG-29 pilots and the military control tower indicate that they acted from a superior position and showed malice and scorn toward the human dignity of the victims.\\"Section IV, Paragraph 37, Subsection iii of the REPORT Nº 86/99, CASE 11.589, OEA/Ser.L/V/II.106 Doc. 3 rev. at 586 (1999) Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, issued September 29, 1999 The third Brothers to the Rescue aircraft, with Basulto on board, was also identified for intercept and was to be shot down but escaped. José Basulto, aviator and leader of \\"Brothers to the Rescue\\" in Miami in 2010 Testimony from a USAF Colonel Buchner expressed support for Cuba's claim that both Brothers aircraft, along with a third flown by Basulto, were only to off the Cuban coast.Court testimony of retired USAF Colonel Buchner, reported in The Miami Herald, March 22, 2001, \\"Fliers downed by MiGs violated Cuban airspace, colonel says\\". The statement by Buchner is directly contradictory to eyewitness testimony and verified radar data documentation provided by Department of the Treasury, Supervisory Detection Systems Specialist J.

September 18, 1996.House of Representatives, Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Committee on International Relations, Washington D.C. September 18, 1996 The ICAO report found that the aircraft were shot down were both very near (and, in one case, directly above) a U.S fishing vessel named Tri-Liner which had a recorded position at the time of the downing outside Cuban territorial airspace.Sections 3.16 and 3.17 of the Resolution on the Cuban Government's Shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue Adopted by the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) at the Twentieth Meeting of its 148th Session on 27 June 1996 Also nearby was the cruise ship Majesty of the Seas. The ICAO report also states that means other than interception, such as radio communication, had been available to Cuba, but had not been utilized, and that this conflicts with the ICAO principle that interception of civil aircraft should be undertaken only as a last resort.Sections 3.18, 3.19 and 3.20 of the Resolution on the Cuban Government's Shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue Adopted by the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) at the Twentieth Meeting of its 148th Session on 27 June 1996 It is also claimed the Cuban Air Force did not make any attempt to direct the aircraft beyond the boundaries of national airspace, guide them away from a prohibited, restricted or danger area or instruct them to effect a landing.Section III, Paragraph 8 of the REPORT Nº 86/99, CASE 11.589, OEA/Ser.L/V/II.106 Doc. 3 rev. at 586 (1999) Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, issued September 29, 1999 Reactions to the incident International Following the incident, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1067 (1996), a U.S.-sponsored resolution condemning Cuba. Dissenting members believed that the resolution was singling out Cuba for condemnation, and instead should have issued a call which urged both states to refrain from shooting down civilian airplanes as well as to prevent the improper use of civil aviation.United Nations press release SC/6247: Security Council condemns use of weapons against civil aircraft; calls on Cuba to comply with international law. 27 July 1996 United States In Miami, reaction from the exile community was swift. The late Jorge Mas Canosa, co-founder and leader of the Cuban American National Foundation, condemned the attack: \\"For two warplanes from the Castro government to shoot down two unarmed civilian aircraft with American flags on a humanitarian mission should be considered an act of war against the US\\". After the attack, the pilots responsible were the twin brothers, El Teniente (LTC) Colonel Lorenzo Alberto Perez Perez and his \\"Guy in Back,\\" El Teniente Colonel (LTC) Francisco Perez Perez. Both were charged in the United States for their role in the attack. Cuban response Miguel Alfonso Martinez of the Cuban Foreign Ministry said that the two aircraft that were shot down were \\"not common civilian aircraft\\" as suggested by the US. \\"This is not the case of an innocent civilian airliner that, because of an instrument error, departs from an air corridor and gets into the airspace of another country\\". \\"These people knew what they were doing. They were warned. They wanted to take certain actions that were clearly intended to destabilize the Cuban government and the US authorities knew about their intentions\\".\\"U.S. TIGHTENS SANCTIONS AGAINST CUBA AFTER DOWNING OF TWO EXILE PLANES OFF CUBAN COAST\\".

Amending legislation came into effect on 6 December 2014, which made the purchase of sexual services illegal, using the Swedish approach. Greenland Prostitution in Greenland is illegal.

Beyle similarly hailed the appointment as a sign of the nation's strengthening security and foreign diplomatic relations. On 12 October 2014, the new Chinese embassy officially opened in Mogadishu. On 15 December 2014, Wei Hongtian presented his credentials to President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Somalia. He is the first such envoy after the reopening of the Chinese embassy in Mogadishu. Foreign Minister of Somalia Beyle and Ambassador Wei subsequently held a joint press conference, wherein the officials pledged to further strengthen bilateral ties. As part of the local reconstruction process, Wei also indicated that the Chinese authorities were slated to implement various development projects in Somalia. In April 2015, Wei Hongtian met in Mogadishu with Foreign Affairs Minister of Somalia Abdisalam Omer to discuss ties between both nations. The meeting concluded with a signed bilateral agreement, which strengthens diplomatic relations and collaboration. As part of the treaty's stipulations, $13 million in Chinese funds will be earmarked for reconstruction and development initiatives in the economy, health, education and infrastructure sectors in Somalia. According to Ambassador Wei, the Chinese authorities are slated to continue their support for the Somali government's stabilizations efforts. Omer in turn commended the Chinese government for its sustained cooperation.

Chroniques des rois de Tunis et du pacte fondamental, vol. II, éd. Maison tunisienne de l'édition, Tunis, 1990, p. 41 was the first hereditary bey of Tunis, founder of the Muradid dynasty. He reigned from 1613 until his death.Ibn Abi Dhiaf, op. cit, p. 40  Biography  Originally from Corsica and named Jacques Senti, he was captured by the Tunisian corsairs at the age of nine and bought by the first bey of Tunis, the old mameluke Ramadhan. He was promoted by the bey, who made him his lieutenant (kahia) in 1613, and participated in missions to pacify the hinterland and collect taxes at the head of armed battalions called mhalla. He allied himself to Yusuf Dey and received his old master's position after his death in 1613. He was enriched by the corsairs and subsequently obtained the title of pasha of Tunis from the Ottoman government, along with the right of his son and heir Hamuda Bey to inherit the title of Bey, with the agreement of Yusuf Dey. Thus he became the founder of a dynasty of Beys who came to enjoy a controlling role in the government of Tunisia. Murad Bey enjoyed the respect of the Ottoman sultan, but also wide administrative autonomy and a unique degree of political independence, without doubt a result of his geographic distance from Constantinople and of the jihad which the Tunisian corsairs carried on against Christendom. In fact, the government of Tunis (the dey, the bey, and the divan) were able to conclude peace treaties and commercial agreements with the rulers of the major states of Europe independently of the Sultan. He contented himself with appointing a pasha, theoretically the supreme representative of the Ottoman government in Tunis, every three years and with receiving the traditional tribute in kind from the diwan on these occasions. The men in power in Tunis demanded from the cities and tribes of the interior only the minimal level of deference necessary to maintain order and security. The bey did not, legally speaking, exact taxes but only a sort of annual tribute and so long as this was paid he left them to live according to their norms and customs. Under the first Muradid beys, Tunis acquired a real prosperity through commercial activity, piracy, and the regular collection of tribute. In the domain of art, the Great Mosque of Kairouan received some restoration work in the reign of Murad Bey who wished to leave his mark on the ancient monument, mostly some painted ceilings in the prayer hall.

Personal life  Wilhelmus received an upbringing based on radical left principles. He was a teacher and started his career by publishing Provo-like journals. Wilhelmus advocated complete sexual freedom, and became a well-known advocate of free sexual morality. Together with Peter Johannes Muller (of Candy magazine), Wilhelmus broke the taboo of sexuality in the Netherlands. Wilhelmus also aggressively attacked women's shelters for abused women, and published the confidential addresses of these shelters. Wilhelmus started sex shops and a 'stimulus society' in a cellar in Utrecht that allowed couples to engage in partner swapping. Wilhelmus was married and had four children; three daughters and one son. Wilhelmus' wife shared his philosophy regarding adult and child sexuality.  Chick  Chick, self-styled \\"sex magazine for the worker\\", was an explicit sex journal that started in 1968. Chick was founded by Wilhelmus, its editor-in-chief, and Jan Wenderhold, its sales manager. It also published dating personals that were about sex and not about love. Chicks initial print run of 5,000 rose to 18,000 by the second half of 1968, and according to Wilhelmus, the magazine's circulation was 140,000 in 1971. In the seventies, Wilhelmus argued in Chick that sex with children was part of the sexual liberation. In 1970, the publication of Chick resulted in the Dutch \\"Chick-arrest\\" by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands, which in turn led to the new Dutch moral law of 1971 that no longer criminally sanctioned pornography. After a conflict between founders Wilhelmus and Wenderhold, two versions of Chick co-existed, Chick/Dordrecht and Chick/Amsterdam, until Wenderhold eventually bought the Dordrecht version.  Lolita  Wilhelmus was also the founder and publisher of child pornography magazine Lolita. Lolita was first published circa 1970. Besides pornography it also featured a contact service for its readers through classified ads. Wilhelmus encouraged readers to provide new child pornography images so as to ensure his magazine's survival. A gift magazine was given in exchange for each new child photograph, and the sum of $350 was offered in the magazine if Wilhelmus could take the photographs himself. While Wilhelmus was arrested for publishing Lolita in January 1971, he was released immediately after the interrogation, and was never prosecuted for publishing the magazine. In June 1975, Wilhelmus partook in a TV broadcast of the NCRV-program Hier en Nu, where he explained how normal sex with children was to him. He also gave a lecture at a Roman Catholic training institute for working girls in Rotterdam, at the invitation of the school board, and Lex van Naerssen of Utrecht University invited Wilhelmus as a visiting scholar, which led to parliamentary questions in the Dutch House of Representatives. In 1986, the PSI subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs called Lolita \\"the most notorious of the foreign commercial child pornography publications\\". The magazine reached issue 55 in 1984, and was eventually closed down by Dutch authorities in 1987, seventeen years after its conception. According to Wilhelmus, at the peak of its popularity, Lolitas circulation was 25,000. Lolita became an almost universal brand name for child pornography. In an interview with the VPRO, Dik Brummel of the NVSH declared that he had bought some Lolitas and considered them to be \\"historical documents\\".  Later years and death  Wilhelmus became a millionaire, but as \\"one of the most successful\\" and \\"one of the most notorious\\" publishers of child pornography, he ran into great opposition when the social climate started changing and he became more and more isolated. The Dutch authorities arrested him every time he tried to leave the country. In 1992, Wilhelmus was sentenced to four years' imprisonment for having sex with his then twelve-year-old daughter. Wilhelmus claimed to be innocent, and his oldest daughter started a petition to free her father and asked a doctor to examine the daughter who was supposedly abused. This doctor issued a medical certificate that stated the daughter could not have had sexual intercourse and that her hymen was intact. Two years later, Wilhelmus was released early because of good behavior. The night after his release, Wilhelmus drowned in the water of the Voorstraathaven in downtown Dordrecht. According to the police, his death was neither suicide nor murder, but Wilhelmus was drunk and his death an accident.

Overview The southern part of Djurgården was in the 1800s an unbuilt meadow that was called \\"Slätten\\" and later \\"Djurgårdsslätten\\". In the mid 1800s a park was built and a number of houses, such as an inn, bars and other building were comedians, musicians and theater could be.

ALCO vigorously promoted their popular 4-6-2s to the railroads, especially in the passenger-dense east coast. It was purchased for $62,296.90 (the equivalent of ±$839,000 in present-day U.S. dollars). During its 30 years of service, 470 pulled named passenger trains including The Gull, the Bar Harbor Express, and the Kennebec Limited. The engine was the last steam locomotive to be operated by Maine Central Railroad, and its final run on Sunday, June 13, 1954 was nationally publicized and attracted widespread spectators along its entire route of travel. Passenger service had been in steady decline, and Maine Central discontinued all passenger service in Maine only six years later. After its final run, Engine 470 was transferred to the Railroad's Maintenance Shops in Waterville where it was drained, winterized and towed to a display plinth near the public railroad station. On October 28, 1962, in celebrating Maine Central Railroad's centennial anniversary, the locomotive was officially presented as a gift to the City of Waterville. Deterioration Following the razing of MEC Train Station and reconfiguration of the nearby roadway, the locomotive was moved to a new display location [Map] on December 14, 1970. This new roadside location provided open recreational access to the locomotive, and it became subject to vandalism and pilferage. During its years on display, the locomotive has received minor cosmetic restoration as well as rudimentary asbestos abatement. Sale and restoration In 2012, recognizing the deteriorating condition and subsequent hazard to the public, the City of Waterville requested bids for the sale or restoration of the locomotive. Of the six bids that were received, only one bidder planned to keep the locomotive in Maine. On December 3, 2013, the City Council of Waterville voted in favor of selling the locomotive to Maine-based non-profit New England Steam Corporation. New England Steam entered a delayed purchase and sale agreement with the city, vowing not to preemptively disturb the locomotive until it had successfully raised both the purchase price and the anticipated moving costs. The locomotive was purchased on November 5, 2015. In 2016, New England Steam relocated the locomotive to Washington Junction in Hancock, Maine. In cooperation with Downeast Scenic Railroad, they plan to commence a complete restoration, returning MEC 470 to service as part of a Maine Heritage railway.

Built in 1908, it was closed to vehicle traffic in 1997 and operated as a pedestrian bridge until December 2014 when it was closed after inspectors found that thirteen floor beams were unsafe for pedestrians. In an October 26, 2015 letter, the Coast Guard informed the City of Boston that the bridge was a 'hazard to navigation' due to the risk of it falling into the Fort Point Channel and requested removal of most vulnerable portion. The center span of the truss also carried a single track for the Union Freight Railroad, although it was designed for two tracks. From 1912 to 1948, the bridge abutted a floating firehouse for Engine 44 of the Boston Fire Department. Following its closure as a road bridge, various redevelopment schemes have been proposed for the bridge, as well as outright demolition of the span. The bridge has been closed to all use since December 2014 Replacement On January 20, 2016, the Boston Globe reported that the City of Boston will spend $100 million to reopen the bridge, as part of its agreement to bring General Electric's headquarters to the South Boston Waterfront. Two days later, the Globe reported that the bridge would instead be removed, and possibly replaced. Later in the spring, the City of Boston and the Boston Society of Architects sponsored an \\"ideas competition\\" for reconstruction or replacement of the bridge. In December 2019, city officials announced that the bridge would be rebuilt for use solely by pedestrians and bicyclists. Updated plans were announced in May 2020, with design expected to be finalized by the end of 2020 and construction to begin in 2021.

History Ritual Aesthetic began in 2013 as the solo project of Sean Ragan who was then drumming for Metropolis Records industrial horror outfit Dawn Of Ashes. The band's original style consisted of genre-blending compositions similar to that of artists like Skinny Puppy. The resulting sound was a unique blend of melodic dance rhythms, harsh metal guitar, aggressive EBM styled vocals and dark experimental noise atmospheres. In early 2013, individual singles were uploaded to the band's various social media pages. Met with overwhelmingly positive feedback from online listeners, the band signed with UK industrial label Juggernaut Services and on April 18, 2014 released its subsequent first full length Decollect . The album featured brand new compositions, re-workings of original singles as well as remixes by Ad Noiseam artist Iszoloscope. Decollect was mixed by Los Angeles-based heavy metal producer Alex Crescioni and mastered by the German producer Sander Kapper Ritual Aesthetic has been praised with critical acclaim, drawing comparisons to Wumpscut, Combichrist and Ministry. Critics praised Ritual Aesthetic's unique and heavy musical compositions as well as praising its catchy pop structured lyrical hooks. Critics referred to its debut album as sounding as if it came from \\"the 1995 heyday of the genre\\". Decollect was ranked #14 on Discogs Best Industrial Albums of 2014 category, as well as #7 in its Best Alternative Electronic Albums of 2014 list. Ritual Aesthetic has since appeared on the Vortex Filth compilation album, alongside Combichrist and Alien Vampires featuring the song \\"Something To Know You By\\". In spring 2018, the band announced via Regen Magazine that the band signed with Cleopatra Records and would be releasing 2018's follow up album Wound Garden in late July. Accompanying the press announcement was a teaser single of the song \\"The Analog Flesh\\".

Kim retired from the WTF presidency in 2004 and was succeeded by Chungwon Choue. Kim Un-yong was elected the president of the Korean Taekwondo Association on 23 January 1971. Though he initially declined the position due to the continued conflicts within the organization, he was asked by the Korean government to accept and to clean up the association. Believing that Taekwondo was a Korean martial art and its governing body should therefore be based in Korea, Dr. Kim dissolved the relationship between the Korean Taekwondo Association and the International Taekwondo Federation. In 1973, the World Taekwondo Federation was formed and Dr. Kim was elected its first president. Kim played a significant role in debuting Taekwondo at the Olympics and helping South Korea host the 1988 Summer Olympics. In 2004, he was arrested for embezzlement and bribery charges and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. Kim has served as President of the Korean Olympic Committee, President of the 2002 Pusan Asian Games Organization Committee, President of the Korea Taekwondo Association, President of World Taekwondo Headquarters (Kukkiwon), an Ambassador at Large with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Co-Chairman of the Rebuilding Korea Committee, and internationally, he was the President of GAISF, Executive Board Member of the IOC, Chairman of the IOC Radio and Television Commission, and President of the World Taekwondo Federation.

It is one of three white flowering rātā vines (the others being white rātā and small white rātā). The name \\"albiflora\\" indeed literally means white flowered. Despite the similar names, large white rātā is distinguished by its much larger leaves and flowers. Its flowers are amongst the largest of any rātā, similar in size to both scarlet rātā and pōhutukawa. It occurs almost exclusively in Kauri forests from the northern Kaimai Ranges to Te Paki at the top of the North Island. Description The flowers of M. albiflora are a pure white, with flowering between October and March. Leaves grow up to 9 cm long and are leathery, and the vine can grow up to 10m high. If no support is available, it will instead form a large bush, and example of this can be seen in Waima, Northland in regenerating bush.  Conservation As of 2012, M. albiflora is not regarded as threatened.  Cultivation Metrosideros albiflora has a reputation for being exacting and difficult and is not common in cultivation. It is however available form specialist plant nurseries. In addition to the large white flowers, its new foliage is a reddish colour. It strongly prefers a situation where its base is afforded shade and it is not permitted to dry out excessively. There is one known cultivar of large white rātā, Metrosideros albiflora 'Northland', which is listed in the Blue Mountain Nurseries catalog.

For his service, he received the Distinguished Flying Cross and other medals. As a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, he received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.  Tuskegee Airmen  After Steward graduated from college and when the Army Air Corps began allowing blacks to enlist and become pilots, he enlisted in 1942. According to Steward, the US Air Force brought together black men—specifically black athletes—from throughout the US to be trained at Tuskegee Institute. When they were initially deployed in Europe, they were initially ignored and often called the \\"Spookwaffe\\". Their mission was to fly fighter aircraft to escort bombers. Once their reputation for providing effective air support for bombers became widely known, they started receiving special request for bomber support. Steward describe how he became a Tuskegee Airman: After receiving segregated training at the Tuskegee Army Air Field, he was sent to Italy in 1944 with the 100th Fighter Squadron. From Capodichino Air Base in Naples, Italy he flew a number of missions in Bell P-39 Airacobras and Curtiss P-40 Warhawks. He was subsequently based in Ramitelli Airfield where he flew many more missions in North American P-51 Mustangs. In total, he flew 143 missions. After the war and after his return to Los Angeles, he helped to organize the Los Angeles chapter of Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. and to found a scholarship foundation in the name of the Tuskegee Airmen. In 2007, Steward attended President George W. Bush's presentation of the Tuskegee Airmen with the Congressional Gold Medal.  Biography  Steward was born in Los Angeles and was a childhood friend of Jackie Robinson. He attended Jefferson High School. In 1937, he entered Santa Barbara State College where he would become the first black captain of the Gauchos team. In 1941, he led the Gauchos to the semifinals of the 1941 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament but was not allowed to play because he was black. Steward graduated from college in 1941 with a business degree. He met his wife Helen in Santa Barbara, California and married her in Los Angeles in 1943. They had one son and two daughters. In 1942, when United States Army Air Forces began to allow blacks enter and become pilots, Steward was allowed to enlist and he was sent to the Tuskegee Institute for training. After his military discharge in 1946, he returned to Los Angeles with his wife to buy a house but they were not able to secure a mortgage because they were black. Because of this, he went to real estate school and obtained a real estate license. In the 1950s he helped to integrate parts of Los Angeles by facilitating home sales. On December 14, 2014, he came down with a cold that led to pneumonia. He died on December 17 in Community Memorial Hospital of natural causes at the age of 95.

He was a nephew of its last emperor Wang Yanzheng, and briefly served as chancellor and general during Wang Yanzheng's reign.  Background  It is not known when or where Wang Jichang was born. It is known, however, that he was a nephew of Wang Yanzheng — and, therefore, likely a grandson of Min's founding prince Wang Shenzhi (Prince Zhongyi) (although conceivably the grandson of one of Wang Shenzhi's brothers, Wang Chao or Wang Shengui (). His parents' identity were not otherwise given in traditional histories.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 94.  During Wang Yanzheng's Reign  In 943, Wang Yanzheng, then in civil war against his brother, then-reigning Min emperor Wang Xi (Emperor Jingzong), declared himself the emperor of a new branch state Yin at his stronghold of Jian Prefecture (建州, in modern Nanping, Fujian).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. He made Wang Jichang Menxia Shilang () and chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). In 944, Wang Xi's general Zhu Wenjin assassinated Wang Xi and took the throne himself, but later that year was in turn killed by the general Lin Renhan (), who then submitted the Min capital Fu Prefecture (福州, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) to Wang Yanzheng. The senior officials remaining at Fu went to Jian to request that he change the name of his state back to Min and move the capital back to Fu. Wang Yanzheng agreed to the former but not the latter (as he anticipated having to defend against an attack from the northwestern neighbor Southern Tang), so he, keeping the capital at Jian, made Fu the southern capital and put Wang Jichang in the position of overseer of the southern capital. He also sent the general Huang Renfeng () with a detachment to Fu to aid Wang Jichang, along with the general Wu Chengyi (), who had already been stationed there.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. However, it was said that Wang Jichang was weak in personality and often taking to drinking, not caring about his soldiers. The soldiers and the officers thus came to resent him. Two former officers, Li Renda and Chen Jixun (), in particular, were worried for themselves because they had both defected from Wang Yanzheng's army previously. They met with Huang and persuaded him that Wang Yanzheng himself was in such a precarious position to defend against the Southern Tang attack such that they should rebel against him and seize control of Fu for themselves. Huang agreed. That day, they led an assault on the headquarters and killed Wang Jichang and Wu, seizing control of Fu.

Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a subspecies of the large-eared horseshoe bat by Robert Goodwin in 1979. Its trinomen was Rhinolophus philippinensis montanus. It was maintained as a subspecies until 2002, when Csorba argued that it was morphologically distinct enough to be considered a full species. Since this publication, it has consistently been considered its own species, Rhinolophus montanus. Its species name \\"montanus\\" is Latin in origin, meaning \\"montane.\\" Goodwin chose this species name because the holotype was found at a high elevation of above sea level. Biology It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as caves. Unlike some bat species which are highly colonial, it roosts in small groups of perhaps 6 or 7 individuals. When roosting, it prefers to hang from the ceilings of caves rather than in crevices. Individuals are well-spaced during roosting rather than clustered. It has been roosting with other species of bat, including Creagh's horseshoe bat, the western bent-winged bat, and the small bent-winged bat. Range and habitat The holotype, paratype, and two additional specimens were all collected from Quoto Lou Caves in Timor-Leste, about above sea level. These caves are not natural, and were excavated by the Japanese during their occupation of East Timor. The caves are located near Ermera. There have been additional acoustic detections near Laleia, Nino Konis Santana National Park, and Betano. Conservation It is currently assessed as endangered by the IUCN, indicating that it is at risk of going extinct. It meets the criteria for this assessment because its area of occupancy is smaller than , and it is threatened by habitat destruction and human disturbance of its roosts.

She was the only Dutch woman to be executed for her wartime activities. Biography She was the daughter of Jewish parents, Aron van Dijk and Kaatje Bin. She married Bram Querido in 1927, and they separated in 1935. After the marriage ended, she began a lesbian relationship with a woman named Miep Stodel, and opened a millinery shop called Maison Evany in Amsterdam. The shop was closed by the Nazis in 1941 as part of their seizure of Jewish property—Jews were forbidden to own businesses or work in retail shops, amongst other occupational restrictions. Stodel fled to Switzerland in 1942. Van Dijk was arrested on Easter Sunday 1943 by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; the Nazi intelligence service) detective Peter Schaap of the Office of Jewish Affairs of the Amsterdam police. After promising to work for the SD, van Dijk was released. Pretending to be a member of the resistance, she offered to help Jews find hiding places and obtain false papers. In this way, she trapped at least 145 people, including her own brother and his family. Some 85 of her victims later died in concentration camps. She may have been responsible for the deaths of as many as 700 people. It has been suggested that she may have betrayed Anne Frank and her family. After the war, she moved to The Hague, where she was arrested at a friend's home on June 20, 1945, and charged with 23 counts of treason. On February 24, 1947, she was brought to the Special Court in Amsterdam. She confessed on all counts, explaining that she only acted out of self-preservation, and was sentenced to death. She appealed the conviction, but in September 1947 the Special Court of Appeals confirmed her punishment. Her request for a royal pardon was also rejected. On 14 January 1948 she was executed by firing squad at Fort Bijlmer in the Weesperkarspel municipality (now the Bijlmermeer district of the city of Amsterdam). The night before her execution she was baptized and joined the Roman Catholic Church.

Life  Petit was born in Fontenay-Trésigny. He began his career at the age of 16½ years as a camera assistant. During the Second World War, he was also active as a cameraman. Among his teachers were Léonce-Henri Burel, Eugen Schüfftan, Jean Bachelet, Joseph-Louis Mundwiller and André Dantan. Shortly after the war ended, Petit debuted as a director of photography; over the course of in the next two and a half decades he became one of the most representative cinematographers working in French cinema (he also worked on a few foreign films). The films Petit photographed were almost continuously purely commercial productions to entertain the masses. He photographed many historical dramas, gangster films, and adventure films, and occasionally comedies. He worked with the directors Denys de La Patellière, Ralph Habib, Maurice Labro, Guy Lefranc, Pierre Billon and Georges Combret. In the 60s, he worked on several agent and spy thrillers. Pierre Petit worked now more frequently with the A film director Christian-Jaque, for whom he shot the sprawling historical costume drama production Emma Hamilton, and the movie star Jean Marais. During the early 1970s, Petit largely moved back from the cinema and devoted himself to the television. He retired in the early 1990s. He died in Rueil-Malmaison in 1997.

However, until 2010, the qualification of P.kolombatovici as species was subject to doubt. Dietz, C. & von Helversen, O. 2004. Specimens of Plecotus sp. were analysed in North Africa, the Canary Islands, and Asia over a period of years, and it was proposed that all the specimens were subspecies of the same species, Plecotus teneriffae. However, the most recent studies confirm the status of species for P. kolombatovici.Tvrtkovic, N. et al. 2005. As several species of Plecotus can be leaving in sympatry in a same region, a clear identification of specimen can be very difficult. Distribution So far, P.kolombatovici has been recorded in Albania, Croatia and Greece. This species is often found in the islands of the Adriatic sea,Théou, P., & Loçe, E. 2017. but also inland with a recorded presence in most of Greece.

It is an imposing structure, dominating the marketplace and north end of the town. It carries the East Coast Main Line, the main railway from Newcastle to London. Chester-le-Street station on that line is just south of the viaduct. It is a Grade II listed building. History A railway line from Gateshead to Durham through Team Valley was proposed in 1846, and authorised in 1848. The downfall of \\"Railway King\\" George Hudson in 1849 led to its postponement, and work was delayed until 1862 when the North Eastern Railway regained the authority to build the Team Valley line, which required the building of the viaduct. The viaduct was completed in 1868 by Benjamin Carr Lawton, under the control of Thomas Elliot Harrison. The line opened the same year, on 2 March for freight and 1 December for passengers. The viaduct is still in use, carrying the East Coast Main Line. Architecture alt=A large arch in red brick, part of a larger structure, with sky and trees visible through it The viaduct consists of 11 semi-elliptical arches, each wide and is high, for a total length of . It is mostly red engineering brick in English bond, with seven rows of header bond around the arches and with stone for the plinths and parapet edge. The stone and bricks are all original, though there has been some resurfacing on the west. Railings and refuges added later are not part of the listed structure. It lies on a north-south axis with a slight curve, passing over Chester Burn. The viaduct was built to cross Chester Burn (also known as Cong Burn), then a centre of activity with both industrial and residential properties around its banks. In 1955 to establish a new market the area east of the viaduct was cleared and the burn concreted over below the viaduct. More recently a Tesco superstore was built, and its carpark occupies the space beneath the arches today.

As the song continues, you can feel a sense of desperation in chorus which captures the overall mood of the song. All in all, The Cinema is at it again with catchy hook evoking that reckless youth previously mentioned.\\" Ryan Gardner of AbsolutePunk awarded the album 7/10 stars and stated: \\"The fun thing about The Cinema is how evident it is that Antelman and Malpass have so much fun doing it. As mentioned are songs in all areas of the spectrum here – the more mellow “Turn It On,” the hook driven “Ghost,” and the most flamboyant pop song with “Weekend.” Even the three part vocal melody on “Punchline” is something I haven’t really heard before. The album feels similar to My Blood Is Full of Airplane but also throws some unexpected segments – the guitar part near the end of “Talking In Your Sleep” – that break from the norm. The experimentation does have some missteps, but there’s still a little something here for everyone – fans of The Cinema’s previous record, Lydia’s Devil, synth-heavy music, and pop music.\\" Track listing Personnel * Leighton Antelman – vocals * Matt Malpass – programming, production References Category:2014 albums Category:The Cinema albums ","title":"Talking in Your Sleep (The Cinema album)"},{"id":"44794724","text":"Widnoon is an unincorporated community located practically in the center of Madison Township, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, United States.

Because they are both vehemently in denial of their feelings to each other, it takes quite a while for them to get together. When they finally did, however, their happiness is short-lived as it is soon revealed that Yousuke has inherited his late father's demonic blood.: Viento, as he is came to be known in the Demon World, is the heir to the Rafaal Tribe, and holds the power to destroy the Love Angels and what is left of the Angel World. Reine Devila aims to capture him for this very reason, but with Wedding Peach's help, he is able to break free from the evil within him, and through the love they share, they are able to purify the world of all demons, even Reine Devila herself. As requested by Wedding Peach, Yousuke's demonic powers get sealed by Aphrodite, and he restarts his relationship with Momoko as a normal human. In the manga, they marry ten years later along with their friends. ;/ ; : Yanagiba Kazuya is the captain of Hanazono Junior High's captain team, known throughout the school for his good looks, smarts and athleticism, thus capturing the hearts of many female students. Momoko, Yuri and Hinagiku would often resort to crazy means to garner his attention, but he remains blissfully oblivious to almost all of their attempts. For the most part of the series, Yanagiba plays the part of the kind senpai who seems to be way out of the Angels' league, until his true identity is revealed later on. : Limone (which means lemon in Italian) is a powerful Senior Angel sent by Aphrodite to watch over Momoko and the others, granting them assistance whenever he is able. To remain close to them, he takes the form of Yanagiba Kazuya, although in this form, he has no memory of the Love Angels or that he is one himself until later in the season. This is so he could evade the devils' detection. In the manga, he was always aware of the Love Angels' existence and took a different identity only to remain close to them. : A hundred years ago in the Angel World, he and Lily fell in love amid the war between Angels and Demons. Their romance was brief, but it was strong enough to continue into their present lives. In the anime, upon remembering their past relationship, Yanagiba and Yuri (with Momoko and Hinagiku's blessing) continued where they left off, but this again was cut short when Limone sacrificed his life to protect the Human World from a massive attack by a strong devil named Petora. Aphrodite was able to bring him back, but the shock has caused him to lose his memories as Limone and of Yuri, much to the latter's grief. : Near the end of the series, he is able to revert to being Limone, and together with the Angels and Viento, confronted Reine Devila for a final battle. In the aftermath, he expressed a desire to enjoy his life as simply Yanagiba Kazuya, which Aphrodite gladly granted. In the manga, he and Yuri marry ten years later. ; ; : The smartest student at school, constantly placing the top spot on all class rankings, and is also Hinagiku's childhood friend. Desiring to be stronger and more confident, Takuro makes a pact with the demon, Igneous, who takes residence in his heart and controls his body at times. At first he saw it as a burden, but starts to see Igneous as a friend. When Igneous comes to him before he dies and breaks their pact, Takuro tries everything he can to save him, even going to the Love Angels for help. In the anime, he had a crush on Momoko, while in the manga, his constant stalking of Momoko led many to believe he liked her but in fact wanted to impress Hinagiku. In the manga, he later marries Hinagiku. ; : He is a childhood friend of Scarlet back in America. In the manga, he eventually marries Scarlet. He only appears in the manga. His name is a reference to Rhett Butler from the novel, Gone with the Wind.  Main Antagonists  ; ; : The leader of the devil world (her name is French for \\"Queen Devil\\"). Her greatest desire is to destroy all love and subjugate the angel world. In the anime, it is revealed that years ago she ventured into the Angel World and fell in love with an angel at first sight, who later became another angel's husband. With that event, they both unknowingly banished Reine Devila from the Angel World. Ever since, Reine Devila has wanted to kill all those who love. Her backstory and subplot do not exist in the manga; she is simply depicted as a tyrannical ruler. In the anime, she is purified and lives as a normal devil, while in the manga, she is purified and put in a long sleep. It is hoped on waking that she will protect the Devil World the way Aphrodite protects the Angel World. ; ; : The first of Raindevila's primary henchmen to appear in the story. He enacts various schemes to both destroy love and lure out the Love Angels, but eventually is sucked into the vortex of destruction as punishment for countless defeats by Raindevila (in the anime). He is destroyed by the angels in the manga. In the anime, before his demise, he appears to have hints of feelings for Aquelda, protecting her before she was killed, and reaching out to save her when she was caught in the Angel's love wave.Wedding Peach, episode 15 (1995) ; ; : Sandra is the second of Raindevila’s primary henchmen to appear in the story, but only in the anime. He sends out the three devils Blitz, Noise, and Cloud to find the Saint Something Four. As the episodes progress, one by one they are purified, including Sandra’s side devil Donna. In episode 22, Sandra locates and kidnaps Jama-P to lure out the Love Angels, which ultimately backfires and gets him purified by the love wave. ; ; : Igneous is the third of Raindevila's primary henchmen to appear in the story. He is a fire demon from the tribe of Hima. He is a sneaky and manipulative demon who doesn't like to get his hands dirty and usually has his minions fight for him before he goes in for the kill. He makes a pact with Takuro and takes residence in his heart and controls his body. He starts to like peace and quiet and actually sees Takuro as a friend, though he doesn't admit saying he is a member of the fire demon tribe. He is later killed by Potamos. Before he dies he goes to Takuro and releases him from his contract. He then tells Takuro that he actually started to become fond of him. As he passes he looks at the moon and admits that it is beautiful. ;/ ; : The fourth of Raindevila's henchmen to appear in the story. She comes to help Igneous and has a crush on him, but later in the series kills him for turning soft by the love angels and falling for Yousuke. Potamos is later turned good by Wedding Peach and becomes an ordinary school girl. She becomes a love angel in the second special. : In the manga, Potamos tries to take revenge for Igneous but falls in love with Yousuke/Viento because of his devil energy, even calling him \\"V-kun\\". She eventually returns him to his father, but when Yousuke rebels against his father and Uragano attacks, Potamos shields Viento and Peach with her body and sacrifices her life to save him, leading Peach to realize she had truly loved him.  Supporting characters ; ; : A cute and small devil that served as Pluie's sidekick until he was purified by Wedding Peach, and subsequently forced out of the devil realm. Jama-P is often humorously picked on by the Angels (mostly Hinagiku), but sticks around as their closest ally. He becomes a resident to Momoko's house, and pretends to be a stuffed toy when others are around. ; ; : Goddess of love and beauty and ruler of the angel world. She is unable to leave the angel world and must rely on Limone and the Love Angels to ward off the devils. She is the sister of Angel Celeste, Momoko's mother, and considered Momoko's aunt respectively. In Wedding Peach DX, it is revealed after defeating Raindevila that Aphrodite erased the Love Angels, Limone’s, Yousuke’s, and Takuro’s memories of anything to do with angels and devils in order for them to live normal lives again. She then makes the Love Angel's memories known again due to the revolting devils, with the exception of Limone. ;/ ; : Celeste is the sister and guardian of Aphrodite. While fighting against devils with Angels Lily, Daisy and Salvia, she was knocked down to earth, losing her memory. She begins to use the name Sakura. On Earth she falls in love with Hanasaki Shouichirou, a young photographer. They have a child together, named Momoko. Three years later, Limone finds Celeste and restores her memory. Celeste says goodbye to her family and leaves. She vanishes, leaving behind her ring, which is part of the Saint Something Four, the Something Old. She then returns to the angel world to protect it and falls into a deep sleep. : Celeste returns after waking from the energies of the Saint Something Four to tell Momoko of her past. She is given permission by Aphrodite to spend one day on Earth. However, she uses up more energy saving Momoko from a brainwashed Viento, and again falls to sleep. In the final episode after defeating Raindevila, she awakes and returns to a normal family life in the OVA. In Wedding Peach DX, Celeste is aware of Momoko’s former identity as a Love Angel. In episode 4 of the OVA, Celeste helps Momoko and the others get back into their bodies after being switched by the devil Dr. Belphegor. : In the manga, her past differs: she is killed along with Lily, Daisy and Salvia and reincarnated 100 years later. She falls in love with Momoko's father, but remembers her past and returns to the angel world. The barrier she erected, however, prevents her from meeting or contacting her daughter. Momoko initially has doubts about her mother as she traces Celeste's legacy, but her mother finally gets through and sends a brief message that she has faith in her and will be able to meet her if the threat of the devils is removed and the barrier is dissolved. Eventually after the defeat of Raindevila, Momoko and her mother have a tearful reunion. ; ; : Shoichirou is the husband of Sakura and the father of Momoko. He is a professional photographer. He met Sakura after she fell down to Earth and lost her memory. They fell in love and get married. They later have Momoko. Once Sakura regains her memory as Celeste, she leaves to go back to the Angel World, but not before telling Shoichirou to take care of Momoko for her. He has no knowledge about the angels and devils and doesn't know that his wife and daughter are also love angels.

It was first identified in 2014 in a man from Bourbon County, Kansas, United States, who died after being bitten by ticks. The case is the eighth report of human disease associated with a thogotovirus globally, and the first in the Western hemisphere. As of May 2015, a case was discovered in Stillwater, Oklahoma (the patient fully recovered) and relatively little is known about the virus. No specific treatment or vaccine is available. The virus is suspected to be transmitted by ticks or insects, and avoidance of bites is recommended to reduce risk of infection. In June 2017 a 58-year-old female Missouri State Park employee died from an infection of the Bourbon virus after it had been misdiagnosed for a significant period of time.Bernhard, Blyth, \\"Meramec State Park employee dies after catching mysterious tick illness\\", \\"St. Louis Post- Dispatch, 12 July 2017 Discovery The virus was discovered in 2014 by Olga Kosoy, Amy Lambert and colleagues from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Fort Collins, Colorado, in a sample of blood from the case patient. Tests had previously ruled out a wide range of tick-borne diseases including anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. During tests for Heartland virus, a recently discovered Phlebovirus known to be transmitted by ticks, prominent plaques, or areas where the cells were affected by virus infection, were observed on one- cell-thick cultures of African green monkey kidney cells. The plaques did not resemble the effects of Heartland virus, and the researchers hypothesized that they were the work of another virus. Recently developed \\"next-generation\\" sequencing techniques were employed to find novel viral RNA sequences in cell culture supernatants, similar to viruses of the genus Thogotovirus, family Orthomyxoviridae. Lambert, who worked on the sequencing, explained that these \\"state-of-the-art\\" techniques could be used to identify pathogens that older technologies could not detect. Next, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm that this novel virus originated in the patient's blood sample. Finally, examining supernatants from the cell cultures under the electron microscope revealed virus particles of different shapes, including filaments and spheres. The virus was named \\"Bourbon virus\\" for the county in which it originated. Virology Bourbon virus is a type of thogotovirus, which is in the RNA virus family Orthomyxoviridae. The virus particles show different morphologies, including filamentous and roughly spherical forms, and have projections from the surface. The spherical virions have a range of diameters, with broadly 100–130 nm being common. Virus was present at high levels in the extracellular space, with occasional particles being observed in the process of endocytosis. Like other members of the Orthomyxoviridae, the Bourbon virus genome is single-stranded, negative-sense RNA, which is segmented, or divided into a number of separate pieces. It has at least six segments. Bourbon virus is most similar in RNA sequence to Dhori virus and the closely related Batken virus, both members of the genus Thogotovirus, but has diverged substantially from these viruses. Dhori and Batken viruses have only been reported in the Eastern hemisphere. Epidemiology The Bourbon virus was first identified in a previously healthy man aged more than 50 years from Bourbon County, Kansas, United States, who worked as a farmer. He died in June 2014. Dana Hawkinson from the University of Kansas Hospital, where the patient was treated, has speculated that the virus had been previously present undetected. There have been five confirmed cases since 2014. The CDC is developing investigational diagnostic tests for Bourbon virus infection; as of December 2014, CDC and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment were planning to test blood samples from people in Kansas who have recently experienced similar unexplained symptoms. It is unknown whether the virus can infect non-human animals, and studies are ongoing to investigate this. Phylogeny of selected orthomyxoviruses, based on the nucleocapsid protein (scale bar: amino acid substitutions per site) The case patient reported multiple tick bites, including a blood-filled tick in the shoulder area that was observed a few days before the onset of symptoms. Based on the history of the case patient, the virus is considered to be possibly tick-borne, but this has not been proven. Most thogotoviruses are transmitted solely by ticks, but the similar Batken virus has also been isolated from mosquitoes. Studies to establish the prevalence of Bourbon virus in tick and insect populations were planned in December 2014. Signs and symptoms The patient suffered from high fever, headache, decreased appetite, muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a maculopapular rash on the abdomen, chest and back. Late in the course of the illness he experienced shortness of breath, which developed into acute respiratory distress syndrome. He died from multiple organ failure 11 days after the earliest symptoms. Laboratory abnormalities observed included a decrease in the patient's white cell and platelet counts, considered to be caused by bone marrow suppression, and an increase in liver enzyme levels. These symptoms and alterations in blood cells are similar to those seen with tick-borne illnesses including ehrlichiosis and disease caused by the Heartland virus. The degree, if any, to which the Bourbon virus contributed to the individual's illness and death remains unknown as of February 2015, as does whether these symptoms and laboratory abnormalities represent the typical course of infection with Bourbon virus. Hawkinson has speculated that there have been previous undiagnosed cases with milder symptoms from which the infected patients recovered. Thogotoviruses rarely cause disease in humans. The case in Bourbon County is only the eighth report of human disease associated with a thogotovirus globally. Thogoto virus caused disease in two people from Nigeria, one of whom died; Dhori virus caused disease in five laboratory workers infected accidentally. Although another member of the genus Thogotovirus, Aransas Bay virus, has been previously found in seabird-associated ticks in the United States, this is the first reported case of human disease apparently associated with a thogotovirus in the Western hemisphere. Treatment and prevention No routine diagnostic test is yet available. There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine for the virus; supportive therapy is recommended. On the assumption that the virus is transmitted by a tick or insect, the main prevention method recommended is the avoidance of tick and insect bites. In mice models, Favipiravir has been shown to be beneficial both therapeutically and prophylactically.

It is also referred to as the Nobska Study, named for its location on Nobska Point near the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The focus was on the ASW implications of nuclear submarines, particularly on new technologies to defend against them. The study was coordinated by the Committee on Undersea Warfare (CUW) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). It was notable for including 73 representatives from numerous organizations involved in submarine design, submarine-related fields, and weapons design, including senior scientists from the Atomic Energy Commission's nuclear weapons laboratories. Among the participants were Nobel laureate Isidor Rabi, Paul Nitze, and Edward Teller. The study's recommendations influenced all subsequent US Navy submarine designs, as well as submarine-launched ASW tactical nuclear weapons until this weapon type was phased out in the late 1980s. New lightweight (Mark 46) and heavyweight (Mark 48) anti-submarine torpedo programs were approved. Although not on the initial agenda, the Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) was determined to be capable of implementation at this conference. Within five years Polaris would exponentially improve the US Navy's strategic nuclear deterrent capability. Background , the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine (SSN), became operational in 1955. The nuclear submarine could maintain a high speed at deep depths indefinitely, creating a more difficult ASW problem than any previous type of submarine, as was shown in Nautilus first exercises. Within a few years, more exercises would show that other SSNs had difficulty detecting and tracking an attacking SSN in time to launch a counterattack. Future SSNs would be even faster, as the fully streamlined conventional was already demonstrating. It was expected that the Soviet Union would have its own SSN within a few years, as it had produced its own atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb, and advanced conventional submarines only a few years behind their development in other countries. As it turned out, the Soviet Navy was only three years behind the USN with their first nuclear-powered submarine. Various ASW technologies and weapons, including new surface ship and submarine sonars, SOSUS, ASROC, the Mark 45 nuclear torpedo, and \\"Stinger\\" (later SUBROC) were in development. Columbus Iselin II, director of WHOI, suggested to Admiral Burke that an inter-agency study was necessary to determine the best approach in each area, and probably also to improve coordination among the numerous offices pursuing the problem. The study ran from 18 June through 15 September 1956, and the final report was released on 1 December 1956. Key findings The final report explored the ways that oceanography influenced the ASW problem, noted that all Soviet submarine bases required long transits in shallow waters to operating areas, and recommended that active as well as passive sonar be explored for improved implementation. The Mark 45 nuclear torpedo was among the systems recommended for further development, as was \\"Stinger\\" (later SUBROC). The Mark 45 torpedo was the first USN submarine tactical nuclear weapon, entering service in 1959. SUBROC was a submarine- launched short-range ballistic missile that carried a nuclear depth bomb; it was deployed in 1965. ASROC does not appear in summaries of Nobska recommendations; however, it became the primary ASW weapon of USN surface combatants. Although references do not make a direct link, the radical redesign of the internal US Navy SSN arrangement between the Skipjack and Thresher classes is often attributed to Nobska. It was proposed by the Naval Underwater Systems Center the month the Nobska report was published.Friedman submarines, pp. 135-136 This involved placing a large sonar sphere in the bow of a teardrop-hulled, fully streamlined submarine. The sphere allowed three- dimensional sonar operation for greater detection range. To make room for the sphere, the torpedo tubes were relocated to a midships position and angled outboard. The first submarine with this arrangement was the one-off in 1961, followed that same year by . This arrangement has been used by all subsequent US Navy attack submarine classes, and was also adopted for the Ohio-class missile submarines. The foundation of future USN torpedo design was laid at Nobska. One conclusion reached was that fast homing torpedoes were possible. The REsearch TORpedo Configuration (RETORC) program commenced soon after the conference. RETORC I, a lightweight design, resulted in the Mark 46 torpedo, which entered service in 1963. Its heavyweight counterpart, RETORC II, was developed into the Mark 48 torpedo, which entered service in 1971. With modifications, the Mark 46 and Mark 48 remain the standard US Navy torpedoes today.US Navy Torpedo History part 2, retrieved 31 March 2019 Focus on Polaris missile program An important milestone in the Polaris missile program was inadvertently achieved at Nobska. In the course of discussing how a nuclear warhead could be made small enough for the Mark 45 torpedo, Edward Teller of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory started a discussion on the possibility of developing a physically small one-megaton nuclear warhead for the Polaris missile, with Admiral Burke present. His counterpart in the discussion, J. Carson Mark of Los Alamos National Laboratory, at first insisted it could not be done. However, Dr. Mark eventually stated that a half-megaton warhead of small enough size could be developed. This yield, roughly thirty times that of the Hiroshima bomb, was enough for Admiral Burke, and Navy strategic missile development shifted from Jupiter to Polaris by the end of the year. Within five years regular Polaris deterrent patrols were in progress. Recommendations not implemented Nobska recommendations that were not implemented included a small 500-ton SSN (to allow large numbers to be built quickly) and a nuclear-powered destroyer escort (DEN). A small fuel cell-powered submarine, possibly with a reactor to heat the fuel cells, was also considered. However, both the small SSN and the DEN were dependent on leveraging high power-to-weight reactors from the developmental nuclear- powered aircraft program, and these reactors were never successfully developed. Fuel cell technology was insufficiently developed to be practical at the time. A sketch design for the DEN was produced in 1958, with a guided missile variant including the Tartar missile. However, it was eventually decided to generally limit surface combatant nuclear power to nuclear-powered guided missile frigates (DLGN) (redesignated in 1975 as nuclear-powered guided missile cruisers (CGN)).

Draper, a New York Times bestselling author. The cover illustration of the fifth edition is by Daniel Chang, and the cover photography is by Cyril Bruneau/Jupiter Images. A reading group guide is enclosed. The book is recommended for ages 10 and up and for grades 5-8. The story was written in first person, featuring Melody Brooks, a girl with cerebral palsy.  Plot  Melody Brooks is a ten-year-old girl who was born with cerebral palsy. Her parents have done everything they can to help her live a normal life, but life is often frustrating for Melody since she cannot speak, move, nor communicate her wishes. As a result, Melody has to fight to get her wishes. At age five, Melody is even diagnosed as \\"profoundly retarded and idiotic\\" by a doctor who suggests putting Melody in a nursing home. Despite this, Melody's mother enrolls her in Spaulding Street Elementary School to get the education she needs. However, the class she is put in is like a baby class, learning the same things every day, i. e. the alphabet. Melody is frustrated by this, due to having far superior knowledge but cannot speak or write. Her neighbor, Mrs. V., is a kind, but tough woman. She pushes Melody to do the best she can. When Melody was three, Mrs. V. was not impressed by Melody having to rely on her parents for everything. Because of this, Mrs. V. forced her to learn how to crawl and roll on the ground. She even taught Melody how to catch herself whenever she fell from her wheelchair. This helped Melody become self-sufficient, but she continues to be reliant on her parents to help feed her and help her go to the bathroom. When Melody turns eight, her mother becomes pregnant. During this time, Melody overhears them talking about the new baby and their fears that it will suffer the same disabilities, causing her to feel ashamed. However, Melody is happy when the baby, Penny, is born perfectly healthy. Melody feels jealous as Penny grows and matures since she will never be able to do the things Penny can do. However, Melody loves her little sister, and the pleasures Penny brings to the family. When Melody enters fifth grade, she has trouble communicating what she wants to everyone. She eventually learns of and gets a communication device that allows her to talk with other people. At school, her new teacher starts an inclusion program that allows the special needs students to participate in the standard classes. Melody also gets an aide, Catherine, to help her. Melody befriends Rose Spencer but is bullied by Molly and Claire, who believe that her disability makes her dumber than them. Even her teacher, Mr. Dimming, believes that Melody cannot participate, but is surprised that not only does Melody join, but passes a test exam of a trivia competition with a perfect score. She then participates in the qualifying exam to be part of the trivia competition and once again, surprises everyone when she makes the team. Eventually, Melody helps the team win the qualifying competition to earn a trip to Washington D.C. for the national competition. However, on the day the group is to fly to Washington, Melody learns that her flight has been canceled due to weather, but that the rest of the team has made an earlier flight without her. The following day Melody insists on going to school, despite the fact that her mother is sick, tired, and frustrated. However, when Melody kicks, hits, and screams to warn her mother that Penny has slipped out of the house and is in the path of the car, her mother fails to understand, resulting in Penny being hit and injured. Melody feels guilty for not being able to warn her mother but learns that Penny will recover. On Monday, Melody's class apologizes for their lack of consideration towards her by giving her the ninth place trophy, hoping to reconcile with her. However, Melody forgives and laughs at them, destroys the trophy by accident, and heads out of the room. The next day, she and Catherine begin work on her autobiography, which begins with the first few lines of the book. Cover The cover shows a goldfish jumping out of a bowl. This cover represents Melody going out of her mind when being stuck in her head so long. The goldfish represents Melody, and the bowl symbolizes her mind. There is also a scene in the book where Melody watches her pet goldfish jump out of the goldfish bowl to freedom. The cover of the book is both literal and a metaphor for how Melody feels trapped in her mind.

Out of My Mind has received reviews from The Denver Post, The Columbus Dispatch, Publishers Weekly, Children's Literature, Washington Post, The Horn Book, and The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books. The novel received starred reviews from School Library Journal, Booklist, and Kirkus Reviews. Kirkus Reviews praised the book was \\"rich in detail of both the essential normalcy and the difficulties of a young person with cerebral palsy\\", and \\"descriptions of both Melody’s challenges—“Going to the bathroom at school just plain sucks”—and the insensitivities of some are unflinching and realistic\\". Publishers Weekly criticized that there was a \\"lack of tension in the plot\\", although it was \\"resolved halfway through\\". Booklist stated that Out of My Mind is \\"a book that defies age categorization, an easy enough read for upper-elementary students yet also a story that will enlighten and resonate with teens and adults\\". The Bulletin said the novel \\"[Will make] students think twice about their classmates, acquaintances, and siblings with special needs\\". The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) stated \\"Draper challenges those who read her story to become activists for those who are different\\". The Denver Post powerfully concluded: \\"if there's only one book teens and parents (and everyone else) can read this year, Out of My Mind should be it.\\" VOYA Magazine praised \\"Melody's triumphs and setbacks as she strives to become a socially accepted classmate and team member are vividly described in this inspirational novel, which will appeal not only to middle school readers but also to anyone who wonders what might be going on in the minds of individuals with severe physical handicaps\\". The Horn Book exclaimed that the novel is \\"a powerfully eye-opening book with both an unforgettable protagonist and a dume cast of fully realized, complicated background characters\\". Children's Literature said \\"this is a genuinely moving novel\\". The Washington Post commented \\"author Sharon Draper creates an authentic character who insists, through her lively voice and indomitable will, that the reader become fully involved with the girl in the pink wheelchair\\".

It was built from 1885 to 1886. It is also known as Breakfast Creek Joss House and Sarm Sung Goon. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Temple, 1886 The Temple of the Holy Triad was constructed in 1885-1886 for the Cantonese Chinese community of Brisbane. In the 1880s sizeable numbers of Cantonese settled in Brisbane. They were most conspicuous in small businesses (particularly in Fortitude Valley and along Albert Street), and in market gardening (especially on the flats around Breakfast Creek and Eagle Farm). By 1888 Brisbane depended almost entirely on the Chinese for its supply of fresh vegetables. Construction of the temple was an attempt by the leaders of Brisbane's five Cantonese clans to provide their people with a community focus. The elaborate triple roof was imported from China by Quong Nam Tai & Co, Brisbane's most prominent Chinese trading firm, and the building was erected by Chinese artisans. The temple was opened on 21 January 1886, and remained the focus of Chinese community activity in Brisbane for nearly sixty years. This was followed by a period of declining interest and neglect until the formation in 1965 of the Chinese Temple Society. The society undertook work on the temple and it was re-opened in June 1966. It today offers a focus for various Chinese communities. In the second half of the nineteenth century Chinese immigrants erected temples on most of the principal Queensland goldfields and ports. Only three temples survive in Queensland from this period: the Breakfast Creek temple, the small Chun Lo Goon temple at Rockhampton, and the Hou Wang Temple at Atherton. The latter is smaller than the Breakfast Creek temple and is constructed of local materials.  Description  Entrance to the temple, 2014 The temple is a rectangular, rendered brick structure with a complex triple roof of Chinese terracotta tiles. A feature of this roof is the elaborate ceramic ornamentation, incorporating Chinese historical and mythological characters, on the ridges and bargeboards. left The interior comprises three sections: an entrance, a sky-lit middle section, and the temple proper with its carved altar and figures of the gods of wealth, medicine and knowledge. Internal decoration is elaborate, and includes exposed carved and gilded timber supports, and furnishings such as silks, embroideries, lanterns and lamps. In the 1965-1966 restoration, the middle roof section, which had been removed, was repositioned. Much of the original interior decoration, which had been either salvaged or vandalised, was replaced. The temple survives in a back street sandwiched between the Breakfast Creek Hotel, Albion Park Racecourse and light industrial development, with the former vista across Breakfast Creek lost. A plain concrete block building has been constructed adjacent to the temple, and the grounds have been concreted and enclosed with a brick fence and gateway.  Heritage listing  Garden, 2014 The Holy Triad Temple was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Temple of the Holy Triad is significant as evidence of the development of Chinese settlement in nineteenth century Brisbane.

It was designed by Department of Public Works and built from 1925 to 1927. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 February 2003.  History  The former Albion Fire Station is a substantial two-storey red brick building standing prominently on Bridge Street (now in Wooloowin but formerly in Albion). It was officially opened on Monday 17 January 1927 when the Home Secretary James Stopford pulled a rope which automatically swung the doors open, rang the alarm and roused the firemen to action, and the two fire engines raced out of the station. The guests were very impressed at the demonstration of the speed with which the station could respond to an emergency. Designed by the Department of Public Works, the building was the major and coordinating fire station for the Brisbane northside area. Its sister station at South Brisbane (corner Main and Vulture Streets, Woolloongabba), opened in September 1927 and also designed by the Department of Public Works, was the major and coordinating fire station for Brisbane southside area. Prior to this, the only other substantial brick fire station buildings were the two buildings constructed as Brisbane Fire Brigade Headquarters – firstly to the corner Ann and Edward Streets (architect Henry Wallace Atkinson, 1890) which was replaced by a new building further north in Ann Street (architect Henry Wallace Atkinson and Charles McLay, 1908). Generally fire stations were small timber buildings, often only sheds or garages. The former Albion Fire Station is the only survivor from this group of substantial brick buildings. The first Brisbane Headquarters was demolished in 1951 and the second in the mid-1980s to make way for Cathedral Square. The South Brisbane Fire Station was decommissioned in 1971 and demolished in the mid-1980s. From 1860 a number of attempts were made to establish a fire brigade for Brisbane but it was not until 1889 that a permanent fire brigade was established. To cope with the fire fighting needs of the expanding city, The Fire Brigades Act Amendment Act of 1902 allowed local authorities to establish independent boards and brigades. Brigades were formed in Hamilton (1917), Windsor (1917), Ithaca (1918), Toowong (1918), Taringa (1919), Wynnum (1921) and Sandgate (1923). These were voluntary bodies with only the superintendent and immediate assistants receiving a salary. The Fire Brigades Act of 1920 rationalised the network of fire brigades in Brisbane city and suburbs, centralising control under the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board in 1921. The former Albion Fire Station replaced the Windsor Fire Station which was established under The Fire Brigades Act Amendment Act of 1902 in 1917 and located on land that is now an extension of Truro Street, Windsor. Following the amalgamation of fire brigades in 1921, the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board purchased the Bridge Street site for a new Windsor Fire Station. When constructed it became known as the Albion Fire Station and remained in operation until 1961 when it was replaced by a new Windsor Fire Station to the corner of Fosbery and Truro Streets, Windsor. The costs of the construction of the fire stations at Albion and South Brisbane was unable to be funded by the Queensland Treasury and a loan from the Commonwealth Bank was negotiated. The loan for over 25 years was covered by debentures bearing interest at 6% government guaranteed. The Albion Fire Station was the smaller station and cost . The original drawings for the former Albion Fire Station have not been located, but the annual report for the Department of Public Works (year ended 1926) recorded that the building was to be constructed of brick and concrete and accommodate the brigade facilities on the ground floor. These facilities included garage space for two fire engines with a repair shop and pit at the rear and an access yard at the back. There was a rest room or dormitory for nine persons and a billiard room taking a full-sized table. Other rooms on the ground floor included a mess room, kitchen, pantry, locker room, watch room, battery room, equipment store and district officer's room with private bathroom and lavatory. A flat concrete roof was to cover the whole building and accommodate laundries. A later drawing (1960) shows two flats (one to the north, one to the south) for brigade officers occupied the upper storey. Each flat had an entrance porch at ground level, internal access to the ground floor station and provided front and side verandahs, kitchen, pantry, bathroom, living room and bedrooms. In 2003, the ground floor accommodated the office of an architectural firm and the upper floor was occupied by the Queensland Family History Society. The fabric of the building has been altered to accommodate these uses but the earlier arrangement of spaces as a fire station can be clearly read and appreciated. In 2014, Neylan Architecture occupies the building.  Description  Rear and side view, 2013 A substantial two-storey red and orange face brick building, the former Albion Fire Station stands in a suburban garden setting south of the corner of Bridge and Merehaye Streets, Albion overlooking the Brisbane-Sandgate railway line and directly opposite the road overbridge connecting Hudson Road and Bridge Street. The main elevation faces east onto Bridge Street and is symmetrical about a recessed parapeted central bay that contains two large arched entrances to the ground floor distinguished by decorative surrounds and infilled with glazing and two deep open porches to the upper level. A plain cream stepped cornice runs around the top of the east, north and south elevations. The central parapet contains the words \\"ALBION FIRE STATION\\". The flanking projecting bays are defined by rusticated pilasters to the corners and accommodate a bay of casement windows with fanlights to each of the ground and upper levels. The ground floor window surrounds are distinguished by decorative brickwork matching the main entrance surrounds. The sills to the upper windows are painted cream. A low brick wall to the south accommodates an arched gated entrance to the side entrance to the south side of the upper level. The words \\"Albion Lodge\\" are lettered above the gate. A timber fence post stands south of the brick wall. The base of a brick wall stands to the north side of the building. A foundation stone recording the dedication of the building is set into the plinth of the south bay of the main elevation. Under the inscription \\"READY AYE READY\\" it is recorded that the stone was laid on 1 December 1925 by the Chairman of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Board and lists members of the board. The asymmetrical south elevation contains three bays of casement windows and a loggia to the ground floor and a verandah enclosed with casement and louvre windows to the upper level. The lintels of the windows are picked out in cream. The pillared loggia is reached by a flight of wide concrete steps from the garden and forms the main entrance to the south side of the upper level. The north elevation has a plain porch entrance approximately half way along the building. The porch has been enclosed with sheeting and louvres. The bays of windows to the north and west at the northwest corner are sheltered by plain timber framed hoods. The rear elevation contains a set of central bifold doors to the ground floor and a flight of timber stairs rises to a timber landing accessing the rear of the upper level. The main entrance to the ground floor opens into a large central space which continues through a narrowed corridor to the rear timber bi-fold doors. Discrete rooms to the sides and rear open off the central space. Two large rectangular rooms occupy the northwest and southwest corners and are lit by banks of casement windows to each side of the room. The south side contains a stairwell and a large meeting room with a small store room. The north side contains a stairwell and two smaller interconnected rooms with a store room and toilet beyond. A tea room and toilet occupy the rear to the north of the narrow corridor space. The interior walls are painted and plastered masonry and the ceilings are rendered with a textured finish. The side rooms are a step above the central space. Doors to each side of the central space open to the stairwells that rise to the upper level. The rear toilet contains an intact early urinal. Stairwells to the north and south arrive at the upper level that is a mirror image of spaces about a central dividing wall running east-west. In each half the rooms work off a central corridor. This main dividing wall is cut through at its east and west ends to provide access between the two halves of the floor. In each half, the outer corner rooms open to the enclosed verandahs that run the length of the north and south sides; a large central room to the east opens onto the open porch and the central room to the west is partitioned into a number of small spaces and opens out to the rear landing. The deep open porches to the centre of the east side offer a prospect over the railway line to the suburb of Albion beyond. Tilting fanlights to the central north-south partition facilitate ventilation through the rooms. Throughout the walls and ceilings are painted and plastered masonry. Each stairwell is lit by a large window and contains a flight of timber stairs with a substantial timber handrail and decorative metal balustrade. The verandah roofs are clad with terracotta tiles and the main hipped roof is clad with corrugated metal sheeting. The building is set in a suburban yard with grassed and treed areas to the south and west. A timber shed with gable roof stands in the centre of the backyard to the west of the building. A freestanding brick chimney stands south of the shed. Narrow concrete paths run along the north and south sides of the building. There are flights of concrete stairs at each end of the north path. A chain wire fence runs along the south boundary and a timber fence runs along the west boundary. The north and east boundaries are not fenced. The adjacent property to the corner of Merehaye and Bridge Streets accommodates a dirt carpark used by the tenants of the building. Shaded by luxurious mature mango trees, the carpark provides a lush garden setting for the building and affords opportunities for views of the former fire station building.

Craigsville is an unincorporated community in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, United States. The community is west-northwest of Kittanning. History In 1793, William Stephenson and Aaron Wor (from whose name nearby Worthington may have been derived) settled a tract of land just north of the forks of Big and Little Buffalo Creeks. John Craig was the holder of the tract, and in 1805 his son Samuel established a fulling mill on the banks of Buffalo creek. In 1814 he erected a carding roll. In 1835, partnering with his brother John and a man named Robert Cooper, he began to manufacture flannels, blankets and woolen goods. In 1843, the building was burned but was rebuilt soon after. In 1856, the firm consisted of the Craigs and William F. Rumberger, under the firm name of Craig and Rumberger. Until 1843 the town was known as Craigtown, and it became known afterwards as Craigsville. The first child born within its limits was born March 30, 1809. The flouring mill, which was later a part of the woolen mill plant, about thirteen rods below the woolen factory, on the right bank of the creek, was erected by John Craig, Jr., Joseph T. McCurdy and Samuel S. Wallace, early in 1849, and was a three- story frame structure. In 1871, John Craig died suddenly soon after breakfast one morning from neuralgia of the heart. His heirs conveyed the undivided two- thirds of the mill property to McCurdy and Joseph Minteer, May 14, 1872, for $2,000. The flouring mill was closed in 1905 and the building was taken over by the woolen mill to allow for necessary expansion. The Craigsville post office was established here on November 23, 1869, with William F. Rumberger, post master. The new schoolhouse, in lieu of No. 14 before the division of Franklin township, is situated on the public road on the lower or right-hand side of the creek about 100 rods below the grist mill. The first separate assessment of Craigsville was made in 1876 and gave 25 taxables: one physician, three clerks, one boss carder, two boss weavers, one laborer, one helper, one dyer, one wool sorter, one picker, two teamsters, one spinner, one blacksmith, one wagonmaker, one miller, and one weaver. A store was opened near the mills in 1860 by Samuel S. Wallace, John C. Wallace, and John Craig, afterward being sold in 1872 to Christopher Leard & Sons. Later it was owned by J. W. Minteer, who also was postmaster. The post office was established there in 1869 with W. F. Rumberger as the first official in charge. In 1884 the Craigsville United Methodist Church was constructed on the present site. Rev. Donovan Daniels is the present minister, and the church has approximately 30 members. The Craigsville Elementary School was also erected around this time. The village in 1913 had a population of two hundred eighty, most of whom were dependent on the woolen mills for employment, and consisted of thirty- five houses, a school, a church, and two stores. In 1913 the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad (later the Baltimore and Ohio) extended their tracks two miles, almost parallel with Big Buffalo Creek, where the Pittsburgh Limestone Corporation, a subsidiary of the U.S. Steel Corporation, opened a large limestone mine. The capacity of this mine was approximately fifteen hundred tons, later increased to approximately thirty-five hundred tons daily. The major portion of their product went to the blast furnaces in the Pittsburgh district and the remainder generally was used for the manufacture of cement and stone for highway construction. Graff-Kittanning Clay Products Company was incorporated in 1924, and construction was begun at the Craigsville site in that year. In 1925 production was started and has continued without interruption until the present date. In 1945 the Worthington Ceramics Division was acquired as a totally-owned subsidiary and was put into production shortly thereafter. In 1958, the Logan Clay Products Company of Logan, Ohio, purchased the Graff Kittanning Clay Products Company, and from that date on it was known as the Graff-Kittanning Division of the Logan Clay Products Company. R. M. Graff was president of Graff-Kittanning from the time of its incorporation until it was purchased by the Logan Clay Products Company. He was also General Manager of the operations from 1924 until his death in 1963. The following products are manufactured at the Craigsville plant: vitrified clay sewer pipe, clay flue liners, wall coping, and factory made joints. At the Worthington Ceramics Plant, clay building tile, drain tile, and flue lining are manufactured. A total of approximately two hundred people were employed at both operations, approximately one hundred fifty at the Graff-Kittanning Plant and fifty at Worthington Ceramics Plant. The products manufactured in both plants was distributed in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. On April 23, 1990, a train carrying a caustic chemical and crude oil derailed and exploded, spewing about 100,000 gallons of oil and releasing a chemical cloud that forced 200 people to evacuate. 29 cars in a 97-car Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad freight train jumped the tracks in a steep ravine along Buffalo Creek. At the fire's peak, flames shooting several hundred feet high could be seen 30 miles away. In addition to the oil, one tanker leaked sodium hydroxide that sent a chemical cloud drifting toward Worthington, causing 200 people to be moved from their homes overnight. Ironically, the event occurred on Earth Day. Today, Craigsville is part of Worthington-West Franklin Township. Nearly everything has shut down, but the United Methodist Church is still active, and Allegheny Mineral Corporation operates a limestone mine at the site of the old Graff-Kittanning Clay Products Company. Craigsville P.O. appears in the 1876 Atlas of Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.

History XHUDG-FM began to transmit officially on May 30, 1974, created to bridge the gap between the academic community and the residents of Jalisco. However, the history of the station dates to an experimental transmission mounted in 1963 under the callsign XEIITG by UDG's engineering school. From the late 1960s, attempts were made to win a permit and actually launch a full-time radio station, a permit conceded by presidential decree in 1973.XHUDG-FM History The first transmitter, donated by then-President Luis Echeverria, was put into place, and the station came on air from the engineering school, broadcasting 13 hours a day. XHUDG-FM moved to the Cultural and Administrative Building in 1983. The transmitters in the rest of the state were all built in the early 2010s. At the same time, a permit discontinuity prompted the UDG to receive a new permit for its Guadalajara flagship, which became XHUDG-FM. Programming Programming on XHUDG-FM and its transmitter network is widely varied. Music takes up most of the stations' broadcast day, and on the retransmitters, much of it is locally produced. News programming, known as Señal Informativa, primarily comes from Guadalajara with each transmitter producing its own additional local broadcasts. Señal Informativa was extended to TV with the launch of XHUDG television in 2011.

Etymology The word pumasi () is a combination of the words pum which means working, and asi which means repayment. Principles Pumasi consisted in working together for the benefit of the community, without taking account of the value of each person's labor contribution. Thus the labor of humans and cattle, male and female, adults and children were equally valued. Participation was voluntary. The work was guided by the benefit accruing to the community as a whole. The practice presupposed a high level of trust among members of the community. Participants Pumasi was mainly practised in small village communities. It occurred particularly among farmers who grew the same crops, cultivated a similar acreage, were related or knew each other's family history. In these situations the required mutual trust was most likely to emerge. Pumasi was sometimes practised by groups of women and sometimes by groups of both sexes. Tasks Pumasi could be involved in any type of farm work throughout the year. It had a very important role in cultivating rice paddy and most other crops. It also included the work of women in preparing food for big events or making clothes for sale. An example was the large-scale annual preparation of kimchi, a preserved foodstuff. Comparison with dure A different form of cooperative labor was known as dure or saegyung. Dure was limited to adult able-bodied men, and their participation was mandatory. Dure was organized mainly at rice planting time - the busiest time in the farming year. In contrast, pumasi typically involved small groups of villagers with a personal acquaintance; it could be used for any type of work required by the farmers, and could be organized at any time, whenever an individual household - typically a tenant farmer and one or more farmhands - encountered a labor shortage. History Pumasi is the oldest collective laboring custom in Korea. It arose in early class society at the time when the monogamous family became the economic unit of society. A monogamous household would need to call on the labor of other family members in order to solve any shortage of labor it might experience. Pumasi today As Korea became more industrialized, the prevalence of generalized wage labor decreased among the agricultural population. Until recently, pumasi still took place to some extent in rural communities, but that aspect has changed greatly. Modernization in rural communities, such as the spread of chemical and mechanical aids to farming, has encouraged the assumption that every activity is done in exchange for cash. So, the concept of equality for workers that forms the basis of pumasi is vanishing, and the value of each worker's labor is calculated and accounted for separately. However, the remnants of pumasi can still be found in the custom of helping each other on the occasion of weddings or funerals.

Life Early years Knobloch was born in Dresden, the son of a photographer. When his father became unemployed the family moved to Berlin in 1935. He started a commercial training with a publishing business in 1942, but in 1943 he was conscripted into the army and was sent as a soldier to France. Army life He deserted from the army near St. Lo in July 1944, shortly after the Normandy landings of the anti-German coalition armies. Knobloch spent the next four or so years as a Prisoner of War in the US and in Scotland. In the USA he gained hands-on experience in Alabama of the agricultural business (maize, sugar cane, ground-nuts/pea-nuts, tomatoes, cotton), in Pennsylvania, of industrial work, and in Virginia of timber logging and garbage disposal. As a result of his transfer to Scotland in 1946 he was able to add road construction, fertiliser production, sheep wool processing and seed research to his list of experiences, and he also undertook a language course, receiving a \\"cum laude\\" (with distinction) diploma in English. Back to Berlin He was able to return to Berlin in February 1948. In 1948 he volunteered to work for the Berliner Zeitung and became a script editor for a press picture publisher. In 1949 he joined the new country's recently created ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands), and in 1953 he co-founded and joined East German's new mass-circulation Wochenpost (newspaper), taking responsibility for \\"puzzles, mental recreation and humour\\" (\\"Rätsel, Denksport und Humor\\"). Work on the Wochenpost quickly became a principal vehicle for Knobloch's professional success over more than three decades. He served as its Culture Editor from 1957 till 1965, and between 1968 and 1988 contributed a weekly Feuilleton-format opinion column. Between 1954 and 1960 he undertook a correspondence course in Journalism with the Karl Marx University (as it was then known) in Leipzig, ending up with a Diploma in Journalism. In 1962 he became a member of the (East) German Writers' Association. Heinz Knobloch: Some published works Books * Ein gewisser Reginald Hinz. Eulenspiegel-Verlag 1963 * Pardon für Bütten.

Personal In 1953 Heinz Knobloch married Helga Leutloff, then aged 24. The marriage produced a daughter and a son born respectively in 1957 and 1965. Knobloch died on 24 July 2003 in Pankow (Berlin), but the wish he had originally published in his book \\"Alte und neue Berliner Grabsteine\\" (\\"Berlin gravestones, old and new) was respected, and his body was taken back to his birth city of Dresden for burial. After his death in 2003 the \\"Freundeskreis Heinz Knobloch\\" (\\"Heinz Knobloch Circle of Friends\\") was created, in order to take care of his legacy and honour his works. Writing Above all Heinz Knobloch was known in Germany, for his Feuilletons, rediscovering and making his own a half-remembered journalistic genre which had become popular in France the early nineteenth century. The flexibility of the feuilleton form makes it hard to define succinctly, but the principal ingredients of Knoblich's feuilletons are nevertheless familiar enough to English speaking readers. Over four decades he contributed more than 1,600 of these insightful sometimes whimsical and relatively compact opinion pieces, often triggered by some passing personal experience. Most of them appeared between 1958 and 1978 in the weekly newspaper Wochenpost under the by-line \\"Mit beiden Augen\\" (\\"With both eyes [open]\\"). The newspaper had a circulation which for much of the time exceeded 1.3 million giving rise to a very large readership for Knobloch's column, and indicating that he was able to soften any implicit criticisms of the single-party state and its plethora of agencies with sufficient charm and subtlety to remain \\"within the lines\\" of official sensitivities. The feuilletons that appeared in Wochenpost were illustrated by the graphic artist and illustrator Wolfgang Würfel, and were subsequently reproduced in a succession of collected volumes which comprise the majority of the books published under Knobloch's name. At the same time as making a living with his pen by writing modern feuilletons, Knobloch researched and found new admirers for hitherto largely forgotten nineteenth and early twentieth century users of the genre in Berlin such as Julius Rodenberg and Victor Auburtin. He also produced intensively researched, accurately presented and illuminating biographies of other individuals from German history many of whom had disappeared from the historical mainstream during the turbulent middle decades of the twentieth century. His book \\"Herr Moses in Berlin\\" (\\"Mr Moses in Berlin\\") portrays the eighteenth century Berlin philosopher (and composer's grandfather) Moses Mendelssohn. In \\"Meine liebste Mathilde\\" (\\"My dearest Matilda\\") Knobloch tells of Mathilde Jacob, Rosa Luxemburg's the longstanding secretary and confidante/companion of who had met her death in a concentration camp.(There was little risk of citizens in Communist East Germany being allowed to forget about the Communist pioneer, Rosa Luxembourg, herself.) These books were popular not withstanding the description of Knobloch by one critic as a \\"Hobby-Historiker\\" (\\"Hobby Historian\\"). Beyond simple biography, \\"Der beherzte Reviervorsteher\\" (\\"The Courageous District Overseer\\") recounted the story of the synagogue burning thwarted in Berlin's Oranienburger Straße \\"Oranienburg Street\\" during the Kristallnacht pogroms of November 1938 as a result of the courage of a police officer called Wilhelm Krützfeld. \\"Der arme Epstein\\" (\\"For poor [Sally] Epstein\\") shed light on the death of Horst Wessel, a man whose name would have been known to every German of Knobloch's generation thanks to the Horst Wessel song which the government had designated a parallel national anthem in Germany during the Nazi years. Awards and honours (not a complete list) * 1963: Literature Prize of the Free German Trade Union Federation * 1965: Heinrich Heine Prize from the Culture Ministry * 1979: Goethe Prize from the City of Berlin * 1980: Louis Fürnberg Prize * 1986: Lion-Feuchtwanger Prize * 1986: National Prize of East Germany * 1994: Moses Mendelssohn Prize from the Berlin Senate * 1998: Order of Merit of Berlin On 3 March 2005 the piece of green space in front of the row of houses which for many years had included Knobloch's home was renamed \\"Heinz-Knobloch- Platz\\". More recently, on 24 July 2013, a memorial tablet was placed on the outside of his former home in Berlin-Pankow.

History Admiral Senyavin of the Second Archipelago Expedition in 1807, occupy the island There was a castle in the island before the 14th century, of undocumented construction and date: it was possibly built by the Phoenicians, Romans or Venetians. However, the castle was demolished after the War of Chioggia between Venice and Genoa on the advice of the Pope. When Mehmet II of the Ottoman Empire conquered the island in 1455 he rebuilt the castle. In July 1656, during the Cretan War, a Venice fleet commanded by Giacomo Loredano captured the castle. But Ottomans under Köprülü Mehmet Pasha recaptured the castle in August 1657.Niclolae Jorga: Geschiste des Osmanichen, ( trans.

It was active from 1959 to mid 2000 when it was disestablished. Formerly it was named Northern Command from 1946 to 1959.  History  Origins Union Defence Force Military Districts The command's origins may date to the formations of Military districts, No 5 and 6 in 1926, which then became Transvaal Command in 1934. Thereafter there were several quick name changes: Roberts Heights & Transvaal Command ; Voortrekkerhoogte & Transvaal Command 1939, and then Transvaal Command . Later the command became Northern Command in 1946; Northern Transvaal Command in 1959. In 1939 Roberts' Heights and Transvaal Command, with its headquarters at Roberts' Heights (now Thaba Tshwane), contained 6th Infantry Brigade, 1 Field Survey Squadron SAEC, the artillery depot, parts of the Special Service Battalion, elements of the Permanent Garrison Artillery, and the Artillery School.Niehorster Its headquarters was in Pretoria, and within its command boundaries, it contained a number of important Active Citizen Force field formations, notably 81 Armoured Brigade (part of 8th South African Armoured Division). Depending upon the command boundaries, it may also have included 72 Motorised Brigade with its headquarters at Johannesburg and 73 Motorised Brigade with its headquarters in the Johannesburg suburb of Kensington. SADF era Northern Transvaal Command insignia Under the SADF In the early 1980s it became clear that the sheer size of Northern Transvaal Command's territory made command and control as well as logistical functions extremely difficult. These as well as other security considerations led to the decision to subdivide Northern Transvaal Command into three Commands in 1984: Northern Transvaal Command (Pretoria); Eastern Transvaal Command, probably covering what later became the Eastern Transvaal (Nelspruit); and Far North Command (Pietersburg) (commanded in succession by Charles Lloyd and, from February 1987, Georg Meiring).Hamann, 'Days of the Generals,' p.62, for Meiring assumption-of- command date. For a contemporary view on Far North Command, see discussion in James Roherty, 'State Security in South Africa: Civil-Military Relations Under P.W. Botha,' 1992, 98-100. The two new Commands were regarded as theatres and as such also had responsibility for conventional operations (and units) within their areas. For example, Far North Command had 73 Motorised Brigade within its area.

Mesir paste was first produced as a medicine during the Ottoman period, but later became an important part of local festivities in the city of Manisa. Earlier versions of Mesir macunu were not sweet, but rather spicy in flavor. Macun is a sweet Turkish confectionery toffee paste that originated from spicy preparations of Mesir macunu. History According to the story about the origins of Mesir paste; Ayşe Hafsa Sultan, who became the wife of Yavuz Sultan Selim and the mother of Suleyman the Magnificent after her placement from Crimea to the Ottoman Harem in the 16th century, became very ill after the death of her husband. Unfortunately doctors couldn't find a cure thus Sultan Suleyman consulted Merkez Muslihiddin Efendi, the head of the theological school belonging to the Yavuz Selim Mosque. He was already making medicines using herbs and spices for the sick people and built a small sort of hospital next to the school. After receiving Suleyman's letter regarding his ill mother, he mixed 41 different types of plants and spices together to form a medicinal paste and sent it to the palace. When Hafsa Sultan ate this paste, she was recovered and wanted to share this miraculous medicine with others. As requests from the people increased, the Sultan told Merkez Efendi to distribute the paste to the people every year in a form of festivity. For this, 22 March was selected because it symbolized the beginning of Spring, and the tops of the Sultan Mosque's domes and minarets were chosen for its location. The Mesir Celebration began this way in around 1527–28. Since then, every year on or around March 21, which is known as Spring festival Newroz, thousands of people gather in front of the Sultan Mosque to catch the Mesir Paste wrapped in paper and thrown from mosques rooftop. In 2009, due to the local municipality elections throughout the country, 469th Mesir Macun international Festival was postponed and held on April 26th. Meanwhile, in 2010 the 470th edition was held between March 21 – 28.

In home medical care is often and more accurately referred to as home health care or formal care. Often, the term home health care is used to distinguish it from non-medical care, custodial care, or private-duty care which is care that is provided by persons who are not nurses, doctors, or other licensed medical personnel. Home care providers Home care is purchased by the service user directly from independent home care agencies or as part of the statutory responsibility of social services departments of local authorities who either provide care by their own employees or commission services from independent agencies. Care can also be purchased directly from independent carers or via care platforms. Care is usually provided once or twice a day with the aim of keeping frail or disabled people healthy and independent though can extend to full-time help by a live-in nurse or professional carer.

It is also known as De Causis Proprietatum Elementorum, De Proprietatibus Elementorum et Planetarum or simply De Elementis. It was probably written in the ninth or tenth century. The author of the work claimed to be Aristotle, but eventually it was determined that it was an original work by an Arab author. Consequently, the work is now attributed to a Pseudo-Aristotle.  History  The work did not have a lasting impact on science in the medieval Islamic world, but it became important in Europe after it was translated to Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the twelfth century. By the thirteenth century, it had become one of the three main sources for medieval knowledge on geology, together with Aristotle's Meteorology and Avicenna's De Mineralibus. These three treatises were an important influence on the study of geology by Albertus Magnus. When scholars started to recognize during the Renaissance that De Proprietatibus Elementorum was not written by Aristotle, it was removed from the academic curriculum.  Content  In his work Meteorology, Aristotle explained that the earth as an element was cold and dry. He did not cover phenomena related to terrestrial heat. De Proprietatibus Elementorum filled this lacuna with its inquiry on volcanoes and hot springs. According to the work large quantities of sulfur in the interior of a mountain caused volcanic eruptions. Winds and waters present at the foot of the mountain could set fire to this sulfur, particularly in the case of Mount Etna. Its explanation of hot springs seems to have been taken by an unknown work from Theophrastus. Theophrastus or the pseudo-Aristotle first dismisses several explanations provided by Democritus, Mileus and Rentifolus, the latter two possibly Thales and Xenophanes. The opinion of the author follows, that water gets heated by beds of sulfur before it emerges on the surface. Naphtha is associated with this process, because together with sulfur it forms a kind of burner to transport fuel to the fire.

All human portions of the missions would be conducted from lighter-than-air craft or from orbit. Background Venus is a planet with a runaway greenhouse effect, with surface temperatures and pressure of and respectively. Conventional rocket engines will not work at those pressures. Hence, human missions to Venus have historically been thought impractical, if not impossible. However, Venus has advantages for crewed travel, such as being closer than Mars, an Earth-like gravity (.904 g) and an atmosphere that provides a level of protection from solar and interstellar radiation. Whereas all ground missions measured their operational time in minutes or hours, the Soviet Vega missions found success in launching small balloons, that operated until their batteries were exhausted (days). At altitude, the atmosphere of Venus is and (the equivalent pressure at an elevation of about on Earth). However, due to the large amount of , the density for a given pressure is greater than in Earth's atmosphere. Therefore breathable air acts as a buoyant gas. At the same time, the gravity at the proposed altitude is 8.73 m/s2 versus 9.81 m/s2 on Earth's surface. Venus has an induced magnetosphere from the interaction of its thick atmosphere with the solar wind, and its nearer proximity to the Sun brings it further within the Sun's magnetic field, which decreases the interstellar radiation levels. With the addition of the reduced deep space exposure time, the radiation levels anticipated by astronauts are much less than an equivalent Mars mission.; draft version of the full paper available at NASA Technical Reports Server (accessed 16 May 2012) Mission concepts Suggested specifications for the robotic airship Slide detailing sequence of events for the crewed descent Phase 1 Phase 1 involves a robotic exploration via a long airship. It would be used to test many of the technologies that would be used in the crewed version, including the dirigible, energy systems, and aerocapture and descent sled. Phase 2 Phase 2 is for astronauts to orbit Venus. The individual components would be assembled remotely, and the crew would join the larger assembly when all the preparations are complete. There would be a return module sent to low Venus orbit ahead of the astronauts, with which they would rendezvous in Venusian orbit, before returning to Earth. Phase 3 Phase 3 involves descending into the atmosphere. The aeroshell would be used for heat dissipation. A parachute would be deployed to further slow the craft, before finally inflating the airship. Once inflated, the crew would live in the airship for a period equivalent to thirty Earth days, before detaching and ascending in the Venus Ascent Vehicle.

History The Gallery was established in 1957 by Dutch artists Kees (Cornelis) Hos (born 1916, The Hague, Netherlands - died 3 December 2015), a printmaker and painter, and his wife, weaver Tina (Albertine) Hos (died 1976), who emigrated to New Zealand from the Netherlands in 1956. Kees and Tina Hos originally opened the New Vision Craft Centre in Takapuna with the aim of making high quality work by New Zealand craftspeople available to the public. The gallery was named after Bauhaus artist László Moholy-Nagy's influential book The New Vision, from Material to Architecture. It became one of a small number of retail spaces and dealer galleries, including Helen Hitchings Gallery in Wellington (opened 1949) and Brenner Associates in Auckland, that showed contemporary craft alongside fine art and design. In early 1959 the Hoses moved New Vision to His Majesty's Arcade in central Auckland (), and it became the city's first retail outlet focused on New Zealand potters, jewellers, weaver, and other craftspeople. New Vision became the first retail outlet in Auckland city to concentrate exclusively on the work of New Zealand potters and other craftspeople. In the following years the Hoses became New Zealand's leading dealers for the applied arts. In 1965 the Hoses secured space above the craft gallery to open another gallery, devoted to contemporary art. The decision to open the second gallery was prompted by the closure of the Ikon Gallery, one of the few dealer galleries in Auckland at the time. New Vision was one of few dealer galleries in New Zealand to embrace abstract art. Gordon Walters and Theo Schoon had their first solo shows here, and the Hoses were early supporters of expressionist painter Philip Trusttrum. Art historian Andrew Paul Wood notes: > The influence of New Vision on the Auckland art scene at the time was > phenomenal, and aside from exhibiting, the Hoses gave tremendous moral > support and friendship to a number of artists, including Colin McCahon. They > were a rare thing in those days, champions of modernism and abstraction, > though not exclusively, and a point of contact with developments in Europe. The gallery also held important applied arts shows. Jeweller Jens Hoyer Hansen held his first solo show there in 1960. In 1970 the gallery staged Silver, Gold, Greenstone, the first substantial exhibition of contemporary jewellery in New Zealand. The exhibition included jewellers Kobi Bosshard, Jens Hansen, Gunter Taemmler and Ida Hudig, as well as artists not seen primarily as jewellers, including Paul Beadle, Theo Schoon and Edward Kindleysides. Ceramicist Bronwynne Cornish had her first significant solo exhibition, China Cabinet Curiosities, at the gallery in 1971. In 1971, Kees Hos moved to Melbourne, where he had been invited to establish and lead the School of Art and Design at the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education (now Monash University). Tina Hos remained in Auckland to manage the gallery. Tina Hos died in September 1976 and Pam Beca (later Donnelly) continued to run the business until it was taken over in 1981 by James Peters. New Vision closed in October 1986. Kees Hos died on 3 December 2015.

The cycle was composed in 1844–48, originally with piano accompaniment, later orchestrated. The title is an allusion to the Ancient Greek elements: earth, air, water, and fire. As an afterthought, Liszt composed an overture for the cycle in 1849–50, but this was instead revised to become his symphonic poem Les préludes. Genesis Liszt's starting-point for the cycle was Les aquilons (\\"The North Winds\\"), a male chorus with piano accompaniment composed on 24 July 1844 in Marseille. Liszt had arrived in Marseille the day before and met with choristers of a German travelling company, who requested an original chorus piece of the composer. The poet Joseph Autran, whom Liszt had visited, offered him the poem Les aquilons. In the afternoon of the 24th, Liszt composed the piece. The work was performed on 6 August at Liszt's fourth concert in Marseille. The accompaniment was on two pianos, one played by Liszt himself.Eckhardt (1982), pp. 172-184. The cycle Besides Les aquilons, Autran gave three further poems to Liszt: La terre (\\"The Earth\\"), Les flots (\\"The Floods\\") and Les astres (\\"The Stars\\"), and Liszt also set these to music. As a series, La terre, Les aquilons, Les flots and Les astres formed a cycle Les quatre élémens (\\"The Four Elements\\"). The title of the cycle was an allusion to the Ancient Greek concept of the four elements, the four poems respectively being a reference to each of those elements: earth, air, water, and fire. La terre and Les flots were composed in Spring 1845 during Liszt's tour through Spain and Portugal. However, the precise dates are still not clear. The four pieces of Les quatre élémens were never published, and the only performance given was that of Les aquilons on 6 August 1844. The manuscripts are preserved in the Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv in Weimar. Their catalogue number is S.80. For the manuscripts of La terre and Les flots, Emil Haraszti and Theodor Müller-Reuter give the dates \\"Lisbon and Málaga, April 1845\\" and \\"Valencia, Easter Sunday 1845\\", respectively.Haraszti (1953), pp. 115 and 123; Müller-Reuter (1909) p. 294. Concerning the manuscript of Les astres, neither a place nor a date is available; Haraszti gives 14 April 1845, as the date.Haraszti (1953), p. 115. In a letter to Autran of 7 August 1852, Liszt reminded the poet of the four texts that he had given him, and confirmed that he had long ago completed their settings. This was perhaps the first time that Autran received information concerning the whereabouts of his poems. The poems themselves were published in 1856.Haraszti (1953), p. 114, n. 2 and n. 3. Orchestration and Overture The earliest sources for attempts of orchestrating the cycle Les quatre élémens are written in the hand of Liszt's copyist, August Conradi, in early 1848.Raabe (1931), p. 70 A score exists in the hand of Liszt's disciple and amanuensis Joachim Raff of an Ouvertüre des Quatre élémens with a four-page correction in Liszt's hand, headed \\"4 Elements Seite 25\\", and datable to 1850.Bonner (1986), pp. 101-3.

A form of historical revisionism which emerged under the post-war republic, it was argued that Italian soldiers had been \\"good\\" or \\"decent people\\" (brava gente) who had acted with humanity and compassion in contrast to their ideologically motivated and brutal German allies. In particular, it argued that the Italians had not participated in the Nazi persecution of Jews in occupied parts of Eastern Europe. By extension, the term is sometimes applied to describe popular beliefs about the Italo-Ethiopian War (1935–6) or non-Jewish responses to the Holocaust in Italy. Notable examples of the phenomenon in popular culture are the film Mediterraneo (1991) directed by Gabriele Salvatores and the novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin (1994) by Louis de Bernières which was also adapted into a film in 2004. The myth avoided \\"a public debate on collective responsibility, guilt and denial, repentance and pardon\\" but has recently been challenged by historians. The myth parallels the popular beliefs about the \\"Clean Wehrmacht\\" popular in post-war West Germany or the \\"victim theory\\" in Austria. The 2012 report of the Italian-German Historical Commission noted that \\"Just as today the myth of the decent behavior of the Wehrmacht on Italian soil cannot survive in Germany, the survival of the myth of Italiani brava gente in reference to the Second World War is equally unacceptable.\\" References Further reading  External links *Brava Gente?

The content of the questionnaire  The questionnaire consists of 243 items that require positive or negative answer.

Currently, only the Polish and Ukrainian versions of KON-2006 are available, however a number of studies based on the tool has been published in English.  Scales  The following working (approximate) names were given to KON-2006 scales: # Feeling of being dependent on the environment # Asthenia # Negative self-esteem # Impulsiveness # Difficulties with decision making # Sense of alienation # Demobilization # Tendency to take risks # Difficulties in emotional relations # Lack of vitality # Conviction of own resourcelessness in life # Sense of lack of control # Deficit in internal locus of control # Imagination. indulging in fiction # Sense of guilt # Difficulties in interpersonal relations # Envy # Narcissistic attitude # Sense of being in danger # Exaltation # Irrationality # Meticulousness # Ponderings # Sense of being overloaded  Methodology of the questionnaire creation  Search for and selection of items that were used for the creation of the KON-2006 questionnaire were based on empirical methods. Analysis of usefulness of 779 items was conducted (including items drawn from scales belonging to various personality and temperament inventories e.g. 16PF, MMPI, PTS, TTS, IPIP, TCI). Clarity, explicitness and comprehensiveness of each item was evaluated and appropriate improvements were implemented. Next, a comparison of answers was made between healthy individuals and the patients that were beginning treatment due to neurotic disorders. This allowed to select 243 items most useful in differentiation of the patients with neurotic disorders from the healthy individuals. These items were used for the creation of Neurotic Personality Questionnaire. The construction of 24 scales was based on cluster analysis conducted on the population of patients at the beginning of treatment and control groups.

Location The building stands on the eastern side of Gdańska Street in Bydgoszcz, near Dworcowa Street. The hotel has a \\"U\\" shape, with irregular and uneven corners. Its footprint is delineated by 2 streets (Gdanska and Parkowa) and by the Park Casimir the Great Bydgoszcz to the east. History Prussian period Hotels in this location date back to the beginning of the 19th century, when an inn was built by the Gliszczyński family en route to Gdańsk. In 1822, a carpenter of the Gliszczyńskis' built a new building called the Hotel \\"The Eagle\\" () next to the old one. Hotel \\"The Eagle\\" is one of the first hotels built in the suburb of Bydgoszcz, then officially called Bromberg. Around 1850, August Friedrich Bernhardt, a baker, bought the building and a nearby piece of land. Between 1875 and 1879, his newly created company was taken over by his son Emil Bernhardt, who had returned from Switzerland where he had taken hotel and catering courses. In 1880 Emil Bernhardt married Louise Müller, daughter of a landlord in the vicinity of Schneidemühl, who had a very substantial dowry. A part of this dowry was likely invested in the construction of Emil Bernhardt's house, located at Gdansks street 16. In 1893 Emil Bernhardt commissioned a Bromberg- born architect, Józef Święcicki, to realize his new hotel project. This building was to stretch under a huge sculpture of an eagle with spread wings. Święcicki's design was based on similar projects from Berlin and Munich. As a signature, Święcicki hid his self-portrait among the row of allegorical heads adorning the façade. The property was built between 1894 and 1896. When completed, the building became the largest and most modern hotel in Bromberg, with an extensively detailed façade and interior decoration. In the hotel's basement, the restaurant was adorned with vaults supported by columns, panelling, and wall paintings modelled after the latest Munich fashions, with niches for seating. From the beginning, the building has been equipped with electric lighting, steam heating, and a hydraulic lift. The facility combined the functions of a residential area (with 3 six-rooms apartment of a high standard), a hotel, and a commercial space (with restaurants and shops). Communication between the different areas was provided by 4 network of staircases and corridors. In 1899, the hotel was leased to the Berlin businessman Rudolf Trillhose. Interwar period In 1920, Bromberg rejoined the territory of the Second Polish Republic and renamed Bydgoszcz, and the building was sold to Polish landlord and tradesman Stefan Majewicz for the then-astronomical sum of 1.25 millionDeutsche Mark. During the interwar period, a modernization of the hotel was carried out; it comprised installing new elevators, changing the décor in the guest rooms, and rebuilding the dining room by adding a mezzanine, new panelling and changing equipments. This renovation work was achieved in 1926 under the direction of Bydgoszcz architect Theophilus Biernacki. In those years, balls, receptions, concerts, chamber music and other entertainment were performed in two different halls; \\"Columns\\" and \\"Raspberry.\\" \\"Column\\" Hall was famous for its daily concerts of popular music, played by the Bydgoszcz orchestra, and the restaurant \\"Pod Orłem\\" () was one of the best in terms of design, meals and drinks. It was here that banquets in honour of Marshal Piłsudski, President Wojciechowski and General Haller were given. In the 1930s, social elite met at its \\"Club of the angular Table\\" (), among them Adam Grzymała-Siedlecki, Konrad Fiedler, Jan Piechocki, Marian Turwid, Henry Kuminek, Stanisław Leśniewski. World War II During the Nazi occupation, the hotel was taken by the Nazis and renamed \\"Danzinger Hoff\\"; Erich Blumm became its director. From 1939 to 1945, the south-west corner of the building was rebuilt so as to widen the Gdanska street. Communist Poland's era After the invasion of Bydgoszcz by Soviet troops, the building was returned to its former owners, who resumed the hotel business as a partnership under the leadership of Stanislaw Lipowicz. In October 1945, the hotel was \\"nationalized\\" and referred to as the \\"Society of Workers' Universities\\". A few more modifications were performed to the edifice, in particular to the attics. In 1952, the Polish state travel agency \\"Orbis\\" took ownership of the \\"Pod Orłem\\" hotel. The times when Orbis was managing the hotel were treasured in the memory of the inhabitants of Bydgoszcz. Refined cuisine was praised, a number of prominent guests visited the hotel, such as Arthur Rubinstein and Krzysztof Penderecki), and the hotel was a substitute for international contacts in the times when Poland was cut off from the western world. Since 1974, the property is registered on the list of Polish heritage monuments. In 1987, a major overhaul of the building was carried out, awarded in 1993 by the Minister of Culture as one of the best restored building. Modern period At the beginning of the 1990s, heirs from the Majewicz and Kosicki families claimed ownership of the hotel; as a compromise, a limited liability company (\\"Majewicz Hotel Enterprise\\") was created on January 1, 1994, with various individuals holding 51% share, including the heirs of the pre-war owners, and Orbis holding the remaining 49%. In 2003, the hotel ranked in the top 20 of the most business friendly hotels in Poland (ranking developed by the Business Magazine in 2003; out of 1500 hotels in the country selected 20 of the most business-friendly). Architecture The building has 5 stories and a basement. Its overall shape consists of a main body and two wings; the North and South.Parucka Krystyna: Zabytki Bydgoszczy – minikatalog, \\"Tifen\\" Krystyna Parucka Bydgoszcz 2008, The edifice has been erected in Eclectism style, with Neobaroque references to Rome's Baroque forms. Among the numerous elements that adorn the front, the large-size sculpture of the eagle with outstretched wings which tops the façade is the hotel symbol. The \\"Pod Orłem\\"'s façade has 14 windows on each floor. The main architectural horizontal elements are bossages, friezes, cornices and balconies. These elements are balanced vertically by the presence of decorative sculptures and columns that run through the entire height of the façade, along the axis of the main entrance. At the level of the first floor is a loggia with atlantes on the sides topped on the second floor by two eagle figures. The third floor windows are crowned with lintels adorned with a representation of a woman's head on a solar background. On the south-western corner, large atlantes' herms stand at ground level. The hotel interiors feature many Art Nouveau references; in the lobby, the staircase with gold- colored stained glass, the door handles and the forged handrails have an interwar appearance. \\"Pod Orłem\\" belongs to the four-star hotel category. In 2009, the hotel had a capacity of 39 single rooms, 32 double rooms and 4 luxury apartments. It comprises a restaurant, \\"Column\\", and 5 multifunction rooms where can be organized banquets, balls, conferences and business meetings.Tradycja zobowiązuje, [w:] Kalendarz Bydgoski 2009 The largest rooms are the Malinowa (\\"Raspberry\\"), Business Center, and Rotariańska. In the same area, Józef Święcicki also created many other buildings, such as: * Oskar Ewald Tenement at Gdanska st.30; * Józef Święcicki tenement at Gdanska st.63; * Tenement at Gdanska st. 86; * Tenement at Freedom Square 1. The building has been registered on the Pomeranian Heritage List (N°601295-reg.90/A) on 15 December 1974.

They are only recorded at Mount Koghis, near Nouméa, and the population is decreasing.  Taxonomy  The formal description of the species was published in 2002 by H. E. Parnaby, although there is an earlier reference by Tim Flannery to the population by a common name. The author compared three specimens to the two species they most closely resemble, Nyctophilus gouldi and N. bifax and presented a diagnosis based on their morphology. The holotype was collected 150 metres north of the Station d'Altitude car park at Mt. Koghis at 450 metres asl. The collection was made by Flannery at 5.45 pm, 10 May 1991, when the specimen, a male adult, flew into a mist net set across a forest track. A second specimen, a female, was added to the collection the same evening, and the third obtained at the site several days later. The specimens examined by Parnaby were collected toward or at dusk. The epithet, nebulosus, refers to both the difficulty in its specific diagnosis and to its known range. The intention is to allude to the \\"misty heights of Mt Koghis\\" and to the nebulous features that obscured the morphological comparison to those characteristics that are well defined in other Nyctophilus species. The common name is New Caledonian long-eared bat.  Description  A species of Vespertilionidae, allied to the long-eared genus Nyctophilus, only observed at the south-western side of a mountain, Mt. Koghis, in Nouméa. The fur of the species is dark brown, a reddish colour in the male and chocolate brown in the female. The ventral side is slightly lighter than the back. Skin colour is grey-brown and dark at the snout, ears and at the membranes of the wing. The species has some resemblance to Nyctophilus gouldi, but lacks the distinctly lighter contrast of the fur on the ventral side; Nyctophilus nebulosus is also darker in colour at the back. The eastern species N. gouldi is around the same size except for the evidently larger ears. Several characteristics place this species as an intermediate in a range of measurements for Nyctophilus bifax and N. gouldi, although experimental comparison of measurement data provides support for separation as species. Ecology  The specimens obtained at Mt. Koghis were active in a cleared area of tall rainforest at dusk. The mountain is surrounded by grassland and Maquis shrubland. Classified as critically endangered at the IUCN redlist, the population is noted as in decline. Threats include removal of habitat for a variety of developments, commercial, residential and recreational, and through logging or fire management practices. Due to its imperilled status, it is identified by the Alliance for Zero Extinction as a species in danger of imminent extinction.

He is generally counted as the third in the list of 63 Nayanars. Life The life of Iyarpagai Nayanar is described in the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. His name \\"Iyarpagai\\" means \\"Contrary to Nature\\", as the Nayanar's exccessively philanthropic ways were against the worldly ways of Nature. Iyarpagai Nayanar was born in Kaveri-poompattinam, where the river Kaveri joins the ocean. This ancient capital of the Chola kingdom and port is now Puhar, Nagapattinam district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Iyarpagai Nayanar belonged to the Vaishya (merchant) caste. A staunch Shaiva (devotee of the god Shiva), he served Shiva and his devotees. A wealthy merchant, he built of a reputation that he never refused to anything a devotee of Shiva would ask for. Once, Shiva decided to test the married Iyarpagai. The god disguised himself as a Shaiva ,,(sivanadiyar) (member of the priest caste) and arrived at Iyarpagai's home, where he was welcomed by Iyarpagai and his wife. The elderly sivanadiyar said he had come to Iyarpagai, having heard tales of Iyarpagai's generosity. Upon enquiry about what he wanted, the sivanadiyar asked for Iyarpagai's wife to come to his house and look after him and his household tasks. The sivanadiyar said he never married due to a vow of chastity and did not have any children to look after him in his old age. Therefore, he needs someone to look after him as if he was their own father. Although, since the sivanadiyar continued to work as a pujari in his faraway town, for her to serve the sivanadiyar she would have to live there which was very faraway from their hometown and she would not be able to be with her husband. The merchant told his wife about the request, who was initially appalled, but later consented considering it as the command of her husband. Iyarpagai's wife worshipped the sivanadiyar feet and readied to proceed with the sivanadiyar. The visitor asked another favour of Iyarpagai. He requested the merchant to escort him and the wife to outside the town and protect him against his kin. Iyarpagai took his sword and shield and accompanied his guest and his wife on their journey. Meanwhile, the relatives of the wife and Iyarpagai, were infuriated that she was to become a virtual slave instead of living her life. Armed with various weapons, they caught with the trio in the way and threatened the \\"lecherous\\" sivanadiyar. As the sivanadiyar looked at his caregiver frightened, she comforted him, while the merchant warned the kin to flee or face his wrath. Iyarpagai, who was skilled in warfare, charged at the opposing host and massacred his kindred, chanting the Shiva Panchakshara, following onslaughts from all sides. As the trio approached Tiru Chaikadu (presently known as Sayavanam), the sivanadiyar told Iyarpagai Nayanar to return. The Nayanar prostrated before the sivanadiyar and left. Suddenly, he heard the sivanadiyar cries of help and rushed back to check any one had attacked the sivanadiyar again. When Iyarpagai reached the spot, the sivanadiyar had disappeared and his wife stood alone. Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati appeared before the couple. The Nayanar bowed in reverence; Shiva praised the Nayanar's devotion as took the couple to Kailash, his divine abode. The relatives killed by the Nayanar attained Svarga (heaven). Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. One of the most prominent Nayanars, Sundarar (8th century) venerates Iyarpagai Nayanar in the Tiruthonda Thogai, a hymn to Nayanar saints, praising as the one who was munificent. The Tamil poet Gopalakrishna Bharati (1810–1896) has composed a musical play Iyarpagai Nayanar Charitram, which has 21 songs and some verses based on the life of the Nayanar. Iyarpagai Nayanar is worshipped in the Tamil month of Margazhi, when the moon enters the Uttara Phalgunī nakshatra (lunar mansion). He is depicted with a crown and folded hands (see Anjali mudra). He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Their images are taken out in procession in festivals. The Chayavaneswarar Temple dedicated to Shiva in Sayavanam, where Shiva is described to have appeared before Iyarpagai Nayanar, has a special affiliation with the Nayanar. After bathing in Kaveri's mouth at Puhar, devotees worship at this temple. A shrine dedicated to Iyarpagai Nayanar and his wife, exists in the temple. A special five-day temple festival is celebrated around the great Iyarpagai Nayanar's holy day of salvation in Margazhi. In the Tamil months of Chithirai and Vaikasi (April to June, which correspond to the summer months), it is a tradition to offer water and buttermilk to visiting devotees in the name of the Nayanar, in the temple.
