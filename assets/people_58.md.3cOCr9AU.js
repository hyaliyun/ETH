The film tells the story of a neuroscientist who violates the law and bioethics to bring his family members back to life after they die in a car accident. It stars Keanu Reeves, Alice Eve and Thomas Middleditch. It was shown at the Night Visions International Film Festival at Finland in November 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on January 11, 2019, by Entertainment Studios Motion Pictures. The film received negative reviews from critics, who criticized the writing, plot holes, and acting; it also became a box-office bomb. Plot William Foster and Ed Whittle are biomedical research scientists working for Bionyne Corporation in Puerto Rico, attempting to transfer the mind of a dead soldier into an android with superhuman strength, codenamed Subject 345. Foster specializes in synthetic biology and mapping of the mind's neural pathways, while Whittle's speciality is reproductive human cloning. Foster successfully captures the soldier's neural map and transfers it into the android's synthetic brain, but the experiment fails when the soldier recoils in horror at the android body and destroys it, killing himself again. Foster's boss Jones warns him that if he cannot get Subject 345 to work, the company's shareholders will shut the project down. Foster takes his wife Mona and three children Sophie, Matt, and Zoe, on a boating trip, but on the way all but William are killed in a car crash. Determined to resurrect his family, he coaxes Ed to bring him the Bionyne equipment necessary to extract his family's neural maps and to clone replacement bodies for them. He successfully extracts their neural maps and tells Whittle to dispose of the bodies, but the first major obstacle to his plan presents itself: only three cloning pods are available, forcing him to choose one to sacrifice. He chooses Zoe, the youngest, and erases her memory from the neural maps of the other three. Whittle starts the seventeen-day cycle required to create mature replacement clones for Foster's family, and tells him he has only that long to solve the problem of integrating the neural maps into the cloned bodies, or else they will start to deteriorate by aging at an abnormally fast rate. Integrating the mind into a biological clone was phase two of the research project, to be solved after android transfer. Foster is forced to keep this secret, since he and Whittle have stolen millions of dollars of Bionyne equipment and are breaking bioethics. He spends the seventeen days removing evidence of Zoe's existence from his home, and creating cover stories of illness to explain his family's absence from work, school, and social media contact. When Foster notices his wife's central nervous system reacting to his touch, he realizes that Subject 345 failed because the mind expects connection to a biological body with heartbeat and respiration, rather than a synthetic one. He knows now that transfer into the clones will not be a problem, and the failure of android transfer can be solved by programming a simulated mind-body interface to make the android body appear biological. He successfully transfers the minds of his loved ones into the cloned bodies, then goes back to work creating a synthetic mind-body interface. When the next dead body he receives has suffered too much brain damage to be viable, Foster resorts to recording his own mind for the android transfer. Meanwhile, Sophie has a nightmare of her mother's death, and Mona catches Foster erasing her memory of the event. He confesses that they died in a car crash and that he resurrected them. The family soon discovers evidence of Zoe's existence that he missed, and he admits that he couldn't save Zoe and erased their memories of her. Jones confronts Foster and reveals that he is aware of what Foster and Whittle have done. He tells him the research is not actually intended for medical purposes, but is being financed by the U.S. government to provide a military weapon, and that Foster's family are loose ends to be eliminated. Foster destroys the mind-body interface, incapacitates Jones, and flees, attempting to escape by boat. Jones' henchmen capture Foster's family. He pursues them to Bionyne, where it is clear that Whittle has sold them out. Jones kills Whittle and forces Foster to finish Subject 345. Foster uploads his own mind into Subject 345, who kills the henchmen and mortally wounds Jones. The two Fosters make a deal with Jones: he can live in a cloned body and become rich by working with Foster-345, selling clone transfers to wealthy people looking for a second life. Meanwhile, Foster is able to retire in peace with his family, including the newly cloned Zoe.

Reception =Box office= Replicas grossed $4 million in the United States and Canada, and $5.3 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $9.3 million, against a production budget of $30 million. In the United States and Canada, Replicas was released alongside the openings of The Upside and A Dog's Way Home, as well as the wide expansion of On the Basis of Sex, and was initially projected to gross $4‚Äì7 million in its opening weekend. After making just $950,000 on its first day, including $200,000 from Thursday night previews, estimates were lowered to $3 million. It went on to debut to $2.4 million, finishing 12th at the box office, and marking the worst wide release opening of Reeves' career. The film fell 81.5% in its second weekend to $439,731, the ninth worst second-week drop of all-time. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 11% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 3.03/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Equal parts plot holes and unintentional laughs, Replicas is a ponderously lame sci-fi outing that isn't even bad enough to be so bad it's good.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 19 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C\\" on an A+ to F scale. Varietys Joe Leydon criticized the film for its \\"cavernous plot holes, risible dialogue, and ludicrously illogical behavior\\", while Charles Bramesco of The Guardian wrote, \\"After what may be one hundred hours, the film does not so much end as it stops, the score's wrapping-up tone an evident substitute for closure or resolution.\\"  References   External links    2018 films American films American science fiction thriller films American psychological thriller films 2018 psychological thriller films 2010s science fiction thriller films Di Bonaventura Pictures films Dystopian films Entertainment Studios films Films about cloning Films set in Puerto Rico Films set in Dubai Films set in the future Films shot in Puerto Rico Fundamental Films films Mad scientist films ","title":"Replicas (film)"},{"id":"51373606","text":"William Falconer, 6th Lord of Halkerton ( ‚Äì 11 October 1776) was an English aristocrat who was Lord Falconer of Halkerton from 1762 until his death in 1776.

Fontanella studied with the Cistercians as a child and entered the Discalced Carmelites despite the protests of her mother and siblings ‚Äì she soon became a noted abbess and prioress and in 1703 inaugurated a new convent she herself oversaw the establishment of. Her beatification cause commenced under Pope Innocent XIII in 1722 and she was titled as Venerable in 1778 under Pope Pius VI. Her beatification received ratification in 1865 under Pope Pius IX. Life Marianna Fontanella was born in Turin in 1661 as the ninth of eleven children to the nobleman Giovanni Fontanella, Count of Santena, and his wife, Maria Tana. On the maternal side she was related to Mara Tana who was the mother of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga and also had ties to the Della Rovere family. In 1667 she schemed with a little brother to imitate the saints and to run off to live \\"in the desert\\", but at the time it was meant to happen the two slept in and it spoiled their plans. Due to her family relationship she adopted Saint Aloysius as a model for personal holiness and made an effort to imitate his example. In 1673 she became a student of the Cistercians in Saluzzo but the death of her father in 1675 prompted her to cut her education short so that she could return home to Turin where she was until 1677 supporting her mother and siblings. It was in 1677 that she announced her intention to join the Discalced Carmelites despite her mother and her siblings voicing their opposition to her decision. Fontanella entered the order at their convent of Santa Cristina. Fontanella entered because she liked their charism and was fascinated with the examples of Saint Teresa of √Åvila and Saint John of the Cross. She was at first overcome with homesickness and at first disliked their pattern of life in addition to not getting along with the novice mistress at the time. Her reception of the habit of the order on 19 November 1675 saw her assume the religious name of \\"Maria degli Angeli\\". She made her solemn profession after the conclusion of her novitiate on 26 December 1676. She became known for unusual penitential practices which included suspending herself with rope in the form of a cross and binding her tongue in an iron ring. Maria degli Angeli experienced several visions and numerous demonic attacks and staved them off with the aid of her confessor after suffering from these demonic visions for three years. Fontanella became the novice mistress the convent she was stationed at in 1694 and at the same time was made prioress. She was noted for her ardent devotion to Saint Joseph and for her devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. People from all over sought her for advice and this included the likes of King Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia and his wife Anne Marie d'Orl√©ans. Maria degli Angeli decided to establish a Discalced Carmelite convent named in honour of Saint Joseph in Moncalieri after receiving encouragement from Blessed Sebastian Valfr√®. The convent was inaugurated on 16 September 1703. Her fellow sisters were about to elect her to a fifth term as prioress and she begged God in November 1717 to let her die if it was His will due to her reluctance to continue in her position. She fell ill not long after and died on 16 December 1717. Beatification The beatification process commenced in 1722 under Pope Innocent XIII and she was titled as a Servant of God. Her life of heroic virtue was recognized on 5 May 1778 which enabled for Pope Pius VI to confer the title of Venerable upon her. The cause caused greater traction when Vittorio Emmanuele II requested that Pope Pius IX celebrate her beatification. The pontiff approved her beatification on 14 May 1865. Her body lies under the altar in the Discalced Carmelite Monastery of Saint Joseph in Moncalieri.

The American Civil War saw significant advances in battlefield medicine. The lower mortality rate of injured soldiers led to the sentiment that the United States should provide care for its surviving injured veterans. The city of Waupaca purchased the land and buildings of the defunct Greenwood Park Hotel and donated the grounds to the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) for the site of a veterans' home. Civil War physician and GAR member Dr. Frederick Marden was chosen to head a five-member committee to organize a Wisconsin veterans' home. Among Dr. Marden's innovative ideas put into action was the practice of allowing wives and widows of veterans to live at the home, as well as the idea of allowing members to live semi-independently in cottages. Marden died on September 24, 1887, a year before the site began operation on August 18, 1888.

Description The Interceptors are red and white space fighters used over the Moon and in Earth's orbit, equipped only with a self-destroying frontal nuclear missile. The Interceptors, usually, fly in groups of three during a period of red alert. These spacecraft always takeoff within three elevators hidden in as many lunar craters. During the flight, the three missiles are fired almost simultaneously. These spacecraft cannot fly in Earth's atmosphere, for unknown reasons. Their UFO opponents cannot stay in Earth's atmosphere for prolonged periods, because they would probably explode.

Dinky model  The Dinky Interceptor was a toy model spacecrafthttp://ufo.sfdaydreams.com/toys/dinkyufo.htm. made by Dinky Toys and based on the SHADO spacecraft. It was manufactured and sold for six years and, during this time, changed appearance several times. =Earliest version= The earliest version was metallic green rather than white, with orange skis and orange stickers, and featuring gold details. This had a clear canopy with a red seated figure with outreached arms. This was the same figure as used in the Joe 90 car. Early versions can be easily detected, as they have a slight raised rim around the chrome gun panel in front of the canopy. Later models did not have this. =1975 version= The year 1975 appears to signify the change where at this point the canopy was blue and the figure became Interceptor 351 specific, in that it was green and had lowered arms. For a period both blue and clear canopies were used. Red-legged versions also appeared around this time and are now considered rare. =Later versions= As production continued it appears that cost constraints and issues regarding toxicity of paints led to the issue of the models with bright casting parts instead of gold painted as featured in the 1978 catalogue. In the 1978, catalogue the skis are turned up on the trailing edge. Final models appeared with no chrome plating, bright metal parts and a black nose.

It mainly consists of white quartzite, and its summit has large treeless areas. Koli village is at the root of the hill, and the area is part of Koli National Park. Description Predecessor of the Koli fells, the Karelian fold mountains, or Karelides were formed in a crash of tectonic plates about 1800 million years ago, an old plate sunk down towards the core of the Earth and a younger plate pushed upwards. From the younger plate arose the five-kilometre-high peaked mountains known as Karelides. Over the millions of years, however, the high mountains eroded and only Koli remains. Koli's cliffs have received their characteristic smooth, rounded shape during the ice age. The continental ice has also collected moraines to eskers, moved huge boulders and created boulder caves and rocks with ripple marks in the area. The summits are called Ukko-Koli (347 m), Akka-Koli (339 m), Paha-Koli (334 m) and Pieni-Koli (238 m). (Names translate unofficially as Old Man Koli, Old Wife Koli, Bad Koli and Small Koli.) Koli has inspired many painters and composers, e.g. Jean Sibelius, Juhani Aho and Eero J√§rnefelt. Eero J√§rnefelt painted a large scene together with Alfred William Finch and Ilmari Aalto in 1911, which can be seen in the Helsinki railway station restaurant.

It forms the junction of Interstate 94 (I-94, Edsel Ford Freeway), with M-10 (John C. Lodge Freeway). The interchange was completed in 1955, and is the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States. History The Ford‚ÄìLodge interchange was part of Detroit freeway system as conceived in the late 1940s and early 1950s, a joint project involving the city of Detroit, the Wayne County Road Commission, and the Michigan State Highway Department. One of the biggest challenges for the designers was the intersection of the two freeways. The accepted design for an interchange between two busy highways was the cloverleaf. However, the Michigan engineers rejected the idea, stating that the crossover traffic and tight turns would be too hazardous. They preferred \\"a design with simple turns that could be performed at relatively high speeds\\". A 1944 Detroit News article announced that the design would be a rotary type, which had been used on the East Coast but never in the Midwest. However, a visit by engineers from New Jersey resulted in a change of design; the New Jersey engineers warned that a rotary could only handle about 3000 vehicles per hour, far less than what the Michigan engineers anticipated. The interchange involved 14 separate overpasses in order to provide unrestricted flow of traffic. A scale model of the interchange was put on display in New York at a \\"Conference of the Future\\"; conference organizers wanted to exhibit it because they considered it to be \\"most outstanding design for a highway interchange in the country\\". According to the Detroit News, as soon as the barriers were removed, \\"cars from downtown roared under the bridges of the $15,300,000 crossing in such numbers that by 5 p.m. a haze of new concrete dust hung like fog in the air. Drivers dipped into the new interchange underpass they had never seen at a cautious 50. By the time (five seconds or so) it took to hit the straightaway, they were back at a minimum 60 and honking impatiently at the few timid souls who lagged.\\" Design The interchange is a full interchange, with ramps on the both right and left sides of the roadways. This \\"right-to-go-right-left-to-go-left\\" design was considered progressive for its time.

Billsmoor Park is an extensive alder woodland of a sort increasingly uncommon in the county; the much smaller Grasslees Wood is an oak woodland. Location and natural features Billsmoor Park and Grasslees Wood are situated towards the north of Northumberland, in the north-east of England, north of Elsdon and west-south-west of Rothbury. Billsmoor Park, formerly a deer park, lies on the valley sides of the Park Burn, a north- running stream set amidst a west-facing lower slope at the south of the Simonside Hills. The roughly square park, extending to about , falls from above sea level at the south-east & south-west, to the centrally located stream which falls from to through the site. The B6341 road forms an eastern boundary of the park. The much smaller Grasslees Wood, slightly north of the park and on the other side of the road, is a strip of woodland up to wide and occupying , and is orientated in a north-east - south-west direction at about . Both park and wood are listed as an increasingly uncommon examples of an alder and oak woodlands, their scarcity arising out of clearfelling and over- grazing which prevents new growth from being established. Vegetation Wooded areas of Billsmoor Park support alder (Alnus glutinosa) with some hazel (Corylus avellana) on lower lying wet soils, and an undergrowth of soft rush (Juncus effusus), tufted hair grass (Deschampsia cespitosa), wood-sedge (Carex sylvatica), greater-tussock sedge (C. paniculata) and pendulous sedge (C. pendula). Birch is found on steeper sections of the valley. Above the woodlands, open areas of the site support bracken and occasional birch, with grassland composed of mat grass (Nardus stricta), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) and common bent (Agrostis capillaris). In very wet areas of the site, mire vegetation arises, including bog myrtle (Myrica gale), broad-leaved cottongrass (Eriophorum latifolium), grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia palustris) and purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and, around springs, yellow pimpernel (Lysimachia nemorum), bugle (Ajuga reptans) and water mint (Mentha aquatica). Grasslees Wood is dominated by sessile oak (Quercus petraea) with some birch (Betula pubescens). Groundcover indicative of a dry acid soil includes sweet vernal grass, common bent, creeping soft-grass (Holcus mollis), wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella), tormentil (Potentilla erecta) and bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), together with remote sedge (Carex remota), oak fern (Gymnocarpium dryopteris) and enchanter's nightshade (Circaea lutetiana). The condition of Grasslees Wood was judged to be favourable-recovering in 2013, with some concerns about deer grazing noted. Billsmoor Park was found to have an 'unfavourable-recovering' condition in the same year, with enclosures erected preventing deer grazing appearing to work well.

The parcel includes an early root cellar, foundational remnants of a late 18th-century farmstead, and a marked stone that has been speculatively interpreted to have pre-Columbian Celtic markings. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history The Slayton‚ÄìMorgan Historic District is located in a rural area of the town of Woodstock. The parcel is roughly divided between a wooded area and an open area that was once meadow and has a low knoll. The parcel is lined by stone walls that probably date to the late 18th or early 19th century. There are two cellar holes, representing the foundations of houses, one of which has been dated 1792, when James Slayton established a farm here. A structure interpreted as a root cellar is located in the southern half of the parcel; it is a stone structure, with three of its side walls and top covered by an earthen embankment. Its east side has an uncovered opening, providing access to the interior. Elements of the interior have stone carvings of uncertain origin and differing interpretation. The structure is one of the best-preserved of its type in the state. Near the northwest corner of the parcel, where two stone walls meet, is a pyramidal stone aligned on a north-south axis with another nearby stone, on which carvings resembling the Eye of Balor are found.Auerbach, Kathryn; Dowd, Anne; O'Bannon, Patrick (1991). NRHP nomination for Slayton‚ÄìMorgan Historic District; redacted version available by request from the National Park Service The area's undisputed history begins in the late 18th century, when James Slayton established a farm on this and the surrounding land. It was operated as a farm until about 1915, by which time all of the buildings had been demolished. In the 1970s, the stone chamber became the focus of a debate, with one side claiming it as evidence of pre-Columbian contact by Celtic peoples, and others claiming it was merely a distinctive example of an early settlement period vernacular cellar used either for storing root vegetables or sheltering sheep. A third interpretation suggests such chambers may have been used by Native Americans as sweat lodges. The interior chamber of this construction is the largest known in the state, measuring about .

It was shot at the Spandau Studios and on location around Berlin at the Olympiastadion, Tempelhof Airport and Charlottenburg. Plot At the beginning of the film, gangster Bruno Stiegler alias Dandy returns to West Berlin from the United States as a boxing promoter. The boxing business serves him more as a camouflage, however, because soon it turns out that he and his gang want to realize various planned raids. The now retired Judge Z√§nker has tried in vain to put Dandy behind bars by legal means during his active service. Now he turns the tables with his friends and sister Elisabeth. His old friends and colleagues meet as a man's choir disguised in his home and prove to be a pensioner's gang, taking on Dandy's gang. He succeeds in this by using the ex- con as a snitch in Dandy's gang. Dandy wants to steal the revenue from a Hertha BSC football match from the Olympic Stadium, but bickering comes to him before. The same is achieved by takers in Dandy's attempt to rob dubious businessman Kunkelmann's cash cabinet and clear up the Haase jewellery store during a parade. What is picisical is that Z√§nker's son-in-law Walter, who lives with his daughter Monika in the house near Z√§nker, works as a criminal inspector with the police and is charged with clearing up these crimes. In fact, Walter's supervisor commissioner, Berg, eventually appears in person with his old friend bickering to arrest him. In a conversation under four eyes, Z√§nker initiates the Commissioner in his motive and method and gains his understanding. So an arrest warrant goes out for Dandy, and Z√§nker manages, with the help of Pietsch, to cheer all the stolen items to Dandy. Immediately before Dandy's departure, all the predatory material is found in his suitcase. This justifies the appearances for the police, that Dandy actually committed the crimes, and that Dandy is being taken away. In fact, after his retirement, Z√§nker has finally managed what he has tried to do legally in his profession for a long time in vain.  Cast  * Martin Held as Oberlandesgerichtsrat a. D.

She is perhaps best known for her involvement in the Wounded Knee incident with the murder of fellow American Indian Movement activist Anna Mae Aquash. Early life Clarke was born Theda Rose Nelson in 1924. According to Census records, Theda R. Nelson was born in the state of South Dakota. Clarke lived in Scottsbluff, Nebraska at the time, and was the matriarch of a large tiyospaye (family), leading to her being designated 'aunt' and 'auntie' by many in the community, including Troy Lynn Yellow Wood and future accomplice in the murder of Anna Mae Aquash, John Graham. Theda Nelson Clarke was aunt (whether this familial affiliation was biological or adopted is unclear) to Darlene Nichols (whom Nichols grew up with), a key material witness in the murder trials of Arlo Looking Cloud and John Graham for their roles in the murder of AIM activist Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash. In the early 1940s, Clarke graduated from the St. Francis Indian School in St. Francis, South Dakota.

Looking Cloud, along with Theda Nelson Clarke and John 'John Boy Patton' Graham, forced Aquash into the back of a car and drove her to a remote part of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Clarke drove from Denver, Colorado to the scene of the shooting on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in her red Pinto. Aquash was shot execution style in the back of the head and left to die. Her body was discovered on February 24, 1976 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation at the bottom of a ravine located in close proximity to an isolated highway. Aquash was revealed to have been executed using a gun, as the autopsy showed that the muzzle of the gun had been pressed into the back of her neck. The coroner's report indicated that in addition to the fatal gunshot wound, exposure contributed to the death of Aquash.

Ecclesiastical authors produced hagiographies of many of these saints. These texts were aimed largely at an ecclesiastical audience, although some were also aimed at royalty and nobility, and outlined how to live an ideal Christian life. Definition With a few exceptions, there was no \\"absolute definition\\" of what constituted a saint in Anglo-Saxon England. In some cases, particularly from the ninth century onward, designation of a deceased individual as a saint was authorised by a bishop or church council, although in other cases they were only designated as a saint by certain churches or religious communities. Blair suggested that it would often have been \\"rather vague\\" as to whether a revered individual was actually a saint or not in this period. While the Pope came to play an increasing role in deciding who was declared a saint from the tenth century onward, it was only in the twelfth century that they took control of canonization. From that point on, specific criteria were set out for who could be considered a saint: they had to have either been martyred or lived a particularly virtuous life, and to have produced posthumous miracles. Evidence A series of catalogues were produced in the period between circa 1000 and 1200 which listed the resting- places of various English saints; the earliest of these, Secgan, incorporates what may be a list from the pre-Viking period. Origins and development =Antecedents= The Anglo-Saxon local saint was a development in a wider and older Roman tradition. The cult of saints had become a centrally important aspect of Christianity from at least the fourth century, when it was criticised by the final pagan Emperor of the Roman Empire, Julian the Apostate. Extramural cemeteries where individuals deemed to be saints were interned became prominent sites for Christian communities; St. Peter's Basilica in Rome was for example erected atop an extramural cemetery believed to house the remains of St Peter. Connected to this cult of saints was the cult of relics; in the eastern Roman Empire, the practice of breaking up the original remains for distribution among various churches began, and soon spread to elsewhere in Christendom. As a theoretical justification for this, several Christian thinkers ‚Äî notably the Archbishop of Rouen, Victricius ‚Äî argued that the saints produced such power that it even exuded from fragments of their bodies. The Church of Rome was concerned by the dispersal of human remains and so encouraged the veneration of secondary relics ‚Äî objects that had been in contact with the remains of a saint ‚Äî as an alternative. The historian David Rollason suggested the possibility that some Romano-British saints' cults survived the Anglo-Saxon migration of the fifth century and continued to exist amid the growth of Anglo-Saxon paganism. One of these may have been the cult of St. Alban, and another associated with Sixtus, a figure later mentioned in a letter written by Pope Gregory the Great but about whom nothing is known. =The conversion of the Anglo-Saxons= Saints' relics began to appear in Anglo-Saxon England soon after the arrival of the first Christian missionaries. At the beginning of the seventh century, Pope Gregory the Great wrote to Augustine ‚Äî who was leading the Gregorian mission to convert the Kingdom of Kent to Christianity ‚Äî informing him that he was sending not only manuscripts, vestments, and sacred vessels, but also \\"relics of the holy apostles and martyrs\\" to aid the conversion process. Later in that century, Pope Vitalian sent the 'benefits' (beneficia) of the saints ‚Äî relics of Peter the Apostle, Paul the Apostle, Lawrence, John and Paul, Gregory, and Pancras ‚Äî to King Oswiu of Northumbria, also sending Oswiu's queen \\"a cross with a golden key, made from the holy fetters of the apostles St Peter and St Paul\\". These gifts likely reflected the Papal desire to link the burgeoning Anglo-Saxon Church with that in Rome. Many Anglo-Saxons were also eager to obtain further relics from Rome. Circa 761, Benedict Biscop, who founded monasteries at Monkwearmouth and Jarrow, visited Rome and brought \\"holy relics of the blessed apostles and Christian martyrs\\" back to England. According to his eighth century biography written by Stephanus, Wilfrid, the founder of Hexham Abbey and Ripon Abbey, also brought many relics from Rome to England following both his 680 and 704 visits to Italy. Rollason also thought it likely that Benedict Biscop and Wilfrid would have brought relics to England from Frankish Gaul, an area that they both had close connections with and which was a prolific source for the creation of relics. Although we have no information revealing what form these relics took, Rollason thought it likely that these would have been secondary relics, which the Papacy preferred to distribute. It is possible that saints' relics were perceived as being vital to the dedication of new churches in Anglo-Saxon England, particularly if ‚Äî as Gregory the Great advised in a letter to Mellitus ‚Äî many early churches were converted pagan temples. Alternately, in other instances relics may have been used for newly constructed churches; this is supported by a statement by Bede, which notes that Bishop Acca gathered relics and \\"put up altars for their veneration, establishing various chapels for this purpose within the walls of the church.\\" =Seventh and eighth centuries= In Anglo-Saxon England, the seventh and eighth centuries have been described as the \\"age of saints\\". Blair noted that after 850, \\"saint-making was different in character and very much more restricted.\\" While hagiographies often presented saints' cults as arising spontaneously out of popular devotion, the establishment of such cults would have required an ecclesiastical impresario who could commission hagiographies, publicise alleged miracles, construct and decorate a shrine, organise a feast day, and if necessary organise the saints' site as a place of pilgrimage. There were many links between royalty and the cult of saints, with many saints having been born to royal families and many churches having been established by royalty. In the Kingdom of Kent, saints' cults were typically located at abbeys which were also royal vills and therefore centres of royal administration. Royalty could use their affiliation to such cults in order to claim legitimacy against competitors to the throne. A dynasty may have had accrued prestige for having a saint in its family. Promoting a particular cult may have aided a royal family in claiming political dominance over an area, particularly if it was recently conquered. Political and ecclesiastical rivalries influenced various saints' cults; there was for instance competition between the cults of Cuthbert and Wilfrid. =Late Anglo-Saxon period= From at least the late ninth century, there is evidence that Anglo-Saxon kings had their own relic collections. The ecclesiastical reform movement of the late tenth century displayed an increased interest in the cult of saints. For these ecclesiastical reformers, the church of saints offered the opportunity for grandeur and prestige. In this period there was a proliferation of hagiographies, the production of which was sustained through to the mid-to- late eleventh century. The tenth century also witnessed the first records of lay people making pilgrimages to sites associated with saints' relics, suggesting that there had been a major expansion in the popularity of the saints' cults among the laity in that period. This expansion would be paralleled by contemporary developments in the area of the former Carolingian Empire. The growth of popular veneration of the saints could have arisen from spontaneous piety on behalf of the laity but also from the church's desire to further integrate the laity into its sphere of influence. The adoption of saints' festivals into the calendar would have aided both the clergy and the kings in regulating the laity's activities. The political exploitation of the cult of saints continued into the eleventh century, as reflected in the actions of Cnut. Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the cult of saints could have developed into a source of opposition to the new Norman administration, but this does not appear to have happened. In one of the anti- Norman rebellions, that led by Hereward the Wake, the rebels swore fealty to their cause on the body of St √Üthelthryth‚Äîa local saint in the area of Ely where they were based‚Äîbut there is no evidence that √Üthelthryth became an enduring symbol of Anglo-Saxon resistance. Many of the Norman bishops and other ecclesiastical figures that were brought to England following the conquest utilised the pre-existing saints' cults to promote their own monasteries and churches. Moreover, during the Norman period, various older Anglo-Saxon figures were converted into saints; the ecclesiastical authorities at Rochester in Kent for instance declared Ithamar, a former Bishop of Rochester who appeared as a minor figure in Bede's Ecclesiastical History, to be a saint. Blair argued that by 1100, many local saints were recognised in their own churches as founders and patrons, but that beyond this little or nothing was known of them. Although hermits were by definition not based at minsters, by the eleventh century a number of major reformed houses had obtained the relics of hermits for their own collections. Saints =Imported saints= Various saints in Anglo-Saxon England, such as Peter and Paul, were those already venerated by the Church of Rome. Evidence for these figures dates from the seventh and eighth centuries and thus it is unclear if they were brought to Anglo-Saxon England earlier, with the Gregorian Mission. The Dialogues of Gregory the Great, a text produced in Rome that was largely concerned with the lives of Italian saints, was influential in Anglo-Saxon England, with the descriptions of miracles that it provided being copied by some Anglo-Saxon hagiographers, such as Bede in his Life of St Cuthbert. The Lindisfarne Gospels, produced circa 700, list festivals of two southern Italian saints, Januarius and Stephen, with the festival lists perhaps having been copied from a pre-existing Neapolitan list. The Old English Martyrology, probably composed in the ninth century, also contains a large number of southern and central Italian saints. It is not clear whether this Italian influence on the Anglo-Saxon cult of saints arose through texts that had travelled west or whether it had instead arisen through direct contact between the two regions of Europe. There is some evidence for Italian ecclesiastical figures who came to England‚ÄîHadrian, the former abbot of an Italian monastery, accompanied the Greek Theodore of Tarsus to England in 669, while Birinus, who evangelised Wessex, was also from Italy‚Äîand it may be that these individuals influenced the development of the Anglo-Saxon cult of saints. Gregory and his Dove, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Ms 389 There is also evidence that Frankish Gaul influenced the choice of saints in Anglo-Saxon England. Various Anglo-Saxon churches were dedicated to the Frankish St Martin of Tours. An Anglo-Saxon copy of the Hieronymian Martyrology, which was originally composed in Rome during the fifth century, likely arrived in England via Gaul, where various saints were appended to it. A mid ninth century Anglo-Saxon calendar‚ÄîMS Digby 63 in the Bodleian Library‚Äîincludes various Frankish saints' days in it, particularly those from the Flanders area, testifying to an influence. There is little evidence for an Irish influence over the Anglo- Saxon cult of saints. With the exception of a few prominent and widespread saintly figures like Patrick, Brigid, and Columba, Irish saints do not appear in Anglo-Saxon textual sources. There is also little evidence of an Irish influence on Anglo-Saxon hagiography, with the only possible exception being the putative impact of the Irish Life of St Columba on the anonymously authored Anglo-Saxon Life of St Cuthbert. Gretsch stated that, with the exception of the apostles, it was Gregory the Great who \\"had enjoyed the largest and most universal veneration in Anglo-Saxon England\\". By the time that Bede and Aldhelm were writing their texts, at least two altars and one chapel had been dedicated to Gregory in England. =Royal saints= Anglo- Saxon England produced more royal saints than neighbouring regions of Northwestern Europe. The lives of some of these saints is attested from sources written in the Anglo-Saxon period, although others only survive in hagiographic accounts produced after the Norman Conquest. Some of these royal saints had been kings who retired to devote their lives to religious pursuits. In some cases, such as that of Ceolwulf, they were likely forced to adopt this course of action by political rivals. One suggestion has been that the emphasis that the Anglo-Saxons placed on royal saints derived from the influence of pagan ideas that kings had a sacred role in society. Part of the explanation for the proliferation of royal saints may have been that royal families encouraged them, believing that they would gain prestige by having a familial connection to a saint. Many leading ecclesiastics were themselves members of royal families and may themselves have had an interest in promoting their own family members as saints. The Church may also have wished to strengthen the prestige of established royal dynasties in order to promote societal stability and strong government, from which the Church itself would have benefitted. Martyred royal saints 14th century depiction of the Anglo-Saxon royal saint Edward the Martyr In various cases, these royal saints had been killed by other Christians. Of the martyred royal saints, the earliest date from the seventh century, with very few appearing throughout the eighth century, and then a number emerging in the late eighth and first half of the ninth centuries in the kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia, with the very last known example coming from Wessex. The fact that motifs and tropes repeat in the various hagiographies of martyred saints led Rollason to suggest that the different authors were operating in a known hagiographical tradition and were borrowing from earlier works. For instance, the motif of a beam of divine light revealing the location of the body is associated with eight of these martyrs in their hagiographies; nine entail the murder being committed by a servant ordered to carry it out by their master; and seven claim that a religious foundation was established in the aftermath of the killing. The earliest example of a martyred royal saint was Oswine of Deira, who was killed on the order of his rival, Oswiu of Bernicia. That Oswine was soon sanctified is suggested by the tone in which Bede describes him and his inclusion in the eighth-century kalendar of St Willibrord. The best documented example of a martyred royal saint is Edward the Martyr, who was killed in 978 or 979 while visiting his half-brother √Üthelred the Unready. That he was sanctified purely for the manner of his death is suggested by the Vita Oswaldi‚Äîprobably authored by Byrhtferth of Ramsey between 995 and 1005‚Äîwhich does not describe him as having exhibited any particular virtues during his lifetime. Three royal men of Northumbria were also martyred saints: the kings Eardwulf and √Ülfwald and the prince Ealhmund. Eardwulf appears to differ from most other martyred royal saints in that he appeared to survive his execution. According to the story set forth in the Historia Regum annals, Eardwulf was put to death outside the gates of Ripon Minster, after which the monks carried his body to a church, where he revived during the night. One of the four known coins depicting √Üthelberht II, who posthumously became one of the martyred royal saints Two seventh-century Kentish princes, √Üthelred and √Üethelberht, are also presented as martyred saints in a number of eleventh century and later sources. There is nevertheless evidence that they were venerated as saints from at least the early eighth century. There is also much evidence for the veneration of a ninth-century Mercian prince, Wigstan, and according to late medieval sources he too had been martyred. In this story, Wigstan had declined to inherit the throne after his father's death, but was then murdered in 849 by another prince, Beorhtfrith, in retaliation for Wigstan's opposition to his own mother, √Ülfl√¶dd, marrying Beorhtfrith's father, the new king Beorhtwulf. Another sanctified Mercian royal was √Üthelberht II of East Anglia, who‚Äîaccording to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle‚Äîwas killed by Offa of Mercia in 794. As with Wigstan, the details of his murder are only found in later medieval sources. Kenelm is also a putative murdered Mercian who became a saint, although the sources dealing with his murder are late medieval and display some contradictions with early medieval sources discussing the Mercian royal succession. Also attested only by late medieval sources are the murders of the Mercian princes Wulflad and Rufinus, allegedly by their father, who sought to punish them for converting to Christianity. There are various inconsistencies with this account, although it may represent the survival of a seventh-century event in garbled form. One possibility as to why various murdered royals were sanctified was that the Church was seeking to dissuade such killings and thus promote societal stability. In such a scenario, kings might have reconsidered killing their rivals and enemies if they feared that the latter would actively be sanctified as a result of the killing. It is perhaps relevant that the apparent proliferation of martyred royal saints occurred in the late eighth and early ninth centuries, shortly after the 786 visit of the Papal legates to England, during which they had strongly condemned the killing of kings and princes. Another possibility for the propagation of the cults of martyred royalty may be political rather than ecclesiastical. These cults might have been cultivated by the enemies of the killers, who hoped that the cults would express and focus opposition to the latter. For instance, Cnut may have promoted the cult of Edward the Martyr to cast a negative image on √Üthelred the Unready, who may have been Edward's killer and who a key rival of Cnut's. Hagiography In Anglo-Saxon England, hagiographies‚Äîor written accounts of a saints' life‚Äîwere not designed to serve as accurate biographies but rather as outlining a holy life for others to emulate. Evidence from the dedications found in Anglo-Saxon hagiographies suggest that they were intended largely for religious communities and in some cases for kings. That they were often written in Latin, and sometimes used complex Latin terminology, presupposes that their primary audience was ecclesiastical. In a few cases, some Old English translations were produced‚Äîthere are Old English examples of Felix's Life of St Guthlac and Bede's Life of St Chad‚Äîwhich could allow these hagiographers to have had a wider audience. The Life of Saint Guthlac and Bede's Life of St Cuthbert for instance both provide a description of how to be a good monk or hermit. There are other stories within the hagiographies that would have had greater relevance to layfolk, in particular members of the royalty and nobility. In the tenth century, Anglo-Saxon hagiography began to display an increasing preoccupation with saintly authority and on the close relationship between saints and kings. Of the 106 Old English hagiographical works, 66 of them (approximately two-thirds) were written by the abbot √Ülfric of Eynsham. Of these, only 6 deal with English or British saints, with the majority being devoted to foreign ones. Studying this material, Gretsch suggested that political and ethical considerations would have influenced √Ülfric's decisions regarding which saints to write about. Relics The early medieval concept of a local saint was based on the idea that the holy could have a physical presence. If a church possessed bodily relics of a saint, this served as both a mark of status and a devotional focus for worshippers. =Saints' bodies= Burial within a church was a prerequisite for an individual to be perceived as a saint in Anglo-Saxon England. The only known possible exception was St Guthlac of Crowland, whose hagiographer, Felix, vaguely described his body being interned under a monument, the nature of which was unspecified. The placement of a saints' corpse within a church enabled the ecclesiastical community to have control over the saint's cult, and to hold possession of the relics and their perceived power. Doing so also enabled the saint's remains to be located near to an altar, both accentuating the altar's sanctity and facilitating masses for the saint. Some saints‚Äîsuch as St Sebbi and St John of Beverly‚Äîwere buried directly inside the church following their death. In other cases, individuals who came to be interpreted as saints were first buried in the ground, typically in a churchyard, and only later were disinterred, with their bodies being moved into the church. This act of removing the relics is known as \\"translation\\". One account of such a translation is provided by Bede, who relates that when √Üthelthryth, the Abbess of Ely, died in 679, she was buried in a wooden coffin amid other deceased nuns, as had been her instruction. Sixteen years later her successor and sister, Seaxburgh, ordered the monks of Ely to dig up √Üthelthryth's body, place it within a white marble coffin found at an abandoned Roman fortress, and then relocate it into the church at Ely. Bede also provided an account of the disinterment and reburial of St Cuthbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne, who had initially been buried in the floor of St. Peter's Church. Cuthbert's successor, Eadberht, later ordered that his body be removed and placed in a higher and more prominent location, either on or above the floor of the church. Rollason suggested that the act of disinterment and then reburial within the church served to mark out the deceased's identity as a saint within a societal context that had no standard process of canonisation. Various Anglo-Saxon accounts refer to a saint's body being disinterred and then placed within a newly constructed church; in this case the saint's presence could have helped to hallow the church, which itself would then provide a context and location for the saint's veneration. He also stressed that the act of disinterment may have been adopted by the Anglo- Saxons from Frankish Gaul, noting that such practices were not in lime with the Church of Rome at the time, which during the seventh and eighth centuries continued to retain its opposition to the disinterment of saintly remains. The idea that the body and clothes of a deceased individual would be preserved at the time of disinterment was seen as a sign of sanctity in Anglo-Saxon England, as it had also been in Gaul. Bede recorded that during the disinterments of both St √Üthelthryth and St Cuthbert, their bodies were found to have been miraculously preserved and undecayed. In the nineteenth century, a medical examination of St Cuthbert's remains found that there was still some evidence of fleshly preservation, thus lending credence to the Anglo-Saxon claim that his body was preserved following its original burial. Such preservation may have resulted from the particular conditions of the soil into which he had been placed, or it may have been that the body had been deliberately embalmed; the latter concept was known in Anglo-Saxon England, for instance appearing in a reference by Bede. Coffins and grave coverings The Hedda Stone, Peterborough Cathedral was perhaps a covering of a saints' grave The wooden coffin of St Cuthbert was uncovered in 1827. It is incised with depictions of the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus, angels, and apostles on the sides, and of Jesus on the lid. A number of decorated stone coffins also survive from the Anglo-Saxon period, although it is unclear who the individuals were that they covered. Some may have entombed the remains of saints although others may have contained the remains of wealthy layfolk. The fragmentary stone chests in the shape of houses located at Jedburgh and St Andrews, both of which are attributed to the Anglo-Saxon period, may have represented reliquary-coffins. That at St Andrews was found in the churchyard of the church of St Rule, and thus may have once covered the tomb of this figure. It is also possible that the ridged stones with Anglo-Saxon styles of decoration on them‚Äîfor instance the Hedda Stone from Peterborough Cathedral and the St. Leonard's School Shrine from St. Andrews‚Äîmay have covered saints' graves. Records indicate that in a later period of time the ridges of the Hedda Stone collected dust which was then considered to have the power to bring about miracles; it is possible that this belief has Anglo-Saxon origins. =Minor relics= Minor relics were likely often placed within a small cavity within a stone altar, covered either with a stone or a metal plate. No English examples of this survive, although a comparable instance can be found in Petersburg-bei-Fulda in western Germany. In other cases, smaller relics were likely contained within reliquary caskets. Two likely Anglo-Saxon examples have been preserved in continental Europe. One, attributed to the second half of the eighth century, is made of walrus ivory and it located in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum in Brunswick. The other is wooden with gilded copper and contains both English runes and the English name √Üdan, likely the creator; it is located at St √âvroult at Mortain in Normandy. One possible reliquary was the gold and garnet cross‚Äîcontaining a cavity in the central boss‚Äîthat was found with St. Cuthbert's remains. =Social uses= Pontificals produced during the tenth and eleventh century demonstrate that at this point, relics were used in ceremonies to dedicate a church. Saints' relics were sometimes employed during the swearing of oaths. In 876, King Alfred the Great made the Danish Army swear upon such relics. The Bayeux Tapestry features a depiction of Harold Godwinson swearing an oath to William, Duke of Normandy over a reliquary. A number of records from the period also indicate that saints' relics sometimes played a part in ceremonies marking the manumission of slaves. They also featured in a number of recorded judicial ordeals carried out with the intention of determining whether an accused individual was innocent or guilty of a particular crime. The presence of relics is prescribed in five of the sixteen surviving texts which describe ordeal rituals from this period. Records also indicate that relics were employed during outdoor penitential processions. These include Rogation Day processions designed to promote the fertility of the land by blessing them. They also appeared in processions designed to ward off a particular threat; for instance, at his council at Bath, King √Üthelred ordered processions involving relics to counter the Viking threat. Saints and healing In various hagiographies, there are accounts of saints performing acts of healing. In most of these descriptions, those healed were ecclesiastics or members of the nobility.

History  View of the castle rock from the east (March 2011) The name of Wichsenstein Castle derives from the personal name \\"Wikker\\" and the suffix Stein or \\"Rock\\"; it was thus the castle of the Wikker family. Nuremberg Castle scholar, Hellmut Kunstmann, has ascertained that castles with the combination of a personal name and the word Stein in the Franconian region are very old.On the subject of castle names see Hellmut Kunstmann, Mensch und Burg, pp. 18ff Examples are G√∂√üweinstein Castle, which is first recorded in 1076, Hiltpoltstein Castle (1109), Gernotenstein Castle near Michelfeld, which is recorded in the foundation document of Michelfeld Abbey in 1119, and Pottenstein Castle, which was probably founded between 1057 and 1070. The purpose of Wichsenstein Castle could have been to guard an ancient road that ran from Pretzfeld and Wannbach via Wichsenstein to Biberach, Waidach and Stein bei Pegnitz, continuing into Upper Palatinate and Bohemia. When and by whom the castle was founded is not exactly known, but in 1118 a \\"Wikker\\" was mentioned in the records. It is possible that the father of Eberhard von Wikkeristein (recorded 1122) had built the castle shortly beforehand.Hellmut Kunstmann: Die Burgen der s√ºdwestlichen Fr√§nkischen Schweiz, p. 2 The Wichsensteins were ministeriales of the Bishopric of Bamberg, whose coat of arms bore a blue wolf salient on a silver field. Eberhard was named in 1121 and later as Eberhard de Lapide, which means von Stein or \\"of the rock\\". In 1133 the brothers, Eberhard and Wikker de Lapide, were named as joint witnesses in a manuscript from Ensdorf Abbey. Kunstmann was able to ascertain the reason for the change of name was that the home castle of the Wichsensteins, the little castle of Stein, today just a castle site in the village of Stein south of Pegnitz, had to be given up for unknown reasons and they had to built a new castle of their own. In 1165 as well an Eberhard II de Steine was appointed as an episcopal ministerialis, in 1201 Wikker II de Steine was a witness in a deed by Prince Bishop Timo. In 1240 Eberhard III was likewise named as a witness in a document by Frederick III Walpot for Banz Abbey. The first record of Wichsenstein Castle was not, however, until 30 October 1310, when Conrad I of Wichsenstein received 60 pounds of Haller (coins) from the Bishop of Bamberg, Wulfing of Stubenberg and in return had to \\"guard\\" the castle for ten years, i.e. fight on the side of the bishop in case of war with his part of the castle and his contingent of troops. In 1328 Bishop Henry II gave Boppo of Wichsenstein a further hundred pounds of Haller for the part of the castle enfeoffed to him. For that he had to concede right of the bishop to buy it back; after that the castle was always a freehold of the Wichsensteins. The Wichsensteins ran into financial difficulties, probably as a result of the economic boom of the towns during the 13th and 14th centuries and the great agricultural crisis of the second half of the 14th century, and became robber barons. George of Wichsenstein was at that time in the service of the brothers Henry and Eberhard of Berg, who had also become robber barons, and was taken prisoner in 1397 by King Wenceslaus following the siege of Spies Castle near Betzenstein. After he had betrayed several robber barons by name, he was executed in Nuremberg. In 1421 Hans II, Kunz IV, Fritz II and Hermann III of Wichsenstein engaged in a feud with the Bishopric of Bamberg and the Imperial City of Nuremberg. That same year John of Wichsenstein and Michael of Streitberg raided and sacked a Leipzig merchants convoy and captured several people, whereupon the castle of Wichsenstein was destroyed because of its role in the robberies by Bishop Albert of Wertheim who decreed that it could not be rebuilt without his permission. In 1432 the ruins were recorded as an episcopal fief that, if rebuilt, had to become an open house of the bishopric. In 1436 it reappeared as Schloss Wichsenstein. It was thus rebuilt within four years, but the extent of the destruction is unknown. In the years that followed, parts of the castle became a fief of the ministerialis, J√∂rg of Rabenstein, in 1476 other parts of the castle belonged to the Wichsenstein line of Bieberbach and another line, whose estate was however still a freehold. In 1484, another line of Wichsensteins was enfeoffed with the Lower Franconian castle at Hainstatt by the Bishop of W√ºrzburg. After 1507, all enfeoffment of the castle ceased. A mid-16th-century map shows the castle as a ruin; it was probably finally destroyed in 1525 during the Peasants' War. In 1609, large parts of the ruins still survived as a document about the riding estate (Rittergut) of Wichsenstein testifies. After the family line was extinguished on the death of George of Wichsenstein zu Kirchsch√∂nbach (near Prichsenstadt) in November 1606 the Rittergut was sold on 24 November 1621 by its heirs to the Bishopric of Bamberg. In the deed of sale it was shown, however, as owned by free nobility, which was not the case for an episcopal fiefdom. Also, the castle was not mentioned. In 1828 the canon (Domkapitular), Franz Karl Freiherr von M√ºnster, made the summit of the rock on which the castle stood, accessible. In 1876 large remnants of the ruins remained visible. In 1879 the state construction office in Bayreuth said that \\"apart from rocks there were still wall remains in the surrounding lower levels and in the private forest\\". Today there are no traces of the castle left. Its site, which is open to the public, is a viewing rock and may be ascended from Wichsenstein on 207 steps. The protected monument, which is described by the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection as a \\"mediaeval castle site\\", bears the monument number D-4-6233-0095.Burgstall Wichsenstein auf der Seite des Bayerischen Landesamtes f√ºr Denkmalpflege  References   Literature  * Walter Heinz: Ehemalige Adelssitze im Trubachtal ‚Äì Ein Wegweiser f√ºr Heimatfreunde und Wanderer.

History The R147 road curves around the church, suggesting that an ancient ecclesiastical enclosure has become fossilised in the street layout. Secundinus (d. 447; variously Sechnall, Seachnall, Seachnail, Secundus) was son of was a son of Restitutus, a Lombard, and Lubaid, traditionally said to be a sister of Saint Patrick and founder of a church on the site between AD 439 and 447. The name Dunshaughlin is ultimately from Domhnach Seachnall ‚Äì the church of Seachnall. The name M√°el Sechnaill ‚Äì servant of Seachnall ‚Äì was common among Kings of Tara. According to a legend recorded in An Leabhar Breac, the 7th-century Eucharistic hymn Sancti venite was first sung by angels at Dunshaughlin, after Secundinus had reconciled with his uncle Saint Patrick. The abbots of Dunshaughlin are recorded in the 9th century, beginning with Ruamnus (d. 801), and continuing to Scannal mac Fergil (murdered 886). Erenachs and coarbs (lay guardians of a parish church and headman of the family in hereditary occupation of church lands) of Dunshaughlin are recorded in AD 952, 1027 and 1040. The monastery at Dunshaughlin was burned down in raids in AD 1026, 1142 and 1143. It was also plundered by the U√≠ Bri√∫in in 1152. Dunshaughlin was also probably the church site of the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine kings of the 6th‚Äì8th century. After the Norman invasion of Ireland Dunshaughlin became a seigniorial manor of Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath. The earthwork c. 700 m to the south of the church could be a motte built by him. Thereafter, the church became parochial. A church at \\"Denclynschael\\" is listed in the ecclesiastical taxation (1302‚Äì06) of Pope Nicholas IV. James Ussher, Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh described the church and chancel of \\"Donshahlen\\" as ruined in 1622. Isaac Butler, writing in 1749, describes the church and tower as in good repair, but the chancel was ruined. The present Church of Ireland church was built in 1813 north of the older structure. Church The remains of the parish church, consisting of one pointed arch and two piers of an arcade, suggest that its nave had aisles. An octagonal limestone font has been moved to the modern church;it contained carvings in relief. Also present is a crucifixion scene carved in false relief over the lintel of a doorway.

Its efforts have also spread to the countryside and more widely. History St. Xavier's Social Service Society (SXSSS) grew out of a 1960s outreach program of students and faculty at St. Xavier's High School Loyola Hall, Ahmedabad. Over the years three areas have come to the fore: education, organizing people's groups, and people's action to improve the quality of their lives. In 1976, Fr. Erviti, founded St. Xavier's Social Service Society (SXSSS) beginning with rehabilitation work in Sankalitnagar. In 1983 it moved on to Mahajan-no-Vando and the Nagori Kabrasthan slum settlements. It also obtained its own premises apart from St. Xavier School. In 1986 Erviti died but other Jesuits carried on the leadership. The SXSSS Center for Orientation, Research, and Documentation (CORD) was founded in 1989. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) is a programme of the Indian Ministry of Human Resource Development. In 1990 SXSSS became the first accredited institute in this programme in Gujarat, with English and Hindi as a medium of instruction.NIOS. Accessed 19 August 2016. SXSSS also responds to emergency situations ‚Äì cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, and communal riots that have ravaged life in Gujarat. By 1994 the Society was active in seven major slum pockets, and had increasing manpower and resources. Funds for its food for work program come from several foreign countries. Since SXSSS is not run by Hindi or Muslims, it is seen as speaking to racial issues from a neutral perspective. Also, it has Sikhs, Jains, Hindi, and Muslims on its staff. In 1995, the organization was named the first recipient of the Anubhai Chimanlal Nagarikta Puraskar for its sustained contribution to the city of Ahmedabad. In December 2004, Jamat-e-Islam-e-Hind presented its Human Rights Award to St. Xavier's Social Service Society for unflinching service towards the cause of communal unity and human rights in the year 2002.Tongeren 2005.Oommen 2007.

It aims to do this by using photography as a tool to make these conversations accessible to everyone. This portal carries articles about wildlife, conservation, eco-travel, communities, nature art, field notes, photography tips, research etc. It also hosts a nature and wildlife photography festival in Bangalore every year. Nature inFocus (NiF) is one festival which attracts not only nature and wildlife photographers but also researchers, conservationists, activists and nature enthusiasts in general. The festival was started back in 2014, it conducted the 5th edition of the festival in September 2018. Some of the previous speakers include Romulus Whitaker, Steve Winter, Bittu Sahgal, Bikram Grewal, Bahar Dutt, Tui De Roy, Cristina Mittermeier, Mordecai Ogada, Trevor Frost, Rohan Chakravarty, Will Burrard-Lucas, Krithi Karanth, Aron Savio-Lobo. The event also conducts an annual photography competition along with the festival. Over the last four years, the NiF Photographer of the Year has been awarded to Ashwini Kumar Bhat, Kallol Mukherjee, Biplab Hazra and Pratik Pradhan.  History  Nature inFocus was founded in 2014 by Kalyan Varma and Rohit Varma, who are both wildlife photographers. On realising that there were no offline activities for the vast nature and wildlife community in the whole of Asia, the photographer- duo took it upon themselves to create a festival where photographers could showcase their work, stay informed on global happenings, meet fellow photographers, and discuss important topics. Bringing people from different disciplines together, the first edition of the Nature inFocus festival was launched in March 2014. In 2015, Nature inFocus started working towards another first for India ‚Äî nature and wildlife photography awards. Begun in 2015, the NiF Photography Awards is a six-category award ceremony that has a bracket dedicated solely to conservation-related issues. With participants from across the globe, today, to receive a NiF photography award is considered prestigious. With amazing content pouring in from the festival and the awards, NiF‚Äôs next step was to create a space that would help archive this material for the larger public experience. In the month of November 2016, NiF launched its online portal, a photo-led exploration into India‚Äôs wilderness, a definitive and democratic platform for sharing stories and photography, enabling relevant knowledge sharing and curation of everything to do with nature. A truly community-driven platform powered by its contributors. In 2017, Nature inFocus created the NiF Hive, a platform that allows you to create your online portfolio about nature photography. You can upload, share and curate your photographs under different categories, tagging and documenting your work in a strategic, relevant way. The Hive becomes your calling card, the repository of your best work in the wild. In 2018, the fifth edition of the NiF Festival took place in Bangalore with a brand new film festival and a curated photography exhibition - The Wild Nation, displaying 100 images from across the country, to celebrate the richness of India's vast and diverse wilderness.  Founders  = Rohit Varma = Rohit Varma is one of those few individuals who chose to pursue passion rather than their professional career. His love for everything nature and wildlife shouldn't surprise anyone given that he was born and raised in Balaghat, a small town bordering Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh, where natural beauty is in abundance. After successfully managing multiple roles over 15 years in companies like AMD, SanDisk, CyberMedia, Rohit decided to hang up his corporate boots and decided to pursue his passion for photography and wildlife. His work has been published in national and international media. He shares his work under creative commons. He believes that wildlife photographs can not only drive people closer to nature, they also make them experience, appreciate and conserve. His Tedx Bangalore talk on ‚ÄúHalf a flush to save the tiger‚Äù was truly thought provoking and highlighted environmental issues in a unique fashion. =Kalyan Varma= Kalyan Varma is an award winning wildlife photographer, filmmaker, naturalist and explorer specializing in environment, science and ecology in India. He freelances with many of the world's leading magazines, environmental NGOs and television channels like Nat Geo and BBC. Over the last 12 years, he has worked on many landmark blue chip wildlife series for the BBC and National Geographic channel. His work has appeared in many publications worldwide, including National Geographic, Nature, The Guardian, BBC Wildlife, GEO, Smithsonian, Lonely Planet and other magazines. Kalyan won the BBC wildlife photographer of the year in 2013 and is also the winner of photographer of the year for Sanctuary magazine, Por el Planeta Mexico and Mans World, Man of the Year.

Veeram is simultaneously made in Malayalam, Hindi, and in English with the same title. Principal photography commenced on 5 January 2016 in Thiruvananthapuram, where it was mostly shot, with other locations being Agra and Aurangabad.

Jayaraj had earlier adapted two of Shakespeare plays Othello and Antony and Cleopatra into feature films in Malayalam. Veeram, an adaptation of Macbeth was officially announced by Jayaraj in October 2015. The announcement was held during a function in Doha, organised by the executives of Chandrakala Arts, a newly formed film production company based in Qatar, who are also the investors of Veeram. Jayaraj said, the film's story is set in 13th century Kerala and will features newcomers as actors and most of the technical crew will be from the American film industry. Apart from Malayalam, the film is also made in English and Hindi for attracting international audience. The film was planned to start production in November 2015 for a mid-2016 release. =Pre-production= Pre- production underwent until early December 2015. Veeram is the fifth film in Jayaraj's Navarasa series, the story adapted from Macbeth will be set in North Malabar and Jayaraj also takes inspiration from Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads). The film will abundantly use the martial art, Kalarippayattu. Jayaraj call the film his dream project. After completing the screenplay and conceptualising a production plan, he put a newspaper advertisement in search of producers. Chandramohan D. Pilai, a Qatar-based banker and an old friend of Jayaraj replied to the ad. In fact, almost thirty years ago Pillai already had a discussion with Jayaraj for producing a film and Jayaraj was interesting in directing it. The deal was finalised after which Jayaraj invited him to India for further discussions about the film's production plans, which likely requires a high budget. Pillai formed the production company, Chandrakala Arts in India for producing the film with collaboration from two of his friends, though they do not wanted to credit their names in the film. Jayaraj himself traveled to the United States in search of technical assistance for the film. Jayaraj did not want to cast superstars or experienced actor for the film as he do not want to compromise his directorial freedom as star actors often demand alterations in script to glamourise their characters. Audition for actors was conducted in three rounds, with first one conducted in Mumbai in October 2015, and second round in Chennai, and third in Kerala. Over 4500 candidates participated in the audition. Despite the search for a newcomer, Bollywood actor Kunal Kapoor was selected to portray the protagonist. He plays the role of Chandu Chekavar, an infamous warrior in the Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads) of North Malabar region in Kerala. Kapoor's name was confirmed in late December 2015. Preparing for the role, Kunal attended a Kalaripayattu training schedule in Mumbai, who was taught by a Gurukkal from Kollam in a strict schedule which started in October 2015. He also underwent weight training and increased muscle weight for the role. Kapoor said, it is every actors wish to play Macbeth and he had a long time wish to do an action film, so when he was offered the role he immediately signed it. During preparation period, apart from his martial art training, he had a regular reading workshop with Jayaraj and also learned Malayalam. His character was reported to have a beard and a man-bun. Veeram is Kapoor's debut film in Malayalam cinema. Most of the other characters in the film were done by newcomers from Mumbai and Kerala. =Filming= Principal photography commenced on 5 January 2016 in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. The film is mostly based in the Southern region of India, the filming locations were in Thiruvananthapuram, Agra, and Aurangabad. Veeram was simultaneously made in Malayalam, Hindi and English. Kapoor's scenes were shot in such a way that they will first shoot it in Hindi, then the same scene will be re-shoot in English and finally in Malayalam, as he was most comfortable with Hindi and the least with Malayalam. The filming hours normally went up to 16 hours a day. The film was mostly shot in Thiruvananthapuram, some portions were shot in Ajanta and Ellora Caves in Aurangabad, Maharashtra and in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. The filming was completed in mid-April 2016. The film will not feature any songs unlike other Indian films. The film's stunt choreography was done by Allan Poppleton, Trefor Proud was make-up artist, music was composed by Jeff Rona, and film's colour grading was supervised by Jeff Olm. Poppleton researched on the martial art Kalaripayattu for the film for almost two months at various teaching centres. Along with the various Kalari movements, he incorporated his on style to adjust it to the camera angles. For the costumes and makeup, Trefor researched for several months. The costumes represent the clothes worn by 13th century warriors in North Malabar. Body paints and tattoos were also used to get a fierce look. The colours used resemble the ones used in various dance forms in Kerala, that including Kathakali. The film's soundtrack was an orchestral combination of traditional Maratha folk music. Veeram is the most expensive films made in Malayalam till date, made on a budget close to 35 crore (350 million). Music Former Hans Zimmer associate Jeff Rona, who debuted as an independent film composer with Ridley Scott's White Squall has composed and produced the film score. The film marks Rona's debut in Malayalam cinema and Bollywood. Release The film was initially planned as a mid-2016 release. Veeram was premiered as the opening film at the BRICS Film Festival on 2 September 2016 at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi, India. The film's theatrical release is scheduled 24 February 2017. Reception The film opened to brilliant reviews all over. Veeyen lauded the film as exceptionally good, and wrote that \\"it is no ordinary canvas that Jayaraj has mounted his epic film ‚ÄòVeeram‚Äô on, and as such it evolves into an ambitious demonstration of an idea that amazingly blends two classic tales together. Atypical in conception and phenomenal in implementation, ‚ÄòVeeram‚Äô presents you with one of the most memorable cinematographic experiences that you have witnessed ever in contemporary Malayalam cinema.\\" Even though the film opened to rave reviews, with some hailing this film as Malayalam cinema's Baahubali, Veeram was a box office failure.

A fifth brother, Julian, died shortly after arriving in Iowa. They built their first grain warehouse in the late 1850s. In 1861 they began their general store, which would in time include private banking as a part of their mercantile business. In 1908 it was incorporated by the family as the Kerndt Brothers Savings Bank. with The first floor on the north side of this building was completed in 1868, and was known as warehouses 11 and 12. The elevator portion of the building was added in 1890. It is the upper portion with the gable roof. Warehouse 13 is the section on the south side of the building that projects forward. The main floor of the building is brick, and built on a basement of native limestone. The basement is exposed in the back, and it extends to the edge of the Mississippi River. The upper section where the grain elevator was located is a frame structure that was originally faced with corrugated metal. At the time of its nomination the grain elevator machinery was still in place. The building now houses several different commercial enterprises. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and it was included as a contributing property in the Lansing Main Street Historic District in 2014.

The historian Frederik E. Schiern (1816‚Äì1882) lived in the building from 1847 until 1852. The architect Peder Malling (1787‚Äì1865) lived on the second floor in 1860‚Äì1865. Architecture The building is three floors tall and five bays wide. The facade is decorated with dour pilasters flanking the two double-wide corner bays and is tipped by a rounded wall dormer. Eight cannon balls are embedded in the masonry above the gate. They were found in the building in connection with a renovation in about 1900. The building was listed in 1918.

It was sculpted by Anthony de Francisci, following sketches by artist Harry Cochrane, from Monmouth, Maine. Officials in Maine wanted a commemorative half dollar to circulate as an advertisement for the centennial of the state's admission to the Union, and of the planned celebrations. A bill to allow such a coin passed Congress without opposition, but then the state's centennial commission decided to sell the coins for $1, double the face value. The Commission of Fine Arts disliked the proposed design, and urged changes, but Maine officials insisted, and de Francisci converted the sketches to plaster models, from which coinage dies could be made. Fifty thousand pieces, half the authorized mintage, were struck for release to the public. They were issued too late to be sold at the centennial celebrations in Portland, but eventually the coins were all sold, though relatively few went to coin collectors. Today they list for hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on condition.  Inception and legislation  Governor Carl Milliken and the council of Maine wanted a half dollar issued to commemorate the centennial of the state's 1820 admission to the Union. Initially, the idea was to have a circulating commemorative that could advertise the centennial celebrations in Maine. Later, after federal authorizing legislation for the coin was approved by Congress, the centennial commission decided to sell the coins for $1 each, rather than letting them pass from hand to hand in circulation. That legislation for a Maine Centennial half dollar had been introduced in the House of Representatives by the state's John A. Peters on February 11, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 12460. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. When the committee met, on February 23, 1920, Congressman Peters told members of the history of the state and citizens' desire to celebrate the centennial, including with a commemorative coin. He stated that he had spoken with the Director of the Mint, Raymond T. Baker, who had told Peters that he and Treasury Secretary David F. Houston planned to endorse the bill, the text of which had been borrowed from the bill authorizing the 1918 Illinois Centennial half dollar. Ohio's William A. Ashbrook recalled that he had been a member of the committee that had approved the Illinois bill; he had favored it and now favored the Maine bill. Minnesota's Oscar E. Keller asked Peters to confirm there would be no expense to the federal government, which Peters did. Clay Stone Briggs of Texas wanted to know if the Maine bill's provisions were identical to those of the Illinois act, and Peters confirmed it. On March 20, Vestal filed a report on behalf of his committee, recommending that the House pass the bill, and reproducing a letter from Houston stating that the Treasury had no objection. Three coinage bills‚ÄîMaine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary‚Äîwere considered in that order by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. After Peters addressed the House in favor of the Maine bill, Connecticut's John Q. Tilson inquired if the proposed coin would replace the existing design (the Walking Liberty half dollar) for the rest of the year; Peters explained that it would not, and that only 100,000 coins would bear the commemorative design. John Franklin Miller of Washington state asked who would bear the expenses of the coinage dies, and Peters responded that the state of Maine would. Virginia's Andrew Jackson Montague asked if the Treasury Department had endorsed the bill, and Peters informed him that both Houston and Baker had. Vestal asked that the bill be passed, but Ohio's Warren Gard had questions about what would happen to the coins once they entered circulation; Peters stated that they would, once issued, be treated as ordinary half dollars. In response to questions by Gard, Peters explained that although Maine would pay for the dies, they would become federal government property. Peters added that though there would be no statewide celebration in Maine for the centennial, there would be local observances. Gard had no further questions about the Maine bill (he would also quiz the sponsors of the Alabama and Pilgrim bills), and on Vestal's motion it passed without recorded dissent. The following day, April 22, 1920, the House reported its passage of the Maine bill to the Senate. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency; on April 28, Connecticut's George P. McLean reported it back with a recommendation that it pass. On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin bills (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate immediately, fearing that though they were on the Senate's agenda for that day, they might not be reached, and believing urgent action was required. Utah Senator Reed Smoot objected: Smoot's attempt to bring up an anti-dumping trade bill out of turn had just been objected to by Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. Smoot, however, stated if the coin bills had not been reached by about 2:00 pm, there would probably not be any objection. When McLean tried again to advance the coin bills, Kansas' Charles Curtis asked if there was any urgency. McLean replied that as the three coin bills were to mark ongoing anniversaries, there was a need to have them authorized and get the production process started. All three bills passed the Senate without opposition and the Maine bill was enacted with the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on May 10, 1920.  Preparation  Anthony de Francisci Sketches for a design were prepared by artist Harry Cochrane of Monmouth, Maine. On May 14, 1920, four days after Wilson signed the bill, Director of the Mint Baker sent them to the chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore, for an opinion as to their merits. The design had been given to Baker by Peters. Moore forwarded the sketches to the sculptor-member of the Commission, James Earle Fraser. Having received no reply, Moore on May 26 sent a telegram to Fraser telling him that the Maine authorities wanted the coins by June 28. Fraser immediately replied by telegram, that he disliked the design as it was \\"ordinary\\", and that it was an error to approve sketches; a plaster model should be made by a sculptor. Moore expanded on this in a letter to Houston the following day, \\"our new silver coinage has reached a high degree of perfection because it was designed by competent men. We should not return to the low standards which have formerly prevailed.\\" Moore in his letter urged a change of design, stating that the sketch, if translated into a coin, \\"would bring humiliation to the people of Maine\\". However, Maine officials refused and insisted on the submitted sketches. After discussions among Peters, Moore, and various officials, an agreement was reached whereby the sketches would be converted into plaster models, and Fraser engaged his onetime student, Anthony de Francisci, to do the work. The younger sculptor completed the work by early July, and the models were approved by the Commission on July 9. The Engraving Department at the Philadelphia Mint created the coin dies utilizing de Francisci's models. Either Chief Engraver George T. Morgan, or his assistant, future chief engraver John R. Sinnock, changed the moose and pine tree on the coin from being in relief (as in de Francisci's models), to be sunken into the coin. This was probably in an attempt to improve the striking quality of the coins, and if so, had limited success, as the full detail would not appear on many coins.  Design  The Seal of Maine The obverse of the Maine Centennial half dollar depicts the arms of Maine, based on the state's seal. At its center is a shield with a pine tree, sunken incuse into the coin, and below the tree a moose, lying down. The shield is flanked by two male figures, one bearing a scythe and representing Agriculture; the other, supporting an anchor, represents Commerce. Above the shield is the legend Dirigo, Latin for \\"I direct\\", and above that a five-pointed star. Below the shield is a scroll with the state's name. Near the rim are UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and HALF DOLLAR. The reverse contains a wreath of pine needles and cones (Maine is known as the Pine Tree State) around MAINE CENTENNIAL 1820‚Äì1920 as well as the various mottoes required by law to be present on the coinage. Numismatist Don Taxay, in his volume on the history of commemorative coins, speculated that \\"De Francisci did not altogether favor them\\". According to Taxay, the two human figures on the obverse \\"were too small to retain their beauty after reduction [from the plaster models to coin size] and seem trivial. The reverse, with its wreath of pine cones, is eminently uninspired.\\" Arlie Slabaugh, in his volume on commemoratives, noted that the half dollar \\"does not resemble the work by the same sculptor for the Peace dollar the following year [1921].\\" Art historian Cornelius Vermeule deprecated the Maine half dollar, but did not blame de Francisci, as the piece \\"was modeled by the sculptor according to required specifications and is therefore not considered typical of his art, or indeed of any art.\\" Vermeule stated, \\"it looks just like a prize medal for a county fair or school athletic day.\\" Nonetheless, feeling that de Francisci could have insisted on a more artistic design, Vermeule found \\"the Maine Centennial was not his shining moment\\".  Production, distribution, and collecting  De Francisci designed the Peace dollar in 1921. Celebrations for the state's centennial were held in Maine's largest city, Portland, on July 4, 1920. Peters had hoped to have the half dollars available for distribution then, but because of the design controversy, they were not. He wrote to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary M. O'Reilly on July 14, expressing his frustration at the delay and stating that though the Portland festivities had passed, the state could still get some benefit from the coins if they received them during 1920. Otherwise, \\"we might as well wait for the next Centennial [in 2020] which I judge would be more convenient and in accordance with the speed at which we are going\\". He concluded by asking that the Mint let him know of the next obstacle ahead of time. Governor Milliken also wrote, on July 20, reminding Mint officials that the coin was authorized by a special act of Congress, and asking when the first consignment would be ready. In the late summer of 1920, a total of 50,028 Maine Centennial half dollars were produced at the Philadelphia Mint, including 28 pieces reserved for inspection and testing at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. No special care was taken in the minting; they were ejected into bins and many display bag marks. They were sent to Maine and placed on sale through the Office of the State Treasurer at a price of $1. Thirty thousand sold immediately and they remained on sale through the treasurer's office until all fifty thousand were vended, though this did not happen until at least 1929. Bowers speculated that had the full 100,000 authorized coins been struck, most of the additional quantity would have been returned to the Mint and melted for lack of buyers. Many pieces were spent in the years after 1920 and entered circulation. Relatively few were sold to the coin collecting community, and the majority of surviving specimens display the effects of careless handling. The 2015 deluxe edition of Richard S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the coin at $140 to $685, depending on condition‚Äîan exceptional piece sold for $7,050 in 2014.

It was designed by Robert Ingersoll Aitken. The U.S. state of Missouri wanted a commemorative coin to mark its centennial that year. Legislation for such a coin passed through Congress without opposition, and was signed on March 4, 1921 by President Warren G. Harding on his inauguration day. The federal Commission of Fine Arts hired Aitken to design the coin, which depicted Daniel Boone on both sides. The reverse design, showing Boone with a Native American, was likely intended to symbolize the displacement of the Indians by white settlers. To increase sales, a portion of the issue was produced with the mark 2‚òÖ4, symbolic of Missouri being the 24th state. Although admired for the design, the coins did not sell as well as hoped, and almost 60 percent were returned to the Philadelphia Mint for melting. There are fewer coins with 2‚òÖ4 than without, but they remain near-equal in value.  Legislation  The State of Missouri, admitted to the Union in 1821 as part of the Missouri Compromise, wanted a commemorative coin for sale at the Missouri Centennial Exposition and State Fair, to be held in Sedalia from August 8 to 20, 1921. Legislation for such a half dollar was introduced in the Senate by that state's Selden P. Spencer on January 20, 1921, the bill being designated S. 4893. Click through on \\"66 S. 4893 - Introduced in Senate Jan. 18, 1921\\" for some information It was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. The bill was reported to the full Senate by Connecticut's George P. McLean on January 25 with an amendment reducing the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 250,000 and a recommendation that it pass. Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, who was presiding over the Senate, asked if there was objection to its passage. The Minority Leader, Democrat Oscar Underwood of Alabama, said he did not think there would be objection, but that the bill should be read first. Idaho Senator William E. Borah stated he would object if there was to be discussion of it, as the Senate had not had morning business in ten days. Borah asked McLean if he expected there would be objection to the bill, and McLean reassured the Idahoan. The bill, as amended, passed the Senate without recorded opposition. An identical bill, H. R. 15767, had been introduced in the House of Representatives on January 17, 1921. On February 10, Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures (to which the bill had been referred) reported it back to the House with an amendment identical to that approved by the Senate, and with a recommendation that the bill pass. S. 4983 had been referred to that committee after its receipt by the House, and on February 24 the Coinage Committee recommended the Senate bill pass the House, noting that the two bills were identical. S. 4893 was considered by the House of Representatives on March 2, 1921, with two days remaining in the congressional session. Ohio's Warren Gard had asked questions about previous coin bills when they passed through the House. Gard enquired of Vestal whether the Missouri bill was identical to the earlier bills, and whether it contained the same safeguards, and Vestal confirmed these. The bill was passed by the House without recorded objection, and was enacted into law with the signature of the new president, Warren G. Harding, on his inauguration day, March 4, 1921.  Preparation  While the legislation was still pending in Congress, on January 29, 1921, Senator Spencer wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), regarding the bill. Moore replied on February 2, advising that one of the few American sculptors capable of designing a coin be hired, and that the resulting work be subjected to the friendly criticism of other artists. Spencer put James Montgomery, chairman of the Missouri Centennial Commission, in touch with Moore, and on February 9, Moore made several proposals for the design, including a \\"prairie-schooner ... second, the heads of [pioneer Daniel] Boone and [early Missouri politician Thomas Hart] Benton; third, the state seal of Missouri; and fourth, the Indian pointing westward\\". The hired sculptor could choose among these concepts, Moore suggested, and decide which could be used to best effect, with Montgomery's approval and that of the Fine Arts Commission. Montgomery replied on February 16, proposing a \\"standing figure of Daniel Boone, coon skin cap, deer skin clothes, with an Indian sitting at his feet, the Missouri River flowing in front, with the bluffs on opposite side, with one star with the figures '24' in center of star. This would signify first, that the white man had supplanted the Indian in Missouri Territory.\\" Montgomery also proposed that a star with the number \\"24\\" (Missouri being the 24th state) be included in the design, but be removed from the die after 5,000 coins were struck. These would boost proceeds, helping to pay the sculptor's fee and the cost of the die, an expense estimated at $1,750. Montgomery wrote again on March 22, proposing that the words \\"MISSOURI CENTENNIAL, SEDALIA, 1921\\" appear on the coins, and if possible the centennial date of August 10 as well. The Fine Arts Commission hired Robert Ingersoll Aitken, a sculptor best known in numismatic circles for his design for the $50 Panama Pacific gold pieces. This was apparently not communicated to the Missouri commission as on May 17, James Earle Fraser, a member of the Fine Arts Commission, told Moore that he had heard that someone associated with the Missouri Centennial had made inquiries with the Medallic Art Company of New York, aimed at hiring a sculptor. Whether Moore wrote to Montgomery is unclear, but he wrote to Spencer on May 26, advising the senator that the designs had been preliminarily approved. CFA members had suggested several changes; these were implemented and, on June 9, the CFA approved the design, a decision communicated by letter that day to the Director of the Mint, Raymond T. Baker. To speed production, the Medallic Art Company produced hubs from Aitken's plaster models, from which working dies to strike the coins could be made. These hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint on June 29, 1921.  Design  The obverse depicts Daniel Boone, shown here in an unfinished portrait by Chester Harding The bust of frontiersman Daniel Boone, who lived in Missouri for the final quarter century of his life, appears on the obverse. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 book on commemorative coins, note speculation that the obverse may have been inspired by Albin Polasek's sculptured bust of Boone in the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in New York City. Boone wears a deerskin jacket and a coonskin cap. The centennial dates, the name of the country and the coin's denomination surround the bust. The reverse depicts Boone with rifle and powder horn, and a Native American‚ÄîSwiatek and Breen noted that the frontiersman appears to be sending away the Indian, who bears a shield and peace pipe, apparently dramatizing Montgomery's desire to show the white man supplanting the Indian in Missouri; Breen stated \\"as though this was something to brag about\\". The 1921 Report of the Director of the Mint describes the interaction as \\"Daniel Boone, with powder and rifle, directing the attention of an Indian to the westward course of the white man\\". The Missouri Centennial half dollar, which shows Boone on either side, is one of the few coins in United States numismatic history to have the same individual depicted on both sides; other such depictions include Boone himself on the 1934‚Äì1938 Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar, Lafayette on the 1900-dated Lafayette dollar and the frontiersman on the 1936 Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar. The 24 stars on the reverse convey the same message that the 2‚òÖ4 on the obverse of some specimens does‚Äîthat Missouri was the 24th state to enter the Union. The name SEDALIA, the site of the centennial exposition, appears in exergue. Aitken's stylized monogram, RA, is near the rifle butt. The Missouri piece, and the Columbian half dollar of 1892‚Äì1893, are the only U.S. commemorative half dollars to bear none of the patriotic mottoes usually found on U.S. coinage, that is LIBERTY, IN GOD WE TRUST and E PLURIBUS UNUM. The design was liked at the time of issue; several specimens were shown and admired at the 1921 American Numismatic Association convention at Boston in August, soon after the coin's release. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. coins and medals, admired Aitken's Missouri piece, writing that Aitken \\"became the first American medalist to apply the principles of Renaissance medallic design to a coin of the United States and the first such artist to make a frontiersman look like a Medici prince\\". He suggested that the figures on the reverse stand \\"like Roman soldiers in an Antonine relief on the Arch of Constantine or Renaissance condottieri in a large fresco of court ceremonials.\\" Vermeule noted that \\"the lettering on the obverse follows the forms and system of Pisanello\\" and that \\"the coin as a whole is a work of art rather than just another way to market a silver fifty-cent piece because all three of the mottoes that usually burden and constrict America's attempts of numismatic art are omitted.\\" The author concluded of Aitken's works, \\"his imagination in selecting from the past to rephrase the present worked very well in the United States commemorative coinage\\".  Production, distribution, and collecting  Portion of advertisement for the half dollar (1921), showing a reverse design not used by Aitken A total of 50,028 Missouri Centennial half dollars was struck at the Philadelphia Mint in July 1921, 28 being reserved for inspection and testing at the 1922 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. The first coins displayed the 2‚òÖ4 on the obverse; afterwards, this was ground off the dies and the remainder were struck without it. The Sedalia Trust Company distributed the coins at a price of $1 on behalf of the centennial commission, selling both varieties by mail and the plain ones at the exposition in August. There had been little advance publicity, and the exposition took place during the Recession of 1921. All of the 2‚òÖ4 coins sold, but when sales slowed of the plain variety, 29,600 were returned to the mint for melting. Early advertisements for the coin contained sketches prepared by Aitken, showing the obverse as issued, but depicting a reverse bearing the state Seal of Missouri, that Aitken had abandoned when he found it did not work well. Aitken, in a letter published in part in the December 1921 issue of The Numismatist (the journal of the American Numismatic Association) wrote that \\"The illustration that you published was made from one of several drawings which I submitted to the Federal Art Commission. The Missouri committee was informed that I would work along these lines, though I was given full latitude for any change I might advise. The seal of the State did not work out well, so I developed the reverse with the two standing figures, which met with the instant approval of the Commission in Washington.\\" May 1922 advertisement for the 2‚òÖ4 coins, with the design as issued The number of coins bearing the 2‚òÖ4 is uncertain. Swiatek and Breen wrote that 5,000 were struck and were sold, meaning that 15,400 of the plain ones were issued. Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, adhered to these figures. Coin dealer David Bullowa wrote in 1937 that 10,000 of the 2‚òÖ4 were issued, with which numismatic writer Q. David Bowers concurred, noting that the two varieties are about equal in rarity. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2018, estimates that 9,400 of the 2‚òÖ4 were issued, and 11,400 of the plain. Both varieties sold at a premium above the issue price by 1925, and at the height of the first commemorative coin boom in 1936, the 2‚òÖ4 sold for $25 and the plain for $28. By 1940, the 2‚òÖ4 sold for more than the plain, and at the height of the second boom in 1980, the 2‚òÖ4 brought $2,600 to the plain's $2,400. Yeoman's book lists the 2‚òÖ4 for between $625 and $7,250, and the plain for between $400 and $6,650, each depending on condition. An exceptional specimen of the plain variety sold at auction in 2015 for $70,500. At least one specimen in proof condition is known, sold at auction in 1992.

The coin was designed by Laura Gardin Fraser. Its obverse depicts John McLoughlin, who was in charge of Fort Vancouver (present- day Vancouver, Washington) from its construction in 1825 until 1846. From there, he effectively ruled the Oregon Country on behalf of the Hudson's Bay Company. The reverse shows an armed frontiersman standing in front of the fort. Washington Representative Albert Johnson wanted a coin for Fort Vancouver's centennial celebrations, but was persuaded to accept a medal instead. But when another congressman was successful in amending a coinage bill to add a commemorative, Johnson tacked on language authorizing a coin for Fort Vancouver. The Senate agreed to the changes, and President Calvin Coolidge signed the authorizing act on February 24, 1925. Fraser was engaged to design the coin on the recommendation of the United States Commission of Fine Arts. The coins were flown from the San Francisco Mint, where they were struck, to Washington state by airplane as a publicity stunt. They sold badly; much of the issue was returned for redemption and melting, and the failure may have been a factor in one official's suicide. Due to the low number of surviving pieces, the coins are valuable today.  Background  Fort Vancouver, on the north bank of the Columbia River in what is today Vancouver, Washington, lay across the river from what would become Portland, Oregon. It was founded in 1825 by the Hudson's Bay Company chief factor for the area, Dr. John McLoughlin. The company sought furs and other trade goods, and was in competition with John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company, which had an outpost at what is now Astoria, Oregon. Fort Vancouver was named for the British sea captain George Vancouver, who also gave his name to Vancouver in Canada. Until the Oregon Treaty of 1846 settled the disputed claims of the United States and Britain, McLoughlin was what government there was in the Oregon Country. McLoughlin's word was obeyed by white man and Native American alike, and there were no significant wars there in that time. Fort Vancouver became the trading center for a large area, and the largest settlement west of the Great Plains. With the coming of American rule in 1846, McLoughlin resigned from the Hudson's Bay Company, going to Iive at Oregon City, which he had founded, and became its mayor in 1851, two years after becoming a U.S. citizen. He died in 1857; a century later, the Oregon Legislature named him the \\"Founder of Oregon\\", and Fort Vancouver is now a national historic site.  Legislation  The Fort Vancouver Centennial Corporation hoped to sell commemorative half dollars at the planned celebration, and persuaded Representative Albert Johnson of Washington state to introduce legislation in the House of Representatives. In May 1924, he and Senator Wesley Jones, also of Washington state, introduced legislation in their houses of Congress for a half dollar commemorating the centennial of Fort Vancouver. The bills were not given any hearings. Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, the chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, met with Johnson and persuaded him to introduce a bill for a medal instead. Vestal reasoned that the Treasury Department was opposing more commemorative coin issues, as these were finding their way into circulation and confusing the public. On February 3, 1925, Jones introduced a bill for a medal, and on the 12th, Johnson did the same. Legislation for a Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar had been introduced by that state's senior senator, Frank Greene, and had passed the Senate. When that bill came to the floor of the House of Representatives on February 16, California Representative John E. Raker moved to amend it to provide for a California Diamond Jubilee half dollar. Vestal asked to be heard in opposition to the amendment, stating that his committee, after recommending the Vermont bill, had decided to promote no further coin bills. He added that because of this, Johnson had agreed to withdraw his bill. The Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Finis J. Garrett of Tennessee, asked why the committee had not set the rule before considering the Vermont bill, and Vestal admitted it was hard to answer. The House voted, and the amendment was added. Johnson to applause from his colleagues moved a further amendment, to add \\"and Vancouver, Wash.\\" The amendment passed, as did the bill. Johnson realized that such a simple amendment might not result in a coin being issued. He therefore returned to the House floor soon thereafter, asking that the bill be reconsidered, so he could couch his amendment in the same phrasing as for the other two coins. Once the bill was again being considered, Johnson added his amendment, but Vestal moved that the bill be returned to his committee. Vestal's motion failed, 24 ayes to 67 noes. Lengthy procedural wrangling followed over whether that vote could be objected to because there was no quorum present. Once that was resolved, the House passed the bill again. The bill was returned to the Senate the following day. Kansas's Charles Curtis moved on behalf of Greene that the Senate agree to the House amendments, and though Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon urged President Calvin Coolidge to veto it, the bill, authorizing all three coins, was enacted by the President's signature on February 24, 1925.  Preparation  Once the coin had been approved by Congress, the Centennial Corporation submitted plaster models by an unknown artist, whose initials SB appeared on the obverse. They were sent to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins. The models showed McLoughlin on the obverse and the fort stockade with Mount Hood in the background for the reverse. These designs were likely dictated by the Centennial Corporation. On May 22, the Commission rejected the models, describing them as \\"interesting\\" but stating that an experienced medalist would be needed. It recommended Chester Beach, but when the corporation tried to hire him, it turned out he was traveling. The corporation instead hired the commission's second choice, Laura Gardin Fraser, an experienced designer of commemorative coins. Since the Centennial Corporation had decided what design elements it wanted to see on the half dollar, Fraser had to do her own interpretation of the designs SB had essayed. Hired on June 15, she completed her models by July 1, when Louis Ayres, a member of the commission, came to view them. He was enthusiastic, and sent a letter to commission chairman Charles Moore to that effect, writing \\"the whole coin looks very interesting to me, and I think is mighty good.\\" The models were approved by the commission, and then by Mellon. Dies were prepared at the Philadelphia Mint, then shipped to San Francisco, where the coins were to be struck.  Design  The coin's obverse depicts John McLoughlin. The obverse features a portrait of McLoughlin, facing left. The name of his adopted country overarches him, and his name and HALF DOLLAR are below him, with the centennial dates and IN GOD WE TRUST flanking his bust. Fraser had no likenesses of McLoughlin to work with, and what she based her portrait of him on is unclear. It shows him as an older man than the 41 years he was at the time of Fort Vancouver's founding. The reverse shows an armed frontiersman, dressed in buckskins, with the stockade of Fort Vancouver behind him, and Mt. Hood in the distance. The inscription is somewhat broken up, but is intended to be read as FORT VANCOUVER CENTENNIAL VANCOUVER WASHINGTON FOUNDED 1825 BY HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY. Numismatists have debated whether the absence of a mint mark was intentional; it is the only commemorative coin issue struck at Denver or San Francisco that lacks one. The artist's initials, LGF, are at lower right on the reverse, on the other side of the circle from the date 1825. Fort Vancouver in 1841 Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 book on commemorative coins, describe Fraser's design as \\"better than anything [Chester] Beach could have come up with\\". Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on the artistry of U.S. coins and medals, deemed Fraser's half dollar \\"a most acceptable coin\\". He wrote, \\"the obverse tries Pisanello's spacing of the lettering and circumscribed roughness of the bust, while the reverse has too much scenery in the background, surrounded by too much lettering. This and the Hawaiian Sesquicentennial coin of 1928 prove that background scenery or geography ought to be omitted from commemorative half dollars\\".  Production, distribution, and collecting  Only 50,000 of the authorized mintage of 300,000 were coined, plus 28 pieces intended to be sent to Philadelphia to be available for inspection and testing at the 1926 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. The minting was done not later than August1 at San Francisco. As a publicity stunt, the entire mintage (less the 28 assay coins) was flown by air to Vancouver, Washington, by United States Army Air Corps Lieutenant Oakley G. Kelly on August 1; the shipment, including packaging, weighed . On arrival, the coins were received by Herbert Campbell, head of the centennial commission. The half dollars were intended to help pay for the centennial festivities in Vancouver. These were held from August 17 to 23, with a highlight being a pageant, \\"The Coming of the White Man\\", which was \\"based on historical fact\\". The coins were sold at $1 each; several hundred were gilded, diminishing their future value as numismatic specimens; others were kept as pocket pieces, or were spent. The poor sales caused financial problems and may have caused a suicide, for on August 22, Charles A. Watts, secretary of the Centennial Corporation and described by Campbell as the real force behind the coin, killed himself. The day before he died, he told a meeting of the corporation there were funds enough to pay all debts, and that Fraser was not owed any money. Neither proved to be the case, and unpaid bills totaled $6,000, with no money to pay them. In fact, Fraser's fee of $1,200 was outstanding, and she tried to get paid even with the half dollars, but her bill was unsatisfied until a year later, when she was paid by check. The half dollars were not owned by the corporation, as the Vancouver National Bank had advanced money for them. Sales came to a virtual halt by the end of October. Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl offered to buy the remainder of the issue at face value, but this was rejected as many people had paid $1 for their coins. A total of 35,034 pieces were sent back to the mint for redemption and melting, leaving 14,966 pieces outstanding. According to Swiatek and Breen, \\"given the remoteness and exclusively local nature of the celebration, it is surprising that as many as fourteen thousand coins were sold.\\" A sale of 1,000 coins was made to an executive of the Hudson's Bay Company, and they were placed in the Archives of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. They were stolen in 1982 by a caretaker, who spent them and redeemed some for Canadian currency at a bank. Many wound up in the hands of a coin dealer, who sold them widely. At the time, the coins were worth about US$800 each. Once the theft was realized, the Province of Manitoba filed suit to recover the remaining coins, but a settlement allowed the dealer to retain them. The coins quickly commanded a premium after their 1925 issue due to their scarcity, rising to $10 by 1928 before falling back to $7 by 1930, in uncirculated condition. They peaked at about $9 during the commemorative coin boom of 1936. They had subsided back to the $6 level by 1940, but thereafter increased steadily in value, rising to $1,600 during the second commemorative coin boom in 1980. The edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins published in 2017 lists the coin for between $300 and $975, depending on condition. A near-pristine specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $8,225.

The coin was designed by Charles Keck, and on its obverse depicts early Vermont leader Ira Allen, brother of Ethan Allen. On January 9, 1925, Vermont Senator Frank Greene introduced legislation for commemorative coins to mark the 150th anniversary of Vermont declaring itself fully independent in 1777 and of the American victory at the Battle of Bennington the same year. His bill passed the Senate without difficulty, but in the House of Representatives faced an array of problems. Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon sent a letter opposing the bill and dispatched three Treasury officials to testify against it, arguing that the public was being confused as special coin issues entered circulation. The committee's resolve to have no more commemorative coins‚Äîafter this one‚Äîdid not impress the full House, which added two more half dollars to the legislation to mark other anniversaries. The Senate agreed to the changes, and President Calvin Coolidge signed the authorizing act on February 24, 1925. There was a lengthy battle over the design between the Commission of Fine Arts and the Vermont commission in charge of organizing the coin issue, as a result of which the original designer, Sherry Fry, left the project, replaced by Keck. Although the eventual reverse design of a catamount satisfied the Fine Arts Commission, it has been severely criticized by later writers. The coins did not sell out; over a fourth of the issue was returned for redemption and melting. The coins sell for at least in the hundreds of dollars today, depending on condition.  Background  In the days before the American Revolutionary War, the ownership of what is now the state of Vermont was uncertain. New Hampshire claimed it, deeming its own western boundary to be east of the Hudson River; the colony of New York believed it owned the territory north of Massachusetts east to the Connecticut River. British authorities awarded the land to New York in 1764, but settlers felt more affinity with New Hampshire, from which they had secured land grants. When New York issued grants for the same real estate, there was conflict between the two groups of settlers, and those deriving title from New Hampshire organized the Green Mountain Boys, a local militia. At first, the Boys concentrated on fending off unwanted settlers from New York, but after the war began in 1775, they turned their attention to the British. Brothers Ira and Ethan Allen were born in Connecticut, and were leaders of the Green Mountain Boys. Ethan Allen led an ill-advised raid on Montreal in 1775, was captured, and spent the remainder of the Revolutionary War a prisoner of the British. Ira Allen, besides being a military leader, was a member of the convention that declared Vermont independent in January 1777. A key player in Vermont politics in the Revolutionary War years, Allen served as state treasurer, designed the great seal, and in the 1780s surveyed several towns, three of which are named for him: Ira, Irasburg and Alburg, Vermont, the last likely a shortened form of \\"Allenburgh\\". In 1791, the year Vermont was admitted to the Union, he was the principal founder of the University of Vermont, the first university in what is now the United States to have a religious nondiscrimination policy. Thereafter his fortunes declined: he went to France in 1796 to buy weapons for the state militia, but his ship and cargo were taken by the British. He returned to Vermont to find his land seized for taxes, and was put in jail in Burlington for debt. He fled to Philadelphia, where he hoped to reverse his fortunes but was unable to; he died there impoverished in 1814. In 1777, the British general, John Burgoyne, advanced south from Canada, hoping to divide the colonies by capturing the Hudson Valley in what is called the Saratoga Campaign. Low on supplies, he heard of a poorly-guarded American depot at what is now Bennington, Vermont, and sent part of his force to secure it. Vermonters were joined by some 1,500 New Hampshire militiamen, and on August 16, 1777, the Battle of Bennington took place. About 200 of the British forces were killed and 700 taken prisoner; only 40 Americans were killed. Weakened by the losses and the failure to obtain supplies, Burgoyne was defeated at the Battle of Saratoga in New York state that October, an American victory that historian Edmund Morgan deemed \\"a great turning point of the war, because it won for Americans the foreign assistance [from France] which was the last element needed for victory\\".  Legislation  Legislation for a silver fifty-cent piece and a gold one-dollar piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversaries of the Battle of Bennington and of the independence of Vermont was introduced in the Senate by that state's Frank Greene on January 9, 1925. Greene had not always been a friend to commemorative coins: when the Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar was debated in 1922, he commented, \\"the question is whether the United States Government is going to go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this‚Äîwell‚Äîharlotry.\\" His bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. Greene, a member of that committee, reported the bill back to the Senate on January 20, with an amendment and a recommendation that it pass. The amendment deleted the proposed one-dollar piece and increased the mintage of the half dollar from 20,000 to 40,000. On January 24, New Hampshire's George H. Moses, acting on Greene's behalf, moved that the Senate consider the bill, and it passed that body without opposition. After the House received the Senate-passed bill, it was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on January 30, with the chairman, Indiana Representative Albert H. Vestal, presiding. He introduced into the record a letter from Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, opposing the measure. Mellon noted that many commemorative issues had failed to sell out, leaving coins in the Mint or returning them for melting. Mellon felt that the public was being confused as surplus commemoratives entered circulation. The Treasury had sent three officials, Mint Director Robert J. Grant, Assistant Director Mary M. O'Reilly and Garrard B. Winston, the assistant to the Undersecretary of the Treasury. O'Reilly, who had been with the Treasury longer than the other two, addressed the committee, warning that there were six coinage bills before Congress, and that the Mint had struck nine commemoratives in the past five years. She answered questions from the congressmen on the panel. Vermont Representative Frederick G. Fleetwood addressed the committee. O'Reilly had indicated that coins were being requested for local celebrations, and Fleetwood stressed the importance in American history of the events that were being commemorated. Vestal and others supported a ban on the committee passing further commemorative coin bills, but wanted the Vermont bill to pass. For one thing, as Massachusetts' Robert M. Leach noted, President Calvin Coolidge was a Vermonter by birth. The Treasury officials were willing to support striking a medal rather than a coin, but as Illinois' Morton D. Hull pointed out, the sellers preferred a coin that could be spent if there was an unsold surplus, over a medal that could not. Leach's attitude toward approving more commemorative coins was typical: \\"I believe we have been going too fast, and I believe at some time we ought to quit it, but I dislike quitting on these gentlemen representing the State of Vermont this morning.\\" Vestal issued a report the same day, stating that the committee was against more commemorative coin issues, but that the Bennington issue should pass because of the national importance of the events of 1777, and because the issue of 40,000 was relatively small. The bill came to the floor of the House of Representatives on February 16. As soon as the bill was read, California Representative John E. Raker pressed an amendment to provide for a California Diamond Jubilee half dollar. He explained that Senator Samuel Shortridge had gotten a bill through the Senate that was nearly identical to his amendment, and \\"the Senator is exceptionally anxious that it go through.\\" Vestal asked to be heard in opposition to the amendment, stating that his committee, after recommending the Bennington bill, had decided to promote no further coin bills. He added that because of this, Washington Representative Albert Johnson had agreed to withdraw his bill for a commemorative honoring the centennial of Fort Vancouver, in his state. The Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Finis J. Garrett of Tennessee, asked why the committee had not set the rule before considering the Bennington bill, and Vestal admitted that was hard to answer. The House voted, and the California amendment was added. But Representative Johnson to applause from his colleagues moved a further amendment, to add \\"and Vancouver, Wash.\\" (that is, the state of Washington) The amendment passed, as did the bill. Johnson realized that such a simple amendment might not result in a coin being issued, and returned to the House floor soon thereafter, asking that the bill be reconsidered, so he could couch his amendment in the same phrasing as for the other two coins. Once the bill was again being considered, Johnson added his amendment, but Vestal moved that the bill be returned to his committee. His motion failed, 24 ayes to 67 noes. Lengthy procedural wrangling followed over whether that vote could be objected to because there was no quorum present. Once this was resolved, the House passed the bill again. The bill was returned to the Senate the following day. Kansas' Charles Curtis moved on behalf of Greene that the Senate agree to the House amendments, and the bill, authorizing all three coins, was enacted by Coolidge's signature on February 24, 1925. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 book on commemoratives, state that the bill would probably not have passed Congress if Coolidge had not been known to have an interest in the Bennington observances.  Preparation  Statue of Ira Allen by Sherry Fry (1921) After the approval of the legislation, the Vermont Sesquicentennial Commission moved quickly to secure designs to be used for the half dollar. Members decided to have the coin show Ira Allen on the obverse, and the Battle of Bennington Monument on the reverse. They commissioned Sherry Fry, who had created a statue of Allen for the University of Vermont, to design the coin. On July 1, 1925, Fry wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts (charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins), informing him that the models would be ready in about a week. Louis Ayres, a member of the Fine Arts Commission, and James Earle Fraser, a former member, viewed the models before they were sent, and did not approve of them. Ayres wrote to Moore on July 15, stating that the designs were mediocre, but that it was not entirely Fry's fault, as the Sesquicentennial Commission had dictated the designs. Moore wrote to Mint Director Grant on the 18th, noting the problem, and relaying a suggestion from Ayres, that sketches be approved by the Mint before the artist spent time and effort on making plaster models, and that Fry be allowed to make designs of his own choosing. In spite of this, Fry formally submitted photographs of his models on August 9. Once the Mint had established that Fry had the authority to act, O'Reilly sent them to the Fine Arts Commission for its verdict. On September 5, Moore replied, rejecting the models on several grounds. The Fine Arts Commission questioned the choice of Allen, did not like the lettering, objected to the misspelling of Bennington as \\"Bennigton\\", and had mistaken the monument for the one erected for the Battle of Lake Champlain, and thus felt that there was an issue regarding relevance. On September 11, the chairman of the Sesquicentennial Commission, John Spargo, wrote to Grant, pointing out the error and strongly defending the choices of Allen and the monument. He wrote again on the 15th, this time directly to Moore, \\"your commission has touched the pride of the Vermonter there, with a rather rough hand.\\" Moore wrote to Spargo on September 18, stating that his commission had approved the head of Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to get right a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the talent to design a handsome coin, but had not done so. The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, the use of a Green Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck. Keck repurposed his rejected design for the half dollar as one side of the official medal. It was not until March 24, 1926, that new models, by Keck, were sent to the Fine Arts Commission. Although the commission admired Keck's portrait of Allen, they disliked his choice of Fay's Tavern for the reverse, and also disliked his enclosing the building in a wreath. On April 2, Moore wrote to Keck, advising him to get rid of both, and to put in place of the building a catamount, which would make a coin one could admire. The animal is a reference to Fay's Tavern, that was also known as the Catamount Tavern, and was a place where the Green Mountain Boys met. A copy of the letter was sent by Keck to Spargo, who wrote to Moore on the 12th, suggesting the Fine Arts Commission was overstepping its bounds by trying to dictate the design, but to resolve the matter, he would agree to the catamount: \\"Life is too short to be spent in futile argument with the Commission of Fine Arts.\\" By the end April 1926, Keck had prepared three models, two with the catamount and a third featuring Revolutionary War memorabilia. The Commission on the 30th approved one showing a walking catamount for the reverse, and asked that the words FOUNDER OF VERMONT be removed and IRA ALLEN be substituted. The Vermont commission objected, and the matter was resolved by the name being added. E PLURIBUS UNUM and IN GOD WE TRUST also had to be added to the reverse; Keck promised completion within several days when he wrote to Grant on May 24, with photographs to be submitted to Secretary Mellon for final approval. In July, Spargo wrote to Grant, advising him of how the coins would be distributed and making arrangements to secure the first coins struck, to be used for presentations. The Medallic Art Company of New York reduced Keck's plaster models to coin- sized hubs from which dies could be made by the Philadelphia Mint.  Design  The obverse features an idealized portrait of Ira Allen, one different from the one Fry had used in his statue and models. Allen wears a periwig, and below his head appears his name. The words FOUNDER OF VERMONT and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA surround his portrait. The reverse features a catamount, facing and walking to the left. The animal is virtually penned in with lettering, with BATTLE OF BENNINGTON, IN GOD WE TRUST and the anniversary dates above him, E PLURIBUS UNUM and HALF DOLLAR below, AUG. 16 (representing the battle's date) below its head, and the designer's initials, CK, between its rearmost paw and the end of its tail. Keck's design has been widely criticized, often because of the catamount‚ÄîSwiatek and Breen summed up the coin as \\"an almost unrecognizably idealized Ira Allen, mated with an equally unrecognizably idealized wildcat. We cannot be sure of the species: cougar? panther? puma?\\" Q. David Bowers described the reverse as bearing \\"a large catlike animal of uncertain species, which had nothing to do with the history of Vermont being commemorated but was a rebus for the Catamount [Fay's] Tavern, a subtlety lost on just about everyone who saw it\\". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume about U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the Vermont coin \\"is spoiled by an excess of lettering on both sides ... It seems superfluous to have to state on the obverse that Ira Allen was 'Founder of Vermont'.\\"  Production, distribution, and collecting  A total of 40,034 Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during January and February 1927, with the excess over the round number reserved for inspection and testing at the 1928 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were distributed by local banks, which charged $1 per coin, and they sold principally to Vermonters. The distribution was coordinated by the Bennington Battle Monument and Historical Association of Bennington, Vermont. Four banks in Bennington each received 2,000 coins for distribution, as did four banks in Rutland. In 1929, the Bennington group was selling the coins by mail at a charge of $1.25 per coin by registered mail and $1 per coin for ten or more if the buyer paid for conveyance by an express company. Sales were not as robust as hoped. In November 1928, Spargo wrote to Mint Director Grant, requesting information on how to return several thousand coins, and by 1934, a total of 11,892 pieces had been returned to the Mint for redemption and melting. Profits from the coin went to the Vermont Historical Trust, and were used to benefit museums and historical societies in the state, including the Bennington Museum. Swiatek and Breen, alluding to the scandals that embroiled other commemorative coins, noted that \\"it is a testimony to something or other in Vermont that there was never the faintest breath of suspicion at any time about anything connected with the distribution of the coins.\\" By 1935, the coins, in uncirculated condition, sold for about $2, a price increased by fifty cents during the commemorative coin boom of 1936. They had subsided to the $2 level by 1940, but thereafter increased steadily in value, peaking at $825 during the second commemorative coin boom in 1980. The 2018 edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2017, lists the coin for between $250 and $750, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $7,344.

It depicts The Rt Hon. The 2nd Baron Baltimore on the obverse and the Coat of Arms of Maryland on the reverse. The Maryland Tercentenary Commission sought a coin in honor of the 300th anniversary of the arrival of English settlers in Maryland. The state's two senators introduced legislation for such a piece, and it passed both houses of Congress with no opposition. A design had already been prepared by Professor Hans Schuler; it passed review by the Commission of Fine Arts, though there was controversy then and since over whether Lord Baltimore, a Cavalier and Catholic, would have worn a collar typical of Puritans. The Commission sold about 15,000 of the full issue of 25,000 for $1 each (), and thereafter discounted the price for large sales to dealers and speculators, getting as little as sixty-five cents per coin. They increased in value over time, and are now valued in the low hundreds of dollars. Background The Maryland Tercentenary Commission, responsible for organizing observances of the 300th anniversary of the 1634 arrival of English settlers in what is now the state of Maryland, desired a commemorative half dollar to mark the occasion. Maryland's early settlers had founded St. Mary's City on land granted by King Charles I to Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. The Tercentenary Commission wanted to use profits from the coin to defray the expenses of the anniversary celebrations. As well as seeking the coin, the commission requested that a commemorative postage stamp be issued. In 1934, commemorative coins were not sold by the government‚ÄîCongress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Maryland half dollar, the responsible group was the Tercentenary Commission, acting through its president or secretary. Legislation On March 6, 1934, Maryland's two senators, Millard E. Tydings and Phillips Lee Goldsborough, introduced a bill for a half dollar in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the founding of Maryland; it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. That committee issued a report on March 13, through Senator Goldsborough, recommending the bill pass without amendment. The bill was brought to the Senate floor on March 20, and passed without any recorded discussion.1934 Congressional Record, .ol. 78, p. 4890 (March 20, 1934) The bill was transmitted to the House of Representatives and referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. That committee issued a report on April 25, 1934, through New York Representative Andrew Somers, recommending the bill pass, but with several amendments, including increasing the authorized mintage from 10,000 to 25,000 and requiring that the federal government would not pay for the coinage dies and other preparations for the coinage. Somers brought the bill to the House floor on May 2, and when he asked the House to consider it, Sam Rayburn of Texas stated that if there was to be debate, he would object. Somers stated that to his knowledge, there would be no debate. Thomas L. Blanton, also of Texas, proposed an amendment to increase the mintage further to 100,000, but this was merely pro forma, to be able to ask Somers questions. Somers stated that the figure of 25,000 had been arrived at in consultation with the Treasury Department. Blanton felt there was a need for more silver coins in circulation, but he and Somers agreed that commemorative coins, which rarely entered circulation and were generally picked out quickly, were not the answer. He withdrew his amendment, and the bill passed without further discussion.1934 Congressional Record, vol. 78, p. 7916 (May 2, 1934) As the two houses of Congress had passed versions of the bill that were not identical, it returned to the Senate. On May 3, Goldsborough moved that the Senate accept the House's amendments, and the bill passed without debate.1934 Congressional Record, vol. 78, p. 7992 (May 3, 1934) The bill, authorizing 25,000 half dollars, passed into law on May 9, 1934 with the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Preparation Lord Baltimore, by Soest, was used as the basis of the obverse. Designs for the coin had been prepared while the bill was pending, and on May 9, the date of passage, the secretary of the Commission of Fine Arts, Hans Caemmerer, sent a telegram to its sculptor-member, Lee Lawrie, stating that the Treasury Department needed an immediate answer as to whether the designs were suitable. Lawrie journeyed by train to Philadelphia to visit the Mint there and confer with the Chief Engraver, John R. Sinnock. Lawrie made several suggestions, including deleting a dot between the words and and respacing the letters in those words. The coin's designer, Hans Schuler of the Maryland Institute College of Art, made changes and brought the coin's plaster models back to the mint on the 14th; Sinnock generally approved of the changes but Lawrie had further suggestions, including moving the words from the reverse to the obverse, adjacent to Lord Baltimore, who had decreed religious freedom in Maryland. He also felt that Lord Baltimore's garments were not accurate, since he was portrayed with a broad collar Lawrie deemed more typical of Puritans rather than Cavaliers such as Baltimore, a Catholic. Schuler made the lettering changes, but would not accept the criticism of the collar, stating that he had based his depiction on a well-known painting of Baltimore by Gerard Soest. Lawrie did not argue further, and with the Tercentenary Commission anxious to have the coins struck as quickly as possible, the Commission of Fine Arts gave its approval. To save time, coinage dies for the issue were prepared by the Medallic Art Company of New York. Design Colonial penny issued by Lord Baltimore, as seen in a 19th-century book The obverse shows The 2nd Baron Baltimore. Since the time of issue, some numismatic writers have criticized the manner in which he is depicted, especially his collar. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their joint work on commemorative coins, state that Schuler's reliance on the Soest painting \\"does not excuse the Puritan collar worn by Lord Baltimore, the Cavalier of Cavaliers. Schuler would have done better to go to Lord Baltimore's own coins, which show a very different portrait.\\" Don Taxay noted, \\"since Calvert's own coinage depicts him in a loosely draped garment, the [Fine Art] Commission's objection to the puritan collar was probably well founded.\\" The reverse side features the Coat of Arms of Maryland; the arms of Lord Baltimore quartered with those of his wife. The Maryland piece and the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar (1936) are the only U.S. coins to have a cross as part of the design. The state motto appears on the ribbon beneath the arms, , sometimes translated from Italian as \\"deeds are manly, words womanly\\". Swiatek and Breen noted in 1981 that the state \\"has not shown any disposition to repudiate this sexist rubbish\\". The Maryland General Assembly in 2017 passed an act disavowing that translation, saying it meant \\"strong deeds, gentle words\\". The sculptor's initials, , are found next to the M in , on the reverse. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. commemorative coins and medals, complained that the Maryland piece \\"looks more like an advertising medal than a commemorative half-dollar\\". He deemed the obverse conventional \\"save for the facing bust, which has been so often taken for good design by mediocre medalists\\". The reverse, which Vermeule called \\"standard fare\\" on numismatic items, \\"could almost be a policeman's badge\\". Production and distribution The United States Post Office Department issued this stamp for the 300th anniversary of Maryland. In July 1934, the Philadelphia Mint struck 25,000 Maryland half dollars, plus 15 extra that would be held for inspection and testing at the 1935 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were delivered to the Tercentenary Commission on July 10, and were put on sale at $1 each. This made the Maryland coin the first authorized under the Roosevelt administration to be issued; the Texas Centennial half dollar had been authorized by Congress in 1933, but would not be struck until October 1934. By the end of 1934, about 15,000 Maryland half dollars had been sold. By this time, the tercentenary celebrations had ended, and the commission lowered the price to $.75. The price was lowered even more, to $.65, and the commission exhausted its stock. When Texas coin dealer Lyman W. Hoffecker enquired in May 1935, the commission advised him it was sold out, and that about 8,000 had been sold in bulk to dealers. Hoffecker testified before Congress in March 1936 about commemorative coin abuses, and stated that he had learned that about 1,000 had gone to a dealer in the Southwest, and when he visited the Tercentenary Commission's offices, the elevator operator told him he had bought 500 to lay aside for the future. The Maryland Tercentenary half dollar sold at retail for about $1.50 in 1935, but had fallen back to about $1.25 in uncirculated condition in 1940. It thereafter increased in value, selling for about $10 by 1955, and $300 by 1985. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2018, lists the coin for between $130 and $325, depending on condition. Between two and four pieces are known in proof condition, including two that had belonged to Chief Engraver Sinnock. One such specimen sold at auction for $109,250 in 2012.

The obverse depicts Boone while the reverse depicts a frontiersman (Boone) standing next to an Indian Chief (Shawnee Chief Black Fish) in front of a stockade on the left and the rising Sun on the right. History Sculptor Henry Augustus Lukeman was hired by the Kentucky Daniel Boone Bicentennial Commission to prepare designs for the upcoming commemorative coin honoring the frontiersman. Although Lukeman ignored many of their artistic requirements for the coin, the Commission eventually conceded and Lukeman's designs, after minor changes, were approved. The profits from the sale were distributed to the \\"Daniel Boone Bicentennial Commission\\" and the \\"Pioneer National Monument Association\\" in Lexington, Kentucky. The coins were struck only at the Philadelphia mint that year, and all were sold by the end of the year. In early 1935, production continued, this time with the coins being struck at all three mints. That same year, the coin's reverse design was modified when C. Frank Dunn, the secretary of the Boone Bicentennial Commission, used his connections in Congress to get new legislation approved stating in part: > That, insomuch as the annual change in coinage date required by law has > caused the removal of the commemorative date of 1934 from the design > originally approved and in use for the coinage of the 50-cent pieces > commemorating the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of Daniel Boone‚Ä¶ it > is herby authorized to supplement said design so that the reverse of said > 50-cent pieces will show the figures \\"1934\\" immediately above the words > \\"PIONEER YEAR\\". The legislation passed on August 26, 1935, and as a result, an additional 10,008 coins were minted at Philadelphia, with 2,003 being minted at Denver and 2,004 at San Francisco. Dunn advertised these coins as rarities, and the pair (consisting of coins with and without the \\"1934\\") was sold for $3.70. Although collectors ordered this extra issue in order for their sets to be complete, most were frustrated when their orders were returned unfilled by the commission, which claimed that all of the branch mint pieces were sold in pre- order sales. As a result, many collectors, sensing fraud from the commission, turned to the secondary market. Although the coins were available on the secondary market, they were sold at many times their initially advertised price. Frustration was further compounded when rumors circulated that the commission had distributed only around 25% of the branch mint issues and held the remaining coins to be released to dealers and speculators after the price had significantly risen. Production of the Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar continued into the following three years. Although Dunn initially announced production would end in 1937, the following year more coins would be minted. However, the 1937 and 1938 were largely shunned by collectors and did not sell well, resulting in many being returned to the mint and melted.

The coin was designed by Henry Kreis and commemorates the 300th anniversary of the founding of Connecticut. Its obverse depicts the Charter Oak, where according to legend Connecticut's charter was hidden to save it from being confiscated by the English governor-general. An eagle appears on the coin's reverse side. The Connecticut Tercentenary Commission wanted a half dollar issued, with proceeds from its sale to further its projects. A bill passed through Congress without dissent and became law on June 21, 1935, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it, providing for 25,000 half dollars. Kreis's design was a Public Works Administration project and technically in violation of the new law, which said the federal government was not to pay for its design. Nevertheless, the design was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts, and then by the Treasury Department. The Philadelphia Mint initially coined 15,000 pieces, but when they quickly sold, the Connecticut commission ordered the 10,000 remaining in the authorization. These were soon exhausted as well. Kreis's design has generally been praised by numismatic writers. The coins sold for $1, but have gained in value over the years and sell in the hundreds of dollars, depending on condition.  Background  Although settlers had been drifting in for years before then, 1635 is recognized as the year of the founding of Connecticut, for in that year John Winthrop the Younger was recognized as the first governor in the future state of Connecticut. No charter was granted at that time, and Connecticut could still have been absorbed into the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Following the Restoration of Charles II, Winthrop went to England where he was able to secure a charter for Connecticut, signed by the king, dated May 10, 1662. The 1999 Connecticut entry in the 50 State Quarters series also displays the Charter Oak. Following Charles' death, James II came to the throne. In 1686, he consolidated the New England colonies into the Dominion of New England, naming Sir Edmund Andros as governor-general. The colonial charters were to be revoked, and when Andros came to Connecticut, he planned to take its charter. By legend, when he announced his intent during a meeting on October 31, 1687, the candles in the room were suddenly extinguished, and Joseph Wadsworth bore the document away and hid it in a cavity in the Charter Oak, a white oak as old as 1,000 years on the property of the Wyllys family. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which overthrew James, the charter was brought forth again. The Charter Oak was uprooted in a storm on the night of August 21, 1856. In 1935, it was not the practice of the government to sell commemorative coins. Congress, during the early years of commemorative coinage, usually designated a specific organization allowed to buy them at face value and to sell them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Connecticut Tercentenary half dollar, the enabling legislation specified it was to be the Connecticut Tercentenary Commission, and that the proceeds were to go towards financing the commission's projects.Statute authorizing the half dollar,  Legislation  Legislation for a Connecticut Tercentenary half dollar was introduced in the House of Representatives by that state's Francis T. Maloney on March 26, 1934. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported back from the committee on April 30 by New York's Andrew Somers with a one-page report recommending that the bill pass after being amended. The most significant changes were an increase in the authorized mintage from 10,000 to 25,000 and a requirement that the Federal government not be put to any expense in the creation of the models from which dies to strike the coins could be prepared. Thus, the Tercentenary Commission was supposed to pay for a sculptor to design the coin. The bill was considered by the House of Representatives on May 21, 1934. There was no debate; the only questions were by William McFarlane of Texas, asking if the coin would cost the federal government anything and if Connecticut was paying the expenses. Maloney assured him on these points, and the bill passed, as amended.1934 Congressional Record, Vol. 78, Page 9181 (May 21, 1934) (subscription required) The bill was transmitted to the Senate for its consideration and was referred to its Committee on Banking and Currency. On June 1, Connecticut Senator Frederic Walcott reported the bill back to the Senate with a recommendation that it pass,1934 Congressional Record, Vol. 78, Page 10174 (June 1, 1934) (subscription required) and on June 13, it did so, without any recorded debate or questions.1934 Congressional Record, Vol. 78, Page 11276 (June 13 1934) (subscription required) President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 21.  Preparation  The design of the Connecticut Tercentenary half dollar was a Public Works Administration project, and as such was a technical violation of the requirement that the federal government not pay for the design. The Tercentenary Commission hired Henry Kreis to do the work, generally supervised by Paul Manship, a noted medalist. In November 1934, Samuel H. Fisher, head of the Tercentenary Commission, contacted Eggerton Swartwout, who was a member of the Commission of Fine Arts. The latter commission was charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins. Swartwout set out the procedure to Fisher and told him that the commission member likely to take the leading role was sculptor Lee Lawrie. Fisher sent photographs of Kreis's plaster models to Swartwout and Lawrie, as well as to Fine Arts Commission chairman Charles Moore and to Acting Director of the Mint Mary M. O'Reilly. Lawrie had a number of criticisms, feeling the eagle's head and feet were more like those of a hawk and that the stars between the eagle and the name of the country were so small as to be indistinguishable. Swartwout wrote to Moore on the 15th, telling him that the coin was strongly supported by art history Professor Theodore Sizer of Yale University, a member of the Tercentenary Commission. The Fine Arts Commission viewed the models on December 6 and approved them subject to Lawrie's criticisms being addressed, which they were, for the most part. Lawrie had disliked the broken branch on the right side of the Charter Oak and wanted it changed, but this was not done. The final models were approved by the Fine Arts Commission in early February, and the Treasury Department added its endorsement on February 6. The models were reduced to coin-sized hubs by the Medallic Art Company of New York; these were shipped to the Philadelphia Mint and used to make dies with which to strike the coins.  Design  Charles Brownell's painting of the Charter Oak The obverse of the coin depicts the Charter Oak and is based on a painting by Charles DeWolf Brownell, who had begun his work in 1855, a year before lightning felled the tree. Below the ground that surrounds the base of the tree is CONNECTICUT 1635‚Äì1935; surrounding the Charter Oak are its name, IN GOD WE TRUST and LIBERTY. The reverse depicts an eagle upon a rocky mound. The name of the country and the denomination of the coin surround the eagle, with E PLURIBUS UNUM to the left of the bird's legs. Thirteen stars lie between the eagle and the lettering, but are so faint as to be invisible on some strikings. Stuart Mosher, in his 1940 book on commemoratives, described the Connecticut piece as \\"among the most handsome of the entire series. The very simplicity with which the artist has portrayed the massive oak is pleasing to the most critical.\\" In anticipation of a complaint that the leaves on the oak were proportionately larger than they should be, Professor Sizer had told Swartwout that they needed to be enlarged to show at all, something Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 book on commemorative coins, call \\"perfectly good grounds\\". The cavity in the oak is also exaggerated in size. Q. David Bowers, in his book on commemorative coins, describes the eagle as being \\"of starkly modernistic form (somewhat similar to the eagle motifs used in Germany at the time)\\". Kreis would use a very similar eagle when he designed the 1936 Bridgeport half dollar. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on the artistry of U.S. coins and medals, stated that Kreis \\"used the great oak ... as a most effective composition on the obverse, and a massive eagle, thrusting like a rocket, on the reverse\\". He noted, \\"all elements of the Connecticut Tercentenary coin blend superbly, the mottos and aphorisms disappearing amid the leafy clusters on the obverse and the balance of the opposite side as successful as for the Eagle of 1907 (by Augustus Saint-Gaudens)\\".  Production, distribution, and collecting  Initially only 15,000 of the authorized quantity of 25,000 were struck at the Philadelphia Mint, as this was the quantity the Tercentenary Commission at first ordered. These were struck not later than April 10, 1935, and were sent at the commission's request to the Hartford National Bank and Trust Company, distributing agent for the coin. Placed on sale on April 21, they were rapidly exhausted, and on April 25, Fisher ordered the remaining 10,000. The commission had enquired as to the possibility of having the coins struck at different mints and in proof condition, but was told that the heavy volume of work at the Mint forbade having those done. The price per coin was $1. In addition to the coins sent to Hartford, the Mint struck 18 pieces, reserved for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. The United States Post Office Department issued a three-cent stamp for the anniversary on April 26, 1935, also depicting the Charter Oak. The three-cent stamp issued for the Connecticut Tercentenary, displaying the Charter Oak Six banks in Connecticut distributed the coin through their branches, placing them in small boxes that bear the selling bank's name. Mail orders were taken through the Hartford National Bank's Main Street branch. The coins sold mostly to residents of Connecticut; the coin collecting community took only a few thousand. By July 1935, they were sold out but for a few the Tercentenary Commission was reserving for presentation to dignitaries; even those few were apparently gone by September. According to Q. David Bowers, \\"there was never any problem concerning profiteering, exploitation, or anything else connected with this issue\\". Swiatek, in his later book on commemoratives, noted, \\"the Connecticut Tercentenary Commission did a fantastic job in distributing a large percentage of this issue to Connecticut residents.\\" The coins quickly commanded a premium after their 1935 issue, rising to $6 during the commemorative coin boom of 1936. They had subsided back to the $2.50 level by 1940, but thereafter increased steadily in value, rising to $730 during the second commemorative coin boom in 1980. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2015, lists the coin for between $260 and $700 each depending on condition. The coin with the highest grade known sold at auction in 2002 for $9,487.

The coin was designed by Chester Beach. Its obverse depicts the Half Moon, flagship of Henry Hudson, after whom the city of Hudson, New York is named. In addition to showing the ship, the coin displays a version of the Hudson city seal, with Neptune riding a whale, a design that has drawn commentary over the years. Although the city of Hudson was a relatively small municipality, legislation to issue a coin in honor of its 150th anniversary went through Congress without opposition and was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, becoming the Act of May 2, 1935. In June 1935, 10,000 Hudson half dollars were distributed to civic authorities for sale to the public. Most of the coins were likely bought by coin dealers, leaving few for collectors, with the result that prices spiked from the $1 cost at the time of issue. This caused anger among coin collectors at the time, but the coin's value has increased steadily since then.  Background and legislation  Hudson, New York, the seat of Columbia County, lies on the east bank of the Hudson River, some south of Albany. It was founded in 1662 under the name Claverack Landing. Originally a trading post for the Rensselaer family, it saw considerable expansion in the early 1780s and was incorporated under the name Hudson in 1785. During the 1930s, it had about 14,000 residents. In 1935, commemorative coins were not sold by the government‚ÄîCongress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Hudson half dollar, the responsible official or group was to be designated by the Mayor of Hudson. A bill for a half dollar to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of Hudson was introduced in the House of Representatives by New York Congressman Philip A. Goodwin on March 6, 1935, and provided for 6,000 pieces. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. Goodwin was the longtime president of the Greene County Historical Society, and introduced the bill as a favor for friends in nearby Hudson. A report was issued by Missouri's John J. Cochran, acting chairman of the committee, on April 2, 1935, recommending that the bill pass with an amendment increasing the mintage to 10,000, and noting that Goodwin had appeared before the committee to pledge that the entire quantity struck would be taken up by the city authorities, and thus there would be no coins left on the Mint's hands. On April 3, immediately after the House passed a bill for the Old Spanish Trail half dollar, it passed the bill for the Hudson piece on Cochran's motion, without debate or opposition. The Missouri congressman also included his report in the Congressional Record. The bill thus passed to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 11, 1935, New York Senator Robert F. Wagner issued a report, recommending that the bill pass unamended. When the bill was considered in the Senate on April 15, Rhode Island's Jesse H. Metcalf moved to amend it so the bill would also provide for the issuance of a Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar. There was no objection or debate concerning either the amendment or the bill as a whole, and it passed the Senate. Because the two chambers of Congress had passed different versions of the bill, it returned to the House of Representatives. There, on April 18, on motion of Cochran, the House agreed to the Senate amendments, and it was enacted on May2 by the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 volume on commemoratives, suggested that the bill passed because of \\"probably the usual 'you vote for my bill and I'll vote for yours' arrangement\\".  Preparation  On the day Roosevelt signed the legislation, Congressman Goodwin wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts, requesting the names of suitable artists to design the coin. The commission was charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins. Moore suggested Laura Gardin Fraser as standing in the first rank of medallists, with other possibilities to include Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, Paul Manship, Francis H. Packer and Chester Beach. Mayor Frank Wise of Hudson asked if John Flanagan, who had recently designed the Washington quarter, would do; Moore agreed by telegram. However, the commission went to Beach for $1,000; the sculptor also agreed to guide the city through the coin approval process. Wise and his officials had tentatively decided to have a head of Henry Hudson on one side of the coin, with the city seal on the other. Beach quickly prepared sketches and met with Wise on May 13, but convinced the mayor that instead of the explorer (no actual portrait of him is known) his ship, the Half Moon, would be a better choice. Working at speed unusual for a commemorative coin of that era, Beach completed plaster models in one week, adding a crescent moon to the left of the ship. The models were converted to coinage dies by the Medallic Art Company of New York, who could accomplish the task faster than the Philadelphia Mint. Though records are not complete, the company apparently contacted the Mint for advice; Chief Engraver Sinnock sent it a letter on May 23. While unfamiliar with the Hudson legislation, Sinnock had confidence in Beach's ability because his previous designs were easy for the Mint to strike into coins. Beach quoted this praise in reporting to Moore on May 27 that Lee Lawrie, the sculptor-member of the Commission of Fine Arts, had approved the designs. Approval by the full commission followed on May 28, and by Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau a week later.  Design  The obverse of the coin shows the Half Moon, Henry Hudson's flagship, sailing to the right. To the left of the merchantman's rigging is a stylized crescent moon. The ship is surrounded by two rings of lettering, the inner reading \\"\\" and , and the outer the name of the country and the coin's denomination. The designer's monogram, , may be found at the waterline on the left side of the coin. The reverse is a rendition of the city of Hudson's seal, with Neptune holding a trident, riding backward on a whale. A mermaid or triton in the background blows into a conch shell. The seal design reflects Hudson's heritage as a whaling port, although it is some distance up the Hudson River from the ocean. The motto (Both the honor and the reward of the righteous) is copied from the city seal; the name of the city and the anniversary dates surround the seal, with above the dates. Don Taxay, in his book on commemorative coins, described the seal as \\"a rather whimsical composition\\"; Beach had deemed it \\"rather amusing\\" and had hoped the new coins \\"will be a little more interesting than the others I have done\\". Swiatek and Breen referenced \\"the quaint device of King Neptune riding backwards on a spouting whale, whose eye is represented as being about where its blowhole should be. Neptune is briefly clad in a wisp of cloth 'blowing in the wind'.\\" They suggested that the position of the Moon meant, if it was waxing, that the ship was sailing west toward America, but if waning, was sailing east to Europe. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume about U.S. coins and medals, considered the ship on the obverse \\"straightforward fare for commemorative half-dollars\\", though he found the name \\"\\" beneath the waves unneeded given the legend on the reverse. The reverse based on the city seal was to him \\"a harming throwback to colonial days, and in American numismatics to the quasi‚Äìfederal and state issues of the period 1780 to 1792\\". Vermeule noted \\"the baroque motto above Neptune and his group [that] makes it evident that this subject, appealing and amusing in itself, appears here because it is the singular characteristic of the City of Hudson on the river of the same name\\".  Production, distribution, and collecting  On June 12, 1935, John Evans, vice president of the First National Bank of Hudson, wrote to Mary M. O'Reilly, the acting Director of the Mint, asking on behalf of Mayor Wise that only 6,000 coins be struck at that time, with the remainder to be coined later if demand justified it. But the Mint delivered the entire authorization of 10,000 on June 28, 1935. Reservations for coins had been taken since early May (at $1 per coin, plus postage of $.03 per two coins and registered mail fee of $.18 per order), and on July 2, 1935, Evans, who was in charge of distribution, began informing what Swiatek called \\"[i]nfuriated collectors\\" that the coins were sold out. Coin dealer Julius Guttag, of New York City's Guttag Brothers, is believed to have bought 7,500 coins at $.95 each, and Hubert W. Carcaba, of Saint Augustine, Florida, is believed to have bought 1,000. In addition to the 10,000 pieces distributed, eight coins were struck at Philadelphia and retained there to be available for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. The uproar in the coin-collecting community resulted in bad publicity for the city of Hudson. Although the specifics of how the coins came to be so quickly sold out were not immediately known, collectors intuited a trick, especially when coins proved plentiful on the market at between $5 and $7 each. Many of these sold, helping set off a commemorative coin boom that continued later in 1935 when low-mintage varieties of the Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar came on the market after a similar immediate sellout. Collectors wrote angry letters to numismatic societies and periodicals, and the Hudson piece was among those that future American Numismatic Association president L. W. Hoffecker complained about to Congress when he testified in March 1936. By 1940, the price on the secondary market had dropped back to $5.50, and thereafter rose steadily and reached $1,700 during the commemorative coin boom of 1980. The 2017 edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the coin for between $700 and $1,500, depending on condition. A near-pristine specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $15,275.

Taking his grandfather as his role model he started at a local cycling club. He proved to be even more successful as a cyclist. However, his early career ended abruptly after he was expected to join the local sport grammar school again, which was the only way to continue his training. He stopped all sport activities altogether for almost two years. Only the reunification offered an opportunity to freely pursue his sport activities again. In the first year as he restarted, he was already 4th in German Road Championship in his age group. Since then he held a permanent spot in the \\"National - Team\\" for several years.

Robert I. Aitken designed the coin. Its obverse depicts Minerva and other elements of the Seal of California; the reverse shows buildings from the California Pacific International Exposition (held 1935‚Äì1936), which the coin was issued to honor. Legislation for the half dollar moved through Congress without opposition in early 1935, and Aitken was hired to design it. Once his creation was approved, the San Francisco Mint produced 250,000 coins, but expected sales did not materialize. Left with more than 180,000 pieces they could not sell, the Exposition Commission went back to Congress for further legislation so it could return the unsold pieces and have new coins, dated 1936, hoping for greater sales in the second year of the fair's run. Although the commission was successful in getting the legislation passed, it was less so in selling the coins, and 150,000 1936-dated pieces were returned to the Mint. The coins, of either date, sell in the low hundreds of dollars today. Background and authorization The California Pacific International Exposition was a world's fair held in San Diego's Balboa Park in 1935 and 1936. One of the largest expositions of its kind, it was held on of land, and cost $20 million. The fair attracted some 3.75 million visitors during its two-year run. At that time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government‚ÄîCongress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and sell them to the public at a premium. In the case of the California Pacific Exposition half dollar, it was the California Pacific International Exposition Co. Three-cent stamp issued by the United States Post Office Department for the Exposition, 1935 California's George Burnham introduced a bill for a California Pacific Exposition half dollar into the House of Representatives on February 19, 1935. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. John J. Cochran of Missouri, acting chairman of that committee, reported back to the House on April 12 with the recommendation that it pass after small technical amendments were made. The bill called for the issuance of a maximum of 250,000 half dollars. Cochran noted that Congressman Burnham had appeared before the committee, representing that there would be no expense to the government, and sent a letter so stating (reproduced in the report). Burnham had also written that the Exposition had considerable participation by the federal government, and its officials expected seven to ten million people to attend. The following day, Cochran had the bill considered by the House, which passed the recommended amendment and then the bill itself without any debate. The Senate received the bill on April 15, and referred it to the Banking and Currency Committee. On April 23, the committee, through its chairman, Duncan U. Fletcher of Florida, recommended that the bill pass, with a report similar to that of the House. On April 26, the bill passed the Senate on Fletcher's motion without any discussion or dissent. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it on May 3, 1935. Preparation and design California Senator William G. McAdoo, former Secretary of the Treasury under Woodrow Wilson, wrote to the incumbent Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau, proposing that the late president appear on the half dollar; Morgenthau wrote back calling the idea \\"interesting\\" and suggested it be directed to the Exposition Commission, which was responsible for securing designs. The January 1935 issue of The Numismatist (the journal of the American Numismatic Association), which went to press before the congressional actions, reported that there were plans for 50,000 silver dollar and 150,000 half dollar coins depicting President Roosevelt. State Seal of California Sculptor Robert Aitken, creator of other commemorative coins including the $50 Panama-Pacific issue, was hired to design the California Pacific half dollar. He submitted plaster models to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with making recommendations regarding public artworks, including coins. Commission sculptor-member Lee Lawrie took the lead in examining the models, and they were approved on July 5, 1935, though Lawrie questioned the legality of having coins omitting the mottoes and . Aitken subsequently added to the obverse. After final approval, the models were shipped to the Medallic Art Company of New York for reduction to coin-sized hubs, which were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint, where the working dies were made. These dies were in turn shipped to the San Francisco Mint. Aitken's octagonal $50 piece, part of the 1915 Panama-Pacific commemorative coin issue, also depicts Minerva. Aitken's obverse shows elements of the California State Seal with a seated depiction of Minerva. She wears a helmet and holds a staff with her right hand, her left rests on a shield with on it. On the shield is an aegis, with the head of Medusa affixed; between goddess and shield is a cornucopia overflowing with produce, symbolic of California's vast resources. A grizzly bear is to the left of Minerva. Behind them, in the distance, is a sailing ship and gold miner, with the hills of the Sierra Madre as background. The name of the issuing country and the denomination surround the central design, with under Minerva. The reverse shows two buildings constructed for the Exposition, and part of the California State Buildings at the fair, the California Tower and Chapel of St. Francis (today the San Diego Museum of Man). The outline which surrounds the buildings is said to suggest Spanish Mission architecture but Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their book on commemorative coins, identify it as a tressure, found on a some medieval gold coins. The name of the exposition surrounds the design, with the date, (under which the mint mark is found) and among the buildings. The California Tower and Chapel of St. Francis, Balboa Park, San Diego Numismatic author Don Taxay called the half dollar \\"a very distinguished coin artistically\\", and said of its reverse, \\"I cannot think of another architectural motif that has been treated so successfully on a United States coin.\\" Art historian Cornelius Vermeule liked the California Pacific half dollar, deeming the Minerva \\"one of the most powerful uses of the facing figure in American numismatic art\\". He deemed Aitken's design influenced by the pediments and other works he had sculpted during the 1920s and 1930s, including the pediment for the United States Supreme Court Building. He felt the depiction of the buildings on the reverse was \\"good enough for what it pretends to show\\", and noted that the monogrammatic style of the artist's initials was imitated by Gilroy Roberts when signing his obverse of the Kennedy half dollar (1964). Vermeule noted that the lettering \\"confirms the strength and balance of the total visual experience\\". Production, distribution, and collecting 250,132 coins were minted in San Francisco in August 1935. 132 were sent to Philadelphia and held for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the Assay Commission. The 250,000 remaining coins were sent from San Francisco to the Bank of America branch in San Diego, which handled distribution, and placed on sale at the fair on August 12 at $1 each. Despite considerable publicity, only 68,000 sold, with 2,000 more being held by the Exposition authorities. Although commemorative coin collecting (and investing) was becoming popular in 1935, the mintage of a quarter million coins, far in excess of some other issues of the era, meant investors were indifferent to the California Pacific issue. With sales of the 1935-S half dollar coming to a standstill, the Exposition Commission was well aware of this problem. Thus, they sought relief from Congress in the form of an act allowing them to return unsold half dollars for new ones, dated 1936. Coin collectors would view this as a new variety and possibly buy both, and melting the returned coins would decrease the supply and (hopefully) increase the attractiveness of the remaining 1935-S specimens. Accordingly, on January 6, 1936, Congressman Burnham introduced legislation to accomplish this. On February 17, the committee reported back through New York's Andrew Somers, noting that the bill provided that the exchange would take place without expense to the United States, and recommending that it pass. When Burnham brought the matter to the House floor on March 16, Michigan's Jesse Wolcott asked how the exchange would be done without expense to the government, and Burnham affirmed that the Exposition Commission would meet all expenses. He explained that the coins had been received so late in the year there had not been time to sell many. There were no further questions, and the bill passed the House without objection. The Senate committee reported on April 17, adding provisions requiring that the coins be dated 1936, regardless of when struck, and that they be produced at only one mint, chosen by the Director of the Mint, in line with other commemorative coin bills that committee had been reporting. Early numismatic author David M. Bullowa noted these provisions, designed to prevent the creation of varieties, were thus inserted in a bill that itself created a new variety. The Senate considered the bill on April 24, and it was amended and passed without debate or opposition. As the two versions passed were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives where, on April 27, that body at Burnham's motion, without debate or opposition, agreed to the Senate amendments. President Roosevelt signed the bill on May 6. G. Aubrey Davidson, chairman of the Exposition Commission, wrote to Acting Director of the Mint Mary M. O'Reilly on May 16, 1936, asking that the coins (which were to be struck at the Denver Mint and bear its mint mark \\"D\\") be minted as quickly as possible, as heavy attendance was expected at the fair around Memorial Day at the end of May. The production at the Denver Mint made the California Pacific half dollar the first commemorative to be struck at San Francisco and at Denver, but not at Philadelphia. It is the only pre-1954 commemorative with that distinction. A total of 180,092 of the 1936-D were produced, representing the number returned (the maximum allowed) plus 92 assay coins. The new coins were placed on sale at $1.50 each. Advertisement for the half dollars, 1937 There was a spike in prices for many commemorative coins in 1936, but due to the relatively high mintages of both the 1935-S and the 1936-D, the California Pacific coins sold badly, and when the Exposition closed in late 1936, fewer than 30,000 of the 1936-D had been sold. On January 27, 1937, Davidson wrote to the Director of the Mint, Nellie Tayloe Ross, asking her to allow the return of some 150,000 coins for refund, the glut blamed on having a relatively short period to sell them. Once the Mint had granted permission, the Exposition Commission placed the 1935-S and 1936-D pieces it withheld from the melting pot on sale at $3 each. Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, said the price increase was \\"to create the appearance of demand and future rarity. This didn't work.\\" In 1938, Emil Klicka, treasurer of the Exposition, offered the 1936-D for sale at $1 each, with a limit of ten. The 1935-S coins were available at $2. Large hoards of both dates were held by insiders for decades, including one holding of 31,050 of the 1935-S, amounting to nearly half the extant mintage. These were gradually dispersed from the 1960s to the 1980s. In 1962, the 1935-S was worth $9 in uncirculated condition, and the 1936-D was worth $11. The edition of the Red Book (A Guide Book of United States Coins) published in 2018 lists the 1935-S for between $100 and $160, depending on condition, with the 1936-D from between $100 and $225. A near-pristine 1935-S sold at auction in 2014 for $4,994.

It was designed by L.W. Hoffecker, a coin dealer, who also was in charge of its distribution. In 1930, President Herbert Hoover vetoed the Gadsden Purchase half dollar bill. Hoffecker had been the moving force behind that bid, and he sought another commemorative coin proposal that he could control if authorizing legislation was passed. He chose the travels of Spanish officer √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca in the early 16th century. Hoffecker took liberties both with the timing of Cabeza de Vaca's travels and their location; though Hoffecker's hometown of El Paso, Texas, is featured on the coin, Cabeza de Vaca came nowhere near its site. All this made little difference to Congress, which passed the Old Spanish Trail coin bill without opposition, and it was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Once they were struck, Hoffecker purchased the coins from the government and sold them to collectors, ostensibly on behalf of the local museum, but in fact for his personal profit, something he later denied in testimony before Congress. There were no complaints about the distribution printed in the pages of The Numismatist (a journal on coin collecting) and Hoffecker went on to the presidency of the American Numismatic Association in 1939. Hoffecker's design for the coin, featuring the head of a cow, has brought mixed reviews from numismatic commentators. The fact that only 10,000 of the half dollars were struck has made them prized among those seeking to complete a \\"type set\\" of early commemorative coins, that is one coin of each different design.  Background  Map showing Cabeza de Vaca's route √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca was an officer on a Spanish expedition that landed around Tampa Bay in 1528. Their searches for treasure led to hostile reception by the local Native Americans, and de Vaca was eventually marooned there. He and others made their way west by small boats along the coast, and eventually reached Galveston Island, where he lived with the Karankawa tribe as a medicine man before continuing west overland: in 1536 he found a Spanish patrol in northern Mexico. He returned home and wrote of his experiences. Cabeza de Vaca, or \\"head of a cow\\", was a name said to have been given by the King of Spain to an ancestor of √Ålvar N√∫√±ez for his help in guiding the army through the mountains, enabling an attack on the Moors from the rear, defeating them. In the 1930s, commemorative coins were not sold by the government‚ÄîCongress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Old Spanish Trail half dollar, the responsible group was the El Paso Museum, acting through its chairman. Hoffecker was elected ANA president in 1939. Lyman William Hoffecker (usually known as L.W. Hoffecker) was an El Paso, Texas coin dealer and an official of the American Numismatic Association (ANA). In 1929, he organized the Gadsden Purchase Commission (consisting mostly of himself) to seek a commemorative coin issue for the 75th anniversary of the Gadsden Purchase. A bill that would have authorized one passed both houses of Congress in 1930, but it was vetoed by President Herbert Hoover, who deemed commemorative coins abusive. Undiscouraged by this, in 1935 Hoffecker made a second attempt for a commemorative coin issue he would control, for the Old Spanish Trail, becoming chairman of the El Paso Museum Coin Committee. This time, he visited Washington and had discussions with several lawmakers, and was even granted a five-minute interview with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a talk Hoffecker said \\"that saved us\\". Hoffecker later testified before Congress that he was asked to handle the arrangements of the Old Spanish Trail half dollar as the only coin collector in El Paso, something Q. David Bowers, in his volume on commemoratives, called a lie, as Hoffecker elsewhere in his correspondence refers to local collectors buying a few of the coins.  Legislation  R. Ewing Thomason of Texas introduced legislation for an Old Spanish Trail half dollar into the House of Representatives on March 4, 1935. The bill was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. That committee held a hearing, at which Thomason appeared, telling the members about Texas history and assuring them the bill would result in no expense to the government. On April 2, John J. Cochran of Missouri reported the bill back to the House on behalf of the committee, recommending it pass. Cochran brought two commemorative coin bills, including the one for the Old Spanish Trail piece, to the House floor on April 3 as emergency measures. He explained to members dubious that the striking of half dollars could be urgent that they were needed for celebrations scheduled for that summer, and that the bills had been delayed due to the committee chairman's illness. First to be considered as the Old Spanish Trail bill. Marion A. Zioncheck of Washington state, who had been quizzing Cochran, asked: \\"Is this for St. Louis again?\\"; Cochran responded, \\"No; this is not for St. Louis.\\"1935 Congressional Record, Vol. 81, Page 4951 (April 3, 1935) New York's Charles D. Millard asked if the minority (Republican) members of the committee had been consulted; Cochran assured him this was so and they were in favor of the bill. William D. McFarlane of Texas asked what the expense to the federal government would be; Cochran responded, \\"it will not cost the Government five cents\\". The bill passed without recorded objection, after which Cochran got the Hudson, New York Sesquicentennial half dollar passed.1935 Congressional Record, Vol. 81, Page 4952 (April 3, 1935) In the Senate, the Old Spanish Trail bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. That committee issued a report on May 23 by Duncan U. Fletcher of Florida, recommending it pass without amendment. When the bill was brought to the Senate floor on May 28, William Henry King of Utah asked if the bill had the Treasury Department's support, but Fletcher did not know as it was a House bill; his committee had approved it as similar bills had been passed for expositions and other celebrations. The Majority Leader, Joseph Taylor Robinson of Arkansas, noted there would be no expense to the government; Fletcher agreed, stating it would make some money through seignorage. The bill passed without further debate,1935 Congressional Record, Vol. 81, Page 8318 (May 28, 1935) and was enacted, authorizing 10,000 half dollars, with the signature of President Roosevelt. According to the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation's page on the coin, \\"Rewriting history to suit his own ends, Hoffecker claimed that El Paso was the end of the Old Spanish Trail traveled by early explorer Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and the remnants of a 1527 Spanish expedition. This was not really the case, but apparently that didn‚Äôt bother Congress, as a bill was passed on June 5th, 1935 authorizing a maximum of 10,000 half dollars commemorating the trail.\\"  Preparation  Monument to Cabeza de Vaca, Jerez de la Frontera, Spain Hoffecker provided sketches for the half dollar, and sent them to the Bureau of the Mint for approval. Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross on June 27 forwarded them to the Commission of Fine Arts for its recommendation, noting that the position of Hoffecker's initials between the anniversary dates was objectionable. The Commission sent the sketches to its sculptor member, Lee Lawrie, for his approval, and he thought they would make a good coin if modeled properly. The sketches had lacked the word \\"Liberty\\", something Ross had pointed out. Lawrie felt it must be included, and suggested it be inserted between the cow's horns, which it was. Lawrie also recommended the initials be made less conspicuous. The full commission approved the designs, subject to Lawrie's criticisms being addressed. Edmund J. Senn of El Paso was hired to make the required plaster models based on the designs and the requirements of the Fine Arts Commission. Hoffecker related that he had sought to hire one of two or three sculptors in the East, but each would take too long and wanted liberty to make changes. Senn was unemployed, and, by Hoffecker's account, he stood over Senn, who worked in Hoffecker's garage. The models were sent to the Fine Arts Commission, which did not like the appearance of the cow's head and required that it be modified. It also questioned the placing of the word on a riband, as if it were a motto, which it is not. Senn revised his models, though little change was made to the head.  Design  The coin's reverse depicts a yucca in bloom. The obverse depicts the head of a cow, intended as a rebus for Cabeza de Vaca, of whom no portrait could be found. Instead, the literal translation of his title was used. There are no other design elements on the obverse, only lettering. Arlie Slabaugh in his volume on commemoratives found the obverse \\"unorthodox\\" but \\"it does what it was intended to do, tells the story and then stops, leaving a generally pleasing and uncluttered design\\". The reverse features a yucca in bloom, superimposed against a map of the five Gulf States, with a line intended to describe de Vaca's route, running from Florida to El Paso, which is the only place named. Hoffecker, in submitting the design to the Mint, stated that he hoped there would be no objection to El Paso being named, as there was a precedent for it. There are dots along the route representing St. Augustine, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Mobile, New Orleans, Galveston, and San Antonio. This is inaccurate, as de Vaca traveled along the Gulf Coast for the most part by boat rather than overland; according to numismatist Dan Brothers in his 2014 article on Hoffecker, \\"the actual Old Spanish Trail, however, followed a completely different route than the path taken by de Vaca.\\" Hoffecker took further liberties, as the year 1535 was not a significant date in de Vaca's travels. Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, describes the Old Spanish Trail issue as \\"beautiful and very popular\\". Bowers noted that it was \\"popular with collectors from the very start, and this enthusiasm has carried through to the present day\\". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. commemorative coins and medals, said of the Old Spanish Trail piece that it \\"can safely be designated the ugliest commemorative coin ever produced by a United States mint. It may be the strongest contestant for the title of least attractive American coin ever manufactured under official auspices between 1793 and the present.\\" He ridiculed the cow's head, saying that using it to represent Cabeza de Vaca was akin to depicting a field of roses on the dime to represent Franklin Roosevelt. Vermeule noted Slabaugh's praise that the obverse told a story and then stopped, and stated, \\"the question is whether or not the story is worth telling on a United States half-dollar.\\"  Production and distribution  There was a note in the June 1935 edition of The Numismatist (the ANA's journal) authored by Hoffecker, stating that he, as head of the Museum Committee, would be selling the Old Spanish Trail half dollars at $2 each, plus postage. He stated that only 10,000 would be issued, and \\"we wish all collectors to obtain a few and will not allow any speculator to hold up the public.\\" He placed an advertisement the following month, stating that he was ready to take orders and he hoped the coins would be available from the Mint in 60 days. The Philadelphia Mint in September struck 10,000 half dollars, plus eight extra that would be held for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. Hoffecker later stated in a letter to another dealer that he paid for the coins, owned them, and sold them, and that the only two the El Paso Museum got were gifts from himself. Accordingly, the profits would have accrued to him. When testifying before Congress in March 1936, he denied having an ownership interest in them. Bowers, whose firm holds Hoffecker's papers, stated his belief that most of the coins were distributed by Hoffecker to collectors and other interested persons, and that he avoided selling to speculators. He kept a quantity for himself, though he also denied that publicly. He wrote to another dealer in 1953 that he was still selling the half dollars, a few each month. When coins from Hoffecker's estate were sold in 1967, a group of 63 Old Spanish Trail half dollars was auctioned off. Hoffecker kept the coin collecting community happy in the distribution of the issue; if there were dissenters, their complaints were not printed in The Numismatist. In 1936, Hoffecker was the distributor of the Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar, and in 1939 was elected president of the American Numismatic Association. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen wrote in their volume on commemoratives that \\"no scandal attached itself to Hoffecker\\". The low mintage of the issue has made it desirable by those collectors seeking to put together a type set of commemoratives, one of each design. The Old Spanish Trail half dollar sold at retail for about $4 in 1940, in uncirculated condition. It thereafter increased in value, selling for about $38 by 1955, and $510 by 1975. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2018, lists the coin for between $1,050 and $1,450, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold at auction for $25,300 in 2005.

The coin was designed by John Howard Benson and Arthur Graham Carey. Its obverse depicts Roger Williams, founder of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. It was intended to honor the 300th anniversary of Providence, Rhode Island, although it bears no mention of the city. Members of Rhode Island's congressional delegation sought a coin for the 300th anniversary of Providence, and Senator Jesse Metcalf added authorization for one to a bill for another commemorative coin that had already passed the United States House of Representatives. The amended bill was approved by both houses of Congress, and it was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A total of 50,000 coins were struck at the three mints then in operation. The coins went on sale on March 5, 1936, and the quantity made available to the public sold out in a matter of hours. Rhode Island insiders were holding back quantities for later sale once prices rose. That conduct incensed coin collectors, and the abuses led Congress to move toward banning commemorative coins. The coins are listed for hundreds of dollars today, depending on condition.  Background and legislation  Roger Williams was born in Britain around 1603. He was ordained as a minister, became a Puritan, and moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony where he became the minister of the church in Salem, Massachusetts. Colonial authorities began to take issue with some of the teachings that he imparted to his congregation, such as the separation of church and state and fair dealings when purchasing land from American Indians. He was banished from the colony in 1635, and attempts were made to send him back to Europe. Instead, he escaped on foot and found refuge with Massasoit, sachem of the Narragansett people. He bought a parcel of land from Massasoit in 1636 and established Providence Plantations. Providence Plantations eventually merged with settlements on Rhode Island to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, which became the State of Rhode Island. A committee was established in 1931 to mark the tercentenary of Williams' founding of Providence. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen claim in their volume on commemoratives that the moving forces behind the Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar were Senators Jesse H. Metcalf and Peter Gerry and Representative John Matthew O'Connell, all of whom applied political pressure to authorize the coin. In 1936, commemorative coins were not sold by the government. Congress usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value from the United States Mint and sell them to the public at a premium, and the Providence Tercentenary Commission was chartered for the Tercentenary coin. A bill had passed the House of Representatives on April 3, 1935 for a Hudson Sesquicentennial half dollar, and it had been recommended for passage in the Senate by the Committee on Banking and Currency. When the bill was considered in the Senate on April 15, Senator Metcalf moved to amend it to provide for a Providence Tercentenary half dollar to be issued, as well. There was no objection or debate, and the bill passed the Senate. It was then returned to the House of Representatives which agreed to the Senate amendments, and it was enacted on May 2 by the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Preparation  John Howard Benson was one of the artists who designed the coin, and he wrote a letter to Lee Lawrie of the Commission of Fine Arts on December 12, 1935 which provides information on the design process. Benson related that Royal B. Farnum of the Rhode Island School of Design had assigned the coin design to him and Arthur Graham Carey because they had cut dies for small medals. The Tercentenary Commission's coin committee originally proposed seven stars from an early version of Providence's seal for one side of the new coin, with the anchor from Rhode Island's seal and the state motto \\"Hope\\" on the other. Benson told Lawrie that the committee had then changed its mind, wanting to picture Roger Williams on the obverse side being greeted by Narragansetts, and they decided to open the design to a public competition. Benson and Carey persevered, made the changes, and entered the competition‚Äîand they were selected. The Providence artist wrote that he was anxious to receive the opinion of the Fine Arts Commission. Lawrie forwarded the letter to Commission chairman Charles Moore the same day, noting: \\"I don't know just what his troubles are. ... It won't make a great coin but the models are I think equal to some others we approved.\\" The full Commission approved the designs on December 20, and reductions were made from plaster models to coin- sized hubs were by the Medallic Art Company of New York.  Design  The obverse is based on the seal of Providence showing Roger Williams kneeling in a canoe, his hand raised in signal of friendship. The Narragansett Indian who greets him has his hand extended, palm down, meant as a native sign for \\"good\\". Behind the Narragansett is a stalk of corn as a reference to the help and friendship which the Indians had shown to the Mayflower Pilgrims in establishing Plymouth Colony.

The reverse depicts the Anchor of Hope, taken from Rhode Island's state seal. The motto symbolizes the authority of the state government, while evokes that of the federal government, as it is a national motto. The name of the country and the coin's denomination surround the reverse design. Nowhere on the coin is the name of Providence, which was left off in the final alterations required by the Coin Committee. According to Swiatek, \\"this issue's obverse does not rate very high among collectors. The image of Roger Williams has the look of a robot from the old Flash Gordon serial.\\" The two designers later became partners in a stonecutting firm in Newport, Rhode Island, which accounts for the sculptural look of the coin, according to Swiatek. According to Q. David Bowers, \\"no significant criticisms were ever mounted of the design\\". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule writes that the bands of lettering overwhelm the designs. \\"Roger Williams in his canoe looks like Elpenor amid the bulrushes on a Greek vase of about 440 with a scene of the dialogue of Orpheus in the Underworld.\\" He notes that \\"the Indian and Williams are blocked out with a childlike charm of conceptualism\\", but \\"the coat-of-arms is so simple as to defy analysis, or even comment.\\"  Production, distribution, and collecting  A total of 20,000 half dollars arrived in Providence from the Philadelphia Mint by February 20, 1936; an additional 15,000 each were expected from the Denver and San Francisco Mints, but they had not been received. Those coins had been struck in January (Philadelphia and Denver) and February (San Francisco) 1936. In addition to the quantities sent to Providence, 13 pieces from Philadelphia, 10 from Denver, and 11 from San Francisco were held at Philadelphia for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the United States Assay Commission. Swiatek and Breen noted, \\"March 5 proved to be a day of immense noise and confusion\\". The new coins went on sale through various Rhode Island banks amid considerable publicity at $1 per coin, with the Rhode Island Hospital National Bank taking the lead as depository. Out-of-staters could write to Grant's Hobby Shop in Providence, owned by Horace M. Grant, a well-known numismatist. Within hours of the coins going on sale, banks were allegedly out of them, and the issue was supposedly sold out within six hours. Yet ample supplies proved to be available at higher prices from insiders, including Horace Grant. Low-mintage commemoratives were sometimes held back from sale by the distributor in anticipation of skyrocketing prices in those days, and Grant ran an advertisement in the April 1936 issue of The Numismatist offering the coins for $7.50 per set of three by mint mark, or $2.75 individually. By June, he was offering to exchange the Rhode Island half dollars for other coins or sell them for $9 per set of three. On June 24, the Tercentenary Commission announced that it would sell the first 100 from each mint in sets of three by matched numbers, by sealed-bid auction, but none of these sets has been identified. There was widespread anger among coin collectors, and lawsuits were filed against the commission. Among those who litigated was Texas coin dealer L.W. Hoffecker, but he dropped the suit in exchange for 90 sets of three coins. In the years that followed, he complained to other dealers about the ethics of Grant and the Rhode Island officials. Hoffecker was influential in Congress and complained to Senator Metcalf about the situation. Metcalf suggested another act for another 50,000 coins, but Hoffecker advised against it unless some neutral party handled the distribution, lest they be hoarded. He complained that \\"every bank in Rhode Island is making a lot of money, instead of distributing the coins\\". Congress ended the authorization for outstanding commemorative coin issues in 1939; the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, for example, had been issued for over a decade. Hoffecker was elected president of the American Numismatic Association that same year, and he wrote to numismatist Walter P. Nichols in November expressing concerns about Grant's ethics. By then, the Rhode Island Tercentenary Committee had been dissolved, having shown a profit of $24,000 on the 50,000 coins issued. About two-thirds of that went towards a memorial to Roger Williams. The deluxe 2015 edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins (the Red Book) notes that the distribution of the coin \\"was wrapped in controversy‚Äîphony news releases reported that the coin was sold out when it was indeed not, and certain dealers procured large amounts at low prices only to resell for tidy profits.\\" By 1940, the price on the secondary market had dropped back to $4.50 per set of three, but it then rose steadily and reached $975 during the commemorative coin boom of 1980. The 2017 Red Book lists the coin between $325 and $675 per set of three, depending on condition, with single coins about a third of that.

The obverse depicts a badger and the territorial seal, while the reverse shows a pick axe and lead ore. Background Wisconsin, before being admitted into the Union as a state in 1848, was originally a territory. Before that, much of the Wisconsin Territory had been part of Northwest Territory, ceded by Great Britain in 1783 as part of the Treaty of Paris. Then part of the Michigan Territory, the area of what would become the Wisconsin Territory gained importance during the 1820s, when large deposits of lead (commemorated on the obverse of the coin) were discovered in southwestern Wisconsin. As more Americans moved into the area, the territory became important enough to become a separate territory in 1836. Inception 1936 was a peak year for commemorative coins, as numerous commemoratives were approved and struck commemorating events such as the Cleveland Centennial, the Elgin Centennial, and the Albany Charter. In order to help fund various activities for the Wisconsin Centennial that year, the Wisconsin Centennial Commission appointed a Coinage Committee to call for commemorative half dollar commemorating the Centennial. When the bill passed on May 15, 1936, it also authorized two other commemorative coins marking the centennial of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and the tercentenary of Swedish settlement in Delaware. As 1936 was the peak year for commemorative coins, the fact that all three coins were hardly worthy of commemoration on United States coinage due to being of local or regional significance was not taken into consideration. Preparation David Parsons, a young university art student, was recruited by Wisconsin's Coinage Committee to prepare models for the coin. However, as the models were in very high relief, they were rejected by the United States Mint. When the Mint was asked by the committee for a sculptor that would serve as Parsons's replacement, the Mint subsequently referred the issue to the Commission of Fine Arts, which then recruited New York sculptor Benjamin Hawkins. Despite being given only three weeks to complete his models, Hawkins submitted the refined models to the Mint on June 3, 1936, which were approved by Commission of Fine Arts two days later. Release While the legislation authorizing the commemorative called for a minimum mintage of 25,000 coins with no limit on the maximum number of coins that could be minted, the commission chose to take a conservative approach and only minted 25,015 coins. Although the coins were unlikely to have been available during the Wisconsin Centennial celebration from June 27 to July 5, most were sold for $1.50 per coin by mail order through the work of the committee, which had been advertising the coins since April, before either the legislation authorizing the coins or even the design of the coin had come about. However, due to their late release and primarily local appeal, the coins did not sell very well, and many remained unsold by the end of the year. They continued to be sold for the following 16 years at the reduced price of $1.25 per coin, until the price was raised to $3 per coin in 1952. The supply of coins eventually was exhausted in the late 1950s. The coins were sold in plain cardboard holders that, similar to holders for the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar, contained slots for up to five coins. Orders of one or two coins were sealed in tissue paper and shipped in envelopes that were either imprinted \\"L.M. HANKS, FIRST NATIONAL BANK BUILDING, MADISON, WISC\\". or rubber-stamped \\"AFTER 10 DAYS RETURN TO STATE SUPERINTENDENT, STATE CAPITOL, MADISON, WISC.\\" Like the coins, envelopes are collectibles.

The obverse depicts a male Dutch settler and an Algonquian tribesman, and the reverse shows a Dutch sailing ship. It was designed by Howard Weinman, the son of Mercury dime designer Adolph A. Weinman. The Long Island Tercentenary Committee wanted a coin to mark the 300th anniversary of the first European settlement there. The authorizing bill for this passed through Congress without opposition, but was amended in the Senate to add protections against past commemorative coin abuses, such as low mintages or a multiplicity of varieties. On April 13, 1936, the bill became law with the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The coins were not struck until August of that year, too late for the anniversary celebrations, which had been held in May. The coins were placed on sale to the public, and four-fifths of the 100,000 coins sent to the Tercentenary Committee were sold, a result deemed to be successful given the large issue and a lack of advertising. The remainder was sent back to the Philadelphia Mint for redemption and melting. The half dollar catalogues up to the low hundreds of dollars. Background and inception The first European known to have sighted Long Island, now part of New York State, was Henry Hudson in 1609. At the time of what was later deemed its discovery, 13 tribes of Native Americans inhabited the island. The first European settlement, on Jamaica Bay, was by the Dutch. The first deed for land on Long Island was dated June 16, 1636, for land conveyed to two Dutch colonists. The Dutch named one of their settlements Breuckelen, a name that later became Brooklyn. The Dutch called the island as a whole Lange Eylandt; after the British took possession of the area in the 1660s, they attempted to rename it Nassau, but this never became popularly used. In 1936, commemorative coins were not sold by the government‚ÄîCongress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and tend them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Long Island half dollar, the responsible group was the Long Island Tercentenary Committee, acting through either its president or its secretary. That committee was formed to organize the anniversary celebrations to take place on Long Island.  Legislation  Congressman John J. Delaney The political influence of the members of the Tercentenary Committee was sufficient to get a bill into Congress. Introduced into the House of Representatives by John J. Delaney of New York on February 20, 1936, the bill called for a minimum of 100,000 half dollars to be struck (no maximum was stated). The bill was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. That committee reported back on February 28, 1936, through Andrew Somers of New York, recommending passage. Somers was the committee chair; both he and Delaney represented Brooklyn. John J. Cochran of Missouri brought the bill to the House floor on March 6, saying he was doing so on behalf of Somers and Delaney, and on his motion the bill passed without debate or opposition.1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 80, Page 3391 (March 6, 1936 ) In the Senate, the bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency; it was one of several commemorative coin bills to be considered on March 11, 1936, by a subcommittee led by Colorado's Alva B. Adams. Senator Adams had heard of the commemorative coin abuses of the mid-1930s, with issuers increasing the number of coins needed for a complete set by having them issued at different mints with different mint marks; authorizing legislation placed no prohibition on this. Lyman W. Hoffecker, a Texas coin dealer and official of the American Numismatic Association, testified and told the subcommittee that some issues, like the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926, had been issued over the course of years with different dates and mint marks. Other issues had been entirely bought up by single dealers, and some low-mintage varieties of commemorative coins were selling at high prices. The many varieties and inflated prices for some issues that resulted from these practices angered coin collectors trying to keep their collections current. On March 26, the committee, through Senator Adams, issued a report recommending the bill pass once amended. That amendment required that the coins be struck at only one mint, that they only be issued for a year and bear the date of authorization (1936) regardless of when coined. A minimum of 5,000 and a maximum of 100,000 were to be issued. Adams recommended these provisions appear in future commemorative coin bills. The Senate considered the bill on March 27, the last in a series of six commemorative coin bills being considered by that body, and like the others, the Long Island bill was amended and passed without debate or dissent.1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 80, Page 4489‚Äì90 (March 27, 1936 ) As the two houses had passed different versions, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 30, Cochran asked that the House agree to the Senate amendment. Bertrand H. Snell of New York requested an explanation of the Senate amendment; he was told by Cochran that it was a strengthening of the language to ensure there was no expense to the federal government. The House agreed to the amendment and passed the bill without dissent.1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 80, Page 4601 (March 30, 1936 ) It was passed into law, authorizing 100,000 half dollars, with the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 13, 1936. The provision that the coins only be struck at a single mint and the one requiring that all coins bear the same date were firsts for commemorative coin legislation. Preparation At the recommendation of the federal Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), the Tercentenary Committee engaged sculptor Howard Kenneth Weinman, the son of sculptor Adolph Alexander Weinman. The CFA was responsible for making recommendations on the artistic merit of public artworks, including coins. The elder Weinman was known for designing the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar and wrote to CFA secretary H.R. Caemmerer on April 2, 1936, relating that Howard Weinman had been hired, and asking for details of the procedure for commemorative coin approval. Caemmerer replied the following day, stating that the designs should be sent to the Philadelphia Mint once the authorization bill had been given final approval. On April 19, Howard Weinman wrote to Caemmerer, stating that due to the Tercentenary Committee having gotten off to a late start, only preliminary sketches had been made, and asking at what stage the designs needed to be submitted for approval. Caemmerer replied on the 21st, stating that for purposes of CFA approval, it would be best to send copies of the photographs of the completed plaster model to himself, and also to Lee Lawrie, sculptor-member of the CFA. Caemmerer also suggested that Howard Weinman consult his father as to the procedure for submission to the Mint, as Adolph Weinman had done it many times. By May, Howard Weinman had completed his models. Lawrie had a few minor suggestions, but was greatly pleased with the work. The CFA concurred on the 26th, having some additional suggestions, such as placing under the ship on the reverse (something not adopted). After the CFA granted preliminary approval, Adolph Weinman met with the Director of the Mint, Nellie Tayloe Ross, and with the Assistant Director, Mary Margaret O'Reilly, to come to terms on the recommended changes. For example, to ensure greater clarity, the legend , appearing incuse, graven into the surface beneath the ship, was to be engraved on the master die directly by John R. Sinnock, the Chief Engraver. When Howard Weinman wrote to Caemmerer on June 22, he stated that he was working in haste, so that the coins would be available as quickly as possible. The Commission gave its approval; Howard Weinman's models were reduced to coin-sized hubs by the Medallic Art Company of New York City.  Design  The obverse of the half dollar depicts jugate busts of a Dutch settler and a member of the Algonquin tribe of Native Americans. Howard Weinman wrote of this, \\"I shall try to infer by the harmonious balance of the heads the peaceful settlement of the island by the Dutch\\". Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl described the obverse in 1937 as \\"conjoined portraits of two rather tough looking gentlemen, but so far I have been unable to ascertain just who they are or who they are supposed to represent\\". Other critics have compared the two heads, with their lantern jaws and prominent noses, to two boxers about to square off. Also present on the obverse are some of the inscriptions required by law, and . The reverse depicts a Dutch three-masted ship sailing to the right. The design resembles the depiction of Henry Hudson's ship Halve Maen on the 1935 Hudson Sesquicentennial half dollar but is more stylized. In the waves the ship rides over is the text, , with the name of the country and the denomination of the coin surrounding the scene, together with the legend, . David Bullowa, in his 1938 volume on commemorative coins, noted that the designs had generally been criticized as a number of previous commemoratives had borne busts in a similar matter to the Long Island piece, and others had depicted ships. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on American coins and medals, took a mixed view of the Long Island half dollar, \\"The Dutch pioneer looks like a character out of Shakespeare (a peasant part), and the Indian could easily play professional football any Sunday afternoon across the United States. Otherwise, beyond those cliches brought about in an effort to modernize traditionally ideal subjects, the ship has a correct amount of simplicity, and the lettering seems to fade into the background in a satisfying fashion.\\"  Distribution  A total of 100,053 Long Island Tercentenary half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during August 1936, with 53 pieces to be retained at the mint to be available for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. The issuance of the half dollar made the Weinmans the second parent and child to have both designed U.S. coins, the first having been Chief Engravers William Barber (1869‚Äì1879) and Charles Barber (1880‚Äì1917) of the U.S. Mint. Advance sales accounted for almost 19,000 coins. By the time of issue, the celebrations on Long Island had passed, having been held under the auspices of the Tercentenary Committee in May. Arlie Slabaugh wrote in his book on commemoratives, \\"Even so the Long Island Tercentenary Committee did a surprisingly good job of selling these through local banks\\". After the coins were delivered from the mint to the National City Bank in Brooklyn, they were sold to the public at various places for $1 each. The office of the Brooklyn Eagle made 50,000 coins available. In addition, 25,000 coins were offered for sale in Queens, 15,000 in Nassau County and 10,000 in Suffolk County. They were for sale at Brooklyn department stores. Despite arriving late, the coins sold relatively well, with 81,826 coins out of 100,000 disposed of despite almost no advertising. In August 1936, examples of the new half dollar were presented by the Tercentenary Commission to President Roosevelt. Sales continued through the first few months of 1937. As was the norm with other early commemoratives, the remaining unsold coins were returned to the mint for melting. Unlike other commemorative coins of the 1930s, there were no complaints about the manner of distribution, as anyone who wanted one could buy one; nor was there any profiteering. The coin was purchased both by the coin collecting community and by residents of Long Island. Collecting As the coins sold well, the Long Island Tercentenary half dollar is often considered as one of the more common early commemoratives. However, few coins survive in gem condition. Problems commonly encountered include wear or bag marks on the high points of the coin, such as on the cheek of the Dutch settler on the obverse and the sails of the ship on the reverse. One reason for this is that the coin design, especially on the reverse, is relatively flat, thus making it prone to bag marks. Other pieces were handled carelessly while in the hands of the public. Marty Rubenstein, a local coin dealer, stated, \\"Long Islands don't generally come nice.\\" The Long Island Tercentenary half dollar sold at retail for about $1.25 in uncirculated condition in 1940. It thereafter increased in value, selling for about $4 by 1955, and $140 by 1985. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2018, lists the coin for between $85 and $450, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold for $9,988 in 2015. Harry Miller, a Patchogue, Long Island, coin dealer, stated in 2002, \\"I find most collectors on Long Island want to have one even if they don't specialize in commemoratives\\".

The reverse shows Brown‚Äôs Garrison, the fort around which York County was formed, while the obverse depicts the arms of York County. Inception The York County, Maine, Tercentenary half dollar was one of several early commemoratives issued for its local significance. The commemorative was approved largely due to the connections that many of the coin's sponsors had, including numismatist Walter P. Nichols, who was at the time the Treasurer of the Committee for Commemoration of the Founding of York County. The bill authorizing minting of the commemorative passed on June 26th, 1936, at the height of the speculative market in commemorative coins. Preparation The sculpting for the coin's design was done by G. S. Pacetti Company of Boston, while the dies were reduced from the original sculpture by New York City‚Äôs Medallic Art Company. As Rich's designs were sculpted in bronze rather than the usual plaster, the design has an unusually flat relief more reminiscent of later (late 20th century onward) designs.

The obverse of the coin depicts former Secretary of the Treasury and U.S. Senator Carter Glass, a native of Lynchburg. The reverse depicts a statue of the Goddess of Liberty, with Lynchburg sites behind her, including the Old Courthouse and the city's Confederate monument. Glass sponsored legislation for the half dollar, which passed Congress without difficulty. The Commission of Fine Arts proposed that the coin should bear the portrait of John Lynch, founder of Lynchburg, on the obverse, but no portrait of him was known. Instead, the Lynchburg Sesqui- Centennial Association decided Senator Glass should be on the coin. Despite his opposition, Glass became the third living person to appear on a U.S. coin, and the first to be shown alone. The coins sold well when placed on sale in the late summer of 1936, and sales to out-of-towners were limited. The entire issue sold out, with some put aside for the sesquicentennial celebrations in October. Issued for $1, the coins have appreciated over the years, with 2018 estimates of value ranging between $225 and $365, depending on condition. Background The Lynchburg Sesqui-Centennial Association desired to have a commemorative half dollar honoring the anniversary of the Virginia General Assembly's 1786 first mention of the incorporation of Lynchburg; it became a city in 1852. In 1936, commemorative coins were not sold by the government‚ÄîCongress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization with exclusive rights to purchase them at face value and vend to the public at a premium. In the case of the Lynchburg half dollar, the responsible group would be the Sesqui-Centennial Association. The year 1936 saw Congress authorize 15 new commemorative coin issues, and pieces authorized in prior years were struck again, dated 1936. That year saw a major boom in commemorative coin prices, and the new issues helped fuel the market. Some of these new issues, like the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar, were controlled by insiders for private profit. The Lynchburg piece, on the other hand, would defray the cost of the anniversary celebrations, and was motivated by pride in the city and its history. Lynchburg was a supply center for the Confederacy during the Civil War; a Union attempt to take the city was beaten back in 1864 by Confederate General Jubal Early. In 1858, Carter Glass, later Secretary of the Treasury and a representative and senator from Virginia, was born there, and lived there in 1936.  Legislation  Glass introduced the bill for a Lynchburg Sesquicentennial half dollar in the Senate on April 8, 1936; it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 22, Alva B. Adams of Colorado reported it back to the Senate. In its report, the committee noted that the bill included the standardized language it advocated because of past commemorative coin abuses: including that they be issued by only one mint and no fewer than 5,000 at a time, have only one design, be struck within a year of enactment, and bear the date 1936 even if struck later. The committee recommended the bill pass. On April 24, Adams brought the bill before the Senate, and moved that the authorized quantity of the coins be increased from 10,000 to 20,000. Both the amendment and the bill were agreed to without debate or recorded opposition.1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 82, p. 6067 (April 24, 1936) The bill then went to the House of Representatives where on 22 May, Virginia's Clifton A. Woodrum brought it to the floor. Robert F. Rich of Pennsylvania, a Republican, took the floor long enough to note that \\"this is, perhaps, the thirtieth bill of this kind to come in here this session of Congress. It is surely the beginning of Democratic inflation, and I warn the Members of the House to beware.\\"1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 82, pp. 7774‚Äì75 (May 22, 1936) Following laughter and applause, the bill passed without objection, and with the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 28, 1936, became a law authorizing 20,000 half dollars.  Preparation  Senator Carter Glass On May 25, 1936, with the Lynchburg bill close to enactment, the secretary of the Sesqui-Centennial Association, Fred McWane, wrote to Charles S. Moore, chairman of the federal Commission of Fine Arts. The commission was charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins. Moore replied on the 26th, suggesting that the coin should bear the portrait of John Lynch, founder of Lynchburg, on the obverse. McWane replied the following day, stating that there was no known portrait of Lynch, and that the Sesqui-Centennial Association was considering other possible obverses. For the reverse, McWane proposed the city's Memorial Terrace, long the first sight there that greeted visitors arriving by rail. On June 3, McWane wrote to Moore stating that the Sesqui-Centennial Association was considering Charles Keck and John David Brcin to sculpt the coin; Moore in his reply on the 9th, praised both men, but praised Keck more. Keck had designed the 1915 Panama- Pacific gold dollar and the Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar in 1927. The Sesqui-Centennial Association took the hint and McWane notified Moore of Keck's hiring on July 1. He also advised Moore that his commission had decided Senator Glass should appear on the obverse. Glass protested at the idea of his face appearing on a coin, but this was to no avail. He telephoned the Philadelphia Mint in the hope a law might forbid himself, as a living person, from appearing on a coin, but was told that none did. The senator stated, \\"I had hoped there would be an avenue of escape.\\" According to Don Taxay in his volume on U.S. commemorative coins, \\"though [Glass was] the most influential man in Lynchburg, and honorary president of the Sesquicentennial Association, he found himself hopelessly outvoted\\". On July 28, Mary Margaret O'Reilly, the Assistant Director of the Mint, forwarded Keck's models to the Fine Arts Commission; they were approved the following day. Moore wrote to Glass on the 31st, predicting that the senator's depiction was one \\"that both your friends and posterity will approve\\". Keck's models were sent to the Medallic Art Company of New York, which reduced them to coin-sized dies.  Design  The half dollar depicts the Lynchburg Courthouse, Confederate Memorial and Monument Terrace. The obverse contains a representation of Senator Carter Glass, making the Lynchburg Sesquicentennial half dollar the third U.S. coin to depict a living person, and the first to show one alone‚Äîthe earlier two, the Alabama Centennial half dollar (1921) and the U.S. Sesquicentennial half dollar (1926), depict jugate busts of a living person, a governor or president, with a deceased predecessor. Glass also became the first person to have his signature on U.S. currency (during his term as Treasury Secretary) and his portrait on a coin. Having headed the Treasury Department, he was aware of the custom that living people did not appear on U.S. coinage; its waiver in his case did not attract unfavorable criticism, as it was deemed well-deserved. The reverse depicts a statue of the goddess Liberty, her arms outstretched in welcome. In the background is seen a portion of Monument Terrace, with the Old Lynchburg Courthouse also depicted. Before the building is the city's Confederate monument. According to Anthony Swiatek in his 2012 volume on commemorative coins, \\"the Confederacy receives prominent recognition on this coin\\". Amid the debate over the removal of Confederate monuments in the United States, the question of whether to displace that statue, dedicated in 1900, has been raised, but as of 2017, it remains in place. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. commemorative coins and medals, deemed Keck's half dollar, \\"a successful but not startling combination of conservative elements\\". He described the figure of Liberty on the reverse as \\"a Greco-Roman, actually Greek imperial, frontal Liberty placed before local landmarks\\". Vermeule suggested that the tall, thin lettering on the reverse indicates that Keck was less influenced by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, under whom he studied, than by Chief Engraver of the United States Mint Charles E. Barber (served 1880‚Äì1917) and his successor George T. Morgan (1917‚Äì1925). Further, Vermeule tied Keck's Liberty to coins and medals designed by the two chief engravers, including their work on medals for the Assay Commission. He concluded that Keck's \\"style, as manifest in the Lynchburg Sesquicentennial half-dollar, was a recollection of the fashions perpetuated by Barber and Morgan\\". Production, distribution and collecting In September 1936, the Philadelphia Mint struck 20,000 Lynchburg half dollars, plus 13 extra that would be held for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. The new coins came on the market during the price boom in commemorative coins, and readily sold at a price of $1 each. There was an order limit of 10 per person, though this might be waived if there was a written explanation. Orders were accepted in advance, and the August 1936 issue of The Numismatist (the journal of the American Numismatic Association) contained a statement from the Sesqui-Centennial Association that orders for 2,000 had been received. Once 15,000 had been sold, the remainder was held to allow local residents the opportunity to buy them. On September 2, McWane wrote to a potential out-of-state buyer stating that they had all been purchased. They were formally placed on sale on September 21. Some were put aside for sale at the sesquicentennial celebration, held in Lynchburg from October 12 to 16, where they sold, mainly to local residents. The coins increased in price after 1936, their value helped by the wide distribution of the mintage, with no known hoards. By 1940, the value in uncirculated condition was $2, and by 1970 $40. At the height of the later commemorative coin boom in 1980, they sold for $550, dropping back to $375 by 1985. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2018, lists the coin for between $225 and $365, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold in 2008 for $4,830.

One of many commemoratives issued that year, it was designed by Jacques Schnier and honors the opening of the Bay Bridge that November. One side of the coin depicts a grizzly bear, a symbol of California, and the other shows the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, with the Ferry Building in the foreground. Competing bills were considered by Congress in 1936: one to mark the Bay Bridge's completion that year, the other to honor both that and the Golden Gate Bridge, also under construction. The bill that only commemorated the Bay Bridge was successful, and passed into law with the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After some discussion involving the Commission of Fine Arts, which reviews coinage designs, Schnier's models were approved and the coins were struck at the San Francisco Mint. Just over 70,000 coins were sold of the distribution mintage of 100,000, by mail, in person, and‚Äîmaking it the first commemorative coin to be sold on a drive-in basis‚Äîfrom booths at the Bay Bridge's approaches. The coins were taken off sale in February 1937, with the unsold remainder returned to the Mint for redemption and melting. The Bay Bridge half dollar catalogs in the low hundreds of dollars, depending on condition.  Background  When the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge opened in 1936, it allowed motorists, for the first time, to drive quickly and easily between San Francisco and Oakland. Ferries had operated across San Francisco Bay since 1851, but a bridge was far more convenient for automobile drivers. Politics, engineering and financing had blocked earlier proposals dating back to the 1870s; the winds and currents of the bay, and the lack of bedrock to build upon, were believed by some to make such a bridge impossible, especially since it would have to extend . It was not until the 1930s, when with the support of President Herbert Hoover, a Californian, that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation agreed to purchase construction bonds backed by future tolls for what would be the largest and most expensive bridge of its time. Sparked by low-mintage issues which appreciated in value, the market for United States commemorative coins spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936; an unprecedented fifteen were issued. One coin authorized and issued in 1936 was the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar, controlled and profited from by Thomas G. Melish‚Äîand issued to celebrate a nonexistent anniversary. In addition, at the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926. By mid-1936, Congress had reacted to these practices, adding protections to commemorative coinage bills such as a requirement that all coins be struck at a single mint, rather than all three then operating as with earlier issues (the use of mint marks would force coin collectors to buy three near-identical coins to have a complete set). Such a provision was present in the bill authorizing the Bay Bridge half dollar, which also required that the funds generated be used towards the celebration. Unlike many early commemoratives, which were struck to mark an anniversary, the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge half dollar was, like the Panama‚ÄìPacific commemorative coins, struck in order to celebrate a present-day engineering achievement.  Legislation  The Bay Bridge, with Yerba Buena Island shown A bill for a commemorative half dollar honoring the opening of the Bay Bridge was introduced in the United States Senate by Hiram Johnson of California on April 10, 1936. Other than referring the bill to the Committee on Banking and Currency, the Senate took no action on the bill that day;, available here it was busy with the impeachment trial of federal judge Halsted L. Ritter of Florida., available here The Banking Committee reported back on the bill with a favorable recommendation, suggesting that the minimum number of coins to be drawn at any one time be increased from 5,000 to 25,000. The Senate considered six commemorative coin bills in a row on June 1, 1936. Four, including the Bay Bridge bill, passed without any discussion; two were deferred until later., available here A bill for a commemorative coin honoring the opening of the new bridges in the San Francisco Bay Area (including the Golden Gate Bridge) was introduced in the House of Representatives by Albert E. Carter of California on April 21, 1936. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures., available here John Cochran of Missouri reported that bill back on April 23, with a recommendation that it pass; he brought the bill to the House floor on May 27, 1936. Robert F. Rich of Pennsylvania, a Republican, noted that this was about the 35th coinage bill to come forward that year and suggested that \\"we place on the one side of this coin the face of Mr. Farley, Democratic National Committeeman; then turn the coin over and place on the other side of it the face of Mr. Farley, the New York city committeeman; then when you flop coins you will always have the head of Farley\\"., available here Nevertheless, Rich did not object and the House passed the bill without further debate., available here On June 18, Cochran informed the House that each body had passed a different bill for the California bridge celebrations and asked that the Senate bill be considered. It was passed without debate, and the House bill was laid on the table. , available here} The Senate bill for 200,000 commemorative half dollars in honor of the Bay Bridge opening became law with the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 26, 1936. A separate bill was introduced for a coin to honor the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, but it failed to pass.  Preparation  A grizzly bear According to numismatic author Don Taxay, preparations for the coin must have begun soon after the authorization was signed, for on July 20, 1936, Franck R. Havenner, the chair of the San Francisco Citizen's Celebration Committee, wrote to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary M. O'Reilly. Havenner had some procedural questions, sent information on the selected artist for the coin, Jacques Schnier, and enclosed photographs of the chosen design. These were sent to the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), responsible under a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding for rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins. On July 31, the CFA chair, Charles Moore, wrote to Havenner relaying the suggestion of the CFA's sculptor-member, Lee Lawrie, that the lettering in the design be made larger. After the required plaster models of the proposed coin were completed, the CFA met on September 15 to consider photographs of them. Moore sent a letter to O'Reilly, stating that the bear's nose was unlike that of a grizzly, and supplied images for Schnier's use in revising it. On the original designs, the mottoes and flanked the bear to left and right: one member of the CFA, John M. Howells did not like the positioning of the latter. Correspondence among the various parties followed, since it was uncertain where it could be moved to. Eventually, Havenner telegraphed to the Mint noting that some previous commemoratives had excluded either or and proposing that be omitted and moved to the left of the bear in its place. O'Reilly accepted this; Schnier modified his designs, and approval from the CFA and the Treasury Department soon followed. Schnier's models were reduced to coin-sized hubs by the Medallic Art Company of New York.  Design  According to numismatic writers Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, \\"it is a matter of guesswork which side should be called the obverse. We follow tradition like [Arlie] Slabaugh and [Don] Taxay and list the side with the bear\\". There was criticism of the grizzly bear design at the time of release, for it was stated that the bear used as model was Monarch II, who lived 26 years in a cage in Golden Gate Park, objectors argued that such a bear was no fit symbol for Liberty, the word that appears at its feet. Q. David Bowers, in his volume on commemoratives, contends that the bear was a composite of several animals seen by Schnier at the San Francisco and Oakland zoos. Taxay noted that the grizzly bear is commonly used by artists to represent California, and that Schnier's was \\"an unusually successful treatment\\". The four stars seen, one to the left and three to the right of the animal, lack symbolic meaning and were not present on Schnier's original sketch of the obverse. The mint mark S for the San Francisco Mint flanks the bear on the left, with the artist's initials on its right. The Ferry Building, with the Bay Bridge in the background The other side of the coin depicts the bridge, as seen from the San Francisco side. The Ferry Building on the Embarcadero is in the foreground, with Yerba Buena Island in mid-bay, with the Berkeley Hills of the East Bay seen in the distance. A ferry boat and an ocean liner sail through the water. Treasure Island, connected to Yerba Buena, is not visible as it is an artificial construction that had not yet been completed. The name of the bridge and the date of striking ring the depiction. The design for this side is complicated, and there are no completely flat areas. Numismatist Stuart Mosher, in his 1940 book on commemoratives, noted the Monarch II controversy and the bear motif's similarity to the California Diamond Jubilee half dollar (1925), though he deemed the bear \\"of secondary importance compared to the bridge design\\". Coin author Anthony Swiatek deemed it \\"a lovely coin\\". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule praised the Bay Bridge half dollar in his volume on American coins and medals, stating that no commemorative half dollar \\"tries animals or vistas on a grander scale than Jacques Schnier's coin for California's giant new bridge in 1936\\". Vermeule stated \\"the temptation to show comprehensive views of harbors on coins has existed ever since Nero adorned a sestertius with Rome's basin at Ostia [...]. Schnier's grand view from San Francisco to Berkeley is comparable to geography on coins and medals of the sixteenth or seventeenth century [...]. In being so bold it deserves praise for the aesthetic excitement it generates and its artistic success. The bear is a poignant combination of furry power and animal, specifically ursine, sympathies.\\"  Production, distribution and collecting  Jo Mora's California Diamond Jubilee half dollar (1925) also depicts a grizzly bear. A total of 100,055 Bay Bridge half dollars were struck at the San Francisco Mint in November 1936, with 55 pieces set aside for transmission to Philadelphia for examination and testing at the following year's meeting of the Assay Commission. Although they were struck no differently than the rest of the coins minted, the first 200 coins that were struck were reserved for presentation purposes. Of these coins, the 22 that were not presented were later sold to collectors with documentation of their early striking. Only half the authorized mintage of 200,000 was struck; numismatic author Arlie Slabaugh Jr. deemed that decision wise, as profit- minded collectors and investors would not have favored a higher mintage. The bridge had opened on November 12, 1936 with a celebration that continued for three days but the coins arrived too late for that, and went on sale about a week later. Distribution of the coins was handled by a group of banks known as the San Francisco Clearing House Association, or they could be purchased by mail from celebration organizers' offices on Market Street at $1.65 each, with a discount for ten or more. Booths were erected near the bridge entrances from which motorists could purchase the new coin for $1.50 without needing to leave their vehicles. Another account states that the coin was sold from the tollbooths. In either event, it was the first time that a commemorative coin had been made available on a drive-in basis. In late January 1937, Lawrence M. Giannini, head of the finance committee distributing the coins, announced that sales would end on February 15, and that the remaining coins would be returned to the Mint for redemption and melting. By this time, sales had ground to a halt. A total of 71,369 half dollars were sold; the remainder, 28,631 coins, was returned to the Mint and were melted. By 1940, the market price for the Bay Bridge half dollar remained at $1.50. It gradually rose thereafter and at the peak of the 1980 commemorative coin boom sold for $240; in 1990, market prices ranged from $120 to $560, depending on condition. The Mega Red edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2018, lists the Bay Bridge piece for between $145 and $340, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold for $21,850 in 2004. In 1986, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the bridge coin issue, 1,000 of the half dollars were placed into holders which were autographed by Schnier, numbered, and sealed in plastic. This was for a coin dealer; the coins were purchased on the open market and were not from unsold remainders.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The obverse design depicts the personification of justice holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the New State House built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the palmetto tree, South Carolina's state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original Thirteen Colonies.  Background  The area around what is now Columbia, South Carolina, was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when Fort Congaree was established at Granby, South Carolina, near the city's present site. Following the end of the American Revolutionary War, the South Carolina Legislature was concerned that the state capital, Charleston, was too vulnerable to attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first planned cities in the United States. The legislature first met there at the Old State House in 1790. That building proved subject to flooding and damp‚Äîa poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the American Civil War; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903. Until 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of coin collecting, where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance. These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt had in 1935 asked that Congress pass no more such bills. The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.  Legislation  The coin was proposed by the Columbia Sesqui- Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding. Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935, by South Carolina's Hampton P. Fulmer. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. That committee reported back through Andrew Somers of New York on February 17, 1936, recommending passage of the bill with amendments. These included increasing the authorized mintage from 10,000 to 25,000 coins, and requiring that the coins be ordered by a committee of not less than three people appointed by Columbia's mayor, who, under the original bill, was to designate the individual(s) responsible for ordering the coins. Fulmer brought the bill to the floor of the House of Representatives on February 24, 1936. Bertrand H. Snell of New York asked if the bill had come from the Coinage Committee. Fulmer stated that it had, and it was being pressed now in the hope of having coins to sell at the celebrations in Columbia in March. Snell stated that he had wanted such a coin at the request of some people from his part of the country, but had learned it was against Treasury Department policy. Jesse P. Wolcott of Michigan noted that he and others from that state had tried to get a coin for the centennial of its admission to the Union. They had not pressed the matter only because of Treasury Department opposition and the threat of a presidential veto. Thomas J. O'Brien of Illinois demanded the regular order, and the bill was amended and passed without opposition or further debate. In the Senate, the bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. South Carolina's James F. Byrnes reported it back on March 3, 1936, recommending a number of minor amendments which stressed that the anniversary commemorated was not the founding of the city, but of it being the capital of South Carolina. The Senate amended the bill and passed it without discussion or dissent. As the two houses had passed versions that were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where, on March 5, Fulmer asked that the House adopt the Senate amendments, which it did. The bill, providing for 25,000 half dollars, became law with the signature of President Roosevelt on March 18, 1936. Preparation The Sesqui-Centennial Commission selected 32-year-old sculptor Abraham Wolfe Davidson of Clemson College to design the coin. Davidson, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, had reached a deal with Clemson administrators whereby he would sculpt a statue of its founder, Thomas G. Clemson, in exchange for room, board and tuition. His completed plaster models of the coin were sent to the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) by the Director of the United States Mint, Nellie Tayloe Ross, on May 25, 1936. A 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding charged the CFA with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins, and Ross wanted the CFA\\"s opinion. She recognized there were visible defects in Davidson's design, and said that \\"his models were 'unsatisfactory' and 'lack artistic merit'.\\" CFA chair, Charles Moore agreed with Ross's assessment in a letter dated June 1, 1936, and suggested the South Carolina commission hire an experienced medalist. According to Eric Brothers in his article on Davidson for The Numismatist: \\"The Sesquicentennial Committee would not budge; Davidson was Columbia's and Clemson's talented, adopted son.\\" On June 13, Ross returned the models to Davidson and wrote to James Hammond, chair of the Sesqui- Centennial Commission, saying she had returned the models and setting forth the Mint's technical requirements for coinage models. Thereafter, Davidson worked under the supervision of Lee Lawrie, sculptor-member of the CFA. The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \\"slumpy\\", and the leaves of the palmetto on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau.  Design  The obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts Lady Justice, bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each. If the coin was struck at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco, the appropriate mint mark appears beneath her‚ÄîD or S. At the time, the Philadelphia Mint did not use one. The word appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design. The reverse depicts a palmetto tree, the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a saltire pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels. As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \\"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\\". The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the Confederate States of America. The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin. According to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \\"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\\". Numismatic author Q. David Bowers stated, \\"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists‚Äîwho certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things‚Äîfelt moved to be critical.\\" Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on American coins and medals, writes, \\"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\\" He deemed the obverse \\"badly proportioned\\" and the reverse \\"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\\"  Distribution and collecting  The anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March 22 and 29, 1936. On May 30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He also requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937. A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of varieties a collector needed for a complete set, but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936. 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck. The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. At the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community. To ensure a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were available only to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order. Local residents could buy them at $2 each. Dealers were unable to obtain large quantities, leading them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price. David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \\"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\\" Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a time capsule that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set. By 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and to $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter. The deluxe edition of R. S.

Piaga√ßu-Purus Sustainable Development Reserve The Piaga√ßu-Purus Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) is divided between the municipalities of Tapau√° (30.35%), Coari (1.37%), Anori (40.11%) and Beruri (28.17%) in the state of Amazonas. It covers an area of . The name comes from the Tupi language: pi'√° (guts, heart or stomach) and wa'su (large, wide), and means \\"great heart of the Purus\\". There are about 85 communities of people in the reserve, who live by fishing, agriculture, hunting and extraction of timber and non-timber products. The RDS adjoins the Abufari Biological Reserve to the southwest and the Nascentes do Lago Jari National Park to the south. The southern part of the RDS surrounds the Itixi Mitari Indigenous Territory, and further north the RDS surrounds the Lago Aiapu√° Indigenous Territory. The Purus River runs through the RDS from southwest to northeast. The RDS contains Lago Jar√≠, which forms part of the eastern boundary of the southern section. The northern part of the RDS includes Lago Aiapu√°. The RDS is accessible by boat. History The Piaga√ßu-Purus Sustainable Development Reserve was created by decree 23.723 of 5 September 2003, incorporating the Lago do Ayapu√° Environmental Protection Area of the middle Purus River. It covered parts of the Anori, Beruri and Tapau√° municipalities on the banks of the Purus, and part of the Coari municipality on the banks of the Solim√µes River. It increased the protected area from to . Indigenous territories were excluded from the area of the RDS. On 27 December 2006 the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (INCRA: National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform) recognised the reserve with an area of as meeting the needs of 700 families of rural farmers, who could thus participate in PRONAF. This was amended to 990 families on 10 October 2008. The consultative council was created on 11 March 2010. The management plan was published on 31 December 2010, although it was not made official through an ordinance or legislative instrument. Scientific research is conducted through cooperation between IPAAM/SDS and the Instituto Piaga√ßu, with a floating support base on Lago Ayapu√°. As of 2016 the reserve was covered by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Environment The RDS a large part of the of floodplain of the Purus River, and contains over 200 lakes. About 40% of the RDS is floodplain and 60% terra firma forest, but the flat relief and homogeneous vegetation suggest that the dry land has been flooded in the recent past. The RDS has high biological importance, with great biodiversity of fish and all the known species of aquatic mammals in the Amazon including Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). There are large populations of turtles and alligators. The wetlands and v√°rzea fields are feeding areas for migratory birds, of which 40 species have been registered including 17 species that eat only fish. It holds the most species of primates of any Amazon reserve, with at least 13 identified species.

The obverse features the Swedish ship the Kalmar Nyckel which sent the first settlers to Delaware, while the reverse depicts Old Swedes Church, claimed to be the oldest Protestant church in the United States. Confusingly, while the coins are dated \\"1936\\" on the obverse and the reverse also has the dual date of \\"1638\\" and \\"1938\\", the coins were actually struck in 1937.  Background  A first attempt at European settlement in what is now Delaware occurred in 1631 near Lewes; the incipient colony was destroyed by the Native Americans. The Swedes tried in 1638 with two ships, the Kalmar Nyckel and the Fogel Grip, an expedition commanded by Peter Minuit, famed for his purchase of Manhattan Island but later dismissed by the Dutch. They settled at the present site of Wilmington. The colony of New Sweden, established to profit from the fur trade, was on land claimed by the Dutch in New Jersey and the English in Maryland; the conflict over the next years was primarily with the latter. Intermittent warfare ended with the arrival of an overwhelming Dutch fleet in 1655. In 1664, though, the English conquered New Netherland, the Dutch possessions in the Middle Atlantic states, and in 1682, Delaware was granted to William Penn, the new proprietor of Pennsylvania. Delaware became one of the original Thirteen Colonies, and, in 1787, was the first state to ratify the Constitution. Until 1954, the entire mintage of each commemorative coin issues issue was sold by the government at face value to a group named by Congress in authorizing legislation, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then entered the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. The growing market for such pieces led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, to mark anniversaries and benefit (it was hoped) worthy causes. Unlike other commemoratives of the time, the reason for minting the Delaware half dollar was greed; it was felt that the 300th anniversary of the first settlement in Delaware, the first state, was worthy of commemoration. The designated organization to purchase the Delaware half dollars was the Delaware Swedish Tercentenary Commission (DSTC), acting though its president.  Legislation  A joint resolution authorizing 20,000 commemorative half dollars for the 300th anniversary of Swedish settlement in Delaware was introduced into the United States Senate by Joseph F. Guffey of Pennsylvania on March 4, 1936. It was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. and was one of several commemorative coin bills to be considered on March 11, 1936, by a subcommittee led by Colorado's Alva B. Adams. Senator Adams had heard of the commemorative coin abuses of the mid-1930s, with issuers increasing the number of coins needed for a complete set by having them issued at different mints with different mint marks; authorizing legislation placed no prohibition on this. Lyman W. Hoffecker, a Texas coin dealer and official of the American Numismatic Association, testified and told the subcommittee that some issues, like the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926, had been issued over the course of years with different dates and mint marks. Other issues had been entirely bought up by single dealers, and some low-mintage varieties of commemorative coins were selling at high prices. The many varieties and inflated prices for some issues that resulted from these practices angered coin collectors trying to keep their collections current. No further action was taken on that joint resolution, but on March 16, Guffey and Delaware's Daniel O. Hastings introduced a new one. Among the changes made were requiring that the president of the Delaware Tercentenary Commission sign off on coin orders from the Mint, rather than requiring the chairman of the commission's coinage committee to be the one responsible. Nevertheless, when Adams reported the joint resolution back to the Senate on March 26, he attached an amendment entirely rewriting the bill, and explained in an accompanying report, \\"The bil above referred to contains certain provisions which the committee recommend be eliminated not only from such bil but also from all subsequent bills relating to the issuance of commemorative coins. One of these provisions would have allowed the coins to be issued at several mints and another provision would have permitted the coins to be issued at such times and in such amounts as the committee or other body in charge of the commemorative exercises might determine.\\" He stated that \\"the committee recommend that the issuance of the coins be limited to one mint to be selected by the Director of the Mint and that not less than 5,000 such coins be issued at any one time\\". The joint resolution was brought to the Senate floor on March 27, 1936, the first of six coinage bills being considered one after the other. Like the others, it was amended and passed without recorded discussion or dissent. In the House of Representatives, the bill was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. That committee reported back on April 16, with an amendment that raised the minimum mintage to 25,000. On April 30, J. George Stewart of Delaware brought the bill to the House floor and it passed without discussion or dissent. As the two houses had not passed identical versions, this sent the bill back to the Senate. On May 4, Adams moved that the Senate agree to the House amendment, which it did; the bill became law, authorizing not fewer than 25,000 half dollars, with the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 15, 1936. The bill was signed despite the opposition of the Treasury Department, which prepared a draft veto message. The striking was only allowed to take place at a single mint, with all pieces to be dated 1936 and to be issued by the Mint within a year of the bill's enactment, thus not later than May 15, 1937. Preparation On May 18, 1936, the DSTC's general secretary, George Ryden, wrote to the Assistant Director of the Mint, Mary M. O'Reilly, requesting procedural information, stating that the commission might order as many as 50,000 coins in two tranches, and informing her that the DSTC planned to elect the design for the coin by open competition. This was not the usual way of proceeding for a committee charged with finding a design for a commemorative, who more usually picked an artist by other means. The competition was judged by Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock and noted sculptor Dr. Robert Tait McKenzie. Over 40 entries were submitted, all vying for both a $500 prize and the honor of being the final design for the coin, and one by Carl L. Schmitz, an American of German and French descent, was chosen. Schmitz chose the Kalmar Nyckel as his subject for one side of the coin, and the Old Swedes Church in Wilmington, Delaware for the other. The designs were received by the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) and on November 5, 1936 prints of them were sent to its sculptor- member, Lee Lawrie. The commission was charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins. The DSTC was withholding the name of the artist pending CFA approval of the designs, and in a letter of November 9 to the CFA secretary, H.R. Caemmerer, Lawrie staled, \\"these models seem to me to be made by one who understands the business‚Äîthey are excellent.\\" He was unsure what the designs represented, though, and asked for clarification. DSTC chairman C.L. Ward responded to Caemmerer on November 14, disclosing Schmitz's name, explaining the designs, and wanting modifications to the shape of the church. On December 14, the CFA approved the design, subject to Ward's concerns being addressed. Schmitz modified his models, which were reduced to coin-sized hubs by the Medallic Art Company of New York.  Design  Mint records consider the side with the church as the obverse, though the DSTC considered it to be the side with the ship; numismatic author Q. David Bowers wrote that collectors have come to agree with the Mint, though Anthony Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, note that some collectors and dealers dissent. Consecrated in 1699, Old Swedes Church has been described as the oldest Protestant church building in the United States still used for worship. Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their earlier volume, note that the church is depicted as it appeared, not in 1699, but following the addition of a tower and belfry in 1802. Above the church the Sun is depicted with its rays piercing the clouds; Swiatek and Breen suggested this symbolic of divine protection despite adversity. The year appears, as required by the authorizing law, and between the year and the church is the motto, . Ringing the design are the name of the issuing country, and the coin's denomination. The reverse depicts the Kalmar Nyckel‚Äîthe name means \\"Key of Kalmar\\". The depiction on the coin is based on a Swedish-made copy of the model of the ship in the Marinmuseum, the Swedish Naval Museum. The artist's initials, , are to the right of the ship. Under the waves beneath the ship are and , along with the anniversary dates. The year of minting, 1937, does not appear on the coin despite the presence of the dates 1936 and 1938. Separating the dates beneath the ship from each other and from the words that otherwise ring the design are three diamonds. These symbolize the three counties (Kent, New Castle and Sussex) of Delaware, \\"The Diamond State\\". In his 1938 monograph on commemorative coins, David Bullowa wrote of the Delaware half dollar, \\"The design of this coin is effective and simple. The legends are particularly clear, and the coin as a whole is very tastefully wrought\\". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule wrote of the Delaware half dollar in his book on American coins and medals, \\"the design comes off with boldness and simplicity. Ships and architecture can offer more pitfalls than they do joys, but Schmitz, wisely, has presented plain solids and solid, yet unusual lettering. Even the triad of standard [national] mottoes are apportioned to both sides, to their exergues, in such a manner as to avoid irritation. Although offering nothing new, this coin speaks forcefully amid its contemporaries.\\" Distribution A total of 25,015 coins were minted in March 1937 at the Philadelphia Mint, with the 15 pieces above the even thousands set aside for inspection and testing at the following year's meeting of the annual Assay Commission. The coins were sold by the DSTC through the Equitable Trust Company of Wilmington at $1.75 per piece, Coins that had been ordered in advance were distributed in late March and in April. Of the 25,000 coins minted, 20,978 were sold, with the 4,022 remaining pieces returned to the Mint for redemption and melting. Proceeds from the coin were used to fund local celebrations of the anniversary, which were held in Sweden and in the United States in 1938. Sweden also issued a commemorative coin for the anniversary, a 2-kronor coin depicting the Kalmar Nyckel. These were promoted by American coin dealers such as Wayte Raymond of New York, who was involved in the US distribution of the Swedish coin, as collectable alongside the Delaware half dollar. There were also several privately-produced medals, and a new stamp from the United States Post Office Department was issued at Wilmington on June 27, 1938. By 1940 the Delaware piece sold for about $1.50 in uncirculated condition, though this went up to $2.75 by 1950, $18 by 1960, and $350 by 1985. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2018, lists the coin for between $220 and $375, depending on condition. Two exceptional specimens sold for $7,475 in 2008 and in 2011. The original coin holder in which up to five Delaware half dollars were sent to purchasers are worth from $75 to $125, and if accompanied by original mailing envelope up to $200, depending on condition.

The coin commemorates the 200th anniversary of Norfolk being designated as a royal borough, and the 100th anniversary of it becoming a city. It was designed by spouses William Marks Simpson and Marjory Emory Simpson. Virginia Senator Carter Glass sought legislation for a Norfolk half dollar, but the bill was amended in committee to provide for commemorative medals instead. Unaware of the change, Glass and the bill's sponsor in the House of Representatives, Absalom W. Robertson, shepherded the legislation through Congress. Local authorities in Norfolk did not want medals, and sought an amendment, which passed Congress in June 1937. The legislation required that all coins be dated 1936; thus, there are five dates on the half dollar, none of which are the date of coining, 1937. By that time, the anniversaries had passed, and sales were poorer than hoped; almost a third of the mintage was returned for melting. The Norfolk half dollar is the only U.S. coin to depict the British crown, shown on the city's ceremonial mace, found on the reverse (\\"tails\\" side) of the coin. Background Much of the area now comprising the city of Norfolk, Virginia, was granted by Charles I of England in 1636 to Adam Thoroughgood, a former indentured servant who had risen to become a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. Thoroughgood recruited 105 people to live on the land, and named the area for his birthplace, the county of Norfolk in England. Some land was granted to the Willoughby family; this eventually became Norfolk's downtown. In 1736, Norfolk was granted a charter as a royal borough by George II, and the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, Robert Dinwiddie presented Norfolk with a ceremonial mace in 1753, making Norfolk the only American city to have a mace from colonial times. Despite being nearly destroyed during the American Revolutionary War, Norfolk was almost as large a port as New York City by 1790, but its importance declined in the 19th century. It remains home to a major naval base. In the 1930s, commemorative coins were not sold by the government‚ÄîCongress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Norfolk half dollar, the responsible group was the Norfolk Advertising Board, Inc., affiliated with the Norfolk Chamber of Commerce.  Legislation  Virginia Senator Carter Glass introduced a bill for a Norfolk Bicentennial half dollar on May 20, 1936; it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Commerce. The bill was reported back to the Senate by Alva Adams of Colorado on June 20. The committee recommended in the report that a medal, not a coin, be issued. They attached a 1935 letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt complaining that commemorative coins of a purely local nature were being authorized by Congress, and recommending that commemorative medals be issued instead. June 20, 1936, the final day of the session, was an exceptionally busy day in Congress. After Adams reported the bill back to the Senate,1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 82, p. 10345 (June 20, 1936) Glass attempted to have it considered by that body, but initially Joseph Guffey of Pennsylvania objected, demanding the regular order.1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 82, p. 10504 (June 20, 1936) Later that day, Glass advised the Senate that Guffey had stated he would not further object, and again asked to have the bill considered. This time it passed without objection or debate, and the title was changed to reflect that medals were to be struck rather than coins.1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 82, p. 10509 (June 20, 1936) The bill was considered by the House of Representatives later the same day. Absalom W. Robertson of Virginia moved that the House pass it, stating that the bill authorized medals, but when questioned by Robert F. Rich of Pennsylvania, stated that the bill was for \\"silver coins\\".1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 82, p. 10680 (June 20, 1936) The House passed the bill without amendment or debate, and it was signed into law by President Roosevelt on the 28th. Such medals would have had no market, as collectors of the day preferred legal tender coins, which is what the promoters of the bill wanted, and so no medals were struck. It was at first hoped that the initial bill might be used to authorize coins; when this proved not to be the case, the head of the Norfolk Advertising Board, Franklin E. Turin, was interviewed in the Norfolk Ledger- Dispatch on August 5, and \\"ripped away the veil of secrecy that has shrouded negotiations and called a spade a spade\\". Turin blamed Roosevelt for the mix- up, and stated that Senator Glass had said he had not realized the bill had been changed, nor had Representative Robertson. Senator Glass promised another attempt. Glass reintroduced the bill, this time numbered as S. 4, on January 6, 1937. It was reported back to the Senate on the 16th by Adams with an amendment containing language usual to commemorative coin bills, that the federal government would not be responsible for the expenses of preparing the dies for the coinage. The Senate passed it without objection on January 19.1937 Congressional Record, Vol. 83, p. 298 (January 19, 1937) The bill was transmitted to the House, where it was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. That committee on May 26 reported the bill back, recommending that it pass after being amended, including increasing the authorized mintage from 20,000 to 25,000. The report drew attention to the \\"unfortunate error\\" of the previous year, and \\"that in making this favorable report it is merely helping to correct this oversight\\". The House passed the amended bill on June 21 without discussion or dissent.1937 Congressional Record, Vol. 83, p. 6060 (June 21, 1937) As the two houses had not passed the same version, the bill returned to the Senate, where on June 22, on Glass's motion, that body agreed to the House's amendments.1937 Congressional Record, Vol. 83, p. 6116 (June 22, 1937) Roosevelt signed the bill, authorizing 25,000 half dollars, on the 28th.  Preparation  Expecting a coin to be authorized rather than a medal, the Norfolk Advertising Board hired husband and wife William Marks Simpson and Marjory Emory Simpson to design the half dollar, and on September 26, 1936, William Simpson submitted prints of his design to the Commission of Fine Arts. The Fine Arts Commission was charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins. The designs were referred to the sculptor member of the commission, Lee Lawrie. In general, Lawrie was enthusiastic, but had some suggestions. One was to shorten the mace, which almost touched the letter \\"O\\" in on the original models. He also advised that further attention should be given to the lettering. The commission chairman, Charles Moore, wrote to William Simpson on September 29, informing him of this, and adding his own congratulations on the design. No formal approval was given at that time, as the coin had not been authorized. After the coin bill passed Congress in June 1937, the Simpsons modified the design slightly, with the tip of the mace now between the words and , and minor changes being made to the obverse. Photographs of the revised models were sent to the Fine Arts Commission on August 10, 1937; the designs were approved on August 14.  Design  The obverse depicts the city seal of Norfolk. A sailing ship is shown, sailing on stylized waves; below is a plow and three sheaves of wheat. Underneath that is the Latin word , translated as \\"may you prosper\\". Above the ship is , meaning \\"both land and sea are your riches\\". The inscriptions trace the progress of Norfolk from borough to city, and include the date 1936, as required by the legislation, though the coin was not struck until 1937. The reverse shows Norfolk's mace, with the date of the land grant, 1636, divided by it and flanked by sprigs of dogwood. That date is explained by the words . The name of the country, the denomination and the inscriptions required by law are also on the reverse, as are the designers' initials, rendered as . There are five dates on the coin, none of which is the year of minting, 1937. Q. David Bowers described the obverse as \\"the most cluttered commemorative design ever produced\\". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. commemorative coins and medals, called the Norfolk piece \\"a low point in commemorative design\\". His view was not entirely negative, saying that \\"skill in spacing the letters, in casting the surfaces, and in modeling the high relief saves much of the composition. Still, the commemoration of Norfolk's anniversaries is a document of epigraphy rather than figural art.\\" Vermeule noted that the coin had been designed by a married couple, and that \\"the coin gives ample evidence that two heads need not be better than one.\\"  Production and distribution  In September 1937, the Philadelphia Mint struck 25,000 Norfolk half dollars, plus 13 extra that would be held for inspection and testing at the 1938 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were placed on sale at $1.50 each, with an initial limit of 20 per purchaser. This limit was later dropped to allow bulk sales to dealers. There was controversy over the half dollar bearing the British Crown as part of the mace‚Äîsome said the crown had no place on an American coin‚Äîand over the fact that the anniversary had passed in 1936. This Turin addressed in advertisements, stating that the crown only appeared as part of the historic mace, and that the city would have issued the coin in 1936 but for the mix-up. Sales were slower than hoped, and Turin promoted the coin through 1938 with mass mailings to coin collectors. Despite this, 5,000 coins were returned to the Philadelphia Mint for redemption and melting in 1938, and 3,077 more at a later date. Several thousand had been sold in bulk to dealers, and wholesale quantities were available on the coin market for years afterward. The Norfolk half dollar sold at retail for about $1.50 in 1940, in uncirculated condition. It thereafter increased in value, selling for about $18 by 1955, and $170 by 1975. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2018, lists the coin for between $310 and $380, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold at auction for $2,760 in 2008.

The bill authorizing the minting of the coin passed on June 24th and set a minimum of 50,000 coins to be minted. Additionally, taking into consideration the abuses perpetrated by previous commemorative coin programs, this legislation specifically required for the coins to be struck with a single design and at a single mint. Preparation Sculptor William Marks Simpson was hired to design the coin. Simpson had already previous designed two other commemorative coins, the Norfolk, Virginia, Bicentennial half dollar and the Roanoke Island, North Carolina half dollar. Release The minimum authorized mintage of 50,000 coins was struck and were sent to the Washington County Historical Society, which sold the coins for $1.65 a piece. However, due to scandals associated with commemorative coins from the previous year, collectors had begun to grow tired of commemorative issues. As a result, despite substantial advertising efforts, the coin was a poor seller, with 18,000 coins were sold and the remaining 32,000 halves were returned to the Philadelphia Mint for melting. However, despite selling poorly, commemorative program was entirely free of scandal.

Roosevelt to oppose any bills for new commemoratives, especially after a Congressional hearing held on April 15, 1937. However, with Harry S.

Former mint engraver Adam Pietz was selected by Mint director Nellie Tayloe Ross to design and sculpt the coin. The coins were sold by the Iowa Centennial Committee $2.50 for Iowans, and $3 for those outside of the state. The discounted price for Iowans came as a result of the committee wanting all Iowans to buy a coin if they wanted one.

The episode was written by Jeremy Carver and directed by Phil Sgriccia. It was first broadcast on May 15, 2013 on The CW. In the episode, Sam makes the ultimate sacrifice in order to complete the trials to lock the demons from Earth with the last trial being Crowley himself. Meanwhile, Dean allies with Castiel and Metatron in order to finish the Heaven trials but they're ambushed by Naomi and her angels, finally finding out what will happen when the spells are finished. The episode was critically acclaimed by critics, many citing it as the best season finale since \\"Swan Song\\". Plot Jody Mills (Kim Rhodes) is on a date with a man that she thinks is named Roderick but is actually Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard). The two get along great and Crowley claims to have lost someone special too, reminding Jody of the deaths of her son and husband and to start crying. Jody goes to the bathroom to calm down, but falls under a spell Crowley casts that causes her to choke on her own blood, unbeknownst to her there is a hex bag in her handbag. Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) call Crowley and demand he stop and he offers them a deal, using the little time Jody has left to force the issue. The deal is that they stop the undertaking the trials to close the Gates of Hell and give him the demon tablet, and he will stop killing Jody and everyone else they've ever saved. Dean agrees on the condition they trade the angel tablet for the demon tablet and Crowley agrees if they say \\"I surrender.\\" In order to make the deal happen, Kevin Tran (Osric Chau) digs up the first half of the tablet where he hid it, ironically under a sign depicting the Devil. Kevin puts the tablet halves back together and gives it to Sam and Dean. In return they give him the key to the Bunker, telling him to wait there. At the ruins of Singer Salvage Yard, Sam shows Crowley the demon tablet to prove he has it while Crowley shows them the angel tablet. Crowley produces a contract many yards long, and Dean insists on reading the fine detail. As he does, he gets close to Crowley and snaps the handcuffs on him that they found in the Bunker - ones covered in spell work that trap Crowley. An angel named Nathaniel approaches Naomi (Amanda Tapping) with the news that one of their freelance operatives has spotted Castiel in Houston, Texas. To Naomi's shock, Nathaniel reveals that Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) has been spotted with him. Metatron tells Castiel that the second trial is to obtain the bow of a Cupid. Metatron has ascertained that Dwight Charles - a bartender - will be shot by a Cupid's arrow. He and Metatron start watching Dwight, but Naomi arrives. She orders an angel to kill Castiel, but after the bartender shoots the angel and Metatron tells Castiel to stand down, she just leaves with her henchmen and Metatron. In her office in Heaven, Naomi straps Metatron to a chair. Despite having never met in person, Metatron recognizes her as the angel that was supposed to \\"debrief\\" him after God left Heaven. Naomi tells him that the archangels wanted to know the secrets in his mind and she now wants to know why he came out of hiding and what his plans are. Naomi tortures Metatron and is shocked by what she finds, asking him why he is going with the plan that he is. Metatron tells her that he was elevated to God's Scribe and it was incredible, but he knew once God left the archangels would try to get God's secrets from him. He was forced to flee. Now, Metatron says, he wants revenge. Sam and Dean take Crowley to a small church to undergo the third trial - to cure him of being a demon. They secure Crowley in the middle of a devil's trap. Sam needs to confess his sins in order to purify his blood to use on Crowley. Dean lists a number of things Sam has done working with Ruby, killing Lilith, letting Lucifer out, losing his soul, and not looking for Dean when he went to Purgatory. Castiel arrives, telling Dean he needs his help in undertaking the trials. Dean is reluctant to go, but Sam insists he will be fine. At the Bunker they give the Angel Tablet to Kevin, and ask that he translate it, to find out what the remaining trials may be. Cas and Dean return to watch Dwight Charles at his bar. They see a delivery woman Gail arrive at the bar, they think she will be the one that Dwight falls in love with. However she is the Cupid, and she causes Dwight and his regular customer Rod to fall in love. Outside the bar, Dean and Castiel tell the Cupid they need her bow, which appears as a mark on her hand. She tells them how chaotic Heaven is, and willingly helps them. Meanwhile, Sam has continued injecting Crowley with his blood. At one point Crowley bites Sam, and when he leaves to get a bandage, Crowley creates a makeshift goblet of blood with his hand and uses the blood to send a call for help. Abaddon (Alaina Huffman) arrives, and throws Sam through a window, but she tells Crowley she is not there to help him, but to take over ruling Hell. But Sam douses her meatsuit with holy oil, setting her on fire, and she vacates the body and leaves. Crowley, who is obviously regaining his humanity, and tries to bond with Sam, tearfully declaring that he deserves to loved. Naomi appears on Earth near where Castiel and Dean are talking on the phone to Kevin who has been examining the angel tablet, cannot find any mention of the trials Castiel has undertaken. Castiel angrily confronts her with his angel blade, but Naomi insists that she is just there to talk, not fight and Dean gets Castiel to hear her out. Naomi reveals what she has learned from Metatron: as revenge for his expulsion from Heaven, he is using Castiel to expel all angels permanently, not close the gates of Heaven. Castiel doesn't believe her, but Naomi insists that its true. She expresses regret for all of her actions, crying and tells Castiel and Dean that angels were meant to protect humanity and somewhere along the line they lost sight of that. Naomi, reminding Dean that she told him he could trust her, tells him that while she wants him to close the gates of Hell, she has learned that doing so will kill Sam, that God intended for the person closing the gates to have to make the ultimate sacrifice. Naomi tells Castiel that if he wishes to return to Heaven she is now willing to hear him out and disappears. Castiel doesn't believe her claims and Kevin Tran is unable to back them up with the angel tablet, but Dean does and has Castiel take him to Sam. When Castiel finds Metatron, he extracts Castiel's grace from him, telling him it is the final part of a spell that will achieve what Naomi described. He sends Castiel back to Earth, and completes the spell. Dean arrives just as Sam is about to complete the ritual, and begs him to stop warning it will kill him. Sam is nonplussed and tells Dean the sin he confessed earlier, was of all the times he had let Dean down. He fears if he does it again Dean will turn to someone else for support. Dean is passionate in disavowing this, \\"Don't you dare think that there is anything, past or present, that I would put in front of you!\\" he says. Sam says he feels consumed by the trial, and Dean holds him, telling him to let it go. The feeling seems to abate, but suddenly Sam is struck by pain. Dean carries him outside, and they collapse on the ground near the Impala. Metatron expels Castiel to Earth, now a human. Kevin is in the bunker when alarms begin to detect paranormal activities across the world at the same time. Then, Sam, Dean, Castiel and Crowley look to the sky and see thousands of angels falling to Earth. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 2.31 million viewers with a 1.0/3 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a 13% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 2.07 million viewers. 1.0 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. Supernatural ranked as the second most watched program on The CW in the day, behind Arrow. =Critical reviews= \\"Sacrifice\\" received critical acclaim from critics. Diana Steenbergen of IGN gave the episode an \\"Amazing\\" 9.4 out of 10 and wrote in her verdict, \\"Supernaturals eighth season went out on a high note with some game changing twists and great performances. Plus, they continued the tradition of using 'Carry On Wayward Son' at the beginning; that never fails to get the season finale started on the right note. We were left with several cliffhangers: Sam's condition after stopping the trials, Castiel losing his angelic power, and the angels falling from heaven. I'm also curious to see if Crowley will be changed after nearly being cured or if he will revert to his old self. Plus Abaddon was on the loose. There will be plenty to keep the show occupied when it returns next season, that's for sure.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com wrote,\\"'Sacrifice' wasn't a flawless finale ‚Äî I kind of take issue with Dean's 'I didn't mean all that crap about not trusting you' monologue because, eh, he's seemed pretty freaking sincere about it the past several seasons, which is totally fine, but let's not conveniently forget about it just because Sam was about to nobly kill himself... again. It's not fair to Dean to cheapen his sincerity and in some cases, totally justified anger/hurt. And it's not fair to Sam to basically reduce his anger/hurt to an overreaction. However, that being my only major complaint with the episode, I'd say 'Sacrifice' was pretty close to perfect. It's definitely the best finale we've had since 'Swan Song' ‚Äî unless you didn't like \\"Swan Song,\\" in which case, feel free to substitute your own favorite. 'No Rest for the Wicked,' perhaps? Also a solid choice.\\" Hunter Bishop of TV Overmind wrote, \\"The season 8 finale of Supernatural delivered so many terrific individual moments, gave the fans a spectacular final 10 minutes, tied up some loose ends and left so many amazing possibilities for season 9 that my head is basically reeling.\\" Sean McKenna of \\"TV Fanatic\\" wrote, \\"After eight years and 172 episodes, Supernatural still knows exactly how to deliver a fantastic finale. 'Sacrifice' provided a gripping hour filled with laughs, heart, emotion, twists and a game-changing final moment that was as shocking as it was visually cool. I've still got to pick my jaw up off the floor with those closing moments, after having been engrossed in the entire hour. Not only was it a wild ride that made nothing what it seemed and things less easy to predict, but like any great finale should be, it has me excited for when the show picks up again next fall. This is definitely an episode worth watching again and one fans will be talking about. The bar has certainly been set high. Bravo, Supernatural. Way to close Supernatural season 8 with blazing, riveting and emotional-filled glory.\\" Caroline Preece of Den of Geek wrote, \\"Overall, this finale had the gumption to try something different, resisting the urge to trot out yet another good vs. evil fight that inevitably leads one of the brothers to a heaven/hell/purgatory dimension. It's refreshing and, for the first time in a long time, I'm excited about what we're going to see in the subsequent season premiere. Castiel is human!? Sam is still glowing!? Crowley is human(ish)!? Biggest of all, the angels are descending from heaven in a shower of awesome, and the reality that the Winchesters have been living in has changed forever.

Washington Memorial half dollar was designed by Isaac Scott Hathaway and minted in silver between 1946 and 1951. The obverse depicts Booker T. Washington. The reverse shows the cabin in which Washington was born, now the Booker T. Washington National Monument, and the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, in which Washington is honored. The description on the reverse reads \\"From slave cabin to Hall of Fame.\\" Inception Booker T. Washington's birthplace, which is depicted on the reverse of the coin The Booker T. Washington Birthplace Memorial Commission, which aimed to strike a commemorative coin in Washington's honor due to his importance in both American and African-American history, had successfully raised funds to buy and maintain his birthplace in Franklin County, Virginia. The funds also helped the commission to get legislation passed on August 7th, 1946 which authorized the mintage of up to 5 million commemorative half dollars. There were no requirements when or at what mint the coins would be struck at, a fact which the commission noticeably took advantage of throughout the coin program, as the coins would be minted for several years at all three mints. Preparation Sculptor Charles Keck, who had previously designed the Panama Pacific Gold Dollar, Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar, and Lynchburg Sesquicentennial half dollar, was initially commissioned to design for the coin. Meanwhile, African-American artist Isaac Scott Hathaway learned of the coin program and offered his own design models for free, which were based on a life mask of Washington. Eventually, Hathaway's obverse model was the one that was accepted by the Commission of Fine Arts, and based on feedback from the commission, Hathaway subsequently prepared a reverse design as well. Although his models were not used, Keck was still paid for his work. Perhaps due to the declining interest in commemorative coins, the Booker T. Washington Memorial half dollar was produced much less carefully than most previous commemorative coins. As a result, many pieces will have abrasions or contact marks on the highest points of the design, especially on Washington's cheek. During the time the coins were issued, complaints about the condition of the coins were common. Release The coins were offered by the Booker T. Washington Birthplace Memorial Commission, and were priced at $1 each for the Philadelphia and San Francisco issues, while the lower mintage Denver issue sold for $1 each. During this first year, 200,000 sets were issued, with an additional 800,000 coins intended for sale as singles minted at Philadelphia. Despite the large number sold, many of the coins were either melted or released into circulation. In the following years, instead of being offered directly by the Booker T. Washington Birthplace Memorial Commission, the coins would be offered by coin firms which worked as authorized agents of the commission. By then, both sales and mintage figures had considerably declined, and would continue to decline for the rest of the program. One exception to this trend is the 1950 San Francisco and 1951 Philadelphia issues, which the commission sold as a part of a promotion which also involved schools and hospitals. However, a considerable portion of the mintage of these coins would still be returned to the mint in the following years for melting. References Cultural depictions of Booker T.

The 2013 improvements are intended to be an interim solution as the transit center will eventually be replaced by a newer and larger one. The decision was made to reconstruct the Spokane Community College transit center at a site on the opposite side of campus. Growing transit operations combined with site constraints, particularly the construction of an elevated North Spokane Corridor adjacent to the current site, limit the future potential of the transit center in its current form.

The three subspecies are *Pseudocrenilabrus philander philander (Weber. 1897), native to streams flowing towards the Indian Ocean from the Zambezi River Delta southward to the vicinity of the city of Durban, South Africa. *Pseudocrenilabrus philander dispersus (Trewavas, 1936), native to streams flowing towards the Atlantic Ocean from the Orange River in South Africa northwards to the upper tributaries of the Congo River. *Pseudocrenilabrus philander luebberti (Hilgendorf, 1902), limited to the Otavi Pan in Namibia. Habitat It has a wide tolerance and can be found in a variety of habitats, including streams, lakes, ponds and sinkholes. Some populations exist in slightly brackish conditions. It usually prefers vegetated zones. Biology The prey consists of insects, shrimps and even small fish. Breeding occurs from early spring to late summer; the male fish defend a territory, construct a simple cleared nest in the substrate and attract gravid females. The eggs are laid in the nest, fertilized by the male and collected by the female. The females withdraws to a nursery to incubate the eggs in her mouth for 12‚Äì14 days at 26 ¬∞C, releasing the fry after which she guards them for 5‚Äì7 days, sheltering them in her mouth when approached by predators. Pseudocrenilabrus philander prefers to remain close to the substrate, only rarely moving higher than 1m above the bottom. Most of its food is obtained from foraging through the substrate, though small swimming prey such as zooplankton are taken when the opportunity to do so arises. In shallow water, individuals will rise to the surface to seize stranded terrestrial insects such as ants or termites. Aquaria It is uncommon as an aquarium fish, many populations are confused with its cogener Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor, because Pseudocrenilabrus philander is so variable and some populations resemble its northern cousin. It is relatively easy to keep and breed in the aquarium. Naming Pseudocrenilabrus philander was described by Max Carl Wilhelm Weber in 1897 as Chromis philander, from specimens taken in the Umhloti river in KwaZulu-Natal;Katongo, C., Seehausen, O. & Snoeks, J. (2017): A new species of Pseudocrenilabrus (Perciformes: Cichlidae) from Lake Mweru in the Upper Congo River System. Zootaxa, 4237 (1): 181‚Äì190. the genus Pseudocrenilabrus was named by the American ichthyologist Henry Weed Fowler in 1934 with P. philander as the type species, under the junior synonyms Pseudocrenilabrus natalensis. The generic name is a compound of the Greek \\"pseudes\\" meaning false, Latin crenulatus meaning cut and Latin \\"labrum\\" meaning lip while the specific name is derived from the Greek \\"philandros\\" meaning \\"one who loves men\\". Parasites The parasitic monogenean Cichlidogyrus philander As most fish, Pseudocrenilabrus philander harbours several species of parasites. A specific parasite on its gills is the monogenean Cichlidogyrus philander. This parasite has been recorded in the wild in fish caught in Zimbabwe and South Africa.

Smirnova). Milovanova attended the Tchiszakoff Dance School in St. Petersburg from 1900 to 1908. She became a member of Anna Pavlova's dance troupe, and, two years later, she became apart of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, and toured across Europe. While performing in London, World War I broke out, and the company found themselves stranded there. In 1916, Milovanova returned to Russia, and was hired at the Nicholas II Theater. The October Revolution forced Milovanova to flee from Russia to Monte Carlo, where she planned to continue her work in the Ballets Russes. Instead, director Ren√© Navarre took notice of her, and Milovanova signed a contract with Gaumont Film Company, making her film debut in La p'tite du sixi√®me (1917) as Sandra Milovanoff. Louis Feuillade became fascinated by Milovanoff, and she next starred in Feuillade's film serial The Two Girls (1921) alongside Olinda Mano and Violette Jyl, followed by L'orpheline (1921), and Parisette (1921). Milovanoff became a very famous actress throughout France, and was ranked only second to Mary Pickford on a popularity scale in a magazine. After her contract with Gaumont expired, Jacques de Baroncelli began managing her career. She then starred in The Legend of Sister Beatrix (1923), N√®ne (1924), which she received praise for her performance in, The Phantom of the Moulin Rouge (1925), directed by Ren√© Clair, Les Mis√©rables (1925), and The Prey of the Wind (1926), which asserted her as a tragedienne. After starring in Mauprat (1926), directed by Jean Epstein, Milovanoff's career took off internationally. In Germany, she played a supporting role in Make Up (1927) with Marcella Albani and Werner Krauss, in Sweden she acted in Gustaf Molander's Sealed Lips (1927), and La Condesa Mar√≠a (1928) in Spain. With the advent of sound, Milovanoff's career began to falter, as her Slavic accent was considered unsuitable for talkies. She made only one film in the 1930s, Dans la nuit (1930), in which she played Charles Vanel's wife. She attempted to resume her career as a dancer, but by this time was too old. She married for a second time to Maurice de Moolek, with whom she had a daughter. She returned to film in the 1940s, appearing in Apr√®s Mein Kampf, mes crimes (1940), The Last Judgment (1945), and The Private Life of an Actor (1948). She made her final screen appearance in Ils ont vingt ans (1950). Milovanoff remarried a third time to makeup artist Joseph Mejinsky, and died in Paris on 8 May 1957. She is buried at Cimeti√®re parisien de Pantin.

He was known for his portrayal of female characters such as Usha (Usha Parinayam), Satyabhama (Bhama Kalapam), Deva Devi (Vipra Narayana), Mohini (Mohini Rukmangada), Sasirekha (Sasirekha Parinayam) and Gollabhama (Gollakalapam). He was a recipient of several honors including Kalidas Samman, Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 1970, for his contributions to Dance.  Biography  Portrait of Siddhendra Yogi Satyanarayana Sarma was born on 9 September 1935 at Kuchipudi, a small village in Krishna district of the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh in Vedantam family which is known for its Kuchipudi tradition, to Vedantam Venkataratnam and Subbamma. He started training Kuchipudi at the age of five under his elder brother, Vedantam Prahalada Sarma, and later trained under known exponents, Vedantam Lakshminarayana Sastri and Chinta Krishnamurthy. He also did training in classical music under Yeleswarapu Seetharamanjaneyulu and Sishta Brahmaiah Sastry, as Bhagawata Melam (Kuchipudi Yakshagaanam), a dance-drama format of Kuchipudi required the performer to sing as well. He made his debut at the age of fourteen, performing in two melams, Harischandra and Ramanatakam, staged at a local temple by the group led by Pasumarthy Kondalarayudu. His first major performance came at the age on nineteen, when he portrayed the role of Parvathi in Usha Parinayam, staged in Sapru House, Delhi. Sarma continued performing as female characters in many melams and his portrayal of Sathyabhama in the dance-drama, Bhama Kalapam, reportedly written by Siddhendra Yogi later became his signature role. Gollabhama, Mohini, Sasirekha and Devadevi were some of his other notable characters. He is known to have developed a new ethos in abhinaya, often termed as Eka Patra, which, in the beginning, did not meet with the approval of many traditionalists of the art form. He performed in over 10,000 stages, including in front of Rukmini Devi Arundale, the founder of Kalakshetra. In 1967, he performed as a male dancer in a dance sequence, Girija Kalyanam, in the Telugu film, Rahasyam, directed by Vedantam Raghavaiah. Towards the latter part of his life, he was more involved in teaching the dance at Venkatarama Natya Mandali, a dance school dedicated to Kuchipudi, at his native place. He also wrote several texts on the dance form and Natya Shastra, Abhinaya Darpanam, Tandava Lakshanam and Alankara Shastram feature among them. Sarma was married to Lakshminarasamma and the couple had a son and two daughters. He died on 16 November 2012, at the age of 77, succumbing to respiratory illnesses at a private hospital in Vijayawada. His life has been documented in a film, I am Satyabhama, directed by Dulam Satyanarayana.  Awards and honors  Sarma received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1961, making him the first Kuchipudi exponent to receive the honor. Six years later, the Akademi honored him again, with Sangeet Natak Akademi Ratna in 1967. The Government of India included him in the Republic Day honors list for the civilian honor of the Padma Shri in 1970. The Government of Madhya Pradesh also honored him with their civilian award, Kalidas Samman, in 1988.

It should not be confused with the nearby St Cuthbert's church, Milburn. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Appleby, the archdeaconry of Carlisle, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of ten local churches to form the benefice of Heart of Eden. The Parish Church of St Cuthbert, Dufton, is situated north-west of the village of Dufton ‚Äì the name of which means 'dove farm' ‚Äì and nestles beneath the eastern fells above the Eden Valley, about north of Appleby and south-east of Penrith. From the new churchyard, fine views are to be had of Dufton Pike and the Pennines.  History and Etymology  The old churchyard is curvilinear, possibly indicating a Celtic foundation. 'Old Dufton', the site of a settlement on the fell above Dufton, has been identified as Romano-British. The first mention of 'the manor of Dufton' occurs in the Pipe Rolls of 1176 and of the church itself in Papal Taxation Records of 1291. Tradition has it that the original church was built on one of the sites where monks from Lindisfarne rested themselves and the body of St Cuthbert during their flight from the Vikings in 865/6.Church records indicate a rector's presence in 1293, while the dedication to St Cuthbert is referred to in 1366. However, the ornamental stones used in the rebuilding of the church, the two re-used round window-heads and the two voussoirs with chevron-ornament, reset in the north and south walls respectively, point to the existence of twelfth-century building. There is also evidence of earlier stonework : outside, in the south wall of the chancel, there is a small figure carved into a small stone panel which is thought to be of Roman origin, and set into the east wall of the nave is an ornamented medieval grave slab. The walls of the present building are of sandstone rubble and ashlar with dressings of the same material; the roofs are slate-covered. The interior is light and airy, with no chancel arch and a high canted ceiling with stucco panelling, spanning both nave and chancel. At the west end is a wooden-panelled gallery and underneath it a slim font. Restorations took place in 1673, 1784 and 1853. The 1784 restoration, undertaken by the rector and people, appears to have included the building of the west tower, the re-building of the north wall, and perhaps the upper parts of other walls. The 1853 restoration seems to have determined to a great extent the present character of the building. In 1946, the roof and east end were rebuilt, and the old glass re-used in the new east window. In 1983, some south-side windows were re-leaded. The brightness and airiness of the interior derive from the nature of the windows which are a feature of this church. They share a pattern of clear glass and brightly coloured, lozenge-shaped panes. They are said to have been made by Faucet of Appleby c.1784. In the centre of the east window is a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descending in flames ‚Äì and a reminder that Dufton means 'dove farm'. Three plaques describe various endowments for the poor and uneducated of Dufton and Knock. One of these on the north wall of the nave, includes an endowment in 1835 \\"to ten poor widows or householders of the parish of Dufton also to five poor widows or householders of the township of Knock, to each six and a half stone loaves of the finest wheaten bread\\" for distribution every Christmas Day. Dufton's Famous Son Among the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970 was John Boste (Boast) who is honoured with a plaque in the porch. The Boste family belonged to Penrith and Dufton, and parish records show that they were christened, married and buried in both places. John was born in Dufton in 1543. He reputedly attended Appleby Grammar School where he became a master after leaving Queen's College, Oxford. At Oxford, John was elected a Fellow, which means he had taken holy orders in the Protestant Church of England. We know, however, that he later became a Roman Catholic, trained for the priesthood in France and, following ordination, returned to England to minister in secret to the Catholics of his native land, particularly those in the north. He became a wanted man and was eventually betrayed, arrested and taken to the Tower of London. For entering the country illegally as a Catholic priest and for celebrating Mass he was charged with treason and tried at Durham, where he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered on 24 July 1594. He died faithfully. St. Cuthbert's, Dufton The church originates from the medieval period, but was rebuilt in 1784 and restored in 1853 and again in 1946. It is Grade II listed.

In 1994 he made his professional debut in the German Formula Three Championship, however, he only scored 5 points and finished 24th in the championship. In 1995 he stayed in German F3 but switched from Volkswagen to Opel and improved to 11th in points. He moved up to International Formula 3000 in 1996 with the RSM Marko team and finished tenth in points, finishing on the podium in third at the season finale at Hockenheimring. Tichy returned to the series in 1997 with Pacific Racing. He finished a career-best second at the Helsinki Thunder round but left the team after eight races. He returned to the series with the Coloni Motorsport team for the season finale at Circuito de Jerez and delivered by again finishing in second place on the podium. He finished seventh in the championship despite missing a race. He was away from racing after that until midway through the 1998 season when he returned to the Coloni team. He failed to score points in any of his races with Coloni in 1998. Tichy's final professional race appearance came in 2001 when he appeared in a single race in the FIA GT Championship.

Early life and education Badstuber was born in Copenhagen in 1685 to coppersmith Lorentz Badstuber (died 1692) and Anna Andreasdatter Knock (died 1725, married a second time to the merchant Jacob Zitzke, died 1708). He learned the trade from his father and inherited the father's property in N√∏rregade. Career In 1719, Badstuber had title of court coppersmith. His works as such included the copper roof on Christian VI's Christiansborg Palace. Badstuber 's father had already in the 1680s taken over the management Nym√∏lle Copper Mill under Frederiksdal. He expanded his business with the acquisition of Brede Works in 1819 and obtained a monopoly on the production of copper and brass goods on the Danish islands. In 1738, when Frederikdal passed out of royal ownership, Badstuber was granted ownership of Nym√∏lle to facilitate the establishment of a production of scythes and wire. He also owned farmland in Lundtofte and a farm in S√∏ller√∏d. His house in N√∏rregade in Copenhagen was destroyed in the Copenahgen Fire of 1728 but rebuilt at great costs in 1730-32. Late years In the 1730s, Badstuber experienced economic difficulties culminating with his bankruptcy in 1776. His properties in Copenhagen and North Zealand were sold in public auction at prices far lower that what they had costed him. His creditors wanted him imprisoned for his \\"shamreful bankruptcy which left them with a loss of 60,000 Danish rigsdaler. He spent his last years in Birker√∏d with his eldest daughter who was the widow of former pastor at S√∏ller√∏d Church Andreas Cramer.

In Spanish America, the ideas of the Enlightenment affected educated elites in major urban centers, especially Mexico City, Lima, and Guatemala, where there were universities founded in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In these centers of learning, American-born Spanish intellectuals were already participants in intellectual and scientific discourse, with Spanish American universities increasingly anti-scholastic and opposed to ‚Äúuntested authority‚Äù even before the Spanish Bourbons came to power.James Lockhart and Stuart B. Schwartz, Early Latin America. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983, p. 344. The best studied is the University of San Carlos Guatemala, founded in 1676.Lanning, John Tate. The Eighteenth-Century Enlightenment in the University of San Carlos de Guatemala. Ithaca: Cornell University Press 1958. In Spanish America just as in Spain, the Enlightenment had some aspects of anticlericalism, but many priests were in favor of science and scientific thinking and were practitioners themselves.D.A. Brading, The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492-1867. New York: Cambridge University Press 1991, pp. 557-58, 609. Some clergy were proponents of the Enlightenment as well as independence.Karl Schmitt. \\"The Clergy and the Enlightenment in Latin America: An Analysis.\\" The Americas, April 1959 (vol. 15), no. 4. Enlightenment texts circulating in Spanish America have been linked to the intellectual underpinnings of Spanish American independence.Charles Griffin, ‚ÄúThe Enlightenment and Latin American Independence‚Äù in Latin America and the Enlightenment, Arthur P. Whitaker, ed. (2nd edition). New York 1961. Works by Enlightenment philosophers were owned and read in Spanish America, despite restrictions on the book trade and their inclusion on the Inquisition‚Äôs list of forbidden books .Henry Bernstein, ‚Äú A Provincial Library in Colonial Mexico,‚Äù The Hispanic American Historical Review 26(1946) pp. 162-83. The Jesuits were instrumental introducing new trends in philosophy to Spanish America, and following their expulsion in 1767, the Franciscans continued exploring this line of thought.Schmitt, ‚ÄúThe Clergy and the Enlightenment‚Äù. Spanish American secular clergy owned such works, including Mexican priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, whose free-thinking lost him his position as rector of the seminary of San Nicol√°s and he was sent to the small parish of Dolores. Jos√© Celestino Mutis, botanist of the Spanish American Enlightenment Illustrations from Spanish botanist Jos√© Celestino Mutis's work in Colombia. Priests pursued science, even in the seventeenth- century ‚Äúbaroque‚Äù era, most prominently Mexican creole intellectual Don Carlos de Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora, as well as the remarkable Mexican nun, Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz. In the eighteenth century, there were several Spanish-born as well as American-born priests practicing science. Prominent among them was Spanish- born Jos√© Celestino Mutis in New Granada, who headed the royal botanical expedition to New Granada. He was educated in mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. Mutis trained Francisco Jos√© de Caldas. In Peru, Hip√≥lito Unanue, a secular cleric trained in medicine, contributed to a Peruvian publication, Mercurio Peruano. Similar to him was Mexican secular cleric Jos√© Antonio de Alzate y Ram√≠rez, who founded important newspapers that disseminated knowledge about scientific findings, including his own. Alexander von Humboldt met and consulted with Mutis, Caldas, and read the works of Alzate (who died just before Humboldt arrived in New Spain) during his scientific expedition to Spanish America at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Humboldt was impressed by the intellectual level of science in Spanish America.Brading, The First America Two strains of philosophical thought were evident in Spanish America, one was enlightened despotism and the other variations on constitutionalism. Divisions among clerics in Spanish America were between those supporting regalism, that is, the supremacy of the crown over the Catholic Church, and those adhering to ultramontanism, supporting the power of the papacy over monarchs. The Spanish crown moved to consolidate its supremacy over the Catholic Church by suppressing the Society of Jesus in Spain and in its overseas empire in 1767. The Jesuits were ‚Äúsoldiers of the Pope‚Äù, taking a vow to serve the pontiff. They were successful in their missions to indigenous peoples on the frontiers of the Spanish empire, such as northern Mexico and most famously in Paraguay. Jesuit educational institutions had as pupils the sons of American born Spaniards, and were places where ideas of the Enlightenment were disseminated. The Jesuits held a considerable number of profitable landed estates, or haciendas, which were run efficiently by Jesuits trained in management.Herman Konrad, A Jesuit Hacienda in Colonial Mexico: Santa Luc√≠a 1576-1767. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1980. Their loyalty to the pope and their defiance of the crown authority as well as their clear success in important realms where the diocesan clergy or other religious orders might have excelled meant that their expulsion in 1767 was not opposed by the episcopal hierarchy or religious orders. Francisco Javier Clavijero, Jesuit Mexican creole patriot. The exile of the Jesuits to Europe was a blow to elite American-born Spanish families, whose sons were educated by the Jesuits or themselves Jesuits and has been seen as contributing to creole alienation from the Bourbon monarchy. An important exiled Jesuit was Francisco Javier Clavijero, who wrote a major history of Mexico, seeing its origins in the achievements of indigenous civilizations and creating an idea of Mexico separate from peninsular Spain.Brading, The First America, The Spanish crown also moved against the clergy as a whole by attempted to limit the corporate privileges of the Catholic Church, the fuero eclesi√°stico, which gave clerics the right to be judged for all offenses in canonical rather than crown courts.N.M. Farriss, Crown and Clergy in Colonial Mexico, 1759-1821. London: Athlone Press 1968. The fuero had been an important factor in strengthening the prestige and power of the lower secular clergy. Parish priests were often the only person of European ethnicity in indigenous parishes, who exercised both political and sacred power.William B. Taylor, Magistrates of the Sacred: Priests and Parishioners in Eighteenth-Century Mexico. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1996. In late colonial Mexico, an important bishop-elect Manuel Abad y Queipo, considered liberal, and sought social, economic, and political reforms, but he firmly opposed Father Hidalgo‚Äôs 1810 uprising for independence.Lillian E. Fisher, Champion of Reform Manuel Abad y Queipo. New York 1955, pp. 65-96. Abad y Queipo gave Humboldt some of his writings on conditions in New Spain and the need for reform to Humboldt, and his ideas found their way into Humboldt‚Äôs famous ‚Äò‚ÄôPolitical Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain‚Äô‚Äô.D.A. Brading, Church and State in Bourbon Mexico: The Diocese of Michoac√°n 1749-1810. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1994, p. 228. Another development in Spanish America was the formation of economic societies and ‚Äúfriends of the country,‚Äù by elite men to improve the local economy through science. They also functioned as discussion groups that considered political issues, particularly as crown policies increasingly favored the peninsula.Robert J. Shafer, The Economic Societies in the Spanish World (1763-1821). Syracuse: 1958. The crown founded a number of institutions aimed at scientific and economic progress, as well as cultural advancement. In Mexico, the crown established of the College of Mines in 1792, directed by Spanish mineralogist Fausto Elhuyar. It was designed to train experts for the empire‚Äôs most lucrative industry, silver mining.Arthur Whittaker, \\"The Elhuyar Mining Missioin and the Enlightenment,\\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 31 (1951), pp. 558-83.Walter Howe, The Mining Guild of New Spain and its Tribunal General 1770-1821.

Motten, Mexican Silver and the Enlightenment. Philadelphia 1959. Depiction of the casta system in Mexico. Art and architecture were cultural expressions that felt the impact of Enlightenment ideas. The Academy of San Carlos was founded in 1781 as the School for Engraving, and two years later renamed the(Real Academia de la Tres Nobles Artes de San Carlos. Miguel Cabrera was one of its most important members. The Palacio de Miner√≠a in Mexico City and the hospicio in Guadalajara, as well as the cathedral in Buenos Aires were designed in the neoclassical style, favoring clean lines and minimal decoration, in contrast to the more ornate baroque architecture.Kelly Donahue-Wallace, Art and Architecture of Viceregal Latin America, 1521-1821. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2008, pp.232-33. \\"Readily understandable and providing solace in its promise of heavenly glory, the Baroque is an art for the people. It was this very popularity that led to the anti-Baroque movement of the highbrow Neoclassical academies of the eighteenth century.\\"Gauvin Alexander Bailey, Art of Colonial Latin America. New York: Phaidon 2005, p. 275. The growth of scientific ideas and the development of different kinds of taxonomy, such as Carl Linnaeus‚Äôs, may well have been the impetus behind the emergence of secular paintings of racial mixture and racial hierarchy in late eighteenth- century Mexico, called casta paintings.Ilona Katzew, Casta Painting. New Haven: Yale University Press 2004. The crown attempted to rein in popular aspects of ‚Äúbaroque‚Äù Catholicism, eliminating burials in the interior of churches and churchyards as a public health measure.Pamela Voekel, Alone Before God: The Religious Origins of Mexican Modernity. Durham: Duke University Press 2001. It successfully suppressed Carnival in Mexico and sought to downsize popular pious practices such as religious processions. Secular entertainments such as bullfighting were no longer supported by the crown, and theatrical productions had didactic and secular themes rather than religious.Juan Pedro Viqueira Alb√°n, Propriety and Permissiveness in Bourbon Mexico.

Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, it commemorates men of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry killed in the conflict; it was unveiled on Armistice Day, 11 November 1923, and has been a grade II listed building since 1972. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' civic war memorials. As well as civic memorials, Lutyens designed multiple war memorials for private companies and individual regiments. The regiment originally planned a memorial outside its headquarters at Cowley Barracks but was unable to find a suitable site for it. Instead, the memorial was built on a site on Rose Hill in Cowley on land donated by Christ Church College (one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford), the location having been chosen so that the memorial would be visible against the sky. History and design The memorial consists of a single obelisk sat on a moulded pedestal and a plain square base and, typically for Lutyens' war memorials, it rises centrally from three shallow steps. The only relief on the obelisk is a carving of the regimental cap badge‚Äîdescribed by Historic England as \\"immediately announcing the identity of those commemorated\\"‚Äîon two of the faces. The west face of the base bears the inscription \\"TO THE GLORIOUS MEMORY OF 5878 OF ALL RANKS OF THE OXFORDSHIRE AND BUCKINGHAMSHIRE LIGHT INFANTRY WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR\\"; this was supplemented later by an inscription on the east face: \\"TO THE GLORIOUS MEMORY OF 1408 ALL RANKS OF THE OXFORDSHIRE AND BUCKINGHAMSHIRE LIGHT INFANTRY WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR 1939 ‚Äì 1945\\". The dates of the First World War are inscribed on the other two faces in Roman numerals: MCMXIV on the north and MCMXIX on the south. The obelisk is similar to the Lancashire Fusiliers War Memorial, also an obelisk dedicated to an individual regiment located in Bury in the north-west of England, but is described by author Tim Skelton as being a \\"much plainer\\" design.Skelton, p. 89. The unveiling was performed by the colonel of the regiment, Major-General Sir John Hanbury-Williams, on Armistice Day, 11 November 1923. The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 28 June 1972. In March 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free- standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

He then undertook postgraduate research in theology and completed a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1986. His doctoral thesis was titled \\"Obeying the truth: a study of Paul's exhortation in Galatians 5‚Äì6\\". Academic career Barclay's early career was spent at the University of Glasgow, where he was a lecturer from 1984 to 1996, senior lecturer from 1996 to 2000, and professor from 2000 to 2003. In 2003, he was named the successor to James D.G. Dunn as the Lightfoot Professor of Divinity at Durham University. Barclay is the current President of the British New Testament Society. He is the former editor of the academic journal New Testament Studies (Cambridge University Press). =Paul and the Gift= One of Barclay's most recent works, Paul and the Gift (Eerdmans, 2015), has drawn considerable praise from scholars around the world. It has been hailed by Markus Bockmuehl and Tim Foster as the most significant book on Paul since E.P. Sanders's Paul and Palestinian Judaism (1977). Douglas Moo has said it is \\"one of the best books on Pauline theology in the last twenty years.\\" Paul Foster likewise proclaims, \\"This book will be not only much-discussed in Pauline scholarship, it will be much-prized for the genuine advances it offers in understanding Paul‚Äôs thought.\\" Paul and the Gift was also reviewed by scholars in popular publications such as Books & Culture and First Things. One of the insights from Paul and the Gift that led to its very positive reception is the manner in which Barclay develops Paul's theology of grace. By setting this concept in the context of ancient notions of gift, Barclay discerns six key ways in which gift, and thus grace, can be conveyed in Paul: superabundance, singularity, priority, incongruity, efficacy, and non- circularity. In an interview with Christianity Today, Barclay explains, \\"So while I disagree with the New Perspective in its sidelining grace within Paul‚Äôs thought, I agree with its emphasis that Paul was fundamentally concerned with creating new communities that crossed ethnic and social boundaries.\\" =Criticism of N.T. Wright= Although they maintain a warm relationship, Barclay has been an outspoken critic of N.T. Wright's work on Paul. This has led to several high-profile debates between the two, most recently at New College, Edinburgh University on 15 June 2016 concerning each author's most recent books. They also debated Paul's relationship to the Roman Empire (the 'Paul and Empire' conversation) at the 2007 Society of Biblical Literature Annual Meeting in San Diego. Barclay's plenary speech from this session is now published as a chapter in his most recent work, Pauline Churches and Diaspora Jews (Eerdmans, 2016).

Cretara is a figurative artist and has often been labeled a modern Caravaggista, as he favors the chiaroscuro method of painting. Domenic died in Harbor City, CA on December 22, 2017. Early life =Childhood= Domenic Cretara grew up an only child in an Italian American neighborhood in East Boston, Massachusetts. His father was Anthony Mario Cretara born in Abruzzo, Italy and his mother was Carmela (Addivinola) Cretara born in Boston of Italian immigrant parents from the Campania region of Italy. As an only child, Domenic often retreated into his imagination for subject matter and very often referenced images of the Italian Renaissance artists around his home. =Education and training= In 1968 Domenic graduated magna cum laude from Boston University, with a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts. He also received his Master's of Fine Arts from the same University. Career After graduation, Cretara served as Chair of the Fine Arts Department for the Art Institute of Boston, before traveling to California in 1986 to join the studio art department at California State University at Long Beach. While there, he has also acted as the Resident Director for the California State University International Program (CSU IP) in Florence, Italy. As an exhibiting artist in both drawing and painting Cretara's work has been featured in numerous significant figurative exhibitions nationally and internationally since the 1970s. He has had solo exhibitions in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. During the period from the 1970s to the present his works have been cited in numerous reviews, articles, and publications globally. His influence and impact as both an artist and Professor of Art has contributed to generation upon generation of new art educators and visual artists both in the studio fine arts and in the field of art history in the United States, Europe, and Asia. =Exhibitions= Cretara's works have been featured in a numerous museum and gallery exhibitions. In 2001 Cretara had a solo exhibition of his work at the Frye Museum in Seattle, Washington titled Dominic Cretara: Portals. In this exhibition he touched on different subjects including the human struggles, a recurring theme in his artwork. In March 2008, the 19-piece collection titled \\"Domenic Cretara: The Large Drawings\\" was featured at the Todd Gallery at MTSU. Cretara's work was also included in ‚ÄúThe Figure in Contemporary Art‚Äù at Cypress College in Cypress California in 2012. The exhibition included other notable figurative artists such as Odd Nerdrum, Ruth Weisberg, Sigmund Abeles, Steven Assael, Juliette Aristides and Jerome Witkin. In 2013, a retrospective survey of his work was organized by the Triton Museum of Art, Santa Clara, Calif. The featured works were presented in four categories: \\"Doll Paintings\\", \\"Family\\", \\"Gender Roles\\", and \\"An Italo- American Life\\". In 2014, he exhibited a series of large scale works on paper in the exhibition \\"The Way of Flesh Part 2\\" at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California. An artist discussion panel, led by art critic John Seed, was conducted in connection to the exhibition which included Cretara speaking on the creation of his work and the state of contemporary figurative art. In 2015-16, his work was included in the thematic exhibition \\"Identity, Who Are We Now\\" at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Other notable artists included in the exhibition were Chuck Close, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Kiki Smith. =Public Collections= *Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Los Angeles *Art Institute of Boston *Boston Public Library *Duxbury Museum of Art, Massachusetts *Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, Thessaloniki, Greece *Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York *Minneapolis Institute of Art *Riverside Art Museum, California *Triton Museum of Art, Santa Clara, Ca. *University Art Museum, California State University-Long Beach *University of Delaware, Newark  Film  Domenic Cretara is the subject of a 1997 three- part documentary film titled Painting Circumstantial Evidence by Adam Shanker.

They are more often seen on hand-led pony rides A small child being hand-led on a pony, with two adults, one handling the pony, and the other watching the child A pony ride is an opportunity for children to ride real ponies for a short time, usually seen at fairs, guest ranches, zoos, summer camps, private children's parties and similar places. Children on pony rides do not handle the pony themselves, but they need to be old enough to sit up straight and hold their head up without support. Pony rides may be given on individually hand-led ponies, or in a group of ponies, usually four to six, placed on a \\"pony wheel,\\" a small type of hot walker that leads all ponies in a walk on a small circle so that fewer handlers are needed. Safety is a paramount concern and insurance companies consider pony rides to be a high-risk activity. There are concerns about the welfare of some ponies used for pony rides. Types of ponies Ponies for younger children generally are under , and often much smaller. A rule of thumb is that the legs of the child should reach at least halfway down the sides of the pony. The Shetland pony is a breed often used for pony rides. Best practices advise that ponies be at least years old. Stallions are not appropriate for pony rides, and when mares are used, they should not work while they are in heat. Children ages and sizes Recommendations vary with the size of the pony, but children who participate in pony rides need to be able to sit up and hold their head up without support, thus children under the age of one are too small to safely ride ponies. Best practices are that children be at least three years old, but some reputable programs accept children age two and up. Maximum size of riders usually correlates to the size of the pony, but standards range from under to about . Weight, not age, usually limits the biggest riders, but some programs require participants to be no older than 12. Safety Pony rides are considered a high risk equine activity. Pony ride operators are generally advised to carry liability insurance and to hire staff who are experienced with horses. Equestrian helmets are mandated by law for children in some places, and their use for all children is considered a best practice. Staff should have first aid certification and be covered by workers' compensation insurance. The safest method for in-hand pony rides is to have two people with each child, one on either side of the pony, similar to the methods used for therapeutic horseback riding. Trained staff should handle the pony, help the child get on and off the pony, and be sure equipment is properly adjusted. Most parents should not be asked to handle the pony, because parents usually lack horse experience and knowledge. That said, where a second person is used as a \\"spotter\\" to help balance the child, a parent can fill that role, so long as they are healthy enough to keep up with the pony and able to remain calm around the animal. A pony wheel eliminates the need for a separate person to lead each pony, but a parent or other spotter can still walk beside the animal to help steady the child. Other methods of controlling the pony with a child on board, such as ponying from another horse or riding double are generally considered unsafe. Modern standards state that children are never to be belted or strapped onto ponies. It was once common for children to be belted to the saddle by velcro or leather straps on pony wheel rides, though this was never considered a safe practice for in-hand pony rides. Safety studies conducted in 1999 led to recommendations that children not be belted onto ponies in any setting. Stirrups, when used, need to be adjusted to fit each child. =Enclosures= Pony rides need to be conducted in an enclosed area to help contain a pony that might escape and to give the pony a visual boundary. Low or flimsy fencing is not a best practice. Welded pipe panels are considered safe for portable fencing, such as at fairs. Settings with permanent pony rides that put up wooden fences need rails or planks to be placed on the inside of the fenceposts so that children do not hit their legs and feet on the posts. Training and equipment Ponies used for pony rides need to be quiet, well-trained, and desensitized to children, noise, and crowds. At fairs in particular, ponies are exposed to loud noises and traffic. Ponies are usually given western saddles for children's rides because they are less likely to slip and children can hang onto the saddle horn. Straps or loops should not be added to the saddle because children's hands can be caught in them. Saddles need to be properly fitted to the pony for its welfare and comfort. Stirrups, when used, should be wider than for regular riding to help prevent children's feet from getting caught, particularly because many children who take pony rides are wearing sneakers instead of boots. Tapaderos over the stirrups can help prevent a foot from going all the say through the stirrup and getting trapped, but only if properly designed so a child's foot doesn't get wedged between the tapadero and the front of the stirrup. To protect the pony's mouth, and because ponies are led rather than having the child control the pony directly, a halter or caveson is used, rather than a bit and bridle. Side reins are not advised for pony rides. On hand-led rides, leading with a dog obedience chain added around the nose as a lead shank for safety and extra control is recommended. Pony wheel rides are also sometimes called \\"carousel\\" rides. Pony wheels are often custom-manufactured. The largest pony wheels can accommodate up to 11 or 12 ponies, but most accommodate four to six. Hand-led rides can be held in an area about , which is large enough to move around, but confines the pony in case of problems. For hand-led rides, a mounting block or ramp can be used to help children get on and off the pony. Pony welfare and law The United States Department of Agriculture mandates that carnivals that exhibit animals, roadside zoos and many similar programs be licensed or registered to operate under the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, 7 U.S.C. ¬ß 2131 et seq., which protects animals not raised for food or fiber. The Act requires that animals have \\"adequate housing, sanitation, nutrition, water and veterinary care, and ... [protection] from extreme weather and temperatures.\\" There also has to be an adequate number of handlers. While horse and pony rides can sometimes be exempt, because equines are \\"farm animals\\" under 9 CFR ¬ß1.1, and exhibitors at fairs and horse shows do not fall within the regulatory definitions, if they are part of a petting zoo or carnival, they fall under the statute. Care for working ponies includes using fly spray in the summer and providing regular access to water. There should be good footing for the ponies, such as sand or shavings brought in to put on top of pavement, but a clay lot or grassy area can also be used. Children need basic instructions to not scream or poke at the animals. Providing instruction for children to sit up straight and how to hold their legs is a best practice. Some animal rights advocates oppose pony rides, suggesting that a merry-go-round is an acceptable substitute. The official position of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is \\"The ASPCA is opposed to the cruelty that is inherent in ... attractions such as elephant rides, camel rides, and llama and pony rides that either stand alone or are attached to [petting zoos].\\" Concerns of animal rights and animal welfare advocates generally concern ponies being subjected to harassment from the public, not getting enough water, and lack of rest. Sometimes there is also criticism that ponies are overfed and obese.

It asked voters if they wanted California to work towards overturning the Citizens United U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Background On January 21, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered its 5‚Äì4 decision on Citizens United v. FEC, ruling that freedom of speech prohibited the government from restricting independent political expenditures by a nonprofit corporation. The principles articulated by the Supreme Court in the case have also been extended to for-profit corporations, labor unions and other associations. This decision was criticized by a number of politicians, academics, attorneys and journalists because it basically allows unlimited election spending by corporations and thus members of 16 state legislatures (including California's) have called for a constitutional amendment to reverse the court.McCarter,Joan, \\"Oregon becomes 16th state to call for amendment overturning Citizens United\\", Daily Kos, July 2, 2013 For the California State Legislature's part, they originally put Proposition 49 on the 2014 California November general election ballot. It would have been a non-binding advisory question presented to voters, asking if the U.S. Congress should propose a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. However, the California Supreme Court ordered that the measure be pulled from the ballot pending further state constitutional review: at issue was that the state legislature had no defined specific power in either the state constitution or in any other state law to place such advisory measures on the ballot. The California Supreme Court then ruled in January 2016 that such an advisory question could indeed be placed on the ballot, and the California State Legislature subsequently placed Proposition 59 on the November ballot.

California previously used voter instructions in the Article V process in an 1892 proposition placed on the ballot by the Legislature in support of the 17th Amendment (Direct Election of Senators).

He was a Laboratory Fellow of Los Alamos National Laboratory. He wrote several books on numerical modeling of explosives, propellants, and water waves, and he authored or co-authored over 160 technical papers. Education and career Charles L. Mader was a Banning Scholar at Oklahoma City University (1948-1951) and earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees in chemistry from Oklahoma A&M; College (now known as Oklahoma State University‚ÄìStillwater) (1951-1954). His Master‚Äôs thesis was on quantitative measurements of the organic acids of sorghum syrup. During his graduate studies at University of Kansas (1954-1955), he was a 1954 Summer graduate student at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (subsequently known as Los Alamos National Laboratory) in New Mexico. He joined Los Alamos as a Staff Member in the Explosive Division (GMX) (1955-1966) and continued in the Theoretical Division (1966-1986). He obtained his Ph.D. from Pacific Western University, Encino, CA (1980). After retirement from Los Alamos, he has continued to research and publish. Mader‚Äôs expertise has been drawn upon by many, including the Beijing Institute of Technology; the Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (JIMAR) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa; the Center for Explosives Technology Research (CETR) at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology; the Department of Physics at University of New Mexico; the Department of Oceanography at the University of Hawaii; and the Department of Marine Science at Hawaii Pacific University. He is currently a Distinguished Scientist of the Energetics Research Institute (EnRI) at Nanyang Technology University, Singapore. Scientific contributions Mader‚Äôs research involved the study of the physical chemistry of detonations, explosives, and propellants through laboratory experiments, atmospheric and underground testing, and numerical modeling. He used the numerical models that he developed to predict results that were then experimentally verified. His models also were used to reproduce results derived from previously acquired experimental data. Mader and J. Zinn developed numerical solutions for nonlinear heat conduction equations that agreed with experimental data (1960). Using the Los Alamos IBM-7030 STRETCH computer and the Becker-Kistiakowsky- Wilson equations of state, he developed computer models for the detonation properties of explosives (1963). Using the Los Alamos PHERMEX (Pulsed High- Energy Radiographic Machine Emitting X-rays), he and colleagues extracted experimental data from flash radiographs of explosives and explosive-driven metal systems (1980), (1983). His book \\"Numerical Modeling of Detonations\\" (1979) surveys two decades of numerical modeling of the detonation process for condensed explosives and describes the numerical methods and the reactive dynamics of these materials. His book \\"Numerical Modeling of Explosives and Propellants\\" (2007) became a standard text on the chemistry and fluid dynamics of chemical explosive devices. Mader applied his expertise in fluid dynamics to research in the numerical modeling of tsunamis (1974) and other water waves. Using the full Navier-Stokes AMR (adaptive mesh refinement) Eulerian compressible hydrodynamic computer code called SAGE (SAIC Adaptive Grid Eulerian), software developed by SAIC and Los Alamos, he modeled landslide tsunami hazards, such as the 1958 Lituya Bay megatsunami (2002) and the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa (2006). His models are used to evaluate tsunami flooding and to determine which areas need to be evacuated. His book \\"Numerical Modeling of Water Waves\\" (2004) is a \\"comprehensive treatise of the evolving science of computer modeling of waves.\\" Personal life Mader was an accomplished mountaineer and downhill skier. He was the 65th person to have climbed (1959) all 54 Colorado peaks above 14,000 feet. He and his wife Emma Jean skied sixty years and after marking his 80th birthday, he skied 1.5 million vertical feet. He was devoted to the Boy Scouts of America, serving as Scoutmaster in Los Alamos (1972-1984) and mentoring 48 Scouts to earn their Eagle rank. He was a 3 Bead Woodbadger and was awarded the Silver Beaver (1984). He was a District Commissioner in the Aloha Council of the Boy Scouts.

The corps was initially stationed in the rear but was moved forward to Baranovichi to stop the German advance. On 26 June it fought in defensive battles around Baranovichi, Stowbtsy, and Minsk. Its positions were broken through by the German XLVII Army Corps (Motorized). The outnumbered 17th Mechanized Corps was unable to offer much resistance to the attack and its remnants retreated eastwards to the Berezina, where they linked up with other Soviet units. By 3 July it was still mostly fighting on the western bank of the Dnieper. It suffered heavy losses in the fighting and on 5 July was allocated to the 21st Army after being ordered to Babruysk on the previous day. On 7 July the corps' strength returns (lists of equipment) showed no armored vehicles. On 14 July the 16th Army was ordered to attack south towards Gorki alongside the 17th Mechanized Corps to destroy the German advance troops. The corps increased its resistance as it retreated, fighting against the German 10th Panzer Division as it advanced towards Pochinok on 16 July.

It was located in the valley of Vidriales in an area of the modern Santibanez de Vidriales and its hamlet Rosinos de Vidriales, in the province of Zamora (Castilla y Leon).http://www.viatorimperi.com/petavonium The legion was located here during the war against the Astures and Cantabrians to control the routes that connected this area with Gallaecia and with the rest of the valley of Douro and Lusitania, including those used for transportation of gold from the mines of Las M√©dulas o Cavenes. The archaeological evidence shows a camp of about 20 ha, many ceramic remains, coins, remains of weapons and other metal objects, and building materials stamped with the legion's motif. The departure of the legion in 63 AD must have been a setback for the town but it began to recover in the Flavian dynasty, probably under Domitian, when Ala II Flavia Hispanorum Civium Romanorum was stationed in the old barracks of X Gemina. The new fort, a castellum alae, was a rectangular walled enclosure of about 4 ha built inside the former camp. Around this camp emerged a vicus, or town, of about 80 ha. The legion's presence attracted large numbers of people, Hispanics and Italians, who created a dense network of rural settlements in the Vidriales valley and which became the future city of Petavonium. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD it became one of the largest cities in Asturian territory. Remains are preserved of the gates, especially the praetoria double gates, of the principia, or headquarters, and of the valetudinarium, or hospital. Also found were numerous coins of the 1st to 4th centuries, weapons, terra sigillata and ceramics, along with building materials such as bricks sealed with motifs of the Ala and Legio VII Gemina with which legion it had collaborated in Africa and in northern Portugal, near Aquae Flaviae (Chaves). In the later Empire, possibly from Diocletian, the resident unit became the Cohors II Flavia Pacatiana, still active at the end of the fourth century according to Notitia Dignitatum. The civil nucleus is mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary as a mansio on the road linking Asturica Augusta (Astorga) with Bracara Augusta (Braga). Numerous inscriptions are embedded in the houses and churches in nearby villages. The city was abandoned in the 5th century as a result of the barbarian invasions.

CBC's Lindsay Michael named Pilot to a 2016 list of five best recent podcasts, saying Foo has \\"created her own playground...A place where she can try things out and see how they go.\\" Foo served as the project lead on the development of an app from This American Life, launched in October 2016, called Shortcut. Produced in collaboration with developers Courtney Stanton and Darius Kazemi of Feel Train, Shortcut aims to allow listeners to share audio across social media sites as easily as they can share video clips via gifs. In the app, listeners can select an audio clip of up to 30 seconds and then post it directly to social media, where the audio plays alongside a transcription of the clip. At launch, the app operated on This American Life's archives, but the project was later released as open- source code, available for other audio projects to adopt. Writing at The New York Observer, Brady Dale called Foo's project \\"the number one innovation in podcasting\\" in 2016, saying, \\"If anything can ever make audio go viral, it‚Äôs a solution like this.\\" =Writing= Foo has also been noted for her commentary on diversity in media, especially for her 2015 essay, \\"What To Do If Your Workplace Is Too White.\\" Introducing the piece at Transom, Jay Allison said it \\"should be required reading for everyone involved in building our workforce or programming.\\" At Current, Adam Ragusea praised it as \\"frank and funny\\" and Neiman Lab's Nicholas Quah called the piece \\"fantastic\\" and Foo \\"a force of nature.\\" =Awards= Foo produced This American Life's 2015 video project, \\"Videos 4 U: I Love You,\\" which garnered three Daytime Emmy nominations: Best Special Class, Short Format Daytime Program; Best Writing Special Class; and Best Directing Special Class, with the project's director Bianca Giaever winning the latter category. The project also won the 2015 Webby Award for Online Film & Video in the Drama: Individual Short or Episode category. In 2016, Foo won a Knight Foundation grant from the Knight Prototype Fund to work on the This American Life project for sharing audio clips that became the Shortcut app. Foo was also a 2016 fellow at Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism to work on the same project.

During this match, Umehara made an unexpected comeback by parrying 15 consecutive hits of Wong's \\"Super Art\\" move while having only one pixel of vitality. Umehara subsequently won the match, though he went on to lose the Grand Final against Kenji \\"KO\\" Obata. Evo Moment #37 is frequently described as the most iconic moment in competitive video gaming, having influenced the fighting game community strongly. Background The Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike finals of Evo 2004 took place at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, California on August 1. Daigo \\"The Beast\\" Umehara and Justin Wong, two of the best Street Fighter players at the time, had never played against one another until that point. Despite this, the two were already known for having a supposed rivalry with each other due to their differences in gaming philosophies. Street Fighter was the only game to still be played on traditional arcade cabinets at this Evo, all other games being played on home consoles. Umehara and Wong met one another in the loser's finals of the tournament. Here, Umehara opted to play using Ken, while Wong picked Chun-Li. Moment In the final round of match 1, after each player had won a round, Umehara got off to a weak start as Wong was playing conservatively, slowly chipping away on Umehara's life bar. Rolling Stone described Wong's behavior during this match as \\"the antithesis of Umehara's aggressive approach\\" and stated that video of the match shows that Wong's turtling was effective in \\"getting under his [Umehara's] skin.\\" Match commentator and Capcom employee Seth Killian commentated that \\"this is rare footage of Daigo actually angry ... Justin's turtle-style now on the verge of putting Daigo down.\\" Umehara's Ken was down to his last pixel of vitality. With 26 seconds remaining, Wong had the option to run out the clock, but he was eager to end the match. At this point, any special attack would knock Umehara's character out if connected, since special attacks deal a slight amount of damage even when blocked. To win the round, Wong attempted to hit Umehara's Ken with Chun-Li's multihit Super Art II move; the Houyoku-sen (, \\"fanning phoenix-wing\\"). However, instead of avoiding it, Umehara chose to \\"Parry\\", a high-risk, high-reward technique which allows the defender to block an incoming attack without losing any health, but requires moving toward the opponent's direction in the same time a hit lands, within six of sixty frames of the impact animation ‚Äì about a tenth of a second. Umehara had to predict when his opponent would start his Super Art Move, essentially making the first parry before the move even started, and then perform the same split-second timing on all 14 of the remaining hits. Umehara did so, and went on to counter a final kick of Chun-Li in mid-air before launching a 12-hit combo, capped by Ken's Super Art III; Shippuu Jinraikyaku (, \\"hurricane thunderclap leg\\"), winning the match. GamePro and Eurogamer pointed out how the moment was elevated by the \\"euphoric\\" reaction of the crowd, which erupted in cheers and shouts as Umehara parried Wong's moves and turned around the game. Umehara went on to lose in the Grand Final to Kenji \\"KO\\" Obata, playing as Yun. Spread One of the tournament organizers and the primary ring announcer, Ben Cureton, was asked to create a highlight video of the \\"Daigo Parry\\" after the tournament was completed. Cureton uploaded the video under the title \\"Evo Moment #37\\", picking a random two-digit number to represent the highlight. In the book Evo Moment #37, Glenn Cravens wrote that: A previously unnoticed recording of the match was discovered by Evo business developer and Tekken brand and community advisor Mark \\"MarkMan\\" Julio in 2019, lying amid a stack of old tapes and discs. Recorded by Ace R., this video is filmed from a different viewpoint and includes distinct live reactions of the people in the crowd. MarkMan uploaded this video on YouTube in April 2019. Legacy Evo Moment #37 is frequently described as the most iconic and memorable moment in the history of competitive video gaming. Being at one point the most-watched competitive gaming moment of all time, Kotaku compared it to sports moments such as Babe Ruth's called shot and the Miracle on Ice. In an interview with John Guerrero of EventHubs, Justin Wong stated that he believed Evo Moment #37 may have helped \\"save\\" the fighting game community, which was getting less active at the time. Umehara gave a more in-depth account of the match in his 2016 autobiography, in which he explains how he briefly departed from the fighting game community afterwards. The downloadable online version of 3rd Strike, Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike Online Edition, features a challenge where players need to pull off the Daigo Parry. A parody of Evo Moment #37 was presented in the 2012 anime adaption of Acchi Kocchi. In 2014, Umehara and Wong held a rematch as a celebration of Evo Moment #37 ten years prior, in which Wong once again attempted to chip Umehara out with Chun-Li's special move. Umehara successfully parried Chun-Li's special move again, but Wong had enough vitality left to win the round a few seconds later. Glenn Cravens wrote a self-published book titled EVO Moment 37 that year as well. In a friendly match, British Street Fighter player Ryan Hart notably pulled off Daigo's parry while not looking at the TV screen.

This enabled him to retain Adolphe Goupil as his agent. To maximize his income, he chose to solicit clients from the upper classes, portraying their activities and possessions. He had a major showing at the exhibition at the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition, where he presented a series of watercolors. He returned to Barcelona in 1889, exhibiting at the Sala Par√©s. He pursued the same upper class client strategy there that he had in Paris. Occasionally, he travelled to exhibit in Madrid.

Career Hern√°ndez has a sixteen-year-long athletic career. When Hern√°ndez was nine years old, he visited the Mexican army's sports facilities where a group of kids were running and swimming. This moment helped Hern√°ndez realize that he wanted to become an Olympic athlete. He started competing internationally in 2009. Ismael Hern√°ndez competed in the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games, where he won an individual silver medal and a bronze medal as part of a team of other Mexican athletes in the modern pentathlon event. Just before the 2012 London Olympic Games started, he fractured his arm while he was riding his horse. This injury set aside the Mexican's opportunity to compete in the Olympic Games of that year. On the 2012-2016 Olympic cycle, Hernandez had great performances. In 2014 along with his teammate Tamara Vega they won the 2nd World Cup Mixed Relays event in front of Ireland and Hungary.

Hern√°ndez qualified for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro by participating in the 2015 Toronto Pan American Games, where he won a silver medal. He trained in two different locations, Europe and the United States of America. During this training process, he suffered an injury, which threatened with his participation in the summer event.

By the end of the Olympic Games, Ismael Hern√°ndez earned the fifth medal for the Mexican Olympic Team in Rio 2016 and the first medal for Mexico in the modern pentathlon. The first event was not the best one for Hern√°ndez after finishing in 19th place. But after the swimming event was finished, Ismael climbed to 11th place. Thanks to the show jumping event he moved to 6th place. In the final event, which consisted on a three kilometer run and several shooting stations, Hern√°ndez obtained 626 points.

Biography She was born to Count Kristian Ditlev Reventlow (1710-75) and Johanne Sofie Frederikke Bothmer (1718-54). In 1761, she married the courtier nobleman Kristian Frederik von Gramm who died in 1768. The social position of her first spouse made her a participator in Danish Royal Court life. She was one of the few people Queen Caroline Matilda befriended prior to the banishment of her favorite Louise von Plessen. Reportedly, Gramm acted as a form of channel between the queen in her isolation with Louise von Plessen, and the other female courtiers: she informed the queen what the women of the court said about her, and then informed the women of the court what the queen said about them, which for a time gave her an influential position until her method was discovered.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. For a time, she and her spouse were regarded as important people because of her favor with the queen. In 1768, she became a widow and retired for a year of mourning. When she returned, she lost her favor with the queen because of her dislike of the queen's circle of friends, Elisabet von Eyben, Anna Sofie B√ºlow, Johanne Marie Malleville and Christine Sophie von G√§hler, whom she considered immoral, and because of her refusal to participate in the queen's attempt to have the king's favorite Conrad Holck (1745-1800) exiled. She retired from court life in 1771. In 1776, she remarried Count Cristian G√ºnther Stolberg (1748-1821). In 1777, Stolberg later became county governor of Tremsb√ºttel in Holstein. Her preserved correspondence is regarded as a valuable historic source about the courtiers of the Danish royal court of her time.

It was formed as a result of the September 2016 merger of Dell and EMC Corporation (which later became Dell EMC). Dell's products include personal computers, servers, smartphones, televisions, computer software, computer security and network security, as well as information security services. Dell ranked 35th on the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Current operations Approximately 50% of the company's revenue is derived in the United States. Dell operates under 2 divisions as follows: * Dell Client Solutions Group (48% of fiscal 2019 revenues) ‚Äì produces desktop PCs, notebooks, tablets, and peripherals, such as monitors, printers, and projectors under the Dell brand name * Dell EMC Infrastructure Solutions Group (41% of fiscal 2019 revenues) ‚Äì storage solutions Dell also owns separate businesses, such as VMware (80%), Pivotal Software, Secureworks, Virtustream, and Dell Boomi. History Dell‚ÄìEMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016 On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire EMC Corporation, an enterprise software and storage company, in a $67 billion transaction. It was labeled the \\"highest-valued tech acquisition in history\\". In addition to Michael Dell, Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners were major Dell shareholders that supported the transaction. On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the merger with EMC Corp., which involved the issuance of $45.9 billion in debt and $4.4 billion common stock. The Dell Services, Dell Software Group, and the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Divisions were sold shortly thereafter for proceeds of $7.0 billion, which was used to repay debt. In October 2017, It was reported that Dell would invest $1 billion in IoT research and development. Dell Inc. had returned to private ownership in 2013, claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business. EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management Corporation, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize the unusual \\"Federation\\" structure, in which EMC's divisions were effectively being run as independent companies. Elliott argued this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core \\"EMC II\\" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. The Wall Street Journal estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3 billion from personal computers and $8.9 billion from servers, while EMC had $16.5 billion from EMC II, $1bn from RSA Security, $6bn from VMware, and $230 million from Pivotal Software. EMC owned around 80% of the stock of VMware. The acquisition maintained VMware as a separate company, held via a new tracking stock, while the rest of EMC were rolled into Dell. The acquisition required Dell to publish quarterly financial results, having ceased these on going private in 2013. Dell Technologies has products and services in the field of scale-out architecture, converged infrastructure and private cloud computing. =IPO= On January 29, 2018, it was reported that Dell Technologies was considering a reverse merger with its VMware subsidiary to take the company public. On December 28, 2018, Dell Technologies became a public company, bypassing the traditional IPO process by buying back shares that tracked the financial performance of VMware.

A church fan is a term used mainly in the United States for a hand fan used within a Christian church building to cool oneself off. The fan typically has a wooden handle and a fan blade made of hard stock paper (i.e. card-stock, 2-ply), often with a staple adjoining the two materials.  History  Modern air-conditioning became widely available in America during the 1950s. However, many churches (primarily African-American congregations) were unable to afford the cooling machines for their church buildings. In addition to their function of cooling the body, the paper blade of the fans were used for printed illustrations and community advertisements. Historically, funeral homes often acquired the space on the back of the fans to advertise their services to the churches members, in addition to other local businesses and services. Illustrations on the front blade of the fans are varied in subject matter, from illustrations of Jesus Christ to notable people within the respective churches‚Äô communities.  Contemporary use  With the spread of modern air-conditioning units within church buildings, church fans have become less popular. However, many churches still supply hand fans for their members.

She attracted attention with her beauty and love life: at this point, women at the Danish court could have official lovers, called amants d√©clar√©s, and hers were in succession minister Konrad Aleksander Fabritius, the royal equerry Frederik Karl von Warnstedt, who left her for Johanne Marie Malleville, and finally courtier Hans Heinrich Friccius von Schilden-Huitfeldt.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. Luise Gramm claimed that she scandalously met von Warnstedt in 1770, a room close by another in which the body of the queen dowager was lying in state. She accompanied the royal couple on their tour of the Duchies in 1770. During this trip, the king's former favorite Enevold Brandt was recalled to court, and the king's then favorite Conrad Holck was sent back to Copenhagen.

Reception The first season of the show received a mixed reception from critics upon its premiere. In a positive review, Flavorwire's Lara Zarum described the show as a \\"a sweetly raunchy fable about finding your voice.\\" She also praised the series for addressing \\"race and gender with a light but sharp touch.\\" In a more negative review, Mitchel Broussard of WeGotThisCovered.com gave the series two-and-a- half stars out of five and commented that, \\"Although it has the noblest of inclusive intentions, Loosely Exactly Nicole ultimately falls flat because it doesn't present its progressive ideas in intriguing ways and - most problematic - it just isn't very funny.\\" Common Sense Media's Melissa Camacho criticized the show when saying, \\"Nicole Byer's comic abilities are evident, but the show's writing is more silly than smart. As a result, it contains scenes (such as one that presents an Asian child in blackface) that cross the line from being politically charged to just being dim and offensive.

Dumitru's uncle was Alexandru \\"Alecu\\" Moruzi, who briefly led the Moldavian government, while his stepsister Natalia Ke»ôco-Moruzi was for a while queen of Serbia. Dumitru was also the maternal uncle of historian Gheorghe I. BrƒÉtianu. A French-trained man of letters, Moruzi held office with the Russian military bureaucracy during the Turkish War of 1877. Against his father's Russophilia, he opted for Romanian nationalism and, in the process, lost his family estates in Bessarabia. He emigrated to the newly formed Kingdom of Romania and took up Romanian nationality in the 1880s. He then helped administer Northern Dobruja‚Äîplaying an important part in the modernization of Sulina, and also in the ethnic colonization of the region. It was also in Sulina that Moruzi contacted illnesses which eventually left him deaf and bedridden. Financially destitute, he tried to earn his living as an opera composer, before becoming a journalist. Moruzi began writing analyses of Tsarist autocracy during the Russian Revolution of 1905, when he asserted that the multinational empire would crumble along ethnic lines. These serialized essays slowly earned the attention and enthusiasm of more prominent nationalists, including historian Nicolae Iorga. The latter brought Moruzi into contact with his SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist circle, hosting his memoirs and articles in Neamul Rom√¢nesc and Unirea, and welcoming him into the ranks of the Democratic Nationalist Party. Moruzi's main literary contributions are social novels, fictionalizing his family history and, overall, the shared destiny of Bessarabian elites. Such works blend a message of nationalism and conservatism, which veers into antisemitism and anti-Masonry, with the classical tradition of storytelling. They were circulated among Romanian intellectuals on both sides of the border and earned critical accolades, but failed to make a significant impact in culture. Posthumously censored in both Communist Romania and the Soviet Union, Moruzi was recovered after 1993, being recognized as an early contributor to both Romanian and Moldovan literature. Biography =Origins and childhood= Dumitru Moruzi belonged to the Mourousis family, which formed part of a wave of Greek immigrants to Moldavia; integrated by the local aristocracy, or boyardom, they had originated in the Empire of Trebizond and settled in Istanbul in the 17th century.

KogƒÉlniceanu, p. 1134; Penelea Filitti, pp. 60, 62 Constantine's first-born son Alexander also rose to that position, and briefly took the princely throne of Wallachia.

Bucharest: Editura Meridiane, 1984. Alexander's brother was the Beizadea Dimitrie, who served as Dragoman of the Ottoman Empire, and helped draft the Bucharest treaty of 1812. Through it, Moldavia ceded Bessarabia to the Russian Empire‚Äîan episode which seemingly pointed to Dimitrie's divided loyalties.LƒÉzƒÉrescu, p. 50Constan»õa VintilƒÉ-Ghi»õulescu, \\"Un jurnal »ôi o cƒÉlƒÉtorie la Istanbul.

His failure to protect Ottoman interests resulted in his hanging by the Janissaries of Shumla. In 1820, the office of Dragoman was held by his nephew Constantine, similarly executed for failing to denounce his friends in the Filiki Eteria.LƒÉzƒÉrescu, p. 51 The family had to flee Ottoman territory, including the Danubian Principalities, after several of its members fought in the Greek War of Independence. They became Russian nationals, but managed to preserve their Moldavian estates by subterfuge‚Äîformally passing them to a branch of the Rosetti family.M. KogƒÉlniceanu, p. 1134 A claim to the Moldavian inheritance was stated by one of Dumitru's paternal uncles, Alexandru \\"Alecu\\" Moruzi (ca. 1815‚Äì1878), who married a daughter of Hatman RƒÉducanu Ruset (Rosetti). Historian and polemicist Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu argued that, by 1861, the family was still entirely Greek, their Rosetti connection being a \\"weak foundation\\" for their claims to Moldavian roots. Also according to KogƒÉlniceanu, in the 1830s the Moruzis had Russian passports, with Alecu asking to be addressed by a non-Moldavian title, as Knyaz Moruzi. Dumitru's father, Constantin Moruzi (1816‚Äì1886), or Costache Moruz Pecheanu,Moruzi (1909), p. 520 was an officer of the Hellenic Navy. He had a son by his first wife, Pulheria Cantacuzino: Russian diplomat Alexandru C. Moruzi (1842‚Äì1900).Bezviconi, Boierimea..., p. 137; Co»ôa, pp. 405‚Äì406 Constantin had inherited estates in both Moldavia and Wallachia, including FƒÉurei, Vrancea County. Attracted to liberal ideas, he had reportedly tried to manumit his Romani slaves, but was forced to rescind when they rebelled.Moruzi (1909), pp. 521‚Äì526 Later, the Moruzi brothers participated in the Moldavian Revolution of 1848: Alecu was swiftly arrested and deported into Danube Vilayet; Constantin became an outlaw and was widely suspected of collecting a private army, before being captured and expelled to Russia.Iorga (1938), pp. 125‚Äì127, 372 A colorful character, he once appeared in Spanish costume on the balcony of an Odessa hotel, proclaiming himself the last descendant of Trebizond's emperors. He declared that a man as handsome as he only appeared once a century.Penelea Filitti, p. 62 eagle of Russia and the Moldavian aurochs Returning home in the 1850s, Constantin married a second time, to Ecaterina Sturza. This granddaughter of Prince Ioan Sturdza was reportedly very ugly but also highly intelligent and energetic; she was Dumitru's mother. Born in Ia»ôi,Corbu, p. 75 Dumitru spent his first four years at FƒÉurei, which he later declared to be his favorite place in the world.Moruzi (1909), p. 521 During that interval, his father became rivals with Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 241, 246; Penelea Filitti, p. 62 Still holding Russian citizenship, he may have acted as a Russian agent of influence in Moldavia.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., p. 241; Corbu, p. 75; Iorga (1938), pp. 259‚Äì260; Xenopol, pp. 483, 487; Zavadschi, p. 10 In 1854, at the height of the Crimean War, Constantin and his family crossed from Moldavia-proper into Bessarabia (by then a Russian governorate). This was done upon orders from the Austrian occupation authorities, RƒÉzvan Voncu, \\"Un sƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist basarabean\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 38/2015 on a request from the Ottoman army,Corbu, p. 75; Iorga (1938), pp. 259‚Äì260; Zavadschi, p. 10 or, alternatively, from Prince Ghica himself.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 241‚Äì242, 246, 250 In the 1860s, Constantin was directly involved in Russian censorship of Moldavian liberal newspapers and magazines.Maria Danilov, Presa »ôi cenzura √Æn Basarabia. Documentar (Secolul al XIX-lea ‚Äì √Ænceputul secolului al XX-lea), pp. 67‚Äì69. Chi»ôinƒÉu: Pontos, 2012. In March 1857, following the death of Caimacam Teodor Bal»ô, Alecu Moruzi was credited with real chances of succeeding him as Prince, but the regency was prolonged, and went to Nicolae Vogoride.Iorga (1938), pp. 229‚Äì300 According to KogƒÉlniceanu, Alecu was an absentee landlord and an apolitical figure throughout most of the decade, before finally taking a seat in the 1858 Assembly;M. KogƒÉlniceanu, pp. 1134‚Äì1135 other accounts suggest that he had rallied with the National Party, before becoming a civilian administrator of Gala»õi. The other Moruzis returned to during the same period, while Moldavia was merging with Wallachia into the United Principalities‚Äîhowever, they still commuted to Bessarabia, where they now owned the estate of DƒÉnu»õeni. Like his brother, Constantin supported the National Party, becoming friends with its candidate for princely office, Alexandru Ioan Cuza.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., p. 242; Corbu, pp. 75‚Äì76, 80‚Äì84; Co»ôa, p. 405 =Exile and return= Knyaz Alecu, meanwhile, briefly headed Moldavian government and preserved his seat in the Assembly‚Äîthough his eligibility, including his citizenship, were openly questioned by KogƒÉlniceanu.M. KogƒÉlniceanu, passim The latter eventually engineered the cabinet's downfall.Iorga (1938), p. 372 Alecu then served on the first unified government of Romania as Minister of Finance, but resigned after only a few days.Demetriescu, p. 271 He joined other boyars in resisting Cuza and KogƒÉlniceanu's land reform project, favoring a more conservative proposal also advanced in Parliament by Dimitrie Ghica and Apostol Arsache.Demetriescu, p. 341; Iorga (1938), pp. 369‚Äì370 Alecu mounted the boyars' last stand, to the point of asking for mediation by Austria.Alexandru Lapedatu, \\"Austria »ôi reforma agrarƒÉ din 1864\\", in Memoriile Sec»õiunii Istorice, Vol. XXIX, 1946‚Äì1947, p. 306 He had four children who married into Russian and European aristocracy,Bezviconi, Boierimea..., pp. 137‚Äì138 including Maria, who wed Cuza's son, the pretender Alexandru \\"Sa»ôa\\" Cuza. She was later married for just one day with the Romanian politico Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, birthing his son, the historian Gheorghe I. BrƒÉtianu.Co»ôa, pp. 410‚Äì411 Cuza and the Moruzis disagreed on agrarian issues, but remained close on other points of policy. Alecu signed his name to various acts strengthening the Moldo‚ÄìWallachian union,Iorga (1938), pp. 367‚Äì368 and, a strong proponent of free trade, served on the board of Romania Bank.Gheorghe Zane, \\"Politica economicƒÉ a Principatelor √Æn epoca Unirii »ôi capitalul strƒÉin\\", in Studii. RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Vol. XII, Issue 1, 1959, pp. 234, 243, 258 In early 1866, he was tipped to succeed Nicolae Cre»õulescu as Prime Minister of Romania, in what was supposed to be a \\"Russophile\\" cabinet.Eug√®ne Lamy, \\"Prin»õul Cuza nu mai domne»ôte √Æn Rom√¢nia...\\", in Magazin Istoric, February 1996, p. 6. See also Iorga (1938), pp. 396‚Äì397 This plan crumbled the same year, with the rise of an anti-Cuza \\"monstrous coalition\\", which deposed the Domnitor. Later that year, the Moruzis switched their allegiance to Moldavian separatism. Most controversially, both brothers instigated, with Calinic Miclescu, the Moldavian separatist riots.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., p. 242; Co»ôa, p. 405; Penelea Filitti, p. 62; Xenopol, pp. 483‚Äì488 Unwelcome in Romania, from 1869 Constantin was recognized as a Knyaz and received into Russian nobility,Bezviconi, Boierimea..., p. 137 serving terms as deputy in the Zemstvo of BƒÉl»õi County, where he supported Bessarabian autonomism.Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 260‚Äì262, 359 The Bessarabian Moruzis sponsored literary gatherings, musical parties, and charities, and, in the 1870s, played host to the novelist Olga Nacu.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 147, 205 Dumitru spent the remainder of his childhood in Kishinev (Chi»ôinƒÉu) and on his father's estates of CosƒÉu»õi and CiripcƒÉu, both in the vicinity of Soroca. His mother taught him elementary notions of mathematics, literature and French grammar, awakening an appreciation for Moli√®re, Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine. He learned Russian followed by French, with his formal education beginning at Ia»ôi. As a youth, he traveled and got to know major cities of the Empire, including Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and Kiev.Corbu, p. 76 He was charmed by Odessa, where he arrived upon the invitation of his aunt, Profiri»õa Moruzi-Ke»ôco. Some of his first literary attempts are verses written in honor of that city.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 251‚Äì253 Profiri»õa died soon after, leaving her daughter Natalia Ke»ôco to be raised by Constantin and Ecaterina, as Dumitru and Alexandru's stepsister.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 256‚Äì258 In 1863, Moruzi was sent to the Lyc√©e Saint-Louis in Paris. He probably attended a military academyCarp, p. 5 or the Sorbonne afterwards, returning to Bessarabia in 1869 as a Francophile.Corbu, p. 76; Zavadschi, p. 10 In 1873, encouraged by his father, he entered service with the marshal of nobility for the Soroca district. In 1875, he and his family became in-laws of the Obrenoviƒá dynasty which ruled upon the Principality of Serbia: through Constantin Moruzi's intercession, Natalia married Milan I, from 1882 the King of Serbia.Penelea Filitti, p. 62. See also Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 257‚Äì258 At the time, his uncle Alecu was serving in the Romanian Assembly of Deputies, where he sided, albeit conditionally, with the conservative majority.\\"Bucuresci, 22 Iuni≈≠ 1875\\", in Alegƒïtorul Liber, Issue 57/1875, p. 1 From 1877, Dumitru became an interpreter for the diplomatic service of the Russian Empire. In this capacity, he accompanied Russian troops onto various battlefields in Rumelia during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 242‚Äì243; Penelea Filitti, p. 62 In early 1878, he had moved to K√∂stence, in Russian-occupied Northern Dobruja. He was then sent to undertake diplomatic work in the Romanian capital Bucharest. There, in April 1878, he entered a joint commission for analyzing protests by Romanian civilians against Russian troops transiting the country, sitting for over a year until the group was dissolved. In December, Domnitor Carol I awarded him the Order of the Star of Romania.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 242‚Äì243 In addition, he received the Order of the Cross of Takovo from Milan I and the Order of Saint Alexander from Alexander I of Bulgaria. Moruzi alienated his parents when he refused to become a diplomat like his half-brother, turning to Romanian nationalism and campaigning for Bessarabia's incorporation into the new Kingdom of Romania. He also married, against Constantin's will,Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 243, 250 to a French governess he met in Bessarabia. She gave birth to a son. The three left Russia for good and settled in Bucharest, obtaining Romanian citizenship in 1882 or 1883.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., p. 243; Moruzi (1914), p. 2 By then, Alexander II of Russia had ordered him stripped of his Russian citizenship and, technically, of his right to inherit. =Sulina and literary debut= Sulina in 1877 (Le Monde Illustr√© engraving) Moruzi, who bragged about having thus \\"spurned a fortune worth more than two million\\",Scurtu, p. 74 was soon after named administrator of Constan»õa County, returning to what was by then Romanian Northern Dobruja. He helped build roads, schools and churches, also organizing a notary service and naming Romanian mayors. According to his own statement, he also helped with the Romanianization of \\"assimilable\\" Greeks and Bulgarians, and unofficially colonized the area with Wallachians. This work was covered in 1886 by the daily Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, which called him a \\"good administrator\\",\\"Coresponden»õa Romaniei Libere\\", in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, May 10/22, 1886, p. 2 but, as Moruzi complained, it was eventually overturned by his successor Vasile KogƒÉlniceanu. In June 1887,\\"Parte oficialƒÉ. Ministerul de interne\\", in Monitorul Oficial, Nr. 57/1887, p. 1353 he was named administrator and deputy prefect at the Port of Sulina, in the Danube Delta, taking anti-flood measures and organizing a volunteer fire brigade on the Austrian model. He devoted special attention to a high school for musicians, helped build a theater and repair the local church, while also taking steps to \\"assimilate all who are assimilable.\\" Constantin Moruzi died at Odessa while playing cards, and was buried at DƒÉnu»õeni, while Ecaterina is buried in Sulina. By 1895, Dumitru's work was threatened by the intrigues of a National Liberal Party politico, Eugeniu StƒÉtescu, who wanted him demoted.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., p. 243 When a change in government portended a demotion and transfer to MƒÉcin, Dumitru resigned from the civil service. A difficult period followed, particularly as he had spent much of the 250,000 gold lei left by his mother. In 1897, when he was living on Zimbrului Street in Gala»õi, he sued one of the local pawn brokers, claiming that he had been cheated out of 40,956 lei.\\"Ultime informa»õiunƒ≠. Din Gala»õƒ≠. IarƒÉ»ôƒ≠ cƒÉmƒÉtarul Urban\\", in Epoca, July 18, 1897, p. 3 Moruzi had by then married and divorced Teresa z Gi≈ºyckich (or Gizyka), who wrote a biography of Moruzi where she describes his affair with another woman. She eventually joined the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth in Wadowice.Danuta Kozie≈Ç, \\"Nazaretanki w Wadowicach\\", in Wadoviana. PrzeglƒÖd Historyczno-kulturalny, Nr. 15, 2012, p. 8 Moruzi himself withdrew to a one-room, unfurnished, apartment on Dealul Spirii,Iorga (1935), p. 132 trying his hand at becoming a composer. Moruzi's comic opera in three acts, Pescarii din Sulina (\\"Fishermen of Sulina\\"), was performed at the National Theater Bucharest in February 1902. By 1903, his last hope of being hired lay in Natalia's son, King Alexander of Serbia, but the latter was assassinated that year. Natalia bought him a house in the TƒÉtƒÉra»ôi quarter of Ia»ôi, located just outside Eternitatea cemetery.Iorga (1935), p. 131 At that point, he was obliged to earn a living by writing, a practice he took up not just out of obligation, but also out of a sense of duty to keep alive a vanished world.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 244‚Äì245, 248‚Äì249 According to the journalist Corneliu Carp, although an \\"infirm\\", his early years in TƒÉtƒÉra»ôi, \\"one of [Ia»ôi's] more pleasant\\" suburbs, were serene and \\"almost monastic\\". Yet, \\"nobody knows the goings-on of his life, not even his well-off relatives with their rightful princely splendor; only now and then do young students visit him, keen on learning from his sweet elderly voice the stories of his parents' Bessarabia.\\" As Moruzi aged, diseases that appeared during his Delta days worsened, and he gradually lost hearing, being also beset by money troubles. He began an intense work in journalism with Basarabia »ôi viitorul ei 1812‚Äì1905 (\\"Bessarabia and Her Future 1812‚Äì1905\\"), first published in Cronica newspaper from February 1905, and in book form later that year. Victor Durnea, \\"C. Stere »ôi ac»õiunea sa √Æn Basarabia anului 1906 (I)\\", in Cultura, Nr. 361, February 2012 Prompted by the Russian Revolution of January, Moruzi speculated that Russia would crumble, leading to the emancipation of Poland-Lithuania or to an independent \\"Little Russia\\", but stated that \\"it is certainly not my intention to promote Romanian irredentism\\". Nonetheless, he urged Bessarabian Romanians to take up \\"productive labor\\" and \\"rekindle the Bessarabian genius\\".Constantin et al. (2011), p. 77; Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 171, 210‚Äì211, 610 He also castigated the Romanian state for not having distributed propaganda in the region, noting that Bessarabia and Romania were separated by a \\"great wall\\". This text was followed the same year by a series of articles titled Ru»ôii (\\"Russians\\"). The collection Ru»ôii »ôi rom√¢nii (\\"Russians and Romanians\\", 1906) was prefaced by the influential historian Nicolae Iorga,Scurtu, p. 73 and circulated clandestinely among Bessarabian intellectuals.Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 210‚Äì211; Dinu Po»ôtarencu, Maria Po»ôtarencu, \\"Infiltrarea publica»õiilor rom√¢ne»ôti √Æn Basarabia din dreapta Prutului sub domina»õia »õaristƒÉ\\", in BiblioScientia, Nr. 7‚Äì8/2012, pp. 30‚Äì31 =The \\"sociological\\" novelist= Iorga, who expressed fascination for Moruzi's \\"sharp intelligence\\",Corbu, p. 87; Iorga (1934), p. 80 maintained his association with the Bessarabian into the next decade. On Iorga's encouragement, Moruzi began writing memoirs and literary fragments for the newspaper Unirea, and for its literary supplement.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 244‚Äì245, 248 According to the writer's own account, Iorga's patronage made his Moruzi relatives aware that he was not \\"a nincompoop and an embarrassment\\", and prompted them to provide him with a pension.Scurtu, pp. 73‚Äì74 He joined Iorga's Democratic Nationalist Party (PND) upon its creation in 1910, but refused to read the statutes, simply believing them consonant with his own brand of nationalism. He remained critical of anti-elitist factions within the PND; seen by historian Florin Marinescu as a \\"staunch antisemite\\", Moruzi declared that \\"the job of playing off classes against each other should be left to kikes and socialists\\". He also proposed the creation of a \\"Christian Masonry\\" to counter the influence of actual Freemasons. Published by the literary press of the PND's Neamul Rom√¢nesc,Carp, p. 5; Scurtu, p. 75 Moruzi's main works are √énstrƒÉina»õii. Studiu social √Æn formƒÉ de roman (\\"Alienated People. A Social Study in the Shape of a Novel\\", 1910) and Pribegi √Æn »õarƒÉ rƒÉpitƒÉ. Roman social basarabean (\\"Outcasts in the Stolen Land. A Bessarabian Social Novel\\", 1912). As Moruzi himself explained, the writings were not to be read as novels, but as documents; to his supporters, he was a \\"thinker and sociologist\\".Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 245, 246 Iorga himself recommended Moruzi, alongside Henri Stahl, Romulus Cioflec and Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu, as a canon of traditionalist writing in prose at Neamul Rom√¢nesc.Iorga (1934), p. 209 As noted in 2015 by critic RƒÉzvan Voncu, such standards make Moruzi a latecomer to Iorga's SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist movement. Nevertheless, Moruzi complained privately that Neamul Rom√¢nesc was censoring his calls for class collaboration, and also his outbursts against the socialists at Facla.Scurtu, pp. 74‚Äì75 The protagonists of √énstrƒÉina»õii are his father Constantin, appearing as boyar Agapie Varlaam, and Dimitrie himself‚Äîhere named Artur. The story covers the events of 1848 and 1854, but is mainly noted for its glimpses of high-society life in Bessarabia and Moldavia at large.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 247‚Äì249; Corbu, pp. 76‚Äì79 In its opening manifesto, the book described the dangers of Russification and Francization, particularly among the upper classes‚Äîthe peasants, Moruzi noted, were still Romanian in language and customs, whereas Bessarabian boyars are shown disregarding their mother tongues for prestige languages.Corbu, pp. 79, 85‚Äì86. See also Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 148, 247 Other parts of the book, showing debates between the Varlaams and Prince Ghica or Alexandru Ioan Cuza, take a more conservative stance, insisting upon class collaboration; the narrator praises Carol and LascƒÉr Catargiu for having found and preserved a moderate course.Corbu, pp. 80‚Äì84 Pribegi √Æn »õarƒÉ rƒÉpitƒÉ was written with noted documentary contributions by Ion Pelivan, the Bessarabian activist.Constantin et al. (2011), pp. 76‚Äì77 It is, in part, an answer to Pavel Krushevan's own novel, Millions, and a homage to Bessarabia on the centennial of her incorporation into Russia.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., p. 249 The Moruzis, including Dumitru's brother Alexandru, appear as the Mavrocosta clan, and the novel delves into their political convictions and intimate affairs. The book also fictionalizes events relating to the Ke»ôcos and to Bessarabian anarchist Zamfir Arbore;Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 250‚Äì252 Constantin Moruzi appears both as himself and as the Mavrocosta patriarch (the two are brothers-in-law).Zavadschi, pp. 9‚Äì10, 15 Here, Russification is depicted in more serious tones, having led to the wholesale import of customs and created new pidgin dialects. Mavrocosta finds himself torn between his loyalty to Russia and his Moldavian patriotism.Zavadschi, pp. 11‚Äì13, 17‚Äì18 The author's conservatism is again on display, targeting revolutionary ideologies. For instance, Moruzi praises the rationality and ethos of social democracy, opposing them to Russian nihilism. In addition to Iorga, Moruzi's writings also drew notice from A. D. Xenopol and Gheorghe Carda»ô, who welcomed his affection for Bessarabia and its past, as well as for nature. Radu Rosetti, Iorga's rival at Via»õa Rom√ÆneascƒÉ, also acknowledged Moruzi as a \\"writer of talent\\", his technique \\"clear and beautiful\\".Rosetti, p. 385 According to Eugen Lovinescu, Moruzi and Rosetti alike were in a line of great Moldavian raconteurs, alongside Gheorghe Sion.Lovinescu, p. 202 Critic Mariana Conta-Kernbach praises Moruzi's \\"flowing and somber style\\", listing him as one of the neo-classicists in succession to his father's revolutionary-and-optimistic generation.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 243‚Äì244 George CƒÉlinescu only wrote a brief note about him, setting down an incorrect birth year; Petre V. Hane»ô, in his 1942 study of Bessarabian writers, devotes much more ample space to analyzing the works of Moruzi.Corbu, pp. 75, 87‚Äì89 Other commentators note that his novels in particular have a certain Russian influence, probably from the author's reading of Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy. Ideology seeps into Pribegi √Æn »õarƒÉ rƒÉpitƒÉ and, prompting literary historian Gheorghe Bezviconi to suggest that its \\"useless, entirely valueless, dialogues\\" be stripped from future editions. According to Bezviconi, the more descriptive parts are \\"exquisite\\".Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 249‚Äì251 Contrarily, Lovinescu assess that, in Moruzi's work, fiction was \\"kept to a minimum, and it is actually the only aspect that annoys the reader.\\"Lovinescu, p. 201 Voncu also argues that \\"although not a great literary talent, [Moruzi] was a cultural and political consciousness.\\" =Final years= Moruzi's other writings covered various genres, including samples of SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist poetry. A three-act comedy, its title unknown, was published in 1911, around the same time as a satirical novella, Pe viscol (\\"During Blizzard\\"). The latter showed the prevarications of a boyar who switches from liberalism to conservatism at his own convenience.Dragnea, p. 3 A \\"moral study\\" with a prologue and three acts, SƒÉrutarea lui Iuda sau Iuda √Æn casƒÉ de boier, Iuda la sat, Iuda √Æn CapitalƒÉ »ôi Iuda parvenit (\\"Judas' Kiss or Judas in a Boyar Dwelling, Judas in the Villages, Judas in the Capital and Judas as Parvenu\\") appeared in 1912. The same year he published a book called Basarabia noastrƒÉ and a collection of folk songs, C√¢ntece basarabene. He was also involved in a dialogue with Russian historian Nikolai Nikolayevich Durnovo, father of the linguist. Durnovo had written favorably of Romanian nationalism, trying to obtain Romania's support for a looming war between Russia and the Triple Alliance; he was also proposing the partition of Bessarabia and Bukovina between the two allied nations. Victor Durnea, \\"N.N. Durnovo, 'un rus cu minte' sau un ipocrit 'ademenitor'? (I)\\", in Convorbiri Literare, October 2014 Moruzi, who believed that Durnovo spoke for the Russian Government, welcomed the change of policy. He acknowledged that a liberal Russia was a comfortable ally for Romania, but asked for guarantees that Russian imperialism would be curbed. He also accused Durnovo of hypocrisy, noting that Bessarabia was not traditionally Russian, but had been colonized with \\"Khokhols\\". He therefore rejected partition on principle. As Iorga recalled, both of Moruzi's novels were accomplished and \\"vibrated youthful, brave, nationalism\\", but were also \\"hardly ever picked up and read\\". According to critic Radu Dragnea, Moruzi did not fit the stylistic mold of the 1910s, \\"as if there is no literature out there for him to acknowledge\\";Dragnea, p. 2 also, according to Carp, the Knyaz detested the work of Romanian Symbolists, showing in this similarities with traditionalists such as Ion Gorun, George Panu, and Mihail Sadoveanu.Carp, pp. 5‚Äì6 Dragnea therefore concluded that Moruzi \\"does not write for us, his contemporaries, who aren't satisfied with anything [...]. His entire work will stand as a precious document in days to come\\".Dragnea, pp. 2‚Äì3 While repeatedly refusing to write an actual autobiography,Bezviconi, Profiluri..., p. 246 Moruzi had begun work on Moartea lui Cain (\\"Death of Cain\\"), which was only published posthumously. In some ways a sequel to √énstrƒÉina»õii, it details the peasants' revolt of 1907.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., pp. 246, 249 In March 1914, Moruzi returned to antisemitic themes, contributing to the polemic on Jewish emancipation with the article Problema jidoveascƒÉ »ôi poporul rom√¢n (\\"The Jewish Question and the Romanian People\\"). Defining himself as a \\"humble autodidact\\", Moruzi argued that Romanian Jews were less qualified for citizenship than ethnic Romanians from outside the Kingdom. He called naturalization on such grounds \\"false, unnatural and alien\\".Moruzi (1914), passim That summer, Unirea published his column on the styling of Romanian nobility, in which Moruzi protested against boyars who took up \\"foreign titles\\".Rosetti, passim Living in near-total isolation after going deaf (\\"the cruelest of all infirmities\\", as he defined it),Moruzi (1914), p. 2 Moruzi was also succumbing to asthma. He died in poverty at Ia»ôi, in October 1914, but had a sumptuous funeral at Eternitatea, where Unireas A. C. Cuza delivered a eulogy.Bezviconi, Profiluri..., p. 245 Cuza referred to Moruzi as a \\"man of generous vision [and] honestly nationalist ideas\\", arguing that his worldview was shaped by \\"the truth of Christian teachings\\" and by a commitment to the Romanian Orthodox Church. In his obituary piece, Iorga also noted that Moruzi was an example to follow, but also a remainder of his age, the age \\"when youth could only be found among the sexagenarians and when those working for the nation, unrewarded, were those beset by fatal illness and the poorest among the poor\\".Iorga (1935), pp. 132‚Äì133 Dumitru was survived by his son, who lived in Paris as \\"Prince Mourousi\\" and, Iorga notes, maintained an extravagant lifestyle. The Russian Revolution of February 1917 brought about Bessarabian autonomy, consecrated as the \\"Moldavian Democratic Republic\\". During the October Revolution, which made possible the union of Bessarabia with Romania, Pelivan, by then a leader of the National Moldavian Party, paid public homage to Moruzi. In his speech before Sfatul »öƒÉrii, he referred to Pribegi √Æn »õarƒÉ rƒÉpitƒÉ as \\"something of a Moldavian gospel.\\"Constantin et al. (2011), pp. 77, 100; Constantin et al. (2012), p. 148 In June 1925, a delegation of Bessarabian cultural societies tended to Moruzi's grave and deposed wreaths.Horea KogƒÉlniceanu, \\"Trei zile de sƒÉrbƒÉtoare\\", in Cultura Poporului, June 21, 1925, p. 2 In 1936, however, Pelivan's former colleague, Emanoil Catelli, suggested that Moruzi had betrayed the Bessarabian unionist cause with his departure for Romania, having \\"capitulated before his fight had even begun\\".Constantin et al. (2012), p. 422 The Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, then the impact of World War II, returned him to near-complete anonymity: Moruzi was indexed and censored in both Communist Romania and the Moldovan SSR. As noted by Voncu: \\"Romanian communists cast a prohibition on Dumitru C. Moruzi's writings because these obsessed about the Bessarabian question and Russia's shameless behavior. For the 'Moldovenists' of Chi»ôinƒÉu, Dumitru C. Moruzi was twice the adversary: on one hand, he was 'the boyar', a hobbyhorse of communist propaganda, and, on the other, one who supported the notion that Bessarabia was eminently Romanian.\\" Reassessment followed the dissolution of the Soviet Union, particularly so in independent Moldova. In 2001, Iurie Colesnic put out a new edition of Ru»ôii »ôi rom√¢nii, the first of several such books issued in a \\"Testament Collection\\" at Museum publishing house. \\"Edituri »ôi editori din Basarabia - supliment tematic.

Her parentage is unknown, but she was the foster daughter of Heinrich Ernst von Gersdorfs in Dresden, and given a good education by him. She married Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann in 1747. Her spouse had an important role within Danish government from 1762, and the couple became central figures within the Danish aristocracy. The masquerade balls hosted by the Schimmelmann couple in their palace in Copenhagen belonged to the foremost centers of Danish society life in the 1760s, and these balls were later blamed to have encouraged queen Caroline Matilda's adultery with Struensee: the couple were also noted to have behaved suspicious at them.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. Schimmelmann belonged to the queen's closest circle of friends, and was decorated with the Matildeordenen in 1771. Described as an intelligent and kind character, who managed her household and the upbringing of her children with good economic sense, she was also regarded as an attractive woman who looked much younger than her years, and had herself the major Seneca Otto Falkenskjold for a lover.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. However, the queen's relationship with Struensee made her worried, and her close favor with the queen caused a conflict in the connection between her spouse and Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. Her spouse was asked to use his wife to influence the queen to end her affair with Struensee, but he refused and commented that the queen was their ruler and did as she pleased.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. The Schimmelmann couple was not affected by the fall of Struensee and the queen in January 1772, despite Caroline von Schimmelmann's position as the queen's intimate friend, and her spouse made a successful career in the new regime. After his death in 1782, Caroline von Schimmelmann retired as society hostess and spent the rest of her life moving about between the homes of her children. In 1774-75, her son Ernst Schimmelmann belonged to the conspirators around Nathaniel William Wraxall, who planned to install queen Caroline Matilda as regent of Denmark.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909.

The Nuremberg Medical Trial 1946/47, Walter de Gruyter, p. 236. Biography = Early life = Karl Freiherr Michel von T√º√üling was born in T√º√üling, Bavaria, as the second child of Alfred Freiherr Michel v. T√º√üling (1870‚Äì1957) and Hertha Gr√§fin Wolffskeel v. Reichenberg (1877‚Äì1948).Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Freiherrliche H√§user, Band XV, Limburg a.d. Lahn 1989, p. 359 ff. He grew up on the Upper Bavarian estate of T√º√üling castle, which his father bought in 1905. After the First World War he graduated from high school (Abitur) and studied forestry in Munich at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t. He graduated as a Diplom-Forstwirt. Michel von T√º√üling came from a national conservative family. His father had served as a Major (reserve) of the Bavarian Army. His uncle Eberhard Wolffskeel von Reichenberg (1875-1954) served as a Major in the Imperial Army. As chief of staff to Fakhri Pasha, deputy commander of the Ottoman Fourth Army, he was actively involved in the Armenian Genocide. His uncle Richard von Michel-Raulino (1864-1926) was a committed member of the German National People's Party as well as publisher and owner of the national conservative Bamberger Tagblatt newspaper. His older sister Freda (1905-1936) was married to the Nazi Henning von Nordeck (1895-1978), who served as a SS-Standartenf√ºhrer in the staff of the Reichsleitung SS, as early as 1934.SS-Personalhauptamt (Hrsg.), Dienstalterslisten der Schutzstaffel der NSDAP, Stand vom 1.

In summer 1933 he was transferred to the 1st SS-Standarte in Munich, that was commanded by Viktor Brack, who was also chief of staff to the Reich Secretary of the NSDAP, Reichsleiter Philipp Bouhler. In August 1934, Bouhler became police chairman of Munich, and only a month later, he was appointed chief of Adolf Hitler's Chancellery. In 1935 Bouhler summoned Michel von T√ºssling to Berlin, where he became a commissioned officer, rising to the rank of Untersturmf√ºhrer. He served in Hitler's Chancellery (KdF) and also became a staff officer to the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler.SS-Personalhauptamt (Hrsg.), Dienstalterslisten der Schutzstaffel der NSDAP, Stand vom 1. Juli 1935, Berlin, 1935, S. 103 Shortly after its foundation in December 1935, Michel von T√º√üling became a member of the SS organization Lebensborn.SS-Personalhauptamt (Hrsg.), Dienstalterslisten der Schutzstaffel der NSDAP, Stand vom 1.

Brack was appointed chief of Main Office 2 (Hauptamt II). Bouhler's office was responsible for all correspondences for Hitler which included private and internal communications, appeals from party courts, official judgments, and clemency petitions. In 1937, he also became a staff officer at the SS Main Office, and was promoted to Hauptsturmf√ºhrer in 1938. Michel von T√º√üling continued his service in Hitler's Chancellery and the SS, and remained the personal adjutant of Bouhler throughout the Aktion T4, the programme of involuntary euthanasia, that ran officially from September 1939 to August 1941, killing more than 70,000 people.NSDAP - Reichsorganisationsleiter Dr. Robert Ley, Hg. (1941), Nationalsozialistisches Jahrbuch 1942, Franz Eher Nachfolger, Munich, p. 167 On 30 January 1941, Michel von T√º√üling was promoted to Sturmbannf√ºhrer. In 1941 Bouhler and Himmler initiated Aktion 14f13. Bouhler instructed the head of the Hauptamt II, Viktor Brack who had already been in charge of the various front operations of T4, to implement this order. Aktion 14f13 killed 15,000‚Äì20,000 concentration camp prisoners. Many KdF employees who participated in T4 later joined Operation Reinhard, the Nazi plan under Odilo Globocnik to exterminate Polish Jews in the General Government district of German-occupied Poland, that was executed from October 1941 till November 1943. In the 1943 and 1944 SS Officers list (Dienstalterslisten der SS), Michel von T√º√üling was listed under the number '2007', serving as a staff officer in the SS-Hauptamt.SS-Personalhauptamt (Hrsg.), Dienstalterslisten der Schutzstaffel der NSDAP, SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer bis SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer, Stand vom 1.

The SS- Hauptamt maintained for other branches of the SS, the \\"paper trail\\" for such activities as the Einsatzgruppen, Final Solution and the commission of the Holocaust. Later on 10 May 1945, Bouhler was captured and arrested by American troops. He committed suicide on 19 May 1945 while in the U.S. internment camp at Zell am See in Austria.Miller, Michael (2006). Leaders of the SS and German Police, Vol. 1, R. James Bender Publishing, p. 155. Michel von T√º√üling was interned at Regensburg Internment Camp, from where he provided an affidavit in defence of Viktor Brack in 1947. In this affidavit he also describes their (Brack, Bouhler, Michel von T√º√üling) relation to Adolf Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann; (excerpt): During the Nuremberg \\"Doctors' trial\\", Brack was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity: Nazi human experimentation, mass murder under the guise of euthanasia, his relation to Aktion 14f13, and his involvement to the implementation of the Final Solution. Brack was found guilty and executed at Landsberg Prison in 1948. Michel von T√º√üling was able to conceal his wartime KdF- and SS-activity from the American prosecutors. At the Nuremberg Doctors trial, he affirmed an affidavit that in September 1939 he was drafted into the Luftwaffe, where he served until the end of the war. After his release from the detention center in 1948, he returned to T√º√üling and worked as a farmer. Along with Brack and Bouhler, one of his close Nazi Party friends was the former Minister of Armaments and War Production Albert Speer, who regularly visited him on his estate following his release from Spandau Prison in 1966.Stephanie von Pfuel, Wenn schon, denn schon, Autobiografie, LangenM√ºller, M√ºnchen, 2007, S. 167 Michel von T√º√üling died at T√º√üling Castle in 1991. =Family= Gravestone of Karl Freiherr Michel von T√º√üling and his wife Ulrike, on the pilgrimage church Innocent Children, Heiligenstatt (T√º√üling) Michel von T√º√üling was married twice.

While pursuing her athletics career, Taher became a stewardess for Air France. Athletic career This attracted the attention of the Chadian sporting officials, who arranged for Taher to visit training facilities in Kenya once a year for the following six years. This meant that she could train alongside the Kenyan middle-distance runners. Taher was the flag bearer for the Chadian team at the 2016 Games, with the team consisting of her and Bachir Mahamat.

Vermont native J.T. Graham learned the milling profession in Sacramento, California during the California Gold Rush. After moving to Iowa in 1853 he built and operated several mills in the state. In 1871 he built the Rockford Mill with partner D.D. Cutler. It is a two-story gable building on a stone foundation. A shed roofed addition was built onto the east side of the building later. Graham was sole proprietor after 1875. What made this mill unique in Floyd County was that 90% of the work was custom grinding. with It processed wheat, buckwheat, cornmeal and feed. Several owners operated the mill after Graham's death. H.W. Winston was unsuccessful at making electricity for the town in 1899. The dam was added in 1918. Rockford Light and Power Company operated the building in 1913 and Cedar Valley Electric Company from 1916 to 1920. They combined feed milling with water and power production. Feed milling continued until World War II when it had to be suspended because of a labor shortage. By the time the war ended the mill pond had silted in and the dam deteriorated, so the operator had to rely on electrical power alone in 1952. It was the last feed mill operation left in the county by that time. The decline in farming operations brought local feed milling to an end. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

She went missing on Saturday, August 20, 2016 and was last seen alive around 2am Central Daylight Time, according to the Amber Alert that was issued for her. When her parents woke up at 8am Saturday, they noted that their daughter, their pickup truck, and the house guest who had stayed with them overnight were gone. After her parents reported her missing, her father's cell phone in the truck pinged a cell tower in Todd County, Minnesota giving a clue to where she might be. Her body was located nine hours later in Cass county near the Wilderness Park in a swampy area. The overnight guest, Zachary Todd Anderson, a softball teammate of the girl's father, is believed to have stolen the family's white 2002 GMC Sierra pickup truck during the abduction. He was located in a secluded area around 4:20pm Central Time. Police had tracked the vehicle to Anderson's family's cabin, which was unoccupied when they arrived. When police located Anderson, he was standing knee-deep in a swamp behind the cabin with his wrists slashed. He eventually led them to Alayna's body, which was completely submerged under water. An autopsy found evidence of sexual assault, and determined the cause of death to be strangulation and blunt force trauma to the head. On March 2nd, 2018, Zachary Todd Anderson pleaded guilty to a charge of first-degree murder while committing first-degree criminal sexual conduct.

Republican Party candidate Coles Bashford was declared the winner after a court challenge, defeating Democratic incumbent William A. Barstow. Barstow was initially declared the winner of the election, having apparently received just over 50% of the vote. However, Bashford and the Wisconsin Attorney General, George Baldwin Smith, filed suit in the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the case Atty. Gen. ex rel. Bashford v. Barstow. They alleged that Barstow created fraudulent election returns in several fake precincts in Wisconsin's northern counties. The court found that Bashford had won the election, and was entitled to the governorship. Before the court could formally remove him from office, Barstow resigned, leaving his Lieutenant Governor Arthur MacArthur Sr. as acting Governor, until Bashford was sworn in four days later.

It was established on 4 September 2014 and began operations on 10 October 2014. In January 2016 its founders, Nic Marchesi and Lucas Patchett, were awarded joint Young Australians of the Year for their social entrepreneurship.  Background  Marchesi describes himself and Patchett as \\"two normal everyday blokes who had a crazy idea\\". They had previously volunteered at food vans and other outreach programs while still at school, and had a passion to help the homeless. Their idea \\"started as a fun test project ‚Äî to see if it would work. From there, it took a life of its own.‚Äù They took the name for their service from the Alexi Murdoch song \\"Orange Sky\\", which is about lending a hand to those in need. Orange Sky Laundry is a government registered charity. The service is believed to be a world first. In February 2015, five months after they started with the first van in Brisbane in October 2014, and two weeks after their expansion into Cairns, Cyclone Marcia hit the central Queensland coast and the then 20-year-olds headed to the area to offer their free service to affected communities. Similarly, in January 2016, they travelled to Victoria to provide laundry services to people affected by the Great Ocean Road bushfires. The laundry vans filled a service gap and not only offered clean clothes and blankets but also dignity. Marchesi says the human connections enabled to the isolated is the most important aspect of their initiative. Each van also carries six orange chairs. During the time the laundry is being washed and dried in the vans, the volunteers sit and socialise with the visitors.  Expansion  Orange Sky began operating its second van (in Cairns) by February 2015, and its third in Melbourne in June. Their first birthday, and World Homeless Day 2015, were celebrated with a new service in south east Victoria, funded by partners The Good Guys (who provided half of the funding for the van), the Jelley Family Foundation, and the Bennelong Foundation. Other vans began operating in Sydney in November 2015, Gold Coast in January 2016, Perth in February 2016, Adelaide in March 2016, Sunshine Coast in April 2016, Canberra in April 2016, and Hobart in July 2016. By July 2016, Orange Sky had 10 vans and 600 volunteers, and were estimated to be washing nearly six tonnes of laundry each week. They now have 13 vans servicing 121 locations with over 800 volunteers. there are services in all Australian states plus the Australian Capital Territory. They have plans to expand to the US.  Awards  On Australia Day 2016, the two co-founders were jointly named Young Australians of the Year. In their acceptance speeches after being announced as winners by the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, Patchett said \\"we can restore respect, raise health standards and be a catalyst for conversation\\". Marchesi continued \\"It's so crazy and humbling to think such a simple idea has had such a significant impact\\". In June 2016 they were invited to Frankfurt, Germany to receive a Global Best Practices Award: Special Award for Corporate Social Responsibility. In October 2018, Orange Sky was given the People's Choice Award in the Google Impact Challenge Australia.  Orange Sky Showers On 23 August 2016, Orange Sky launched a new mobile service: free hot showers for the homeless. One of the homeless to first try the shower van described it as \\"bloody awesome\\". The first van is being trialled in Brisbane, but will then be permanently moved to Melbourne as it was funded by the Shine On Foundation which is based in Melbourne.

It runs from Landem√¶rket in the southeast to Rosenborggade in the northwest, linking Vognmagergade with Tornebuskgade. The last part of the street passes the rear side of the grounds of the Reformed Church in Gothersgade. The former rectory associated with the church is located at No. 32-36. It is now houses the Danish Association of Architects. History Gedde's district map The street in 1913 The street originally followed Copenhagen's East Rampart in an area of the city, north of Landem√¶rket, which long remained relatively undeveloped. It is believed that the street was originally called \\"√Öbne Vr√•er\\", a reference to a row of open market stalls that sold woollen goods at the site. This name was gradually corrupted into its current name and it is thus unrelated to the name of the town Aabenraa in South Jutland. The street was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 but was not part of the area that was destroyed in the Fire of 1795. Several buildings along the street were demolished in the 1950s. Notable buildings and structures The former rectory of Reformed Church No. 32-36 is the former rectory associated with the Reformed Church in Gothersgade on the other side of the block. The building was built in 1730-32 to design by Philip de Lange. It is now owned by Karberghus and houses the Danish Association of Architects. Rosenborghus at No. 29 served as school and orphanage for children from the German Reformed congregation for the 1770s until 1926. No. 26 Several of the other buildings in the street also date from the 18th century and are examples of the so- called \\"fire houses\\" that were built immediately after the Fire of 1728. No. 25 was originally built for court sculptor Friderich Ehbisch in 1733. Its facade was originally decorated with reliefs on all floors as well as on the dormer but they were removed when the building was converted into a warehouse in 1895-96. The neighbouring building at No. 27 was built for Trabant Elias Dord√©. The painter Wilhelm Bendz lived in the building in the late 1820s and early 1830s. No. 23 (√Öbenr√• 23 / Hauser Plads 24) is also from the 1730s and listed. No. 26, with its large, five-bay wall dormer, is from the 1750s. The eleven-bay building at No. 28-30 was originally two houses from the 1730s but they were later expanded with an extra floor and merged into one building in the late 19th century. The modern property at No. 20, Blanche, is a dormitory. It is from 1961 and was designed by Steen Eiler Rasmussen in collaboration with Kai L. Larsen.

The Hugh River and Waterhouse Range run through the reserve. It also features the first pastoral homestead built in Central Australia. History Aranda people have lived on Owen Springs Station and adjoining land for thousands of years. Explorer John McDouall Stuart's route through Central Australia passed through Owen Springs during his early 1860s expeditions. The Australian Overland Telegraph Line originally followed his track through Lawrence Gorge in the Waterhouse Range. William Gilbert drove 1000 head of cattle from Adelaide to the MacDonnell Ranges in 1872, with Ted Bagot (1848‚Äì1881) and his foster-brother James Churchill-Smith (1851‚Äì1922). It was considered to be one of the great droving feats in Australian pastoral history. Gilbert obtained the lease for Owen Springs station in 1873, appointing Archie Conway as manager. The station was stocked with cattle and horses and two log huts were constructed. The first hut was completed by 7 August 1873 and the other was nearly completed. These timber buildings were the earliest buildings to be constructed in Central Australia. He sold the station after the death of his father to Sir Thomas Elder in 1886, who attempted to breed horses for the Indian Army. After sustaining significant losses, Elder was forced to sell Owen Springs in 1894, inclusive of the stock to an unidentified stock and station agent. The following year a consortium comprising Charles Gall, Allen Breaden and Sir Sidney Kidman purchased the station. From 1896 to 1901, Kidman and his brother Sack mustered horses off Owen Springs and sold them into southern markets before abandoning the station. Dennis White, a bushman who formed part of Peter Warburton's exploration team, committed suicide at Owen Springs Station in 1898. In 1905, Norman Richardson purchased both Owen Springs and Undoolya Station. William Hayes (1827‚Äì1913) purchased numerous blocks, including Owen Springs between in 1903 and 1907. The Hayes family then sold Owen Springs to Hurtle and Tom Kidman, nephews of Sidney Kidman in 1930 only to purchase them back in 1937. William's son Edward and his new bride Jean (n√©e Bloomfield) took on the management of the property. Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia was inoculated on the property in 1950. In 1992, of land was excised from the pastoral lease to create the site for the penal facility now known as the Alice Springs Correctional Centre. Owen Springs was owned by the Hayes family until the death in 1999 of Mrs Elizabeth Milnes, the daughter of Edward Hayes. Nature Reserve Owen Springs opened as a nature reserve in April 2003 and is now managed by the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory. The homestead and yards were listed on the Northern Territory Heritage Register under the name Old Owen Springs Homestead and Yards on 3 November 2004.

The Ahmedabad king Sultan Mahmood-III (1538-1554) ordered its construction to defend the city from the frequent attacks that had devastated it. He entrusted the work to Safi Agha, a Turkish soldier who had been ennobled with the title of Khudawand Khan. History Though in context of the identity of Surat in medieval times many views have been expressed by different historians, in all the historical narratives Surat has emerged as one of the major ports of international importance on the map of the world trade. A Portuguese traveller named Barbosa during his visit to Gujarat in 1514 described Surat as a city of great trade in all classes of merchandise, a very important seaport yielding a large revenue to the king, and frequented by many ships from Malabar and many other ports. Shortly before Barbosa was in Gujarat, Surat is said to have been burnt by the Portuguese in 1512. Surat reportedly suffered from a wholly unprovoked, and piratical raid, in 1530, a second time by the Portuguese under the leadership of Antonio da Silvaria. Though the assailants were opposed by a guard of 300 horses and 10,000 foot, at the first charge the defenders fled, and the town was taken and burnt. As they were still at the war with the Gujarat King, the Portuguese again burnt Surat in 1531. The Ahmedabad king Sultan Mahmud Shah III (1538-1554), who was very much annoyed by these frequent destruction of Surat, ordered a very strong castle and endowed Safi Agha, a Turkish soldier who had been ennobled with the title of Khudawand Khan with a substantial budget for the work. Khudawand Khan initially selected three alternative sites for building the castle.

She is perhaps best known for her involvement in the Wounded Knee incident and for her involvement in the murder of fellow American Indian Movement activist Anna Mae Aquash. Personal life Between 1974 and 1975, Thelma Conroy-Rios allowed a fellow male activist, Harry Hill, to live with her. Conroy-Rios and Hill were said to be involved in a common law marriage. Although identified as a cop by ex-wife Thelma Conroy-Rios, Hill's role as a law official is disputed. Conroy-Rios identified Hill as having provoked the Custer Courthouse Incident Riot that unfolded in 1973 following a one-day jail sentence of murderer Darld Schmitz, a White Air Force veteran in the murder of Wesley Bad Heart Bull. According to Conroy-Rios, \\"He started it all, Dave. He provoked the riot. He was right there. He told me so, proudly, several times. He instigated that courtroom riot too. I was there. I saw him start it, punching a cop. At the time everybody thought it was great. He was a warrior. He was a hero and everybody trusted him, including me.\\" Conroy-Rios' account is corroborated by a separate account found in Peter Matthiessen's book, In the Spirit of Crazy Horse. Although Hill denies ever working in any capacity as a cop or collaborated with law enforcement, there has been speculation that he was an FBI informant. Conroy-Rios was an enrolled student at Black Hills State University, but had to drop out after her daughter was born with a rare blood disease in 1970. Legal history =Murder of Anna Mae Aquash= Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash was a female activist within the ranks of the American Indian Movement. On December 11, 1975, Aquash was forced out of the home of Denver AIM Troy Lynn S. Yellow Wood despite the latter's objection that something bad would happen to Aquash.Aquash Murder Case Timelineby Paul DeMain, jfamr.org She was taken to an apartment in Rapid City owned by Russell Means' brother, and during interrogation, she was raped by Graham. Anna Mae was moved to two residences owned by Thelma Conroy-Rios. Looking Cloud indicated that he heard John Graham and Aquash having sex in the bedroom of a Rapid City apartment (whose ownership is attributed to Thelma Conroy-Rios and her mother, which led to prosecutors alleging that Graham raped Aquash. These allegations were further reinforced by the 'strong acid phosphate' found in the vagina, which \\"constitutes evidence in support of the allegation that defendant John Graham raped the victim at Thelma Rios' apartment on or about December 10‚Äì11, 1975.\\" Graham acknowledged in a taped interview/interrogation that Looking Cloud waited outside of the room Anna Mae was imprisoned inside of. Aquash was then forcefully moved to the Rosebud Indian Reservation where AIM supporters refuse to house her. Nelson-Clarke was given orders to have Anna Mae eliminated. Theda Nelson Clarke, another female AIM activist, received instructions to have Aquash \\"dealt with\\" from Rapid City, South Dakota American Indian Movement activist Thelma Conroy-Rios. Aquash's assassination was allegedly rooted in the mistaken belief that Aquash was a government informant. Looking Cloud, along with Theda Nelson Clarke and John 'John Boy Patton' Graham, force Aquash into the back of a car and drive her to a remote part of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Clarke drove from Denver, Colorado to the scene of the shooting on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in her red Pinto. Aquash was shot execution style in the back of the head and left to die. Her body was discovered on February 24, 1976 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation at the bottom of a ravine located in close proximity to an isolated highway. Aquash was revealed to have been executed using a gun, as the autopsy showed that the muzzle of the gun had been pressed into the back of her neck. The coroner's report indicated that in addition to the fatal gunshot wound, exposure contributed to the death of Aquash. =Court= Conroy-Rios was indicted on September 9, 2009 on one count of felony murder for kidnapping and one count of premeditated murder to Anna Mae, with a trial scheduled for November. Rios agreed to a plea deal which allowed her to avoid going to trial on murder charges,\\"On September 10, 2009 the state of South Dakota indicted John Graham and Thelma Rios (Conroy-Hill on murder, rape and kidnapping charges. Thelma Rios pled guilty during November 2010 to the charge of kidnapping.\\" Aquash/Peltier - NFIC Files/Articles, indiancountrynews.com which resulted in her pleading guilty to acting as an accessory in the kidnapping of Aquash, and, as a result, was sentenced to serve five years in prison. Rios admitted that Aquash was kept at her home in Rapid City before being taken to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Judge Delaney of South Dakota suspended the 5-year maximum sentence and instead ordered 90 days in jail, which Rios had served while waiting to be released on bond. In a plea agreement, Rios indicated that she overheard two other people who wanted Aquash to be killed, but these names were redacted from court documents. Prosecutors and defense attorneys requested that Conroy-Rios' plea agreement be sealed, which approved and carried out by the judge. Death On Wednesday, February 9, 2011, Rios died at 4:30 P.M.

He developed armour-plating for warships, and worked on the Bessemer process of steelmaking. Early life Ellis was born in Handsworth on 20 April 1824, son of Charles Ellis, a Birmingham brass manufacturer, and was educated at King Edward VI School, Birmingham. He obtained a practical knowledge of the manufacture and working of brass in his father's works, and in 1848 became a partner in the firm. On 5 December 1848 he married Elizabeth Parsons Bourne of Childs Ercall, Shropshire. Armour- plate for warships In 1854 he purchased with John Brown and William Bragge the Atlas engineering works in Sheffield, then a modest establishment covering about three acres. Shortly after the partners took over the works, the adoption of armour for warships in France (1858) led the company to produce iron plates by a new and cheaper process of rolling welding them. Four-inch plates made by this process were fitted to and , the earliest ironclads of the British Royal Navy. For several years Ellis was occupied in devising appliances for the manufacture of thicker plates to protect ships against guns and projectiles. Steel was tried, but was not found to have the necessary toughness under the impact of shot. After many experiment Ellis perfected a process for uniting a hard steel face with a wrought-iron backing. Such compound armour was used until about 1893, the s being protected with an 18-inch belt of this on the water-line. Meanwhile, as early as 1871, Ellis had turned his attention to the process of cementation, and in that year he took out a patent relating to it; but it was not until the chilling process devised by Captain T. J. Tresidder (in which the heated surface of a plate was chilled by means of water under pressure) was applied in conjunction with cementation, that satisfactory results were obtained. The first Ellis-Tresidder chilled compound plate was tried with success at Shoeburyness in 1891. Bessemer process and other developments Ellis was largely instrumental in promoting the success of the Bessemer process. Sir Henry Bessemer established works close to the Atlas works, and Ellis, adopting at an early stage the new process, then established at the Atlas works the first plant in England outside the inventor's own works. In conjunction with William Eaves he introduced the Ellis-Eaves system of induced draught, and he devised a mill for rolling the ribbed boiler-flues of the Purves and other types, and also in connection with the manufacture of Serve tubes. The Atlas works soon acquired a worldwide reputation for mechanical engineering of all kinds. The concern was formed into a limited liability company in 1864. The capital rose to nearly three millions sterling; about 10,000 men were employed at Ellis's death, and the output exceeded 100,000 tons of steel per annum. Ellis was managing director from 1864 until 1905, when he became chairman of the company. Brown retired in 1870 and Bragge died in 1884, when Ellis acquired sole charge. In 1899 the Clydebank Shipbuilding and Engineering Works, employing 8000 men, were taken over by the concern. Awards and later life In 1867 Ellis was decorated with the Cross of the Order of Vasa in recognition of his aid in certain fortifications in Sweden. From the Iron and Steel Institute, of which he was a member from 1875, a member of council in 1888, and a vice-president in 1901, he received the Bessemer Gold Medal in 1889, when Sir Henry Bessemer acknowledged Ellis's services in establishing the process. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 8 January 1884. He took little part in the public affairs of Sheffield, but was a magistrate for the West Riding, and was for ten years chairman of the South Yorkshire Coalowners' Association. He died at his residence in Worksop on 11 November 1906 and was buried at Carlton in Lindrick. His son William Henry Ellis was also a steelmaker in Sheffield.

Pulling is when a blocking player in American football leaves his usual spot in order to pick up another assignment on the opposite side of the field, running behind the other offensive linemen, to sprint out in front of a running back and engage a defensive player beyond the initial width of the offensive line. Guards This technique is most commonly used by guards. In most playbooks, guards pull for outside runs as a lead blocker, such as a sweep play, and on counter plays, where the far-side guard pulls to block a play-side lineman. Since the guard is free of responsibility for play-side outside runs and far-side counter plays, pulling is generally a unique responsibility for guards. Tackles While tackles can also pull, this strategy is generally less common as they are too far away to pull to the opposite side of the formation (for counter plays) and have the responsibility of blocking the outside defender (generally the defensive end) for outside runs. History John Heisman is credited with first pulling guards. Vanderbilt's Dan McGugin soon followed. =Trap block= Pop Warner invented the trap block with his single wing. The offensive line deliberately allows a defensive player to cross the line of scrimmage untouched, and then blocks him with a guard or tackle from the opposite side.http://www.dummies.com/sports/football/offense/the-types-of-blocks-in- american-football/ =Packer sweep= In the 1960s, National Football League (NFL) coach Vince Lombardi of the Green Bay Packers utilized the Packers sweep play in which guards Jerry Kramer and Fuzzy Thurston rapidly pulled out from their normal positions and led blocking for the running back (typically Paul Hornung or Jim Taylor) going around the end. It was an integral part of an offense that won five NFL titles in seven years.

Description \\"Blow Pony\\" is a queer event organized by nightlife promoter Airick Redwolf, who saw LGBT establishments targeting either men or women and wanted to create an event series inclusive to the entire community. Redwolf said of the event's origin and purpose: > Blow Pony was created as a place for people of all walks of life to gather > in a respectful place, and to feel safer to express themselves, but also to > showcase queer talent and queer artists. It's also a social, a dance, a good > time.

History Exterior of Bossanova Ballroom for a \\"Blow Pony\\" event in October 2016 \\"Blow Pony\\" was established c. 2007 and originally held at the \\"old\\" Eagle gay bar on West Burnside Street. The event series was popular from the start, but had to relocate to the gay bar Casey's when the Eagle closed. Casey's hosted \\"Blow Pony\\" for less than a year due to conflicts with neighboring tenants and attacks on patrons. Bruce LaBruce was a guest disc jockey in 2008. From 2009 to 2016, the event was hosted at Euphoria Nightclub, a venue on Southeast 3rd Avenue with two levels: Rotture and Branx. The event hosted its eighth anniversary celebration in March 2015. In June 2016, Euphoria changed ownership, and the new owner and his promotion company opted to target a single demographic and play only electronic dance music. The venue stopped hosting \\"Blow Pony\\" and its counterpart event \\"Bearracuda\\" immediately, despite event organizers having contractual agreements through November. \\"Blow Pony\\" started being held at Bossanova Ballroom, which also hosts the lesbian dance party \\"Inferno\\", on July 16, 2016.

Criticized by J√ºrgen Habermas as one of the leading representatives of German neoconservatism in the 1970s and 1980s, L√ºbbe is now widely recognized as one of the most influential German political philosophers in the last decades.

History  = Formation = The 25th Mechanized Corps was formed in March 1941 at Kharkov in the Kharkov Military District. The corps included the 50th and 55th Tank Divisions, and the 219th Motorized Division. The 50th Tank Division was formed at Kharkov, the 55th at Chuguyev, and the 219th Motorized Division at Akhtyrka. The corps was commanded by Major General Semyon Krivoshein. = World War II = Burning T-34 tank of the type used by the corps The 25th Mechanized Corps was part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command on 22 June 1941, the date of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Between 24 and 29 June it deployed by rail to the Kiev region. The corps was originally to support the 19th Army and was assigned to it on 30 June. The corps was slow in deploying forward from Kharkov. As a result, the 23rd Mechanized Corps supported the 19th Army instead. During the first half of July, it was assigned to support the 21st Army to replace the mechanized corps destroyed in the border battles. Between 3 and 8 July the corps moved to the Novozybkov region. The corps included 163 older model tanks on 1 July (6 BT tanks and 157 T-26 tanks) and was reinforced by 64 T-34 medium tanks by 13 July. On 13 July, the corps was ordered to concentrate the 219th Motorized Division in the Rudnia, Borkhov, and Pribor region, 15 to 25 kilometers to the west of Gomel. The 50th Tank Division was to attack along the Bykhov and Bobruisk axis from its positions. 300 tanks of the corps launched heavy unsuccessful attacks in cooperation with the 67th Rifle Corps against Heinz Guderian's forces south of Bykhov. On 16 July, the corps was in the Krichev area, according to Western Front commander Semyon Timoshenko. On 18 July, the 50th Tank Division was in the Voshchanka and Aleshnia region, 40 to 50 kilometers wast of Rogachev and 15 to 20 kilometers east of Dovsk, according to Timoshenko's situation report. Its 10-tank detachment and a motorized company had reportedly destroyed 70-80 wheeled vehicles, 10 tanks, and killing up to 500 German soldiers in the Mahsevskaya Sloboda region from 17 July. The 219th Motorized Division was in the Chechersk and Voronovka area. The 55th Tank Division was at Novozybkov. According to Timoshenko's 21 July report, the corps was attacking. The 50th Tank Division was on the southern outskirts of Obidovichi, the 219th Motorized Division was unsuccessfully attempting to capture Maly Propoysk with its motor rifle regiment, and the 55th Tank Division was still at Novozybkov. On 22 July the corps was ordered to capture Propoysk. On 23 July it was fighting for Propoysk. The corps suffered heavy losses in its attacks and regrouped on 24 July. Between 25 and 27 July it resumed the offensive. The corps shifted back to defense on 31 July. On 10 August, the 55th Tank Division became the 8th and 14th Separate Tank Battalions.

It was a fictionalised account based on a proposed scheme for prisoners of war to escape from Colditz Castle by a clandestinely constructed glider christened the Colditz Cock. The film appeared on the ABC Movie of the Week on September 18, 1971.pp. 54 Karol, Michael The ABC Movie of the Week Companion: A Loving Tribute to the Classic Series iUniverse, 2008 The film was shot at Universal Studios Hollywood and released theatrically in several countries. Plot O.S.S. Agent Major Cook is sent to Occupied Europe to bring Halden Brevik, a Norwegian scientist with knowledge on how to build an atomic bomb, to the Allies. The pair are captured, but their cover story, that they are escaped Allied air force prisoners of war, is believed by the Germans, and they are sent to the \\"escape proof\\" Beckstadt Castle. Cook plots escape, while keeping the scientist's true identity from both the Germans and his fellow prisoners. Cook comes up with an escape plan to fly out of the castle all the way to nearby Switzerland. A glider is built in secret in an attic, which will be able to take two men out. With the Germans closing in, Cook has to reveal Brevik's true identity and importance to the other prisoners in order that Brevik can be the second escapee. The other P.O.W.'s suspect Cook of lying to them, but fortunately one of them turns out to be a commando who had been captured (and also blinded) during the failed attempt to extract Brevik from Norway. Cook gets injured and will not be able to fly the glider, so he gives up his seat to Colonel Crawford, his strongest doubter, who hitherto he has had a strained relationship with. The prisoners knock out a wall and, with Crawford piloting, successfully launch the glider.

Zurita commenced his studies for the priesthood after he had once been refused entrance and he became known as an athletic seminarian. Bishop Rafael Gu√≠zar Valencia ordained him in 1931 and he was killed three months later after armed gunmen stormed the cathedral ‚Äì enacting the so-called Tejeda Law ‚Äì and shot him dead. Zurita's beatification cause commenced under Pope John Paul II on 3 September 1988 and he was beatified under Pope Benedict XVI on 20 November 2005 after the latter confirmed that Zurita had been killed 'in odium fidei' ‚Äì in hatred of the faith. Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins presided over the beatification on the pontiff's behalf in Guadalajara. Life Dar√≠o Acosta Zurita was born in Mexico on 14 December 1908 as one of five children to Leopoldo Acosta and Dominga Zurita. His sole sister was Elisa while two brothers were Heriberto and Vicente and then Leopoldo who was the last. He was baptized in the parish church of Saint Matthew the Apostle. His mother instilled in him a Christian education while his father worked as a butcher ‚Äì his father later died in his childhood and he was forced to find work to support his mother and siblings. Bishop Rafael Gu√≠zar Valencia visited Veracruz looking for potential seminarians at the time that Zurita had discerned that his call was to that of the religious life, though the bishop refused to accept him for he was still looking after his mother and was not considered old enough. His mother then travelled to Xalapa to meet the bishop and begged him to accept her son; the bishop relented and allowed him to commence his ecclesiastical studies. He was known for his noble and kind character and became involved in football, in the defence position; he was seen as an excellent athlete. Zurita was soon named as the captain of the seminarians' football team. Bishop Gu√≠zar ordained him to the priesthood on 25 April 1931 and Zurita celebrated his first Mass at the Assumption Cathedral on 24 May 1931. He devoted his pastoral mission to instructing children in catechism and to the sacrament of confession. On 26 May 1931 he was appointed as the coadjutor vicar at the Assumption Cathedral. In mid-1931 a law titled Decree 197 ‚Äì known as the Tejeda Law ‚Äì was implemented in order to stop the so-called \\"fanaticism of the people\\" as the governor Adalberto Tejeda Olivares put it. The governor led the anti-religious charge and had designed the law to reign in the power of the churches in the area. Zurita remained calm and placed his faith in God once he received his letter ‚Äì designated as number 759 rather than in name ‚Äì on 21 July 1931. He would call fellow vicars to assess the situation though all were of the mindset that their sole role was to cater to the needs of the faithful rather than to the wishes of the government. All priests were sent the same letter demanding that they cooperate with the government and remain faithful to the contents of this law. This law entered into force on 25 July 1931. On 25 July 1931 at 6:10 pm several men in militia raincoats entered the cathedral of the Assumption and without warning unleashed a barrage of bullets at the two priests present in the room. One sustained grave injuries while another ‚Äì Father Rosas ‚Äì escaped death when he hid in the pulpit. Father Zurita had just baptized a child in the adjacent room before coming into the main section of the cathedral and was at once shot several times. He fell to the ground and exclaimed \\"Jesus!\\" before he died. His death ‚Äì which occurred on a Saturday ‚Äì took place while children were present for a catechism class he was about to start. Beatification The beatification cause opened under Pope John Paul II on 3 September 1988 in a move that titled Zurita as a Servant of God. The diocesan process opened in 1994 and closed in 1998 after Bishop Jos√© Guadalupe Padilla Lozano both inaugurated and concluded the process. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated this process on 25 February 2000. The Positio was submitted to the C.C.S. in 2004 and was passed onto theologians on 15 May 2004 for their assessment in which the cause received approval. The cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. also met to discuss the cause on 15 June 2004 and also responded in the affirmative, while John Paul II offered his definitive approval to the beatification on 22 June 2004. Zurita's beatification was celebrated under Pope Benedict XVI on 20 November 2005 in Guadalajara with Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins presiding over the celebration on the behalf of the pontiff.

It seems closely related to Schilbe uranoscopus and these two species are sympatric over part of their ranges. Distribution Widespread in sub-Saharan Africa from the Senegal River across to Somalia and south as far as the Pongola River in South Africa. Biology Schilbe intermedius is a potamodromous catfish. It is reported to be a pelagic species which occurs mainly in shallow waters and open waters of lakes, it migrates to the surface at night. Generally found in the lower reaches of river systems. It feeds on a fish, either swallowed whole or in pieces and a wide range of invertebrates including terrestrial insects. It is mainly piscivorous once it reaches 13‚Äì34 cm in length. Schilbe intermedius rarely grows to lengths greater than 30 cm. It breeds throughout the year peaking in the rainy season when it migrates into rivers in fairly compact schools to spawn in floodwater pools. In one study the most common prey item was redeye barb, a cyprinid, which made up 29% of all identifiable fish species sampled from the catfishes stomachs. Description There are two populations of the species one with and one without an adipose fin. The population lacking an adipose fin are from the north and west of Africa while the populations with an adipose fin are from the central, east and south of Africa. Quite distinctive with a large shovel mouth surrounded by 4-6 nasal barbs and the eyes slightly protrude from head. The anal fin is long, extending from vent almost to the caudal fin. It has four pairs of short, barbels around the mouth. The ground colour is silvery, brownish to olive on the back and upper parts of the head. There are two dark grey to olive bands, the longest running along the lateral line from the upper gill cover to the caudal peduncle, where this band starts on the upper gill cover there is a dark humeral spot. The second shorter band runs from the beginning of the pectoral fins to the end of the anal fin. The fins are transparent, although the anal fin has a dark band near the body and there is a dark streak which runs into each lobe of the deeply forked caudal fin.

These campaigns led to conflict with the Roman Republic, the outcome of which was the return of Bithynia and Cappadocia to their respective rulers. The Roman Republic then urged the king of Bithynia to invade Pontus with the intent of seizing loot to return to Rome. Mithridates in retaliation conquered Bithynia and Cappadocia once again and began massacring the Roman and Italic populations of Asia Minor with the assistance of the Greeks in what is referred to as the Asiatic Vespers. This led to two further wars between the Roman Republic and Pontus which ended with the death of Mithridates VI, the end of revolts in Greece, Macedonia, and Asia Minor among others, and the subjugation of Armenia. During this period, Gaius Antonius Hybrida was sent alongside Sulla to Macedonia to assist in the First Mithridatic War in around 87 B.C. After the end of the First Mithridatic War, while Sulla returned to Rome, Hybrida stayed in Macedonia levying contributions for himself. He was later recalled to Rome. First to face criminal charges in 76 B.C. resulting in his expulsion from the Senate, and then again in 63 B.C. to be elected to the position of Roman Consul and to fight the campaign against Catiline. From here he returned to Macedonia where he began incurring into the territory of Lower and Upper Moesia. He was to be attacked and defeated twice during this time, first by the Dardanians in an unknown location and then second near Histria by a coalition of Bastarnian and Scythian peoples, who may have been under the command of the Dacian king Burebista. Burebista himself took command of the Bastarnae, Scythian, Dacian and Getae peoples sometime between 82 B.C. and 60 B.C. His rule led to a vast expansion of the Dacian kingdom, as far north as the Bug River at Olbia, south into Thrace, east along the Black Sea and west into Moesia and Pannonia. During the civil war between Pompey and Caesar, Pompey sought the assistance of Burebista, however, the Battle of Pharsalus ended any chance of an alliance between the two. Caesar himself had plans to lead a campaign against Dacia, however, both Caesar and Burebista were assassinated in 44 B.C. and Dacia itself broke apart into several smaller pieces soon after. The Dacians later enjoyed a resurgence in 85‚Äì86 A.D. under the rule of Decebalus, but, were again eventually defeated in 106 A.D. by Emperor Trajan who then turned a large portion Dacia into a province of Rome; Roman Dacia. Background =Mithridates VI Eupator= Extent of the Pontic Kingdom under Mithridates VI Eupator. Before the reign of Mithridates (Darkest purple), after his conquests (purple), after his conquests in the Mithridatic Wars (pink). Mithridates VI Eupator, or Mithridates VI of Pontus, came to rule over the Pontic kingdom in 113 B.C. at the age of 11, when his father was assassinated. The Pontic kingdom is roughly located in the north-eastern quadrant of modern-day Turkey bordering against the Black Sea. Mithridates VI began his career of military expansion first to the east, in modern-day Georgia, and soon after followed the coast of the Black Sea to the north. Around 108 B.C. the Bosporan Kingdom was also peacefully incorporated into Mithridates VI growing Pontic Kingdom when Pairisades V handed its control to Mithridates VI. By 100 B.C the Scythians had been subdued by Mithridates, here he recruited Scythian cavalry which he employed into his later campaigns to the south. Mithridates' influence extended onto the north of the Black Sea and included the cities of Odessos, Nesebar, Histria (Istros), Tomis, Kallatis and Byzantion. Having subjugated Scythia, Mithridates turned his attention to the south and began conquering the neighbouring lands of Bithynia and Cappadocia while the Romans were embroiled in the Social War (91‚Äì88 BC), Rome attempted to force Mithridates into releasing the territory back to their respective kings urging the king of Bithynia to retaliate by invading Pontus and seizing loot to give to Rome. By 90 B.C., however, Mithridates had successfully defeated the king before attacking Pergamon and killing a Roman envoy. During 89‚Äì88 B.C. Mithridates further expanded his territory by peacefully incorporating many Greek city-states within Asia Minor into his kingdom and Greece itself sought his assistance in freeing itself from Roman rule. In 88 B.C., Mithridates had the Romans and Italic peoples residing in his kingdom and those that were within Asia Minor and Greece, including at Ephesus, Pergamon, Adramyttium, Caunus, Tralles and others, massacred in what is now called the \\"Asiatic Vespers\\". The Roman response to this was immediate and Mithridates was defeated in 85 B.C. by Sulla and pushed out of Greece the following year in the First Mithridatic War. Kohn challenges this assertion slightly, suggesting that a Roman General, Fimbria, had defeated Mithridates in 84 B.C. while Sulla and his army defeated the Greeks, who had allied themselves with Mithridates, in 85 B.C. A few years later a Roman General Murena invaded Mithridate's land, sparking the Second Mithridatic War, in the Kizil Irmak River area. Mithridates emerged victorious in this encounter around 82 B.C. During the 70s B.C. Mithridates came to further blows with Rome now against the Roman General Lucullus who forced Mithridates out of Pontus. Mithridates was now forced to flee to Armenia where he sought refuge with his son-in-law, King Tigranes I \\"the Great\\" of Armenia, who after refusing to surrender to the Romans was also be invaded by Lucullus and his army. Tigranocerta fell to the Romans during this campaign after a battle in the autumn of 69 B.C., the following year Lucullus attempted to continue the subjugation of Armenia, however, his army was unprepared for the mountainous region and climate. A second battle occurred at Artaxata in 68 B.C. where Mithridates was again be defeated. Despite this Lucullus and his army was forced to retreat to the Euphrates Valley. In 66 B.C., Lucullus was recalled to Rome and Pompey took over the command. Armenia was subdued the same year. Finally in 64-63 B.C., Pompey pushed Mithridates into the Crimean peninsula where he committed suicide ending the Third Mithridatic War. =Gaius Antonius Hybrida= In 87 B.C., Gaius (or Caius) Antonius Hybrida accompanied Sulla during his campaign to Greece as a military tribune. Sulla himself had left Rome, after ending an uprising in Rome, to face the Mithridatic Greek armies commanded by Archelus and Aristion in Greece and laid siege to Athens. Following this campaign, while Sulla returned to Rome, Hybrida remained behind with a small cavalry contingent to levy contributions from the province of Achaea. Several years later, in 76 B.C., Caesar had Hybrida prosecuted for his offence, the latter, however, failed to appear and the charges were dropped until in 70 B.C. Hybrida was ousted from the Senate for his crimes. In 64 B.C, Hybrida was nominated for the position of consul alongside Lucius Sergius Catilina and Cicero. Cicero and Hybrida were eventually elected to hold the positions of consul for the following year. Cicero made a move to make a deal with Hybrida; Hybrida was to be given the governorship-elect of the province of Macedonia, which was supposed to have been Cicero's at the end of the consulship, in exchange for granting Cicero sole power to rule over the Roman Republic. Towards the end of 63 B.C., Hybrida went into Etruria with the intention of assisting the praetor Quintus Metellus Celer in capturing Catiline and his men, however, during this campaign Hybrida handed over command of the army to his Lieutenant, Marcus Petreius. Hybrida claimed to have been suffering from illness though this may be a fabrication on his part. His Lieutenant, now in command, met Catiline, and approximately 3,000 of his men, in battle emerging victorious having destroyed Catiline's army and killed Catiline. Having adhered to the agreement with Cicero and the Senate, Hybrida was given control of Macedonia where he then began pillaging the province and robbing the provincials. From here Hybrida also started incurring upon barbarian lands in Lower and Upper Moesia. Battle The battle of Histria took place c. 62-61 B.C., between the Bastarnae and Scythians and the Roman Consul (63 B.C.) Gaius Antonius Hybrida near the ancient town of Histria. Dio writes about the battle in his work, \\"Dio's Roman History\\", stating that Hybrida had \\"inflicted many injuries\\" against his subjects during his tenure as Governor of Macedonia. Hybrida's incursions were into Upper and Lower Moesia. Dio writes of one specific event in Book XXXVIII where Hybrida and his men forcefully took the possessions of the \\"Dardanians and their neighbours\\" before retreating away in anticipation of a retaliatory attack from them. Hybrida took the opportunity to flee by pretending to retire his cavalry with his men. This maneuver ultimately failed, however, as Hybrida and his men were surrounded by enemy infantry and forced out of the land losing all of the possessions that they had stolen. Hybrida later tried a similar tactic while in Moesia at Histria but was again defeated, this time by the Bastarnian Scythians, before again fleeing from the site of the battle. The Romans had been under the impression that with Mithridates defeat that the region had been conquered, however, while Hybrida and his men marched to occupy the city of Histria a large cavalry force of Bastarnae attacked them. Hybrida and his cavalry force detached from the main column and retreated away from the site, leaving the Roman infantry to be massacred. Aftermath =Dacian king Burebista= Various accounts draw different starting dates for the reign of Burebista; Jordanes, in his work \\"the origin and deeds of the goths\\" writes that Burebista was the king of the goths during the time of Sulla, without an explicit date, Sulla himself was appointed dictator by the Senate either towards the end of 82 B.C. or at the start of 81 B.C. Grumeza, and Hitchins suggest that Burebista's rule began around 82 B.C. Jones and Ereira suggest that Burebista came to reign over the Dacians around 70 B.C, while Bunson, Middleton, and Schmitts suggest that Burebista's reign started around 60 B.C. Burebista's rule is marked by the unity of the Dacian and Getae peoples and campaigns of expansion throughout the Danube. His campaign of expansion led to the destruction of the Boii, at the time led by Critasiros, and the Taurisci, residing in the approximate regions of modern-day Czech Republic and Slovakia. Further, Burebista led campaigns against the Celts living in Thrace and Illyria, which were likely the Scordisci, raided throughout Thrace and into Roman Macedonia, and subjugated the Greek polis', including Histria, Tomis, Apollonia, Odessos and Dionysopolis amongst others, along the Black Sea. To the north Burebista's campaigns led to the capture and control of the Greek merchant city of Olbia/Olbiopolis thus extending the border of the Dacian kingdom to the western bank of the Bug River. In Pannonia, the Dacians took over the fortified cities of Zemplin and ≈Ωidovar and attacked the Celtic tribes that had expanded their lands towards the Black Sea. The Anarati, Pannoni, and Eravisci were also brought under the rule of the Dacians. Despite these conquests, the Breuci and Sagestani tribes remained defiant and closed off access to the Adriatic from the Dacians. In 48 B.C., Pompey sought the assistance of Burebista in his war against Caesar, however, the Battle of Pharsalus ended any chance of an alliance between the two. After the war with Pompey, Caesar intended to lead a campaign against Burebista and the Dacians, part of a larger campaign planned to go through to Parthia. This plan did not come to fruition as in 44 B.C., both Caesar and Burebista were assassinated. After Burebista's death, a revolt led to the disintegration of the Dacian kingdom into four parts, and, by the time of Augustus, into five parts. =Dacia subjugated= In the time between Tiberius' and Domitian's reigns as Emperor, the activity of the Dacians was minimal. The Dacians had divided into smaller tribes with Burebista's death and posed no substantial threat to the Roman Empire. This once again changed around 85‚Äì86 A.D. with the ascension of Decebalus to the throne when Dacia was once again considered to be a threat to Rome. Decebalus, like Burebista, successfully united the Dacians and earned a reputation as a leader and military commander. His rule saw a new wave of raiding into Moesia, Illyria and Macedonia by the Dacians. This raids were of such intensity and scale that Domitian sent the praetorian prefect Fuscus and a large force to combat the Dacians. Decebalus attempted to draw a peace treaty with Domitian, but, the overconfident Emperor rejected the offer. In the end, Decebalus set up an ambush which saw Fuscus and his forces massacred. This reign of superiority for the Dacians, however, came to an end when Trajan became emperor in 98 A.D. Trajan waged two wars against the Dacians, the first in 101‚Äì102 A.D. which resulted in a peace between Dacia and Rome, but that was not respected by the Dacians and this then culminated in the second war of 105‚Äì106 A.D. The second war ultimately ended in the permanent defeat of the Dacians, the death of Decebalus and a large portion of Dacia being turned into a Roman province.

The film is based on the 1975 novel of the same name written by Laura Z. Hobson (who had written Gentleman's Agreement in 1947).  Plot  Tess and Ken Lynd have been together for 26 years and share two children. Margie, their oldest, is married to Nate, and recently found out that she is pregnant. The youngest child Jeff is off for college and heads the university's swim team. Jeff has had a strained relationship with his parents, especially his father, with whom he constantly argued over trivial matters. One day, Tess receives a letter from her son asking her to contact him. They meet in his university town, where Jeff tells her that he is homosexual. While Tess applauds his bravery, she has trouble processing the news, and the next day contacts her doctor, Mark Waldo, to inquire about any counseling possibilities to \\"show Jeff that he is mistaken.\\" She contacts psychiatrist Dr. Daniels in Seattle, who shares her view that homosexuality is an illness. He tells her that 25% of his patients have returned to heterosexuality after sessions with him. Later, she informs Ken about their son's situation, and he bursts into tears. During a session with the psychiatrist, Jeff reveals that he has been struggling with his sexual orientation for over seven years. Dissatisfied with the sessions, Jeff returns home to see his family, but Ken is not ready to see him and avoids him. Jeff goes to dinner with his mom to discuss his homosexuality. He tells her that he has tried being with girls but does not feel anything romantic, unlike what he feels about a guy on his swim team. Later that night, Tess blasts Ken for avoiding Jeff, but Ken tells her that he simply cannot agree with his son's lifestyle, criticizing liberalism and calling homosexuality \\"unnatural.\\" Jeff starts to realize that his father does not want to see him and angrily leaves. While on his way back to his college, he meets Hank, a man in a diner, who flirts with him. Hank offers him a drive and Jeff nervously accepts. When Hank makes a move, Jeff initially refuses, but eventually gives in. Jeff returns home for Christmas, and tries to be romantic with his neighbor Sue, but quickly realizes that he has no interest in her. He then tells his parents that he has stopped treatment with Dr. Daniels, as he does not believe that his sexual orientation is a disease. During their confrontation, Jeff criticizes his parents for trying to remain in the closet and reveals that he has been sexually involved with men. Ken reaches his boiling point and cuts Jeff off financially. Somewhat later, Jeff witnesses gay bashing in a diner and raises his voice to the offenders. Later he comes out of the closet to his roommate and best friend Pete. Pete calls Jeff out for deceiving him and makes several homophobic remarks, prompting Jeff to move out and move in with his new boyfriend Stu. Suddenly, Ken dies from a stroke. After his funeral, Tess hands Jeff a letter written by his father in which he opens up about his struggle of trying to accept his son's homosexuality. He has written that he is not ready to embrace his lifestyle, but does not intend on giving up his son. Tess tells her friend Claire that she has accepted her son, but does not want to share or witness his lifestyle. In the end, still struggling to cope, she calls her son and tells him she loves him.

Hobson novel in 1975, and first intended on adapting it to a feature film, later on as a television film, but with no results. He picked up the project again in 1979 with David Lawrence.\\"'Consenting Adult' As Gay Son\\" by Lee Margulies, Los Angeles Times, January 31, 1985. Retrieved on August 21, 2016. With the support of Martin Starger, the project was finally picked up by ABC in late 1983. On her decision to take on the female lead, Marlo Thomas said: \\"\\"I thought [Tess] acted so much the way most mothers would act. She wanted to fix it. She got her kid through chicken pox and other problems and she'd fix this too. I was also struck by the broader implications of the film. It's also about unconditional love.\\" In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Aghayan drew comparisons with another LGBT-related made-for-tv movie, That Certain Summer (1972): \\"At the end of That Certain Summer, the father cries and apologizes to the son. The son here really accepts his homosexuality and thinks it's terrific. There is an unguilty, positive attitude to this film.\\" Reception Tom Shales criticized the film for seeming \\"a bit dated\\", and wrote that the film instead could have been more daring by focusing on AIDS. In the reviewer's opinion, the problem lay with screenwriter John McGreevy having to not depict homosexuality too negatively for concerns of offending the gay community, all while not depicting it too positively either, for concerns of offending the \\"Bible Belt\\". He credited Barry Tubb with doing \\"his best to humanize a character who is largely a symbol\\", while calling Marlo Thomas a \\"formidable actress\\", yet criticized Martin Sheen for being \\"miscast\\".\\"'Consenting Adult' Is Not Of Age by Tom Shales, Chicago Tribune, February 4, 1985.

He was a four-time Australian national champion who won the double sculls event at the 1938 British Empire Games and competed in the single sculls at the 1936 Olympics. Sporting pedigree Cecil Pearce was born in Woollahra Sydney, Australia, into a family with an extraordinary sporting pedigree. His great-grandfather emigrated from England in 1850 and settled in Double Bay, in Sydney's harbourside district, where he worked as a fisherman and ran a boatshed. Pearce's grandfather Henry John \\"Harry\\" Pearce, Sr. was an Australian champion in sculling. Harry Pearce had five sons and seven daughters. One of those daughters (Cecil's aunt) was a New South Wales swimming champion. Cecil Pearce's father Sandy Pearce, was a national rugby league representative inducted into that sport's Australian Hall of Fame. Cecil's brother Sid Pearce also played rugby league for Australia. Cecil's son Gary Pearce would row in three Olympic games from 1964 to 1972. Cecil's uncle, Henry J \\"Harry, Jr\\" Pearce Jr., was an Australian sculling champion and challenged for the world championship twice (in 1911 and 1913), losing to Richard Arnst (NZL) and Ernest Barry (GBR) respectively. Harry's son Bobby Pearce (Cecil's cousin and eight years his senior) was the most accomplished rower in the family. Bobby - a sculler like Cecil - was a three-time world champion (1933, 1934 and 1938); twice Olympic champion (1928 and 1932); three time Australian national champion; and won the Diamond Sculls at Henley in 1931. Bobby Pearce. sports-reference.com Club and state rowing Cecil Pearce's took up rowing at age eighteen and rowed from the Balmain Rowing Club. He was first selected as the New South Wales state entrant to contest the President's Cup - the interstate single sculls championship - at the 1936 Interstate Regatta. He won that title in 1936 and then won the event in 1937, 1938 and 1939. International representative rowing Pearce's chief Australian and New South Wales rival early in his career was Herb Turner. Although Turner was the 1935 Australian single-sculls champion, Pearce beat him in selection trials for the 1936 Summer Olympics. Pearce was chosen as the single sculler and Turner was selected to row the double scull with Pearce. The rowing selectors also nominated Pearce and Turner in a double scull. However the AOF selection committee preferred to see Pearce focus on the single and Turner rowed the double with the Bill Dixon the reserve for the men's eight. In Berlin Pearce finished fourth in his heat , then second in the repechage and failed to reach the final. For the 1938 British Empire Games the selection intrigue was reversed. Pearce was the Australian national champion but Turner beat him in trials for the single sculls selection. Pearce rowed the double sculls event at the Empire Games in Sydney, with William Bradley and won a gold medal. War service In WWII Pearce served as a sergeant in the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in 1943 just before his 30th birthday and was discharged at the war's end.Pearce at WWII Nominal Roll References 1914 births 2002 deaths Olympic rowers of Australia Rowers at the 1936 Summer Olympics Australian male rowers Commonwealth Games medallists in rowing Commonwealth Games gold medallists for Australia Rowers at the 1938 British Empire Games ","title":"Cecil Pearce"},{"id":"51380063","text":"Owen's laminated organ, named after the 19th century English biologist Richard Owen, is one of two secondary sexual organs of the female of the genus Nautilus.

Aged 17, he embarked in Port-Louis (Morbihan) as second surgeon on board the ship La Force. He landed in Daman, Portuguese India, in 1673 and had serious problems with the Portuguese Inquisition. Back in France, he completed his studies and entered the service of Prince de Conti. He later married the daughter of a wealthy butcher and settled in Paris, where he died around 1710. The work for which he is known, Relation de l'lnquisition de Goa, published for the first time in 1687 in Leiden and in 1688 in Paris, was a great success, immediately translated into German, English and Dutch and reedited several times during the 18th century. In this book, Dellon narrates his trial and incarceration by the Portuguese Inquisition in Goa, Daman and later in Brazil and Lisbon, totaling 18 months. He was accused of denying the validity of baptism and having blasphemed against the adoration of a crucifix, and in addition to having criticized the Inquisition. He was excommunicated, saw all his property confiscated, and was sentenced to five years of galleys. This story had an enormous influence on later writers, such as Voltaire, who drew inspiration in his Candide. Dellon also wrote Relation d'un voyage des Indes orientales and Trait√© des maladies particuli√®res aux pays orientaux.  References   Sources  L'Inquisition de Goa.
