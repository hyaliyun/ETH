This task was largely finished when high resolution images of the near and far sides of the Moon were obtained by orbiting spacecraft during the early space era.

The settlement is located on the easternmost shore of Desoto Lake, an oxbow lake. Prior to 1942, Desoto Lake was part of the contiguous Mississippi River, and Sunflower Landing was a riverport on the eastern shore of Sunflower Bend. History A commission appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 determined that Sunflower Landing was the \\"most likely\\" place where explorer Hernando de Soto and his expedition crossed the Mississippi River in 1541. It was theorized that de Soto and his men spent a month building flatboats near Sunflower Landing, then crossed the river at night to avoid the Native Americans who were patrolling the river, and with whom de Soto had previously hostile relations. More recent research suggests other Mississippi locations may have also been the site of de Soto's crossing. By 1838, Sunflower Landing was a well known steamboat landing. In 1863, the Bolivar Troop, a Confederate States Army company of the First Regiment Mississippi Cavalry, under the command of Frank A. Montgomery, engaged in a land skirmish with about 250 Union troops at Sunflower Landing. Union soldiers had been removing slaves and taking cotton from farms in the vicinity. A post office operated under the name Sunflower Landing from 1857 to 1892. In 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers removed Sunflower Bend from the course of the Mississippi River.

Hassan was still pursuing her primary education during her training for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Hassan started as an association football player, and in 2012 changed to athletics. She began running competitively at the urging of a friend.  Athletics career  Hassan was selected to compete as an \\"Independent Olympic Athlete,\\" a designation for athletes who are unable to compete under their nation's flag, at the 2014 Youth Olympics held in Nanjing, China.

The definition of a \\"home state\\" for purposes of such an advantage can be complicated by the fact that candidates may be born and raised in one state and achieve political success in a different state before seeking national elected office. While many successful candidates have won the presidency without winning their birth state, only four (James K. Polk, Woodrow Wilson, Richard Nixon,Nixon, a lifelong Californian, had taken residence in New York after his failed run for the California governor's office. and Donald Trump) have won election despite losing their state of residence. Polk is the only man to win the presidency but lose both states of birth and residence with those being two different states. The perception that a home state advantage can deliver votes in an important state has also influenced presidential nominees in the selection of a running mate.Christopher J. Devine, Kyle C.

Their bodies consist of mesoglea, a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick. They have two basic body forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps, both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration. Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp- like zooids, or both (hence they are trimorphic).http://www.iws.ie/_fileupload/advice/id_card_for_website.pdf Cnidarians found in Ireland and Irish waters include sea pens, sea anemones, hydroids, sea jellies (\\"jellyfish\\") and corals.

Notice the low set window. Only one Saab 401 hovercraft was built. SaabO is a travel trailer created and manufactured by Saab from 1964-1968 in Ljunga, outside Norrk√∂ping, Sweden. The project was started by Bo Bjernekull of the Ljunga plant and Birger Lindberg at Saab in Link√∂ping. Officially they were working on a project called MEFAN that was supposed to produce hovercrafts for the military. Unofficially they made a camper caravan. The idea was to get a product to even out the workload at the helicopter department, that at the time mainly assembled helicopters manufactured in France. After making a model in 1:10 scale they received the OK for production. A first prototype was made at Fisks√§tra boatyard and the pre- production prototypes at Marieholms Bruk. The first prototypes were made without brakes, but these were soon added. It was important to keep the weight down as the caravan would be used with automobiles with as little as 25 hp (19 kW), like the 38 hp (28 kW) two stroke Saab 96. Another reason to save weight was that Swedish regulation at the time allowed unrestricted speed with a caravan if the weight was low enough. The SaabO included space enough for a family of four, or five (with bunk). It was designed with low-set, large windows so the driver of the vehicle could see through them when looking through the rear-view mirror. The interior consisted of two sofas, a dining table, galley sink and two wardrobes. Liquified petroleum gas was used for cooking, heating and lighting. The design was made with two half shells of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) enclosing an insulation of folded cardboard. The SaabO had large, low set front and rear windows so the driver of the towing vehicle could look right through it in the rear view mirror. At least 438 SaabOs were made.

Savage was convicted partly due to Coleman's testimony. In return Savage ordered the house of Coleman's mother in North Philadelphia to be burned down. At the time Savage was in custody at FDC Philadelphia. At about 5 ‚Å†a.m. on October 9, 2004, the rowhouse was firebombed.

Writing for The New York Times, Nikil Saval called Chapo Trap House and its hosts \\"prime originators of the left's liberal-bashing.\\" The Pacific Standard noted: > Contemporary conservatism is the butt of many jokes on Chapo, but the > harshest critiques are often saved for the Democratic Party (and for > contemporary liberalism more generally). Chapo has managed to strip away the > layers standard of political discourse to highlight the brutality behind > policies like \\"double-tap\\" airstrikes and for-profit health care. Biederman said the show's audience is seeking alternatives to liberal media, which he calls \\"the dominion of either upper-middle-class smugness when it's even the least bit funny and insufferable self-righteousness when it's even the least bit conscious.\\" Similarly, Christman said that leftist perspectives in media tend toward either the \\"smug above-it-all snark of The Daily Show or the quaver-voiced earnestness of, like, Chris Hedges or something. Neither of those models offer the visceral thrill of listening to people who actually give a shit (as opposed to the wan liberalism of people who are mostly interested in showing how much smarter they are than Republicans).\\" Menaker has said that Chapo is meant to be in \\"marked contrast to the utterly humorless and bloodless path that leads many people with liberal or leftist proclivities into the trap of living in constant fear of offending some group that you're not a part of, up to and including the ruling class.\\" The Bell House in New York City in 2017 Chapo Trap House is dense with inside jokes and hyper-specific references to ongoing political discussion on Twitter. The hosts are associated with Twitter communities called \\"Left Twitter\\" and \\"Weird Twitter\\", a name used to describe a loose group of Twitter users known for absurdist humor. =Format and availability= An episode of Chapo Trap House is typically between 60 and 80 minutes. Episodes are usually structured with a prepared \\"cold open\\", an interview with a guest, and commentary on current events. In post-production, relevant audio samples are interspersed into the episode's discussion. The theme song‚Äîand inspiration for the show's title‚Äîis \\"SALUTE 2 EL CHAPO PART 1\\" by DJ Smokey. The show has a reading series which usually features texts by conservative and neoliberal writers, such as Ross Douthat, Steven Seagal, Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager, and Rod Dreher. Weekly free episodes of the show are available via SoundCloud, Spotify, and iTunes, among other services. Subscribers who contribute at least $5 per month via Patreon gain access to additional weekly premium bonus episodes. By May 2017, the show generated over $60,000 a month from subscribers, and is as of February 2020 the highest-grossing user on Patreon, earning nearly $160,000 per month. Geek.com cited the show's premium content as an example of a viable revenue model for new podcasters.  History  =Background and formation= The three founding hosts met online through discussions on Twitter years prior to starting the podcast. Under the usernames @willmenaker (Menaker); @cushbomb (Christman); and @ByYourLogic (Biederman, also formerly @swarthyvillain), they developed followings for their political commentary and have been called \\"minor Twitter celebrities.\\" All had been politically motivated for several years. The three first recorded together as guests on an episode of the podcast Street Fight Radio to mock the film 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.2 22 2016 - Bryan Interviews Will, Matt, and Felix About Seeing 13 Hours : The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi in Theaters, Street Fight Radio, 2016-02-22 They had already discussed hosting a show together for some time, and, encouraged by positive reception to their Street Fight appearances, they created Chapo Trap House. They chose the name Chapo Trap House in the first episode as a joking reference to the Mexican drug lord Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n and a slang term for a drug house, intending the title to sound like the title of a rap mixtape. =Early years= The show came to prominence during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primary contest between former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and United States Senator Bernie Sanders. The show's left-wing content became popular with supporters of the democratic socialist Sanders. The team behind the podcast has since expanded from the original three hosts. Brendan James joined as producer after appearing as a guest, and journalists Virgil Texas and Amber A'Lee Frost joined the show as alternating co-hosts after the 2016 American presidential election. James left the show in November 2017, later being replaced by producer and writer Chris Wade. =The Chapo Guide to Revolution = Biederman, Christman, James, Menaker, and Texas authored a satirical book about American politics, The Chapo Guide to Revolution: A Manifesto Against Logic, Facts, and Reason, published in August 2018 under the name Chapo Trap House. It debuted on The New York Times Best Seller list at number 6 under the Hardcover Non-Fiction category and number 7 under the Combined Print & E-Book category. = 2020 election = During the 2020 United States presidential election cycle, Chapo Trap House interviewed Democratic presidential candidates Marianne Williamson, Andrew Yang, John Delaney, Joe Sestak, Tom Steyer, and Bernie Sanders. In February 2020, The New York Times profiled the group's large live shows in early Democratic Party primary states, noting that they had \\"morphed into a touring political rally,\\" for the election of Bernie Sanders.  Reception  Avid fans of Chapo Trap House are called Grey Wolves, a satirical reference to the neo-fascist, nationalist Turkish movement of the same name. Many fans credit the show for introducing them to political organizing. A review of the second episode in The A.V. Club called the show \\"tremendously funny\\" and said \\"it feels like an absolutely essential listen.\\" The reviewer cautioned prospective listeners that the show's left political perspective and amateur audio quality are \\"not for everyone,\\" but said the hosts' \\"energy and desire to improve the political landscape of this country is not only unparalleled, but also contagious: if listening to this podcast doesn't make you want to become a more politically engaged person, it's hard to imagine what will.\\" A subsequent A.V. Club review of the seventh episode noted the show's marked improvements in audio quality and the hosts' newfound confidence and flow in discussion, while retaining the \\"raw energy and urgency that has fueled the show from the get-go.\\" The publication eventually named the episode of the show following the election of Donald Trump one of the best individual podcast episodes of the year 2016. Mediaite called the show \\"consistently, absurdly funny and impressively literate on the diverse subjects it tackles,\\" citing the hosts' \\"breadth of awareness about (seemingly) everything that's been published in every media outlet for the past few decades, and a depth of knowledge on various, arcane subjects.\\" Paste described the show as \\"not deliberately offensive, but unapologetically honest ... so hilarious and delightfully vulgar I can barely stand it.\\" Pacific Standard noted, \\"Whether you think Chapo Trap House and its fans are bullies or righteously hilarious seems to come down to whether you think calling a Washington Post reporter 'smooth brain' is an acceptable move within the political discourse.\\" The Irish Times commended its \\"more bracing and venomous approach to politics\\" than other podcasts and named the show one of the best podcasts of 2016. The Advocate praised the show for its \\"scathing, hilarious, erudite analysis on politics and media from a far-left perspective,\\" and favorably analogized the thrill of listening to how Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh make their right-wing fans feel. Comedy website Splitsider recommended the episode featuring video editor Vic Berger, who did an in-depth interview about his surreal Vine and YouTube shorts covering the 2016 presidential election season. In a 2016 column, Robby Soave of libertarian magazine Reason criticized the show as \\"apparently a group therapy session for Bernie bros.\\" Soave wrote in reaction to host Will Menaker commenting on one of his tweets, saying that he believed Menaker had a hypocritical view of free-speech rights, and said the hosts \\"would gleefully applaud the silencing of everyone to their right.\\" Soave later appeared as a guest on a premium episode of the podcast, \\"17 ‚Äì The Road to Soavedom\\", in which he debated the hosts on freedom of speech in the media and the viability of public education. The 2019 role-playing video game Disco Elysium features voice-acting cameos from Biederman, Christman, Menaker, and Texas. The creators of the game, Studio ZA/UM, lauded the podcast on Twitter, saying they had been \\"huge [Chapo] fans since the beginning\\". = Political influence = In March 2019, it was revealed former US Senator from Alaska Mike Gravel filed for an exploratory committee regarding a possible 2020 presidential campaign after being convinced to run by students David Oks, Henry Williams, and Elijah Emery, who learned about Gravel from Chapo Trap House. Gravel's formerly dormant Twitter account soon went viral after being used by the students to attack various politicians, including Democrats Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris, in an effort to move discussion of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates leftward. The Mike Gravel campaign performed an AMA on the r/Chapotraphouse subreddit on April 8, the day the campaign officially launched. Italian weekly news magazine L'espresso attributed Chapo Trap House viewership with rising membership in the Democratic Socialists of America throughout early 2019, saying the podcast is real and physical program, which is bringing thousands of young Americans to subscribing themselves to the DSA: the young Democratic Socialists of America.\\" = Controversies = During the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, The New York Times wrote about the Chapo Trap hosts' characterizations of candidates challenging Vermont Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, the hosts' preferred candidate. The hosts called supporters of former Vice President Joe Biden \\"gelatinous 100-year-olds\\"; referred to former Mayor Pete Buttigieg as \\"a bloodless asexual\\"; and said former Mayor Michael Bloomberg should lose \\"so badly that this midget gremlin won't even have a shot even with a trillion dollars.\\" When the hosts mentioned the name of Massachusetts Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren during a live event, the crowd hissed in reference to the snake emoji sent to Warren and her supporters on social media after a public disagreement with Sanders over whether he had said a woman could not win the presidency in a private 2018 meeting. According to the article, \\"the Sanders campaign maintains a close relationship with the podcast. His senior adviser, David Sirota, and his national press secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, have also been on the podcast.\\" Describing the podcast's simultaneous intense criticism of the Warren candidacy and its associations with the Sanders campaign, Zach Beauchamp of Vox wrote, \\"If Sanders's fans are really serious about helping their guy, they need to think carefully about whether what they're doing is actually working.\\" On June 29, 2020, Reddit banned the unofficial Chapo Trap House subreddit, citing violations of Reddit's new community guidelines and the subreddit's persistent failure to moderate rule-breaking content. The hosts of Chapo Trap House have frequently repudiated this subreddit as well.

Gathering items along the riverbanks, she fashioned them into decorative ornaments or useful items and sold them in and around Swan Hill. Widely known she was honored by several local ceremonies. Works attributed to her are featured in the Museum of Victoria in Melbourne. Early life Agnes Crow was born about 1873 at Mellool Station, New South Wales, Australia, located between Moulamein, NSW and Swan Hill, Victoria to Sarah and Jim Crow, who was a worker at the station. They were of the Edward River Wati Wati people. Around 1890, Aggie, as she was known, married, probably in a traditional arrangement, Harry Edwards, an older Muti Muti aborigine. Mid-life Edwards was widely known in the area as Queen Aggie having been introduced to the governor, Lord Hopetoun, in 1897 and later shown in 1902 a photograph of her \\"crowning ceremony\\" taken near Swan Hill. After her parents died in 1898, the couple moved to a campsite about forty kilometers north of Swan Hill on the Edward River. In the area, which became known as Aggie's Swamp, they and other aborigines operated a changing station for horses on the Cobb and Co's Balranald route. In addition, Edwards earned a living from fishing, trapping and selling eggs, as well as from handcrafted goods, which she sold on weekends in Swan Hill. Using a canoe to gather duck eggs and feathers, Edwards collected items along the banks of the Murray River. Edwards provided feathers for the turn-of-the-century fashion trend of highly-decorative feathered hats. Her hand-made crafts included feather flowers, drawstring purses made from rat skins, reed mats, baskets and feather fishing lures. Her use of colour and sense of design and style were widely recognized, as her decorations adorned homes and became part of museum collections. Seven arrangements of feather flowers attributed to Aggie are held by the Museum of Victoria in Melbourne. Edwards maintained her independence and homestead on the Murray River until her death, though in her later years, she utilized ration distribution programs to supplement her living. From around 1912, after Harry's death, Aggie lived alone. She and Bob Nicholls were known as partners, but each maintained their own separate living quarters. Death and legacy Edwards died on 17 November 1928 on her homestead and was buried in Swan Hill Cemetery. The local Australian Natives' Association erected a tombstone to honor her. In 1988, to address the disparity of women's biographies in Australian history, the Australian Bicentennial Authority pressed for inclusion of more women and began collecting histories on notable women. Edwards along with other noted Australian women were featured in an article in The Age to highlight the drive.

He was the founder and chairman of Guardsmark, a privately owned security company with a payroll of 17,000 employees and 130 offices in the United States, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and France. In 2015, he sold Guardsmark to Universal Protection Service, the largest private security company in the United States, and he served as its vice chairman until its 2016 merger with AlliedBarton. He was called \\"a pioneer in the private security guard business\\". His work was cited by the United States Department of Justice's Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. He supported the arts in Memphis, Tennessee and Judeo-Christian interfaith dialogue in the United States. Early life Ira A. Lipman was born November 15, 1940. His father, Mark Lipman, was the founder of Mark Lipman Service, a private investigation company, and the author of the 1975 book Stealing: How America's Employees Are Stealing Their Companies Blind. His mother was Belle Ackerman. He was a member of Aleph Zadik Aleph. Lipman was educated at the Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. While he was in high school, Lipman acted as an anonymous source to journalist John Chancellor, who was covering desegregation. Business career Lipman founded Guardsmark, a security company, in 1963. He initially founded the company to provide hospitals and factories with a better security services organization. Within a year, in 1964, he had under 100 employees. He served as its president and chairman from 1970 to 2015. In 1971, Lipman disagreed with City College of New York Professor Lawrence Zeitlin's research, which showed companies would save money by letting good employees steal. Instead, he argued that companies should cut costs by investing in good security to prevent theft. Lipman believed most theft occurred as a result to addiction to narcotics, and the best way for companies to end this would be to hire undercover security agents, as employees would be more likely to confess to them than policemen. By 1973, Lipman expanded his business to shoplifting prevention, especially in the Southeastern United States. Meanwhile, in 1972, after President Richard Nixon laid off 1,100 federal airport security agents, Lipman argued that they should be replaced with private armed guards who should be present in airports at all times. Moreover, Lipman suggested that airport security could be improved if frequent travelers carried with them special cards, as airport security would then focus on irregular travelers and significantly reduce the risks of skyjacking. He added that passengers should be required to go through metal detectors, their carry-on luggage should be searched, and landing ramps should be equipped with closed-circuit television camera. By 1976, Lipman's company handled security for 20 airports in the United States. Lipman expanded his business to home security in 1973, initially in Memphis, Houston, New Haven, Connecticut and Concord, California. Meanwhile, he also expanded his business to patrolling entire neighborhoods, the first of which was Belle Meade, Tennessee. By then, he had 3,500 employees active in 35 cities across the United States. A decade later, in 1983, Lipman argued that neighborhood security guards needed \\"walkies-talkies, close- circuit cameras, electronic fences, bullet-proof glass, card-key systems\\", but no guns, adding \\"They are more of a threat to society by having a gun.\\". Lipman expanded his business further with bodyguard protection for high-net- worth individuals by 1974. He argued that this was necessary to prevent kidnappings. Lipman authored a book about security entitled How To Protect Yourself From Crime: Everything You Need To Know To Guard Yourself, Your Family, Your Home, Your Possessions, And Your Business in 1975. A 1981 report from the United States Department of Justice's Law Enforcement Assistance Administration quoted Lipman's advice that having a dog in the house was an efficient deterrent for burglaries. Meanwhile, in a 1988 lecture at the Institute of Criminal Justice and Criminology of the University of Maryland, College Park, Lipman suggested private security firms should have access to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's criminal records to weed out felons and individuals with mental health. Lipman's business increased in the wake of the 1995 Oklahoma city bombing. On September 11, 2001, Lipman instructed his employees to evacuate floors 48th to 52nd of the One Liberty Plaza, adjacent to the World Trade Center. Within a year, Lipman supported the Private Security Officer Employment Standards Act, a 2002 bill proposed by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan. Don Walker, the chairman and CEO of Pinkerton and chair of the American Society for Industrial Security, suggested Lipman had worked with Levin in \\"a cloud of secrecy\\". In 2004, Lipman's opinion pieces published in The New York Times as early as 1980 were discussed by the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. By 2014, the company had an annual revenue of US$500 million, with 17,000 employees. It had \\"130 offices in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom.\\" In 2015, Lipman sold Guardsmark to Universal Protection Service, making it the largest security company in the United States. Lipman served as its vice chairman until its merger with AlliedBarton in 2016. Lipman was the chairman emeritus of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency. He also served on the board of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, where he was the namesake of the Chair in Emerging Technologies and National Security, currently held by Adam Segal. He is the recipient of the Stanley C. Pace Leadership in Ethics Award from the Ethics Research Center. Lipman was called \\"a pioneer in the private security guard business\\" by The New York Times. He was also called a \\"pioneer\\" by Don Walker, the chairman and CEO of Pinkerton. Lipman was a shareholder of Contemporary Media, Inc., which owns Memphis: The City Magazine. Philanthropy and art collection Lipman served on the boards of trustees of the Brooks Memorial Art Gallery and the Memphis Academy of Arts as well as on the Advisory Council of the Chickasaw Council Boy Scouts of America. He established the Alexis de Tocqueville Chapter of the United Way of Memphis in 1984, and he led its fundraising campaigns in 1985-1986. In 1992, he was elected to the board of governors of the United Way of America. In 1995, he endowed the annual $50,000 John Chancellor Award. He served on the board of trustees of Ohio Wesleyan University, from 1988 to 1997. Lipman was appointed as the vice president of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in 1992. He subsequently served as its chairman. He was appointed as the vice president of the International Council of Christians and Jews in 1992. He served as the Honorary Life Chairman of the National Conference for Community and Justice. He served as an officer of the American Jewish Historical Society in 1994-1995. With his wife, he donated a Torah scroll to Yeshiva University in 2007. He served on the board of trustees of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Lipman collected paintings by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Mary Cassatt. Personal life Lipman's wife, Barbara, established the Barbara K. Lipman Early Childhood School Research Institute at the University of Memphis. They had three sons, Gus, who served as Senior Vice President of Guardsmark, Joshua, and M Benjamin.

There have also been major gun policies that affected American opinion in the 1990s. Throughout these polling years there are different gun control proposals that show promise for bipartisan action. Over the years listed there have been major tragedies that have affected public opinion. Most of the tragedies are school shootings. There have also been a growth in states around the United States taking more drastic measures on gun control. As of late February and early March 2018, a majority of Americans support stricter gun laws, including wide support for universal background check and mandatory waiting periods for gun purchases and including support for banning assault weapons, adding felons and mental illness patients to background check systems, and prohibiting sales of guns to persons under 21 years old. History =1990s= In the 1990s, public support for gun control led then- president Bill Clinton to sign into law the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which remained in force for ten years thereafter before expiring. Another measure by the Clinton Administration was the Brady Bill. This bill was enacted on November 30, 1993 and the main purpose was to create a waiting period for handgun purchases. The bill enacted makes a person subject to a background check when they are trying to purchase a firearm from a federal dealer, manufacturer, and also an importer. Background checks are run through the FBI and go through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System(NICS). Other features of the Brady Bill are also prohibiting transporting firearms if a person falls under certain criteria made under the bill and prohibiting firearm possession if a person has a felonious charge. A 1995 poll found that 58% of Americans were worried the government would not do enough to regulate guns, while only 35% of Americans reported worrying the government would regulate them too much. =2012= A Pew Research Center poll conducted shortly after the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting found that 47% of Americans thought controlling gun ownership was more important than protecting the rights of Americans to own guns, while 46% thought the opposite. Six days after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012, another Pew Research Center poll found that 49% of Americans believed that controlling gun ownership was more important than protecting gun rights, while 42% of Americans believed the opposite. This trend of sticker gun control policy could be seen by a Galluppoll that was taken in December 2012. With the question being \\"In general, do you feel that the laws covering the sale of firearms should be made more strict, less strict or kept as they are now?\\" there was a result of (58%) of respondents believing in stricter laws, a (6%) view of less strict, and lastly (34%) believing to keep laws the same. This marked the first time more Americans supported gun control more than gun rights since President Barack Obama took office in 2009. =2015= A poll conducted by CBS News and New York Times in October 2015 found that 92% of Americans supported universal background checks for all gun sales. Pew Research Center poll in August 2015 can be looked at as well for asking surveyors based on partisan lines about background checks for gun shows and private sales. Polling from the research center show that Republicans (79%) and Democrats (88%) want background checks for gun show transactions and private sales. This bipartisan view also is expanded upon for barring mentally ill stricken people from obtaining a firearm with Democrats being (81%) and Republicans being (79%) in favor of this gun control proposal. While there is a more concise statistical agreement upon background checks for all gun sales there is a growth in people looking at the rights of gun owners. From a Pew Research Center poll that came out in August 2015 there has been a change in opinion on how people view gun rights vs controlling gun ownership. Throughout the various years (2008,2011) of when polling on this topic took place there was a steady stance on the belief that controlling gun ownership should come before gun rights. In the years of 2008 there was a (49%) vs. (45%) poll which favored control of gun ownership, as well as in 2011 there was a concurrent agreement of the last poll but with the numbers of (51%) to (45%). This would change when the polling topic would be surveyed again in 2014 and published in 2015. The poll would show that (52%) would have the view of protecting gun rights to (46%) of people believing to control gun ownership. =2016= After the Orlando nightclub shooting in June 2016, NBC News and the Wall Street Journal released the results of a poll which found that 50% of Americans were more concerned the government would go too far in regulating guns, while 47% of Americans were more concerned that the government would not do enough to regulate guns. A CBS News poll conducted the same month found that 57% of Americans supported a federal assault weapons ban, 13 percentage points higher than a previous poll they conducted in December 2015 (after the San Bernardino shooting.) Also in June 2016, a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that about 90% of Americans supported universal background checks. Later in the year polling about gun control measures were politicized through the 2016 presidential elections. A poll came out in August 2016 by the Pew Research Center based on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump supporters and their stance on gun policy proposals. The research conducted looked at five separate proposals. The five proposals were based on back ground checks, prevention of ownership of firearms with people with mental illness, barring gun ownership from people on a federal watch, creating a federal database on gun-ownership, banning high-capacity ammunition magazines, and lastly banning assault style weapons. The results that came from the poll show that on the proposal on background checks Trump's supporters are (75%) supportive of this proposal and (90%) supported by Hillary supporters. With the proposal of preventing firearms to people with mental illnesses there is a similar belief by both party supporters in support. Trump supporters are in (82%) and Hilary supporters are (83%) support. The next proposal on barring gun ownership on federal watch and terror lists also show similar support for barring gun ownership for people with mental illness. For Trump supporters they are (72%) support for this proposal while for Hilary supporters it is (80%). After the first three proposals there is a growth in the disparity on how candidate supporters view gun control measures. The federal data base gun control proposal shows a 39-point disparity. While Hillary supporters show an 85% support for a federal database there is only a 46% support in the Trump supporter group. In the next two gun control proposals there is a consistency between Trump supporters with a (34%) favorability. Hilary supporters have a favorability for the last two proposals with a (75%) and then (74%). =2017= On October 11, 2017, ten days after a mass shooting in Las Vegas killed 58 people, a Politico/Morning Consult poll was released. It found that 64% of Americans support stricter gun laws, while 29% opposed them. Support was higher among Democrats (83%) than among independents (58%) and Republicans (49%). Another topic that came up in the discussion of gun control is the question of should teachers be armed in the classroom for school shooting scenarios. A Pew Research Center poll was conducted in March and April of that year. The results looked a range of adults such as parents and non parents, gun owners and non-gun owners, and lastly on partisan lines. The survey came back to show that all adults (55%) opposed teacher having guns while (45%) favored. In the category of parents and non parents there was more favorably to oppose teachers having guns in the classroom. Parents opposing would represent (53%) and non-parents (56%). The category of gun-owners and non- gunowners show that gun owners would support the measure with the result of (66%) and among non-gun owners they oppose the measure of teachers having guns (64%). The results that stemmed from the basis of partisan lines was that Republicans (69%) supported the measure and between Democrats (71%) opposed having guns with teachers and officials in schools. =2018= On February 21, 2018, eight days after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting killed 17 people, the surviving students rallied for stricter gun control policies in Tallahassee, Florida, the state's capital and then again asked for the same gun restrictions at a CNN Town Hall later that day. The events led to students across the nation showing their solidarity by walking out of their individual high schools and marching with the survivors. A House Committee vote approved the bill to raise the age from 18 to 21 years old as the minimum age to buy and own a rifle in the state of Florida. As well as, creating a three-day waiting period for all gun purchases. The same bill proposed creating a program which allows teachers who have successfully completed law enforcement training and are deputized by the local county sheriff to carry weapons that are concealed within the classroom, if approved by the school district. In February 2018, 66% of American voters supported stricter gun laws, in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll with a margin of error of +/- 3.4%, the highest level of support measured since 2008. 70% of American adults supported stricter gun laws, according to a CNN poll with a margin of error of +/- 3.7%. 75% of American adults supported stricter gun laws, according to an NPR/Ipsos poll with a margin of error of +/- 3.5%. 65% of Americans support stricter gun laws, according to a CBS News poll with a margin of error of +/- 4%. In March 2018, 67% of Americans supported stricter regulation of firearms sales, according to a Gallup poll with a margin of sampling error of +/- 4% at the 95% confidence level, the highest in any Gallup survey since 1993. On March 14, 2018, many schools around the country took part in the Enough! National School Walkout to protest the NRA and current United States gun laws. The nationwide movement started around 10:00 A.M in each time zone and lasted about 17 minutes, each minute representing a victim of the Stoneman Douglas shooting. During the protest, students from different schools took part in many acts of remembrance such as: holding a moment of silence, reading out the names of the victims, or spelling out the rallying cry of the movement‚Äî\\"Enough.\\" However, several schools around the country did not let the activism go unpunished. Students faced anywhere from 3 hour detention to 5 day suspension for protesting. Following the Santa Fe High School Shooting on May 18, 2018, activists in favor of gun control drew parallels between it and the earlier Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Twitter user Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed in the Stoneman Douglas shooting, cited this incident as part of a pattern, saying \\"Now, we have 8 more children dead and our leadership in Washington has done nothing.\\" Reaction among students from Santa Fe has been more mixed, with some students such as Callie Wylie stating that violence is not a \\"gun problem.\\" A round table hosted by Governor Greg Abott of Texas, involving students, politicians, and activists, focused less on gun control than on \\"greater police presence on school campuses and improved strategies to deal with mental health problems.\\" In greater response to the Stoneman Douglas through an article of CNN that was updated June 13, 2018 there has been a growth in states to respond in how they will control guns in the future. States such as New York, Florida, Nebraska, New Jersey, Washington, Illinois, Vermont, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Connecticut to expand on gun control measures. These measures range from state to state on banning bump stocks, stricter mental health checks, using the legal age to buy a weapon to 21, restricting high capacity firearm magazines to 15 or 10 rounds, and even the measure of city ordinances banning assault style weapons. On the federal level even there was a move by President Donald Trump in March 2018 in prohibiting the sale of bump stocks. Politicians and the public alike have grown increasingly apart in the wake of recent events and tragedies. Many states have started passing legislation to change gun control in America which has led to an increased debate about the topic. Oregon, Washington, Florida, and Rhode Island have all passed legislation that increased gun restrictions in their states in 2018. According to David Owens, these laws all favor ideas presented by Democrats and have been met with backlash from Republicans in the area. On the other side of the coin, two school districts in Connecticut have hired armed guards to be present at the school at all times in order to have an immediate officer on the scene in the event of a shooting. Republicans have supported this idea but Democrats feel that adding more armed people to situations only makes them more dangerous. =2019= In July 2019, the San Diego City Council tentatively approved a new gun safety ordinance that would \\"require gun owners to store guns in a locked container or disable them with a trigger lock when not in use or being worn on their person.\\" City Attorney Mara Elliott proposed the legislation hoping to reduce the number of accidental shootings, children's access to guns, and suicides. According to her data, \\"46% of gun owners in the U.S. who have children do not secure their guns and 73% of youngsters aged 9 and under know where their parents keep their guns.\\" An August 2019 Fox News poll of registered voters found 90% of respondents favored universal background checks, 81% supported taking guns from at-risk individuals, and 67% favored banning assault weapons. Predictors A 2007 study found that an index of individualism and collectivism predicted both gun ownership and attitudes toward gun control in the United States.

His real name was . Biography Ikuta was born in what is now part of the town of Hino, Tottori, and was educated at St Andrew‚Äôs School in Osaka, a school run by the Anglican Church in Japan. In 1898 he converted to Unitarianism. He moved to Tokyo the following year and was accepted into the First Higher School in 1900. He was accepted into the Department of Literature of Tokyo Imperial University in 1903. While in Tokyo, he became friends with Ueda Bin, who suggested his nickname. He graduated in 1906, and after returning briefly to Tottori to get married, moved into rooms provided by Yosano Tekkan and Yosano Akiko in Kojimachi, Tokyo where he taught as an English language instructor at a women‚Äôs college until 1909. This was also the start of his association with women‚Äôs literature, and his literary circle included Okamoto Kanoko, Yamakawa Kikue and Hiratsuka Raicho. In 1909, Ikuta began his translation of Friedrich Nietzsche‚Äôs Thus Spoke Zarathustra into Japanese, which was completed in 1911. The same year, he also assisted Hiratsuka in the publication of her literary magazine Bluestocking. He continued to work on translation of Nietzsche from 1916 through 1929, eventually translating all of Nietzsche‚Äôs works into Japanese. he also translated Homer‚Äôs Odyssey in 1922. Also around this time, he began a correspondence with the socialist Toshihiko Sakai and the anarchist Sakae ≈åsugi. This led to an interest in the works of Karl Marx, and he translated Das Kapital into Japanese in 1919. However, his flirtation with Marxism was short-lived, and he had distanced himself from Marxist ideals by 1923. His interest in anarchism lasted longer, and maintained a correspondence with Takamure Itsue for many years. He translated Dante‚Äôs Divine comedy in 1924. From 1925 to 1930 Ikuta moved to Yuigahama in Kamakura. At some point before this time, he contracted Hansen‚Äôs Disease. he left Kamakura before the physical effects of the disease became apparent, and lived in Shibuya, Tokyo until his death in 1936. His final work was a translation of Dumas‚Äôs Camellia. His grave is at Hase-dera in Kamakura.

In 1887 the club moved to a building vacated by the Orient Bank, which had gone into liquidation, later became part of the Queen's Hotel. In 1924 the building was acquired by a Swiss lady, Jeanne Louisa Burdayron, who operated it as a guest house before it became a hotel.

She worked at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, for most of her career. She started as a computer at the segregated West Area Computing division in 1951. She took advanced engineering classes and, in 1958, became NASA's first black female engineer. After 34 years at NASA, Jackson had earned the most senior engineering title available. She realized she could not earn further promotions without becoming a supervisor. She accepted a demotion to become a manager of both the Federal Women's Program, in the NASA Office of Equal Opportunity Programs and of the Affirmative Action Program. In this role, she worked to influence the hiring and promotion of women in NASA's science, engineering, and mathematics careers. Jackson's story features in the 2016 non-fiction book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Who Helped Win the Space Race. She is one of the three protagonists in Hidden Figures, the film adaptation released the same year. In 2019, Jackson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. In 2020 the Washington, D.C. headquarters of NASA was renamed the Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters.  Personal life  Mary Winston was born on April 9, 1921, to Ella Winston (n√©e Scott) and Frank Winston. She grew up in Hampton, Virginia, where she graduated from the all- black George P. Phenix Training School with highest honors. Mary Jackson earned bachelor's degrees in mathematics and physical science from Hampton University in 1942. She was a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha. Jackson served for more than 30 years as a Girl Scout leader. She was noted in the 1970s for helping African American children in her community create a miniature wind tunnel for testing airplanes. Jackson was married on 18 November 1944 to Levi Jackson, Sr., a sailor in the U.S. Navy, and had two children, Levi Jackson, Jr. and Carolyn Marie Lewis. She died on February 11, 2005, age 83.  Career  Jackson working at a control panel After graduation, Mary Jackson taught mathematics for a year at an African-American school in Calvert County, Maryland. At that time, public schools were still segregated across the South. She also began tutoring high school and college students, which she continued to do throughout her life. By 1943, she had returned to Hampton, where she became a bookkeeper at the National Catholic Community Center there. She worked as a receptionist and clerk at the Hampton Institute's Health Department. She was pregnant during this time and eventually returned home for the birth of her son. In 1951, she became a clerk at the Office of the Chief Army Field Forces at Fort Monroe. Jackson holding a wind tunnel model In 1951, Jackson was recruited by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which in 1958 was succeeded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). She started as a research mathematician, or computer, at the Langley Research Center in her hometown of Hampton, Virginia. She worked under Dorothy Vaughan in the segregated West Area Computing Section. In 1953, she accepted an offer to work for engineer Kazimierz Czarnecki in the Supersonic Pressure Tunnel. The , wind tunnel used to study forces on a model by generating winds at almost twice the speed of sound. Czarnecki encouraged Jackson to undergo training so that she could be promoted to an engineer. She needed to take graduate-level courses in mathematics and physics to qualify for the job. They were offered in a night program by the University of Virginia, held at the all-white Hampton High School. Jackson petitioned the City of Hampton to allow her to attend the classes. After completing the courses, she was promoted to aerospace engineer in 1958, and became NASA's first black female engineer. She analyzed data from wind tunnel experiments and real-world aircraft flight experiments at the Theoretical Aerodynamics Branch of the Subsonic-Transonic Aerodynamics Division at Langley. Her goal was to understand air flow, including thrust and drag forces, in order to improve United States planes. Jackson working at the Langley Research Center Jackson worked as an engineer in several NASA divisions: the Compressibility Research Division, Full-Scale Research Division, High-Speed Aerodynamics Division, and the Subsonic-Transonic Aerodynamics Division. She ultimately authored or co-authored 12 technical papers for NACA and NASA. She worked to help women and other minorities to advance their careers, including advising them how to study in order to qualify for promotions. By 1979, Jackson had achieved the most senior title within the engineering department. She decided to take a demotion in order to serve as an administrator in the Equal Opportunity Specialist field. After undergoing training at NASA Headquarters, she returned to Langley. She worked to make changes and highlight women and other minorities who were accomplished in the field. She served as both the Federal Women's Program Manager in the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs and as the Affirmative Action Program Manager, and she worked to influence the career paths of women in science, engineering, and mathematics positions at NASA. She continued to work at NASA until her retirement in 1985.  Legacy  The 2016 film Hidden Figures recounts the NASA careers of Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Dorothy Vaughan, specifically their work on Project Mercury during the Space Race. The film is based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly. Jackson is portrayed in the film by Janelle Mon√°e. In 2018, the Salt Lake City School Board voted that Jackson Elementary School in Salt Lake City would from then on be officially named after Mary Jackson rather than (as it used to be) after President Andrew Jackson. On June 24, 2020, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine announced that the agency‚Äôs headquarters building in Washington, D.C. will be named after Mary W. Jackson and will be referred to as the Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters.  Awards and honors  * Apollo Group Achievement Award, 1969 * Daniels Alumni Award for Outstanding Service to Disadvantaged Youth * National Council of Negro Women, Inc.

A group of consumers take upon themselves to reduce the price of some good or service, and act collectively. This could include collectively engaging in shoplifting, avoiding paying transit fares or for movie tickets, or calling in sick for work. The targeted service or product is generally considered by activists as being essential and should be available on an equal basis to all people. Critics of autoreduction do not distinguish between this practice and criminal theft or robbery. The action includes various forms of non-payment for goods or services. It can result from refusal to pay for an increase in rent or utilities such as electricity, gas, or water. It may be done with the aim of redistributing goods to those in need.  Historical examples  In Italy, rent strikes are numerous and affected several large cities (Rome, Milan, and Turin) in the mid-1970s. This reappropriation of the proletarian practice was systematized by the autonomous movement and also spoke of immediate communism. In France, this was the case in the rent strike in Sonacotra in 1975. The Autonomia movement in 1977 involved activities of autoreduction, and resulted in the creation of spaces where anti-capitalist principles are popular, among related themes in punk and hardcore music. After a lull in autoreduction practices, there was a renewed interest in it beginning in 2008. The social crisis caused by market speculation appeared to be a favorable environment for its revival. In late 2008, several autoreduction actions were organized by political groups made up of precarious workers, the unemployed, intermittent workers, and students, including in Paris, Rennes, and Grenoble.  Requisitions in supermarkets  Autoreduction may also be applied to food in supermarkets. This action involves shopping for food and refusing to pay. After blocking checkout lanes in protest, a dialogue is initiated with store management. The time for which the checkouts are blocked may represent a loss to the company, as some customers decide to abandon their purchases because of the situation. If management agrees to allow the militants to leave with their shopping carts, it is not legally a flight but extortion. Requisitioned products are then collectively shared or distributed to show the militant and selfless character of the action.  Public transport  Autoreduction in public transportation involves travelling in large numbers via public transit without paying, typically while distributing leaflets to other passengers, with the aim of making public transport free. This approach has an ecological dimension, as making public transport free would encourage its use and reduce private vehicle travel, thereby reducing pollution. This type of action has been used by environmentalist movements such as the Camp for Climate Action.

The bill would \\"provide that it is unlawful to knowingly distribute a private, visual depiction of a person‚Äôs intimate parts or of a person engaging in sexually explicit conduct, with reckless disregard for the person's lack of consent to the distribution.\\" The bill was introduced by Representative Jackie Speier in 2016. The proposed law explicitly would not forbid the use of such images in reports to law enforcement, the courts, corrections officers, intelligence services, nor in other cases of public interest (perhaps including responses to a public health problem). The definition of \\"sexually explicit\\" is inherited from existing laws, and \\"reckless\\" is to be interpreted by prosecutors. Interactive computer platform providers (such as Wikimedia or Facebook) are not considered violators of the law if users upload something that violates the law, unless the platform explicitly invites such content. The explicit protection (\\"safe harbor\\") for platform providers (\\"intermediaries\\") may have been inserted in response to requests by Google which had opposed an earlier version of the bill but supports the June 2016 one.

Research Ferrari's research has focused on the diversity of bacteria in the soil. Her studies include both Australia and Antarctica, as well as the Sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island, in collaboration with the Australian Antarctic Division. She and her co-workers have discovered new methods to cultivate soil bacteria in the laboratory, to reveal the breadth of organisms present and to isolate novel and rare bacterial species. Some of her work has studied the effects of diesel pollution on the ecology of Antarctic/Sub-Antarctic soils, including the bacteria and fungi that metabolise pollutants. She is a member of the National Committee for Antarctic Research of the Australian Academy of Science. In 2017, a team of scientists led by Ferrari showed that bacteria could thrive in Antarctica, living only from the hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere. Because the conditions needed for the existence of these microorganisms are so minimal, the study has also cast light on the question of what would be needed for life to exist elsewhere in the universe besides Earth.

She is an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award (ARC DECRA) Fellow in Archaeology. Her research interests include Australian Aboriginal Archaeology, Experimental Archaeology, Landscape Archaeology, Late Pleistocene and Holocene Palaeoecology and Zooarchaeology and she is a specialist in the taphonomic identification of animal bones (native and introduced species) and invertebrate fauna. As well as her research, Garvey teaches undergraduate courses and supervises Honours and Higher Degree in Research (HDR) level, including Archaeology Field School, at La Trobe University. Garvey is a Registered Cultural Heritage Advisor (CHA) with the Office of Aboriginal Affairs Victoria (OAAV) and a current member of the Australian Archaeological Association (AAA); International Council for Archaeozoology (ICAZ); Australasian Quaternary Association (AQUA) and The Royal Society of Victoria (RSV). Education In 1999, Garvey completed a Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science (Hons) with a joint thesis between the Departments of Archaeology and Zoology at La Trobe University. The focus of her thesis was in identifying the fossilized history of a late Holocene assemblage of small mammals in Tasmania. This project involved studying the dietary selectivity of predators and \\"included the role in which Strigiformes (owls) play in the accumulation of small animals in these faunal assemblages\\". \\"Experimental feeding trials of the three owl taxa known to currently inhabit Tasmania\\" were conducted as part of the research in the investigation of regurgitated owl-pellets in determining the source of small animal bones. In 2005, she investigatedhttp://www.worldcat.org/title/early-carboniferous-fossil- assemblage-from-fish-hill-mansfield-basin- australia/oclc/225460734?referer=br&ht;=edition \\"the vertebrate taphonomy, palaeoecology and the depositional environment of an Early Carboniferous (Tournaisian) fossil fish locality, Fish Hill, in the Home Station Member of the Snowy Plains Formation, Mansfield Basin, Australia. This project combined research on the vertebrate fish assemblage, micro vertebrates, ichnology, taphonomy and geology of the locality to develop an overall understanding of the palaeoecology and palaeocommunity\\". This PhD research contributed to improving knowledge on new fish species from the Early Carboniferous in the Mansfield Basin locality. Career Garvey has published on Indigenous Australian Archaeology with an extensive list of academic publications and Research projects in which she has been involved. She has worked on late Quaternary assemblages within South-west Tasmania, Lake Mungo in New South Wales (NSW), Cuddie Springs in New South Wales (NSW), and Murray River in north-west Victoria. Her contributions have included numerous book publications as an editor, reviewer and author and has over 30 published Conference papers nationally and internationally including Society of American Archaeology, International Conference for Zooarchaeology, Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology, Australian Archaeological Association Conference and Conference on Australian Vertebrate Evolution Palaeontology and Systematics (CAVEPS). Ongoing research into the possible causes relating to the extinction of Australia's megafauna during the late Pleistocene era have uncovered that megafauna and Indigenous humans co-existed in the same environment, inclusive of these two sites; Cuddie Springs in NSW and Nombe Rockshelter in the Papua New Guinea (PNG) highlands. Bones from megafauna and stone tool artefacts from human inhabitants have been found at these sites in association with each other. The cause of Indigenous Australian megafauna loss has been attributed to human-driven extinction (HDE) by numerous researchers, however, Garvey and her colleagues in dating faunal assemblages estimated 69% of total faunal species extinctions lie outside the known time for human colonization. Fauna may be identified from teeth, bone, hair, fur, shell, and are important in describing the palaeoenvironment and how Indigenous humans selected, killed and prepared these fauna as a nutritional food source in ancient times which has been a focus of Garvey's research. To obtain a greater understanding of Indigenous Australian aboriginal hunting and butchery practices, collection of evidence from the ethnographic record and modern animal anatomical experiments are conducted including fatty acid analyses involving Bennett's Wallaby, kangaroo, wombat and emu as an analogue to ancient fauna. Research on freshwater shell middens left in the archaeological record by Indigenous human occupants along the Murray River in Northwest Victoria (Ned's Corner pastoral station) has also been undertaken by Garvey. During November 2016, Garvey and colleagues were involved in an archaeological dig at the Lancefield megafauna excavation site in central Victoria, Australia where the discovery of teeth from the extinct giant marsupial Diprotodon, a rhinoceros-sized wombat, had been unearthed from the ancient swamplands, together with remains of Macropus Titan, an extinct giant kangaroo, and aboriginal artefacts. The findings from the excavation site may hold important information on the extinction of megafauna in the region.  Awards and grants  Garvey had been awarded the ARC Kathleen Fitzpatrick Laureate Fellowship Mentoring Scheme (2016) at the University of Melbourne. This Fellowship is awarded to those who have completed a PhD in the last 10 years within Humanities and Social Sciences. The focus of this intensive mentoring programme is in improving and supporting leadership capabilities in early career female researchers, and best practice guidelines in research activities. Garvey has been awarded over $875,000 in Research funding for project work between 2004 and 2016.

Background Following World War I, the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff began to re-consider submarine warfare as an element of fleet strategy. Before the war, the Japanese Navy regarded submarines as useful only for short-range coastal point defense. However, based on the success of the Imperial German Navy in deployment of long-range cruiser-submarines for commerce raiding Japanese strategists came to realize possibilities for using the weapon for long range reconnaissance, and in a war of attrition against an enemy fleet approaching Japan.Peatty, Kaigun, p.114, 212-214 Procurement for a large, long-range Japanese submarine was authorized in fiscal 1918 under the Eight-six fleet program, under the designation S22. Design Project S22 was based on the latest Royal Navy design, the British K class submarine. Japanese ties to Great Britain via the Anglo-Japanese Alliance were still strong. Project S22 was laid down at Kure Naval Arsenal on 6 April 1921, launched on 29 November 1921 and completed on 20 June 1924.Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-1945, p.190 During construction, the vessel was renamed , however, on commissioning into the Imperial Japanese Navy, her name was formally registered as I-51. With a displacement of 1390 tons, I-51 was the largest submarine built in Japan to date. In order to attain a design speed of 23 knots on the surface, and 15 knots submerged, the design required four diesel engines, driving four screws. To accommodate these engines, a double hull design was used, with hulls joined side-by-side forming a sideways figure \\"8\\". As completed, I-51 achieved only 18.4 knots surfaced and 8.4 knots submerged during trials, but had an unrefueled range of 20,000 nautical miles, which was considered remarkable for the time. Operational history I-51, despite her various technical achievements, as not regarded as a successful design, largely through problems with her Sulzer diesel engines. The vessel was never assigned to fleet service, but was retained at Kure Naval Arsenal for crew training and as a test bed for various submarine technologies. In 1931, I-51 was fitted with an aircraft hangar housing a Yokosuka Ro-go Ko-gata floatplane, which could be raised and lowered into the water by a crane. In 1933, this was modified with the addition of an aircraft catapult, making I-51 the forerunner of the Japanese submarine aircraft carriers of World War II. In 1932, two of her engines and associated shafts were removed, as was her main gun. I-51 was removed from the navy list on 1 April 1940 and was scrapped in 1941.

Like the rumba flamenca, the Galician rumba originated from a fusion of certain Cuban and Spanish elements of style. The characteristics of that new genre are similar to those of the new song-dances that appeared in the Caribbean Basin area during the 19th century, which were the result of a combination of Iberian and African elements. This new musical style has been called by Armando Rodr√≠guez Ruid√≠az the Rumba prototype and defined as follows: ‚ÄúThat original product, which we can call the Rumba prototype, was the result of a process of cultural fusion, in which certain European components, such as the lyrics, the tonal relationships (Major-Minor), the melodic and harmonic structures and the ‚Äúquatrain-refrain‚Äù (copla-estribillo) form, were combined with syncopated rhythmic patterns and micro-metric fluctuations (micro time) of African origin.‚Äù Andalusian cadence in E PhrygianTenzer, Michael (2006). Analytical studies in world music, p.97. . . Also like in the rumba flamenca, the melody in the rumba gallega is frequently based on the Spanish Andalusian cadence, while in the background it generally utilizes one or several rhythms which are characteristic of some Cuban music genres such as the guaracha, the rumba and the habanera. Origin Galician bagpipers gaiteiros in a romer√≠a. According to Miguel P√©rez Lorenzo, there are testimonies about the inclusion of the ‚ÄúRumba‚Äù in the Galician bagpipe‚Äôs (gaita) repertoire since the 19th century. He also says in reference to the bagpiper from Ourense, Xo√°n Ferreiro: ‚ÄúHe played, we imagine, those pieces that he heard from his father, other bagpipers, and the band‚Ä¶ Jer√≥nimo (father of this bagpiper, who passed away in 1940) emigrated to Cuba, where he lived until five years before his death‚Ä¶ those years in Cuba served him to include ‚Äúrumbas and ‚Äúboleros‚Äù in his repertoire‚Ä¶ which now Don Xo√°n plays. With the exception of the processional pieces that Don Xo√°n used to play; sometime in the mass and other times walking behind the ‚ÄúSaint‚Äù in the procession, the rest was mainly for the people to dance in the fests and romer√≠as.Luis Costa. Las rumbas olvidadas: transculturalidad y etnicizaci√≥n en la m√∫sica popular gallega. Universidade de Vigo. http://www.sibetrans.com/trans/trans8/costa.htm , Pag. 8. Diversification and popularization Due to its popular origin the ‚ÄúGalician Rumbas‚Äù are frequently attributed to unknown authors; and in a similar way as the Mui√±eira and other traditional genres, they are named after the town or region where they were collected, like: Rumba de Eo, Rumba de Mallou, Rumba de Cerqueira, Rumba de Anxeriz or Rumba de Vergara. They are also titled after the name of the author, if it happens to be known, or after the person to whom they have been dedicated, as for example: Rumba de Juanito do Carballal, Rumba de Pucho, or Rumba Sabeli√±a. The introduction of the rumba in Galicia is closely related to the creation, during the first half of the 20th century, of musical groups called ‚Äúcharangas‚Äù o ‚Äúmurgas‚Äù. Those groups, differently from traditional Galician ensembles such as those comprised by tambourines or by bagpipes and percussion, included other instruments like the clarinet, the saxophone, the accordion, and the guitar, as well as an ample selection of percussion instruments.Norberto Pablo Cirio Desaparici√≥n, permanencia y cambios en las pr√°cticas musicales de la colectividad gallega de la Argentina.

She co-founded the Working Class Movement Library in Salford, a collection of material associated with labour and working class history.  Early life and education  Ruth Engel was born on 28 July 1922 in St John's Wood in London. Her father, Leon Alfred Mayer Engel, was a concert pianist and a traveling sales representative in embroideries. Her mother, Ethel Maud Engel, was originally Irish catholic but converted to Judaism, her husband's faith, on their marriage. Ruth attended a Jewish synagogue, but had a largely secular upbringing, and she attended a local private girls‚Äô school. The family moved to an estate built by a cousin, Engel Park in Mill Hill, when Frow was five. Her father died when she was thirteen.  Career and politics  Upon leaving school, she enrolled in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in April 1940, though underage, working in the RAF Fighter Command control room and on radar. Her altered date of birth is recorded in her discharge papers, along with a commendation of her service. She spent four and a half years in the WAAF. Here she met her first husband, Denis Edmund Haines, an electrical engineer, and the pair married on 25 July 1944. She left the WAAF when she became pregnant, towards the end of 1944. In 1945 she joined the Communist Party in Sandwich, Kent, on the recommendation from local miners to join over the Labour Party. She found the Communist Party an ideologically- and socially-attractive space as an activist and a woman not wishing to return to a purely domestic role post-war. Following the Second World War, Frow enrolled in the Emergency Teacher Training Scheme, and became a teacher in 1949. She was a trade union activist and member of the National Union of Teachers. She was Secretary of Teachers for Peace and Manchester branch of the Peace Committee, and was elected Vice-Chair of the Manchester Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. In the 1950s she lived for a time with Communist party members Bill Wainwright and Molly Wainwright. She met her second husband, Edmund 'Eddie' Frow, in 1953 at a day school on labour history in Sussex, and they married in 1961. The pair were enthusiastic collectors of books, pamphlets and ephemera to do with labour history and the labour movement. The couple were both awarded honorary degrees from the University of Salford in 1989.  The Working Class Movement Library  Working Class Movement Library in Salford Along with her husband Edmund, Frow was the founder of the Working Class Movement Library in Manchester. The library was originally the personal book collection of the couple, to which scholars or students of labour history could access for free. In 1972 the Frows established the library as a Charitable Trust, allowing it to be accessible as an education resource. Their collection of books and ephemera grew so extensive, in 1987 it was re-housed by Salford Council in a converted nursing home, in which it still retained; Jubilee House on The Crescent in Salford. The offer from the council was accepted over similar offers from universities, in order to avoided limited access for workers to their own history. In 1989 Ruth and Edmund Frow were awarded the Commendation of Merit by the Library Association for their service to the library profession.

Background Following World War I, the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff began to re-consider submarine warfare as an element of fleet strategy. Before the war, the Japanese Navy regarded submarines as useful only for short-range coastal point defense. However, based on the success of the Imperial German Navy in deployment of long-range cruiser-submarines for commerce raiding Japanese strategists came to realize possibilities for using the weapon for long range reconnaissance, and in a war of attrition against an enemy fleet approaching Japan.Peatty, Kaigun, p. 114, 212-214 Although a large, long-range Japanese submarine had already been authorized in fiscal 1918 under the Eight-six fleet program as Project S22 (later designated ), a second prototype with a different design was authorized under fiscal 1919. Design The first Kaidai prototype, Project S22, was based on the latest Royal Navy design, the British K class submarine; the second Kaidai prototype was based on the German Type U 139 submarine.Stille, Imperial Japanese Submarines 1941-45, p. 4 This second prototype was designated Project S25 Project S22 was laid down at Kure Naval Arsenal on 2 April 1922, launched on 12 June 1923, and completed on 20 May 1925.Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-1945, p. 190 During construction, the vessel was renamed , however, on commissioning into the Imperial Japanese Navy, her name was formally registered as . With improved Sulzer diesel engines, I-52 was able to use a single hull with two engines, rather than the double-hull, four engine design of the I-51. The greater power and more streamlined shape gave a slightly higher surfaced speed than I-51, or even SM U135, but with reduced range. I-52 had a design speed of 22 knots on the surface, and 10 knots submerged, but as completed, achieved 19.5 knots surfaced. Her unrefueled range was 10,000 nautical miles, or only half that of I-51. Several more of submarines of the same Kaidai II design were planned, but all were cancelled before contracts were even formally signed due to the arrival of seven German U-boats received by Japan as war reparations at the end of World War I.Boyd, The Japanese Submarine Force in World War II, p. 17-18 Operational history I-52, despite her various technical achievements and superior performance to I-51, was not regarded as a completely successful design. The vessel was never assigned to fleet service, but was retained at Kure Naval Arsenal for crew training and as a test bed for new submarine technologies. She was assigned to Maizuru Naval District for use as a training vessel from 1 February 1939. CombinedFleet.com: HIJMS Submarine I-152: Tabular Record of Movement With the start of World War II, I-52 was considered obsolete but was retained as a training vessel in the Seto Inland Sea based at Kure. Her designation was officially changed to on 20 May 1942. I-152 was removed from the navy list on 1 August 1942. Afterwards, she was retained at Kure as a static training hulk for use by the Imperial Japanese Navy Submarine Warfare School, formally designated Hulk #14. After the surrender of Japan, she was scrapped at the former Kure Naval Arsenal from 1946-1948.

The film was originally released straight to VHS. VHS copies of the film have become collector's items due to their difficulty to locate and extremely limited quantities, with one copy selling for $2000 on eBay. Turner has expressed interest in creating a sequel and began writing the film's script in 2013. Tales from the QuadeaD Zone was the only film produced by Erry Vision Film Co. Since its release Tales From the Quadead Zone has received several public screenings, one of which was a 2016 symposium at the Yale University Library, Terror on Tape. It was given a DVD release in 2013 through Massacre Video.  Synopsis  The film is composed of two stories, \\"Food For ?\\" and \\"The Brothers\\", both of which are narrated by a mother (Shirley L. Jones) reading the tales to her deceased son Bobby. \\"Food For ?\\" centers upon a family that is so poor that they are unable to afford food for every family member. Their only solution is to get rid of some of their family in order to increase the amount of supper for everyone else. \\"The Brother\\" follows two brothers who have hated each other their entire lives and have each made cruel jokes and attacks against the other. When one of them dies, the living brother tries to have the last laugh by stealing his brother's corpse and making him look like a circus clown. Little does he know that his brother's spirit has returned to his body, unhappy with his brother's plans.  Cast  =Food For ?= *W.J.

Jones as Bobby's Mother Production Work on Tales from the Quadead Zone began three years after Turner completed his first film, Black Devil Doll From Hell, which was initially intended to be one of the anthology's stories. Two of the film's stories, \\"Food For ?\\" and the wraparound story \\"Unseen Vision\\", were shot in Alabama while \\"The Brothers\\" was shot in Chicago.  Release  As Turner released the video on his own, along with star Shirley L. Jones, Tales from the Quadead Zone was released in an extremely limited amount, estimated to be at or less than 100 copies. The copies were only circulated in the Chicago area due to the cost of gas and travel required by Turner and Jones and it is believed that many of these copies have been lost. Over time the video achieved cult status and VHS copies became much sought after collector's items. In 2011 one copy of the film sold for $665 on the online auction site eBay, a feat that was covered in the 2013 documentary Adjust Your Tracking. The winning bidder later sold his copy of the movie for twice the amount paid. The price reached an all time high when a copy was sold on eBay for $2000. In 2013 Massacre Video released the movie as part of a DVD box set along with Black Devil Doll From Hell. The box set features commentary from Turner and Jackson, a documentary about the both films, and the director's cut of Black Devil Doll From Hell, which was heavily edited from Turner's original version.  Reception  Horronews.net commented that although the video could be seen as a \\"complete and utter train wreck\\", the film was made during a point in time when amateur filmmaking would be cost prohibitive for the average person and the creation of Tales from the Quadead Zone was evidence of Turner's \\"heart and a dream to become a film maker\\". Bloody Disgusting also reviewed the movie, stating that it was \\"a no-budget, SOV labor of mad love\\". DVD Talk reviewed the movie as part of Massacre Video's box set and gave it a poor review, which they felt was weaker than Black Devil Doll From Hell.

He was interested in music and left Saint-Sa√´ns 100,000 francs in his willSaint-Sa√´ns en six dates (France Musique) which enabled the composer to retire from his church post at La Madeleine in Paris and use his time for composition. The inheritance came with the stipulation that Saint-Sa√´ns compose a requiem for the first anniversary of his benefactor's death, which the composer fulfilled with gratitude. He retreated to a hotel in Bern and completed the work in eight days. He wrote to his publisher: \\"Fear not, this Requiem will be very short; I‚Äôm not just working hard, I‚Äôm working flat out!\\" He conducted the first performance on 22 May 1878 in the Mass commemorating the first anniversary of Libon's death at Saint-Sulpice in Paris, with Charles-Marie Widor as the organist. It was first published the same year. In 2016, it was published in a critical edition by Carus-Verlag, in the version for orchestra as well as in a version for a smaller ensemble but retaining the characteristic sound.  Music  = Structure and scoring = The Requiem consists of eight movements: # Requiem ‚Äì Kyrie # Dies Irae # Rex Tremendae # Oro Supplex # Hostias (Offertory) # Sanctus # Benedictus # Agnus Dei The Requiem is scored for SATB soloists and choir, and a large orchestra reminiscent of Berlioz: four flutes, two oboes, two English horns, four bassoons, four French horns, four harps, four trombones, timpani, grand organ, accompanying organ, and strings. The trombones are positioned with the grand organ, while the orchestra and the singers are located in the choir. Carus- Verlag also published a version with a reduced orchestra, comprising only two flutes, two bassoons, two French horns, two harps, and one trombone, and without the accompanying organ, but retaining the oboes, English horns, grand organ and strings. = Background and composition = In the 19th century, church music was predominantly \\"backward-looking\\", due to the demands of the liturgy and a concept of music considered \\"proper\\" worship, such as the vocal polyphony of Palestrina, which the Cecilian movement tolerated. The most popular work by Saint-Sa√´ns is Oratorio de No√´l, written in 1858, but he also composed motets and psalm settings earlier and late in life, in keeping with liturgical demands. His Messe de Requiem is unusual, requiring a rich orchestra for heightened expressiveness. His biographer Jacques Bonnaure noted in his 2010 book: \\"This unjustly neglected Requiem is perhaps the most sensitive, imaginative, and perfect work by the composer, who finds here, more than ever before, a classical balance between form and expression, innovation and tradition, sophisticated compositional style and immediate effect.\\"  Recordings  The Messe de Requiem was recorded, among other choral works by Saint-Sa√´ns, by the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana and its choir, conducted by Diego Fasolis, with soloists Marie-Paule Dotti, Guillemette Laurens, Luca Lombardo and Nicolas Test√© (2004). The Messe de Requiem was also recorded in 1972 by the Orchestre Lyrique de l'O.R.T.F and the Ensemble Choral \\"CONTREPOINT\\" with Director Jean-Gabriel Gaussens. This recording was released on LP in stereo by RCA and RTF (650 002) as part of the Ars Gallica series. Soloists included: Danielle Galland, Soprano, Jeannine Collard, Alto, Francis Bardot, Tenor, Jacques Villisech, Basse and Micheline Lagache, Organist.

Like many of her class, she was not named and is properly referred to by her hull designation. Construction LST-18 was laid down on 1 October 1942, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by the Dravo Corporation; launched on 15 February 1943; sponsored by Miss Ruth Watt; placed in reduced commission for transportation to be fitted out; and fully commissioned on 26 April 1943, with Lieutenant John Lenci, USCGR, in command. Service history During the war LST-18 served exclusively and extensively in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater from September 1943 until November 1945. LST-18 was then floated down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers from 19‚Äì25 April 1943, arriving at New Orleans on the latter date. When she entered commissioned service there were only 7 officers and 67 enlisted men in the original crew. After tests and maneuvers at St. Andrews, Florida, she returned to New Orleans on 14 May 1943, for post- shakedown availability. She was then assigned to LST Flotilla 7, Group 21, Division 41. LST-18 left Galveston, Texas, on 25 May 1943, with Convoy HK 186 headed for Key West, Florida, where she arrived on 29 May 1943. On 1 June 1943, she got underway for the Canal Zone. Arriving at Coca Sola, Canal Zone, on 14 June 1943, Commander Clarence H. Peterson, USCG, with two officers and 13 enlisted men reported aboard for duty to the staff of Group 21, LST Flotilla 7 and LST-18 was designated flagship for the group. She then travelled to Australia, where she left Caloundra, Queensland, on 23 August 1943, en route to Townsville, Queensland, with Convoy QL 8, arriving on 26 August. From there she left two days later with Convoy TN 147 en route to Milne Bay, Territory of Papua, where she arrived on 31 August 1943. She then proceeded to Milne Bay, New Guinea, arriving on 2 September 1943, for ten days of beaching operations and loading for the first trip in the forward areas. =Eastern New Guinea operation= LST-18 participated in the landing at Scarlet Beach during the Battle of Finschhafen from 22‚Äì24 September 1943. =Bismarck Archipelago operation= LST-18 participated in the Cape Gloucester landings, New Britain at the end of December 1943 and January 1944. She then assisted in the Admiralty Islands landings at the end of March until 1 April 1944. =Hollandia and Western New Guinea operation= LST-18 remained busy participating in the Hollandia operation at the end of April and the beginning of May 1944, the Toem-Wakde-Sarmi area in the middle of May 1944, the Biak Island invasion in the middle of June 1944, the Noemfoor Island invasion at the beginning to the middle of July 1944, the Cape Sansapor landings at the end of July and the beginning of August 1944, and the Morotai landings in the middle of September 1944. =Leyte operation= From the Western New Guinea area LST-18 moved to the Philippines to participate in General Douglas MacArthur's promised liberation of the islands from the Japanese occupation starting with the Leyte landings from the middle of October until the end of November 1944. LST-18 finished out her combat career participating in the Battle of Luzon Lingayen Gulf landings from the beginning to the middle of January 1945, the Palawan Island landings at the beginning of March 1945, and then the Visayan Islands landings at the end of March and the beginning of April 1945. In carrying out these invasions, LST-18 was under attack on eight different occasions by enemy planes, shore installations and torpedo. No casualties were suffered by the ship's crew, but one Army passenger was killed aboard, the result of an enemy strafing run. The ship carried approximately of equipment in all these trips and about 16,000 Army and Navy personnel. She also evacuated 617 ambulatory cases and 179 stretcher cases from the various beachheads. There were three deaths aboard; one Army enlisted who had been brought on board for treatment; one Army passenger who died of wounds during an air attack (mentioned earlier) and one prisoner of war who was brought on board for treatment. Up to the time of the ship's return to San Francisco on 16 December 1945, 291 enlisted men and 33 officers had served aboard at various intervals. Postwar career After the cessation of hostilities on 14 August 1945, the LST made one support landing at Brunei Bay, Borneo, on 25 August 1945, and then completed her tour of duty by taking a load of occupation troops to Taku, China. LST-18 performed occupation duty in the Far East until early November 1945. She returned to the United States and was decommissioned on 3 April 1946. She was struck from the Navy list on 17 April 1946 and was sold to the Suwannee Fruit & Steamship Co., of Jacksonville, Florida, on 31 October 1946 for conversion to merchant service.

It was designed by Government Architect's Office and built in 1919. It is also known as Bushell's Meats, Dore & Donald Butchers, and Ladbrook's Butchery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 April 2001.  History  This single- storeyed brick shop was erected in 1919 for the Queensland Government as a purpose-designed State Butcher's Shop. From 1915 to 1929, 90 State butcher's shops operated in Queensland for various periods, mostly in leased or purchased premises. The peak number of shops operating at any one time was 72, in 1922-1923. The Roma shop was one of Queensland's few purpose-designed State butcheries, and one of the more substantial of the regional State butcher's shops. In 1915 T. J. Ryan's Labor government won office in wartime Queensland on the strength of promises to improve living standards - principally by addressing the problems of high commodity prices, price-fixing and the emergence of monopolies. The Labor party in general and Ryan and his Treasurer, Ted Theodore, in particular, advocated public ownership of key economic activities, in competition with private enterprise, but at fair prices. They argued that by operating at a reduced profit margin (the State butcher's shops average one-fifth of a penny profit on every pound of meat sold), the cost of goods and services provided by State-run enterprises would be reduced, and that the flow-on effect would be to reduce and stabilise prices for similar goods and services provided by the private sector. In the period 1915-1925 the Queensland Government instituted or acquired a diversity of business enterprises, including a State Insurance Office, a Public Curator's Office, the Golden Casket State Lottery, sawmills and joinery works, mining and fishing ventures (including a string of State Fish Shops), a hotel, a sugar mill, cold stores, plant nurseries, cattle stations and a network of butcher's shops, the process being formalised with the passing of the State Enterprises Act of 1918. These activities were part of a broader, pragmatic Labor platform which advocated State intervention in the private sector to protect individuals against capitalist exploitation, not as a means of involving workers in the control of production, or of raising wage levels. Labor politicians regarded State enterprise as \\"State capitalism\\" rather than \\"State socialism\\". Interior of the State butchers shop in Roma Street, Brisbane, circa 1917 In 1915 cattle raising was one of the principal economic activities of the State, and meat was considered a staple food. Believing that all Queenslanders should have access to meat at fair prices, and needing to maintain a regular supply of cheap meat to the Allied fighting forces, the Ryan government introduced a Statewide system of State-owned butcher's shops which proved to be among the more successful of the numerous State enterprises. The first State butcher's shop was opened in Roma Street, Brisbane, on 12 November 1915, and soon other shops were established in Brisbane suburbs and in regional centres such as Rockhampton, Gympie, Townsville, Charters Towers, and Mount Morgan, following the railway lines via which frozen meat was distributed to the State butcheries. During the life of the scheme 90 shops were opened throughout the State. The town of Roma was established officially in 1862 to service the Maranoa pastoral district, and as a government administrative centre. With the extension of the Western railway line to Roma and Charleville in the 1880s, linking Western Queensland to the coastal ports, Roma boomed, and emerged as an important regional centre. Roma was considered an important centre in the Statewide chain of butcher's shops established by the Labor government from 1915. It was a substantial town serving a wide pastoral and agricultural district, and functioned as an important distribution centre for meat slaughtered at the State-owned Charleville Meatworks, further west along the railway. Toward the end of 1918 moves were made to open a State butcher's shop at Roma. In fairness to established butcheries, when the State intended to open a butcher's shop in a town or suburb, inspections were made of existing butcheries, to assess the possibility of State acquisition. At Roma, at least two butchers were keen to sell their business and/or premises, but inspection revealed that these shops were not sufficiently well-equipped, and recommendation was made to erect purpose-designed premises of the most up-to- date kind. The recommendation was accepted, but while an appropriate site for new premises was being sought, two State butcher's shops opened in Roma on 1 March 1919, in leased premises in Wyndham and Arthur Streets. By May 1919 a vacant allotment in Arthur Street had been resumed, and an adjacent allotment was purchased subsequently from Henry Hoffman. A cottage on this second land parcel was removed to Charleville Meatworks to make room for the construction of the State butcher's shop. Plans were prepared in the office of the Queensland Government Architect. The new building was completed by late October, and opened on 18 September 1919, at which time the leased shops in Arthur and Wyndham Streets were closed. The new premises was of brick construction, and at a cost of ¬£4,061/13/3, was one of the more expensive of the purpose-built State butcher's shops. It contained an office, shop, breaking-down room, salting-room, cold room, country order department, store, and engine-room. In 1920, just over ¬£300 was spent on stables. Only six purpose-designed butcher's shops were constructed in Queensland, each apparently built to an individual design: a retail butchery within the Central State Fish Market, South Brisbane (the markets were a substantial brick complex erected 1917-18 at a cost of over ¬£45,500); Booval State Butchery (erected at a cost of just over ¬£600); Roma State Butchery (brick, erected 1919 at a cost of just over ¬£4,000 (this figure possibly includes plant)); Ayr State Butchery (brick and wood, erected at a cost of just over ¬£2,000); Mackay State Butchery (fibrous-cement and wood, erected at a cost of just over ¬£2,600); and Walkerston State Butchery (erected 1922-23 at a cost of about ¬£536). Cold stores and additions were erected at various butcher's shops, but no other purpose-designed shop was constructed. Initially the State butcher's shops were supplied with frozen meat from meatworks companies, but from 1921 they purchased their own stock which they killed at their own slaughter-yards, ensuring that the State butcher's shops were supplied always with fresh meat at very competitive prices. It has not been established whether the Roma shop continued to be supplied from Charleville Meatworks. Despite benefits such as the provision of employment, assistance to small farmers and small business, and the provision of cheaper meat to thousands, the State Enterprises scheme proved an economic failure. Some State enterprises had been purchased at an inflated price; others were located in unsuitable areas or were badly managed; others suffered the effects of economic recession, or of the mid-1920s drought. Following the passing of the Profiteering Prevention Act of 1920, other mechanisms were in place for controlling prices. By 1926, Labor premier William McCormack had declared publicly his intention of disposing of unprofitable State Enterprises, although little action was taken at the time. Some of the State butcher shops were disposed of in the period 1926-1928 (including the Roma shop), and when Labor was defeated at the 1929 election, the in-coming Country/Progressive/Nationalist coalition government disposed of most of the remaining State Enterprises, including the 39 remaining State butcher's shops, which ceased trading as of 30 June 1929. In their 14 years of operation, the State butcher's shops sold over ¬£5 million worth of meat and had made an overall profit to the Treasury of ¬£185,000, but when interest and other charges were factored in, they lost about ¬£6,000. However, this pales by comparison with the combined ¬£2 million loss sustained by the State stations and the State-acquired Chillagoe railway, mines and smelter. The State butchery in Arthur Street, Roma, was sold in July 1928 to Roma butchers Dore and Donald Ltd. Edwin Arnold Donald, son of a Roma grazier, built up a successful butcher's business in Roma in the 1910s, and it appears to have been his two Roma shops which were leased briefly by the State Butcheries Department in 1919. The original street awning supported on timber posts has been replaced with a cantilevered awning, and the shop front has been modernised. A small office, where customers paid for their meat, was removed when the front section of the shop was refurbished . In 2016, the former Roma State Butcher's Shop remains a privately owned butchery (Ladbrook's Butchery).  Description  The former Roma State Butcher's Shop is located in Arthur Street, Roma, in the town centre, south of the intersection with McDowall Street. It a rectangular, single-storeyed brick building with a gabled roof to the front (east) elevation and hipped gablet roof to the rear (west) elevation. There is a hipped roof wing on the south side. All roofs are covered in corrugated iron. To the rear of the wing is a modern car/van port structure. The front (east) elevation has a decorative gable comprising evenly spaced vertical painted timbers on plaster. Centrally placed in the gable is a timber louvred ventilation panel. There is a cantilevered awning, with a cloth \\"Dutch style\\" blind on the south side, beneath which is a modern aluminium shopfront. To the south side there are two original high level windows, now blocked-in. The hipped roof wing, originally open, is now partly built in by a brick wall with a window, with the remainder enclosed in vertical metal sheeting. There is a decorative timber trellis screen fence to the street (east) elevation of the wing. The van/car port is a flat roof metal structure with vertical metal cladding to the south side. In the wall beneath this structure there is a timber door with a skylight over, either side of which are 4:4 pane timber vertical sash windows. To the rear (north) elevation there is a timber lean-to structure clad in weatherboarding, with a centrally placed opening. The rear brick wall of the building is painted with a centrally placed door. In the west side wall there are 3 closely spaced 4:4 pane timber vertical sash windows at the northern end, a door, and two original high level windows, now blocked in, at the southern end. The external brickwork is a combination of stretcher bond to the front and sides of the building, indicating cavity construction, and English bond to the rear, indicating solid wall construction. Internally there is an L-shaped shop area with modern counters. There is a door from this area into a large cold room store on the north side and a door into the meat preparation area. Beyond the preparation area is a store/staff room area. The stables do not survive. There is a small detached toilet block to the northeast corner of the building, but no other structures. The south side of the site has an access road leading to parking at the rear. There is a car width access way along the north side.  Heritage listing  The former State Butchers Shop was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 April 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Former State Butcher's Shop, Roma, erected in 1919, is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland's history. In particular, the place is illustrative of the highly co-ordinated, statewide system of State butcheries which provided cheaper meat to thousands of Queensland families in the years 1915-1929. During this period successive Queensland Labor governments established various State enterprises, with the network of State butcher's shops being among the more successful of these experiments. The Roma State Butcher's Shop was considered an important distribution centre for meat supplied from the State-owned Charleville Meatworks, which is illustrated in the construction of a substantial brick building with state-of-the-art butchery equipment and facilities. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Roma shop was one of only six purpose-designed State butcher's shops constructed 1917-1923 - most of the State butcher's shops operated from leased or purchased premises - and was among the more substantial (full brick construction) of these. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place has remained a butcher's shop, and is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of a purpose-designed State butcher's shop of its era.

The film stars Shirley L. Jones. A copy of the film is held in the Yale University Libraries' archives.  Plot  Helen Black is a religious young woman who is determined to abstain from sex until marriage. This all changes once she purchases a supposedly haunted doll from a thrift store, after which point Helen's sex drive becomes insatiable.  Cast  * Shirley L.

Turner as The Doll  Production  When Turner began working on Black Devil Doll From Hell, he initially intended the story to be one of several featured in the anthology film Tales from the QuadeaD Zone. The short was turned into a feature-length film after Turner noted that the script had grown too long to be part of an anthology. Turner wrote the script over a period of three and a half days, however filming took place over several years on a budget of about $10,000. Most of the film's budget went towards paying the cast and crew involved with the film, as Turner was unaware that it is accepted practice for some performers and crew to work for free when making an independent film. During filming Turner began dating actress Shirley L. Jones, who would return for Turner's second film. The titular devil doll from the movie was modeled after the performer Rick James and Turner's young nephew portrayed the doll in walking scenes. As Turner had no prior experience in filmmaking, he took a correspondence course to help him with the film.  Release  The film was first released in 1984 through Hollywood Home Video, a working relationship that Turner has described as exploitative. Copies of Black Devil Doll From Hell were circulated to various video rental stores, where they were rented \\"over and over and over\\". Despite the film enjoying some popularity, Turner only received $6 for each VHS copy purchased and was not certain how many copies of the film were actually sold by the distributor. Hollywood Home Video also made extensive edits to Turner's film, resulting in the removal of seventy minutes of footage and of Turner's original soundtrack. In 2013 Massacre Video released Black Devil Doll From Hell as part of a DVD box set along with Tales from the QuadeaD Zone. The set also featured commentary from Turner and Shirley L. Jones, a documentary on both films, and the original version of Black Devil Doll From Hell. Both Black Devil Doll From Hell and Tales from the QuadeaD Zone received a screening in Austin, Texas that same year, as part of a film event hosted by the Austin Film Society and attended by both Turner and Jones.  Reception  HorrorNews.net commented that the film was \\"hard to recommend\\" but contained a good ending and \\"some truly unbelievable lines of dialogue\\". DVD Talk gave Black Devil Doll From Hell two stars, remarking that they preferred the edited cut over Turner's original version. Shock Cinema Magazine reviewed the movie in 1991, writing that \\"It revels unashamedly in its own misogynistic mindset and utter incompetency, and I can't imagine an uglier, more unbelievably inept piece of rotgut. Difficult to endure, impossible to forget, and loads of fun to discuss afterward (sorta like bragging about battle wounds).\\" Graeme Clark from The Spinning Image panned the film, awarding it one out of ten stars, calling it \\"Absolutely dreadful by any estimate, but difficult to look away from (and listen to, thanks to the piercing and droning soundtrack)\\". In his review, Clark criticized the film's dialogue, sexual content as being \\"almost softcore pornographic\\", and called the title character \\"a low rent Chucky\\". Reviewing the 2013 release of the film, Nathaniel Thompson from Mondo Digital offered similar criticism. In his review Thompson wrote, \\"Love it or hate it, there's no way you'll ever forget Black Devil Doll from Hell. The monotonous (and loud) Casio soundtrack, hallucinatory pacing, profane script, and amateur performances combine to create a Black Devil Doll from HellDIY video project so far removed from anything remotely resembling normality that most wondered how it ever escaped onto commercial VHS release at all.\\" References External links  * 1984 films 1984 horror films 1984 direct-to-video films American films American direct-to-video films American supernatural horror films Blaxploitation films Direct-to-video horror films English-language films Films about dolls Films featuring puppetry 1984 directorial debut films ","title":"Black Devil Doll From Hell"},{"id":"51338784","text":"The Junior Mance Touch is an album by jazz pianist Junior Mance which was released on the Polydor label in 1973.Polydor Records discography: 300 series accessed August 16, 2016Junior Mance discography accessed August 16, 2016 Reception The Allmusic site awarded the album 3 stars calling it \\"A nice approach without the schmaltz\\".

History (Jane Avis) Frances Keith was born in Hammersmith, a daughter of Daniel Keith D.D., of St. Andrew's University, Scotland, and married Montgomery Martin in 1826. She left him for John Sheridan MD (1805 ‚Äì 17 April 1858), a graduate of Edinburgh University who left the medical profession to take up editorship of the Morning Advertiser, organ of the Society of Licensed Victuallers of London. Martin divorced his wife in 1847; Dr. Sheridan was around that time an inmate of a lunatic asylum. After his release he emigrated with Frances and their four children to South Australia aboard the Constant, serving without distinction as ship's surgeon.

He married Emma Brown in Adelaide on 17 December 1854. Another son Raymond Sheridan ( ‚Äì 8 November 1882) was foreman for printer David Gall on 89 King William Street, which he took over in January 1873 and operated as Gall & Sheridan, until being taken over by Scrymgour & Sons of 115 King William Street.

It was built from 1877 to 1878. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 August 2008. The winery closed for business in December 2012.  History  Romavilla Winery, circa 1910 Romavilla Vineyards, on the outskirts of Roma in the Maranoa district of south western Queensland, was established in 1866 by Samuel Symons Bassett. It dominated wine-production in the Roma district and later in Queensland for many decades, and continues to manufacture commercial wines. The earliest section of the present winery buildings was constructed in 1877-1878. Grapes were grown successfully on the head stations of pastoral properties in the area in the 1850s, during the first wave of European settlement, but Romavilla produced the earliest commercial wine in the Maranoa in the 1860s and was among the earliest of Queensland's commercial wine producers. At the peak of viticulture in the Roma district in the late nineteenth century there were 50 local vineyards, the majority of which had been established in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of the grapes grown were for table fruit, but a small wine- producing industry also emerged at this time. The principal vignerons in the district included SS Bassett, John Robertson (manager of Mount Abundance Station), William Tune, James Spencer, Alexandre Robinson, and the Tardent brothers (Henri, Alexis and Emile, from the late 1880s). Grape growing and wine producing remained important local industries well into the twentieth century, with Roma being described in about 1920 as being surrounded by \\"a magnificent fruit and wine growing district\\". Bassett, born in Cornwall in 1840, arrived in Sydney in 1856 and worked on his uncle's Hunter Valley property for some years. From 1860 he managed Euthulla Station in the Maranoa for his uncle and cousin, until in 1866 he purchased from the Crown nearly 270 acres (109 hectares) of recently surveyed agricultural land just outside the town of Roma. Here he established Romavilla Vineyards, with vine cuttings brought in by bullock dray from Toowoomba. In 1869 he diversified his interests with the establishment in Roma of a general store and a depot for wines sales. In about 1870 Bassett built a house at Romavilla and in 1871 married Isabella Cameron of Brisbane. At Romavilla they raised a large family, with three daughters and six sons surviving to adulthood. Bassett had no formal training either in grape-growing or wine-making, and learnt largely by trial and error. By 1881 he was employing a manager to run the winery, while he (and later his sons also) travelled throughout Queensland to promote Romavilla wine. By 1888 Bassett had 55 acres under vines, from which he was producing 7,000 gallons of wine per annum, as well as table grapes for the local and Brisbane markets. The Romavilla cellar was capable of holding 30,000 gallons of wine, and Bassett usually kept 20,000 in stock. Like many of Queensland's early wine producers, Bassett's first cellar at Romavilla was above ground. That structure no longer exists. The earliest section of the present large winery building at Romavilla was constructed in 1877-1878, reportedly of cypress and imported Oregon pine, and was extended several times in later years. It accommodated the whole process of wine making, from crushing, to fermentation in vats, to maturing in barrels, to bottling, and incorporated a large underground cellar. In late 1888 the cellar was described as being partly above and partly below ground, \\"built of corrugated iron in 7 feet 6 inch lengths, with a space of 18 inches filled in with battens to the wall-plate, and covered with corrugated iron\\". The section of the cellar that lay partly underground measured ; attached to the end of this was a similarly constructed cellar building, all above ground, about . There was no attempt to maintain a regular cellar temperature in this structure. During the 1880s Bassett's reputation as a maker of good wines was established when Romavilla won its first prize for wine in 1886. The winery sustained a list of impressive prizes, including four first prizes out of eight at the 1900 Queensland Exhibition, nine first prizes out of ten at the 1901 Exhibition, and medals at international competitions in continental Europe. By the late 1960s, the winery had won over 650 certificates and medals in Australia and internationally. Romavilla underwent considerable expansion during the last decade of the nineteenth century and in 1898 Samuel Bassett sent one of his sons, William Augustus, to learn wine-making from Leo Buring in South Australia. By 1903 the property comprised 500 acres (202 hectares), mostly of light and dark sandy loam, with 170,000 vines planted. Much of this was under irrigation, with two recently erected irrigation plants on the estate. The winery building included an immense cellar, which stored up to 50,000 gallons of wine at a time. Adjacent to the cellar was a \\"well-equipped plant, with the latest appliances for wine-making\\", including cooling coils on the vats to reduced heat during fermentation. Romavilla was among the first wineries in Australia to use cooling during fermentation. In August 1904 title to the property passed from Samuel Symons Bassett to The Romavilla Vineyards Limited (The Romavilla Vineyards Pty Limited from 1942). Following his death in late 1912, Bassett's sons expanded the enterprise into the largest wine-producing firm in Queensland. In 1916 the annual output was estimated at 31,000 gallons and the cellar holdings at 100,000 gallons. By 1923 Romavilla was supplying products to individuals and hotels (especially) all over Queensland. Romavilla fortified wines - such as port, sherry and madeira - were particularly popular and for a considerable period Romavilla distilled its own spirits for fortifying wine. By the 1930s the firm was supplying to wine saloons throughout the State; Queensland Government Railways stocked Romavilla port in its refreshment rooms; and Romavilla altar wine was popular in Catholic churches. By 1967 Romavilla Vineyards was the sole remaining commercial winery in Queensland, producing 20,000-30,000 gallons annually, until the emergence of a boutique wine-making industry in the Stanthorpe district of southern Queensland in the 1970s. Following WA Bassett's death in the early 1970s the winery passed out of the Bassett family, but its historic involvement was perpetuated when the name of the enterprise was changed in 1977 to Bassetts Romavilla Winery Pty Ltd. New owners installed modern equipment within the nineteenth century structures but retained much of the earlier technology, which is now of considerable historical interest and a tourist attraction. Documentation has been preserved, including early award certificates and a letter from Prime Minister William Hughes, a former worker at Romavilla, who wrote recalling those days following a gift of wine from the vineyard. The residence was destroyed by a severe storm in 1984. In 2016, the winery is still in operation as Queensland's oldest winery, producing a wide variety of table wines and fortified wines.  Description  Approximately two kilometres north of the township of Roma in western Queensland, Romavilla Winery stands prominently to Northern Road, the main road north out of Roma travelling to the Carnarvon Gorge and beyond. The winery and vineyards are on the flood plain of Bungil Creek which runs down from the hills around Injune to the north. Bounded by Northern Road to the west, Bassett Lane to the north, a neighbouring property to the east and Edna Street and the adjacent caravan park to the south, the winery complex comprises a number of structures. Those considered to be of heritage significance are winery office, winery shed and distillery shed. A display vineyard occupies part of the front yard. A number of hoardings, including one for Bassett Romavilla Winery, stand along the front fence line. = Driveway and display vineyard = The winery shed is approached along a graveled driveway from the front entrance gate. A display vineyard stands to the south of the driveway adjacent to the small low-set timber-framed and clad winery office. = Winery Office = A small rectangular timber-framed building standing on low timber stumps and sheltered by a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron, the office building stands west of the winery shed. The projecting gable roofed entrance porch opens into a narrow room running the width of the building. Two offices with a connecting doorway open onto this space. The building is clad with chamferboards and lined with fibrous cement sheeting with batten cover strips. The narrow front room is lit by rectangular casements windows to all three sides and banks of casements windows light the offices. = Winery shed = The winery shed is a large, timber-framed building clad with timber and corrugated iron. Sheltered by a series of high gabled roofs supported by king post trusses, the winery building is constructed as linked buildings on three levels stepping down the gradient of a slightly sloping site. The small extension at the front of the building is used for sales and wine tasting and together with the adjacent barrel storage area is built over a cellar used for long term wine storage. The centre section accommodates racked barrels and the pressing equipment, storage vats and bottling machinery stand towards the rear of the building. The front elevation is clad with corrugated metal sheeting and the former tall rectangular parapet is now truncated to follow the outer roof lines of the twin gables behind. The single storey extension running across the front of the building is sheltered by a skillion roof which is screened by a low corrugated iron parapet. The metal sheet cladding extends down into the soil that has been piled up against the front of the building. The extension accommodates two entrances, both housing pairs of ledged and braced timber doors. One opens into the front lobby, the other into the front barrel storage area. Romavilla Vineyards signage is fixed to the upper centre of the elevation, flanked by pairs of fixed timber louvred windows. The north, east and south sides of the shed are clad with corrugated iron and a continuous band of fixed timber louvres runs along the upper north and south walls. The north side has a number of lean-to extensions - an open storage area to the west end, small lean-to enclosed sheds flanking the entrance in the rear end of the shed and a skillion roof open storage space to the east end. This wraps around to the eastern side where it terminates in an enclosed shed to the south end. A number of concrete slabs, drains and structures, including timber and corrugated iron sheds and concrete water tanks, stand south of the shed. From the front entrance lobby, the sales office opens to the left, the tasting area to the right and the front portion of the shed is directly ahead. An unlined, high volume space with fixed timber louvres along the upper north and south walls, the front portion of the shed is wider than the other parts of the shed and has a timber floor supported by timber posts from the cellar below. It accommodates barrel storage, a small open office cubicle and the excise inspector's office. The office cubicle sits on a timber platform projecting into the middle shed area where it is supported by timber stumps. The office accommodates narrow timber benches with cupboards below, a small table and a bench seat. A number of framed certificates and awards are propped around the office. A timber framed podium clad with vertical tongue and groove boards, the elevated excise inspector's office, stands to the north and is approached by a set of timber stairs. It projects into the middle shed area and commands views across the whole shed. The middle and rear portions of the shed have concrete floors and a number of drains run through these areas. The barrel storage area in the middle portion of the shed is organised around a grid of walkways and concrete upstands accommodating concrete plinths on which the barrels stand. The rear of the shed accommodates a range of early and modern equipment. Early equipment including the crusher, pressing equipment, in-ground concrete blending and storage tanks are considered to be significant. Pairs of large timber doors open from this area of the shed to the east and south. Marks in the concrete floor indicate where earlier concrete fermentation tanks stood. A number of these tanks now stand inverted in the yard to the north of the shed. Drive wheels and other elements of the earlier power generation system remain to the south wall of the shed. Two small in-ground concrete blending tanks stand to the middle of this area of the shed. Each tank has a low, rounded, concrete upstand supporting concrete posts to each corner linked by hollow metal rails. A large three chamber concrete storage tank runs along the north side of the shed. The tank has deep in- ground chambers with concrete walls rising about above shed floor level. The flat concrete top has a number of lidded access hatches. A cut-away portion in the side of the tank allows a view into the middle chamber. Modern equipment including stainless steel storage vats, bottling equipment and cold storage is not considered to be significant. The cellar is dug into the ground below the front part of the shed and is accessed from the middle barrel storage area by a set of concrete stairs descending below the excise officer's podium. A narrow corrugated iron sheeted chute incorporating a timber ladder drops into the cellar on the south side of the projecting front office cubicle. Rows of rough unsawn posts support timber beams carrying the framing for the floor above. Barrels rest on timber racks standing on the part concrete, part dirt floor. Perimeter retaining walls to the north and south are timber framed and lined with corrugated iron and those to the east and west are constructed of concrete and timber. A set of timber stairs to east side climbs to the tasting area above. = Distillery = The distillery shed is a rectangular timber framed corrugated iron clad building sheltered by a corrugated iron clad gabled roof. To the south, a small rectangular roof sheltering the distillery apparatus projects above the main roof. Both gable ends of the shed are infilled with horizontal timber weatherboards and fixed timber louvres run around the upper parts of the walls. The timber frame is a combination of sawn studs, beams and battens and adzed and unsawn timber posts. A skillion roof projects from the south side of the building sheltering the firebox hatch. The distillery shed accommodates a storage room over a cellar to the north and a distillery room to the south. A braced and ledged timber door in the middle of the north elevation opens into the unlined storage area which has a timber floor. Fixed timber louvers run around the upper west, north and east walls. A metal grate stands immediately inside the entrance. A door on the east side opens into the still room where from the northwest corner a set of steep timber stairs to the cellar. The cellar has timber framed walls clad with corrugated iron set into the earth surrounding it. In the distillery room, two copper boilers - one higher than the other - are set into a stepped rectangular brick frame which houses a firebox and stands against the south wall onto the dirt floor. A brick chimney extends out of the firebox and through the roof at the southwest corner. The firebox is accessed through a metal hatch on the external south wall. The hatch bears the maker's nameplate - Harvey & Son Engineers Brisbane. Each boiler is fitted with a tall copper cylinder standing perpendicularly over it, the whole crowned by a horizontal chamber just below the ceiling. The boilers are connected by a copper inverted U-tube and a number of cocks and tubes are worked within the apparatus which is held within a timber frame. A small timber ladder provides access to the upper part. To the front of the apparatus a cock regulates tubes that connect to the cellar below, running within a timber frame in the middle of the dirt floor. = Equipment = Equipment associated with earlier wine making practices has been retained and is displayed for visitors. This includes basket presses in the tasting/sales area and concrete fermentation tanks in the yard.  Heritage listing  Romavilla Winery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 August 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Romavilla Winery demonstrates a continuity of use from the 1870s and is important for its association with early attempts to establish a Queensland wine-making industry. Immigrant agriculturalists experimented with grape-growing in Queensland wherever soil and climate were considered suitable, and for many decades in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the Roma area was one of the principal grape-producing districts in Queensland. Although wine production is no longer a significant industry in the Maranoa, viticulture was one of the earliest commercial agricultural activities in the Roma district and wine production one its earliest agriculture-based industries. The first commercial wine in this district was produced at Romavilla Vineyards in the 1860s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As a rare surviving early winery in Queensland that has retained much of its building and some early equipment, the place is important in demonstrating aspects of Queensland's manufacturing history that are no longer common. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. With further investigation the surviving early fabric, Romavilla Winery, informed by the firm's early business records (held in the State Library of Queensland), has the potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's early wine-producing industry. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Romavilla Winery is the oldest still-operating winery in Queensland, and retains much fabric important in illustrating the principal characteristics of a late nineteenth and early twentieth century winery.

He was a member of the royal clergy, the clergy in the personal service of the King of Norway and the effective state administration in the Middle Ages, and was one of the six canons at St Mary's Church, the royal chapel in Oslo and the seat of government of Norway. Together with the other canons and the provost, he was a member of the cathedral chapter of St Mary's Church. The provost ex officio also held the office of Chancellor of Norway, with one of the canons serving as Vice-Chancellor; it is unknown if Hans Olufsson served as Vice-Chancellor. As decreed by Haakon V of Norway in a 1300 royal proclamation, the canons of St Mary's Church held the rank and privileges of a Knight, the highest rank of nobility in Norway since 1308 and typically reserved for noblemen with a significant national political role.Gave- og stadfestingsbrev fra kong H√•kon Magnusson til Mariakirken i Oslo Hans Olufsson is first mentioned in 1542 as a canon at St Mary's Church, and undoubtedly was a priest both before and after the Reformation in Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Holstein. As indicated by his patronymic, Hans Olufsson's father was named Oluf. Due to his career as a member of the royal clergy, he almost certainly had a privileged family background. Most canons in Norway at the time were recruited from the lower nobility, and normally studied at universities abroad, which was normally only possible with an affluent background. Hans Olufsson held a prebend (estate held for his lifetime), the prebend of Saint Mary's altar sub lectorio, also known as the prebend of Dillevik,Anton Christian Bang, Oslo domkapitels altre og pr√¶bender efter reformationen, Jacob Dybwad, 1893 that included the income of 43 church properties (36 huder, hides) in Eastern Norway. After 1545, when the cathedral chapter of St Mary's Church was dissolved, Hans Olufsson served as a priest at Oslo Cathedral, but retained his prebend affiliated with the estate of St Mary's Church. He died on the night between 17 and 18 September 1570 and was buried in Oslo Cathedral on 19 September. Following his death, his prebend passed to Jens Nilss√∏n, the noted Oslo humanist and later Bishop of Oslo.S. H. Finne-Gr√∏nn (1943). Slekten Paus : dens oprindelse og 4 f√∏rste generasjoner. Oslo: Cammermeyer. Hans Olufsson's son, as documented by court proceedings from 1602, was Povel Hansson (born ca. 1545‚Äì50), who was a merchant in Oslo. According to genealogist S.H. Finne-Gr√∏nn, Povel Hansson was almost certainly the father of the priests Hans Povelsson Paus (1587‚Äì1648) and Peder Povelsson Paus (1590‚Äì1653), two brothers from Oslo who were the progenitors of the Paus family.

It was designed and built in 1916 by John Hill. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 October 2008.  History  The former Hunter's Emporium at Roma, constructed in 1916, is a large, purpose-designed brick department store situated at a principal intersection (the corner of McDowall and Arthur streets) in the commercial heart of the town. It was the head store and signature building in a chain of western Queensland drapery stores established by John McEwan Hunter (1863-1940), businessman and politician, in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. The town of Roma was established in 1862 as a supply and government administrative centre servicing the Maranoa pastoral district. The extension of the Western railway line to Roma and on to Charleville in the 1880s, linking western Queensland to the coastal ports, combined with the tapping of the vast Great Artesian Basin in the late 1880s and early 1890s, stimulated regional development. By the early 1900s Roma was a substantial town serving a wide and prosperous pastoral and agricultural district, the principal economic activities being sheep and cattle grazing, wheat growing, fruit growing, viticulture and wine making. John McEwan Hunter, 1915 In 1889 JM Hunter, a young Scottish immigrant, took up the management of JP McLeish & Co.'s general store and drapery at 88 McDowall Street in Roma, adjacent to the Queen's Arms Hotel at the corner of McDowall and Arthur streets. In the early 1890s he acquired this business in partnership with EJ Harding, trading as Hunter and Harding drapers, grocers and general merchants. In March 1894 Hunter, in partnership with the manager of the Bank of New South Wales in Roma, Alexander Fairlie Whitehill, acquired title to both the store and the adjacent hotel. About this time the firm of Hunter and Harding became Hunter & Co., storekeepers. By 1896 a branch of Hunter & Co. had been opened at Yeulba, where the firm also operated a sawmill and planning establishment. Further branches were opened at Mitchell (), Wallumbilla (), Jackson (), Miles () and Chinchilla (). By 1930, the firm had become Hunter's Ltd. In February 1916 JM Hunter gained sole title to 86 and 88 McDowall Street. A few months later, on 11 April, a fire destroyed Hunter & Co.'s store, O'Malley's tailor shop and the Queen's Arms Hotel. The fire had started in the rear of Hunter and Co.'s store and the entire building and contents (the latter estimated at ) were destroyed. Hunter rebuilt the general store (1916) and the hotel (1917) as substantial brick structures, but transposed their location, with Hunter & Co.'s new emporium now situated prominently at the corner of McDowall and Arthur streets, and the Queen's Arms Hotel adjacent at 88 McDowall Street. Roma prospered during the first three decades of the twentieth century, despite the impact of World War I (1914-1918), and many of its buildings were reconstructed in brick at this period. Work on erecting Hunter's new emporium commenced in the first week of August 1916 and was completed in late December that year. It was an imposing, two-storeyed brick building, designed and built by local contractor John Hill. The street facades were \\"tastefully worked in selected bands of salt glazed bricks, as also around all doors and window openings ... over the first floor windows has been fitted a plastered cornice about 20 inches and a coping mould about 10 inches with the top finished artistically in scrolls and ball finials\\". The ground floors of both street facades had awnings supported on timber posts, and the McDowall Street elevation featured three island display windows. At the rear of the main structure a single-storeyed rectangular brick building, lit and ventilated by a large roof lantern, accommodated a large show-room and offices, which were accessed from the back of the main shop. A strong room, office and underground cold storage were provided. Local labour and materials were used wherever possible, and the timber fittings, including shelving and pigeon holes, showcases and glass-topped counters, were crafted by Roma cabinet maker and furniture manufacturer John Crawford. The new emporium had electric light, a cash railway and everything needed to make it \\"a thoroughly modern place of business equal to the largest metropolitan establishments\\". The ground floor accommodated the drapery, grocery and ironmongery departments, while the furniture department and bulk store were located on the first floor. Every need of customers from the surrounding district was anticipated, the opening sale advertising \\"General Drapery, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Linos, Carpets, Furnishings, Grocery, Crockery, Ironmongery and Produce\\". As the local press noted, the high capital outlay needed for such an extensive enterprise reflected the proprietors' \\"unbounded faith in the prospects of the district\\". JM Hunter was a prominent businessman in the Maranoa district and was actively involved in the public life of his community and in Queensland politics. He served as an Alderman on the Roma Town Council in 1898 and 1899 and as Mayor of Roma in 1900. He was instrumental in establishing the Roma Co-operative Milling Co. Ltd, which in 1900 constructed the Roma Co-operative Flour Mill and produced Excelsior brand flour until acquired by the Dominion Flour Milling Co. in 1914. He was a President of the Western Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Association, which held its annual show at Roma. He was closely associated with the formation of the Queensland Traders' Association, a leading wholesale trading co-operative with headquarters in Brisbane, of which he was chairman from its inception. In May 1907 JM Hunter was elected Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Maranoa, retaining this seat until 22 October 1919. Affiliated with the Australian Labor Party, he held the position of Secretary for Public Lands in the T. J. Ryan government from 1 June 1915 to 30 April 1918, and then as Minister without office until his appointment in October 1919 as the Queensland Agent-General in London, serving in this position until 1922. JM Hunter had married Ellen Guthrie Moffat in 1890. They had one daughter, Helen Roma Jean, born in 1897. In 1927 Roma Hunter married Vincent Lancelot Victor Bressow in Brisbane. After her father's death in 1940 she and her husband took control of Hunter's Ltd, which remained one of western Queensland's principal retail firms well into the second half of the twentieth century. When the Warrego Highway was sealed in the 1950s the smaller branches (Wallumbilla, Yeulba, Jackson and Chinchilla) became unviable, and were either sold or closed. The Roma store was sold in 1977 to the Anderson family trading as Ace Drapers; the Miles branch was sold in 1984; and the Mitchell branch, managed by Bill McMullen for nearly 30 years, in 2004. In early 2008 Ace Drapers closed the former Hunter's Emporium at 86 McDowall Street, Roma.  Description  The former Hunter's Emporium comprises a two-storeyed brick building with facades to McDowall and Arthur streets, and an attached single-storeyed brick building, fronting Arthur Street, at the rear. A painted and rendered parapet embellished with moulded scrollwork and crowned with ball finials screens two side skillion roofs and a central hipped roof which shelter the two-storey building. The external walls to McDowall and Arthur streets are of red face-brick worked with darker bands of brick which also form the decorative quoining defining the door and window openings. These bands and decorative surrounds are painted white on parts of the Arthur Street elevation. A cantilevered awning surmounted by a row of glass louvres runs along McDowall Street and extends around the corner into Arthur Street. The form of the three street-level island display windows in the McDowall Street elevation remains, but the glazing is not original. The street-level shop windows along Arthur Street are modern. A narrow timber awning supported by decorative timber brackets shades the first floor windows to each street elevation. The soffits are lined with decorative pressed metal. The small rectangular building at the rear (former office and show room), is entered from the back of the shop. It has a hipped roof surmounted by a large roof lantern. The rear loading platform is enclosed with corrugated galvanized iron. The loading area is accessed from the narrow rear service lane. The interior of the ground floor of the store retains fluted timber columns with corbels supporting the beams running the length of the space. The ceiling is lined with decorative pressed metal and the walls are finished in painted plaster. The main staircase to the upper floor is accommodated in the south- east corner and is fitted with square-moulded balusters with a moulded oak handrail. A plainer staircase occupies the south-west corner. The purpose- designed silky oak showcases, other purpose-made shop joinery, and the cash railway system, have been removed from the ground floor.  Heritage listing  The former Hunter's Emporium was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 October 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Hunter's Emporium, a two-storeyed brick department store constructed in 1916 for Roma businessman and MLA for Maranoa, John McEwan Hunter, is important in demonstrating the consolidation of Roma as a major regional centre during the first three decades of the twentieth century, when many of the principal buildings in the town were being rebuilt in brick, and provides evidence of the quality of design and manufacturing skills available in Roma at this period. As the headquarters and signature building for a chain of western Queensland drapery and general stores established by Hunter and Co. (later Hunter's Ltd) in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the building is important in illustrating the provision and expansion of general retailing in regional Queensland, in particular reflecting the growth of western Queensland at this period. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place remains substantially intact and is significant as a rare surviving, early twentieth century masonry department store in a Queensland regional centre, one of a small group of similar establishments which includes: the former Daking-Smith & Co. Department Store (, Pollard's Store) in Charters Towers; the former Boland's Department Store (1912 with 1930s extensions, Bolands Centre) in Cairns; and the former Piggot's Department Store (1909-10 with later additions, Pigott's Building) in Toowoomba. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. In its size and intactness the place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a large regional department store of the early twentieth century, designed to impress. These characteristics include: the prominent location at the corner of two main streets in the heart of a principal regional centre; the substantial nature of the two-storeyed, brick structure; the decorative parapet and other detailing to the street elevations; the extensive use of pressed metal throughout the public areas of the store; the provision of natural lighting via the fenestration in the main elevations and a roof lantern to the rear store; and the store and loading dock facility at the rear of the premises. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Prominently situated on a corner allotment in the principal street of Roma's central business district, the building is significant for the contribution of its form, scale and detail to the historical character of this area and to the Roma townscape. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Hunter's Emporium has a special association with the life and work of John McEwan Hunter, a self-made and successful Roma businessman, local and state politician, and former Agent- General for Queensland. From the mid-1890s Hunter & Co. (later Hunter's Ltd) developed a chain of general and drapery stores in south-west Queensland. The substantial edifice that JM Hunter erected in Roma in 1916 as Hunter's Emporium was the head office and signature building of this chain.

Since their releases in the 1980s, Turner's movies have developed cult followings and are considered to be much sought after collector's items. A copy of Black Devil Doll From Hell is currently archived by the Yale University Library and Turner's other movie was featured as part of a horror film symposium hosted by Yale University in 2016. Turner has expressed interest in creating sequels to both of his movies.  Filmmaking career  Prior to creating Black Devil Doll From Hell and Tales from the QuadeaD Zone, Turner wrote several horror stories and worked in the home remodeling business. He began developing his films during the 1980s after the advent of home video recorders made amateur filmmaking more accessible to non-professional creators and his first film, Black Devil Doll From Hell, was filmed over a period of several years. Turner, who had no prior experience, took a correspondence course in filmmaking before shooting his first movie. During filming Turner began dating his female star, Shirley L. Jones, and the pair's working relationship would continue into Turner's second movie. Turner released his first film through the now-defunct video distributor Hollywood Home Video, who heavily edited the movie prior to its release in 1984. He would later describe the experience as unpleasant, as Turner was unable to tell how many videos the company sold and potentially received far less than what he was actually owed. This led Turner and Jones to release the second film independently. In 1996, rumors surfaced that Turner had been killed in a horrifying car accident. Grief spread among his devotees. Although, by then, DVDs had started to replace VHS as the home entertainment option of choice, Mr. Turner‚Äôs films became some of the most prized VHS horror titles among fans who treasured the low-fi beauty of a chunky plastic box of tape. https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/movies/chester-novell-turner-and- black-devil-doll-are-back.html  Post-filmmaking career  After releasing both films, Turner shifted his focus back to his home remodeling business and to raising a family. He remained unaware that his movies had achieved a cult following, as his fanbase was unable to locate him until about 2013, when Louis Justin of Massacre Video tracked Turner down in order to gain permission to release both films to DVD. Prior to Justin locating Turner many fans believed that Turner died in a car accident in the 1990s, a rumor that was only disspelled after Turner began making public appearances.

During the stationary mode (working at constant nominal power), the fuel temperature is always constant (solid black line), and the propellant is coming cold (blue dotted lines) heated in the chamber and exhausted in the nozzle (red dotted line). When amplification in thrust or specific impulse is required, the nuclear core is \\"switched on\\" to a pulsed mode. In this mode, the fuel in continuously quenched and instantaneously heated by the pulses. Once the requirements for high thrust and specific impulse are not required, the nuclear core is \\"switched on\\" to the initial stationary mode. A pulsed nuclear thermal rocket is a type of nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) concept developed at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Spain and presented at the 2016 AIAA/SAE/ASEE Propulsion Conference for thrust and specific impulse (Isp) amplification in a conventional nuclear thermal rocket. The pulsed nuclear thermal rocket is a bimodal rocket able to work in a stationary (at constant nominal power as in a conventional NTR), and as well as a pulsed mode as a TRIGA-like reactor, making possible the production of high power and an intensive neutron flux in short time intervals. In contrast to nuclear reactors where velocities of the coolant are no larger than a few meter per second and thus, typical residence time is on seconds, however, in rockets chambers with subsonic velocities of the propellant around hundreds of meters per second, residence time are around 10^{-2}s to :10^{-3}s and then a long power pulse translates into an important gain in energy in comparison with the stationary mode. The gained energy by pulsing the nuclear core can be used for thrust amplification by increasing the propellant mass flow, or using the intensive neutron flux to produce a very high specific impulse amplification ‚Äì even higher than the fission-fragment rocket, where in the pulsed rocket the final propellant temperature is only limited by the radiative cooling after the pulsation.  Statement of the concept  A rough calculation for the energy gain by using a pulsed thermal nuclear rocket in comparison with the conventional stationary mode, is as follows. The energy stored into the fuel after a pulsation, is the sensible heat stored because the fuel temperature increase. This energy may be written as :E_\\\\text{pulse} = c_fM_f \\\\Delta T where: :E_\\\\text{pulse} is the sensible heat stored after pulsation, :c_f is the fuel heat capacity, :M_\\\\text{f} is the fuel mass, :\\\\Delta T is the temperature increase between pulsations. On the other hand, the energy generated in the stationary mode, i.e., when the nuclear core operates at nominal constant power is given by :E_\\\\text{stationary} = \\\\chi_ll t where: :\\\\chi_l is the linear power of the fuel (power per length of fuel), :l is the length of the fuel, :t is the residence time of the propellant in the chamber. Also, for the case of cylindrical geometries for the nuclear fuel we have :M_f= \\\\pi R_f^2l\\\\rho_f and the linear power given by :\\\\chi_l= 4\\\\pi\\\\kappa_f(T_f-T_s) Where: :R_f is the radius of the cylindrical fuel, :\\\\rho_f the fuel density, :\\\\kappa_f the fuel thermal conductivity, :T_f is the fuel temperature at the center line, :T_s is the surface or cladding temperature. Therefore, the energy ratio between the pulsed mode and the stationary mode, N=\\\\frac{E_\\\\text{pulse}}{E_\\\\text{stationary}} yields : N= \\\\frac{c_f\\\\rho_f R_f^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\kappa_f(T_f-T_s)}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Delta T}{t} \\\\right] Where the term inside the bracket, \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Delta T}{t} \\\\right] is the quenching rate. Typical average values of the parameters for common nuclear fuels as MOX fuel or uranium dioxide are: heat capacities, thermal conductivity and densities around c_f\\\\simeq 300J/(mol\\\\cdot K), \\\\kappa_f\\\\simeq 6W/(K\\\\cdot m^2) and \\\\rho_f\\\\simeq 10^4 kg/(m^3), respectively., with radius close to R_f\\\\simeq 10^{-2} m, and the temperature drop between the center line and the cladding on T_f-T_s=600 K or less (which result in linear power on \\\\chi_l\\\\simeq 45000 W/m). With these values the gain in energy is approximately given by: : N\\\\simeq 6\\\\times 10^{-3}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Delta T}{t} \\\\right] where \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Delta T}{t} \\\\right] is given in K/s . Because the residence time of the propellant in the chamber is on 10^{-3} s to 10^{-2} s considering subsonic velocities of the propellant of hundreds of meters per second and meter chambers, then, with temperatures differences on \\\\Delta T \\\\simeq 10^3 K or quenching rates on \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Delta T}{t}\\\\right] \\\\simeq 10^6 K/s energy amplification by pulsing the core could be thousands times larger than the stationary mode. More rigorous calculations considering the transient heat transfer theory shows energy gains around hundreds or thousands times, i.e., 10^2\\\\leq N\\\\leq 10^3. Quenching rates on \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Delta T}{t}\\\\right]\\\\geq 10^6 K/s are typical in the technology for production of amorphous metal, where extremely rapid cooling in the order of 10^6 K/s \\\\leq \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Delta T}{t}\\\\right]\\\\leq 10^7 K/s are required. Direct thrust amplification The most direct way to harness the amplified energy by pulsing the nuclear core is by increasing the thrust via increasing the propellant mass flow. Increasing the thrust in the stationary mode -where power is fixed by thermodynamic constraints, is only possible by sacrificing exhaust velocity. In fact, the power is given by :P = \\\\frac{1}{2}F v_\\\\text{e} where P is the power, F is the thrust and v_\\\\text{e} the exhaust velocity. On the other hand, thrust is given by :F= \\\\dot{m}_\\\\text{p} v_\\\\text{e} where \\\\dot{m}_\\\\text{p} is the propellant mass flow. Thus, if it is desired to increase the thrust, say, n-times in the stationary mode, it will be necessary to increase n^2-times the propellant mass flow, and decreasing \\\\frac{1}{n}-times the exhaust velocity. However, if the nuclear core is pulsed, thrust may be amplified n-times by amplifying the power n-times and the propellant mass flow n-times and keeping constant the exhaust velocity. Isp amplification Pulsed nuclear thermal rocket unit cell concept for Isp amplification. In this cell, hydrogen-propellant is heated by the continuous intense neutronic pulses in the propellant channels. At the same time, the unwanted energy from the fission fragments is removed by a solidary cooling channel with lithium or other liquid metal. The attainment of high exhaust velocity or specific impulse (Isp) is the first concern. The most general expression for the Isp is given by : I_\\\\text{sp} \\\\simeq c\\\\sqrt{T} being c a constant, and T the temperature of the propellant before expansion. However, the temperature of the propellant is related directly with the energy as E\\\\simeq kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant. Thus, : I_\\\\text{sp} \\\\simeq c'\\\\sqrt{E} being c' a constant. In a conventional stationary NTR, the energy E for heating the propellant is almost from the fission fragments which encompass almost the 95% of the total energy, and the faction of energy from prompt neutrons f_\\\\text{n} is only around 5%, and therefore, in comparison, is almost negligible. However, if the nuclear core is pulsed it is able to produce N times more energy than the stationary mode, and then the fraction of prompt neutrons or f_\\\\text{n}N could be equal or larger than the total energy in the stationary mode. Because this neutron energy is directly transported from the fuel into the propellant as kinetic energy, unlike the energy from fission fragments which is transported as heat from the fuel into the propellant, it is not constrained by the second law of thermodynamics, meaning that there is no impediment to transport this energy from the fuel to the propellant even if the fuel is colder than the propellant. In other words, it is possible to make the propellant hotter than the fuel, which is otherwise the very limit of specific impulse in classic NTRs. In summary, if the pulse generates N times more energy than the stationary mode, the Isp amplification is given by : I_\\\\text{sp} \\\\simeq I_\\\\text{sp,o}\\\\sqrt{f_\\\\text{n}N+1} Where: :I_\\\\text{sp} is the amplified specific impulse, : I_\\\\text{sp,o} the specific impulse in the stationary mode, :f_\\\\text{n} the fraction of prompt neutrons, :N the energy amplification by pulsing the nuclear core. With values of N between 10^2 to 10^3 and prompt neutron fractions around f_\\\\text{n}\\\\simeq\\\\frac{1}{20}, , the hypothetical I_\\\\text{sp} amplification attainable makes the concept specially interesting for interplanetary spaceflight. Advantages of the design There are several advantages relative to conventional stationary NTR designs. Because the neutron energy is transported as kinetic energy from the fuel into the propellant, then a propellant hotter than the fuel is possible and therefore the I_\\\\text{sp} is not limited to the maximum temperature permissible by the fuel, i.e., its melting temperature. The other nuclear rocket concept which allows a propellant hotter than the fuel is the fission fragment rocket. Because it directly uses the fission fragments as propellant, it can also achieve a very high specific impulse.  Other considerations  For I_\\\\text{sp} amplification, only the energy from prompt neutrons, and some prompt gamma energy, is used for this purpose. The rest of the energy, i.e., the almost 95\\\\% from fission fragments is unwanted energy and must be continuously evacuated by a heat removal auxiliary system using a suitable coolant. Liquid metals, and particularly lithium, can provide the fast quenching rates required. One aspect to be considered is the large amount of energy which must be evacuated as residual heat (almost 95% of the total energy). This implies a large dedicated heat transfer surface. As regards to the mechanism for pulsing the core, the pulsed mode can be produced using a variety of configurations depending on the desired frequency of the pulsations. For instance, the use of standard control rods in a single or banked configuration with motor driving mechanism or the use of standard pneumatically operated pulsing mechanisms are suitable for generating up to 10 pulses per minute. For the production of pulses at rates up to 50 pulsations per second, the use of rotating wheels introducing alternately neutron poison and fuel or neutron poison and non- neutron poison can be considered. However, for pulsations ranking the thousands of pulses per second (kHz), optical choppers or modern wheels employing magnetic bearings allow to revolve at 10 kHz. If even faster pulsations are desired it would be necessary to make use of a new type of pulsing mechanism that does not involve mechanical motion, for example, lasers (based in the 3He polarization) as early proposed by Bowman, or proton and neutron beams. Frequencies on the order of 1 kHz to 10 kHz are likely choices.

Since the Russian state is of such a vast size and nature that it includes many different seas, long and indented coastlines and a great number of islands, as well as a complex system of waterways and lakes, surveying has been an indispensable activity for the Russian Navy since its modernization at the time of Czar Peter the Great in the 17th century. The hydrographic service has been historically attached to the Russian Navy and the agents and supervisors of hydrographic works have been largely naval officers throughout its history. Russia is a member of the International Hydrographic Organization. Competences and functions The Osinovetsky Lighthouse near the Neva entrance is one of the tallest lighthouses in the world. Despite having undergone a number of name changes along its history, the main functions of the Hydrographic Service of the Russian Navy have been quite consistently the following: *Providing specific services to the Navy, including other branches of the Russian Armed Forces, related to the Russian maritime and coastal areas, as well as navigable inland waters.

Navy Hydrographic Service - Structure - Russian Ministry of Defence History Russian Admiralty (1716) =Background= At the time of Peter I hydrographic surveys were carried out following personal decrees of the emperor through the General admiral. Hydrographic tasks were always performed by Naval officers, who from 1724 onward began to work under instructions from the Admiralty Board. By 1746 important matters concerning hydrography were entrusted to Fleet Captain Alexey Nagayev who compiled the first atlas of the Bering Sea, as well as of the Baltic Sea in 1752. Nagayev's charts were very detailed for its time and, despite a few shortcomings, his atlas of the Baltic Sea was republished in 1757, 1788, 1789 and 1795, serving Russian mariners for more than 50 years. =Foundation and first phase (1777-1885)= Flag of the Hydrographer General (1828) Alexander Menshikov In 1777 the Admiralty Board founded the Russian Hydrographic Service, implementing a plan that marked the beginning of systematic drawing of nautical charts.–° —ç—Ç–æ–π —á–µ—Ä—Ç–µ–∂–Ω–æ–π –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–æ—Å—å —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∫–∞—Ä—Ç –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, –∞ –¥–∞—Ç–∞ —É—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è —à—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ —á–µ—Ä—Ç–µ–∂–Ω–æ–π ‚Äî 2 (13) –Ω–æ—è–±—Ä—è 1777 –≥. ‚Äî —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –¥–∞—Ç–æ–π –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –Ω—ã–Ω–µ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–µ–≥–æ –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–ú–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –§–ª–æ—Ç–∞. In 1799 a committee for the dissemination of marine sciences and the improvement of the drawing of charts was created, and in 1807 the Russian Lighthouse Administration was established so that the lighthouse system in Russian shores, shoals and islands would follow an organized pattern and be provided with regular, state-controlled maintenance. The first director of this section was Leontiy Spafaryev.Igor Alexeev, Lighthouses of the Baltic Sea In 1827 the special Office of the Hydrographer General was established. In the same year the Corps of Naval Navigators was founded, the chief of which was also a hydrographer. The first and only general of the newly-instituted body was hydrographer Admiral Gavril Andreevich Sarychev (in office 1827-31), after whose death the management of the office was transferred to the Chief of Naval Staff Prince A. S. Menshikov. The first and only director of the hydrographic depot was F. F. Schubert (in office 1827-37).Russian Hydrography before 1917 In 1837 the former institutions dealing with hydrography were abolished and all the management of the hydrographic section was transferred to the newly- instituted Russian Hydrographic Department, the directors of which were: *A.

The period between 1885 and 1917 was characterized by full-scale construction and modernization of lighthouse equipment, compass technology and improvements in the printing of nautical charts. The 1910-1915 Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition, led by Rear Admiral Boris A. Vilkitsky on icebreakers Vaigach and Taimyr mapped the last blank areas of the northern coast of Eastern Siberia ‚Äîwhich were the last unmapped coastal areas of Eurasia, and gathered as well a vast amount of oceanographic and meteorological data.The Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition 1910-1915 The heads of the Main Hydrographic Office were: *Konstantin Mikhailov (1898-1903) *Yakov Gilterbrandt (1903-1907) *Andrey Vilkitsky (1907-1913) *M.

The Ubek regulated the particular hydrographic zone ‚Äîin Arkhangelsk for example it was 'Ubek-North'‚Äî as part of the unified local authority directly responsible to the central Soviet government. In 1924 the Hydrographic Office was renamed the 'Central Hydrographic Department of the USSR' and a set of new flags and pennants was issued. Barely two years later, in September 1926, the office underwent another name change; the new name was \\"Hydrographic Department of the Office of Naval Forces of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\\" (UVMS Hydrographic Department of the Red Army) ‚Äî–ì–∏–¥—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–∏–ª –†–∞–±–æ—á–µ- –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ê—Ä–º–∏–∏.

Vilkitsky's expedition, which in 1913 sighted and surveyed a section of the eastern coastline of what he assumed was a single landmass, had to concentrate on the Siberian continental shore in order to prepare the way for the Northeast Passage and he had no means to make a comprehensive survey further north.Alfred S. McLaren, Unknown Waters: A First-Hand Account of the Historic Under-ice Survey of the Siberian Continental Shelf by USS Queenfish (SSN-651), University of Alabama Press 2008, , p. 130 Finally a hydrographic expedition of the Arctic Institute of the USSR led by Georgy Ushakov and Nikolay Urvantsev thoroughly surveyed the large Severnaya Zemlya archipelago in 1930‚Äì32, making it the last sizable territory on Earth to be put on the map. In 1935 the Ubek were replaced by hydrographic offices subordinate to the commander of the fleets and flotillas. In 1937 the 'Hydrographic Office UVMS Red Army' was renamed the \\"Hydrographic Office of the Workers' and Peasants' Navy\\" ‚Äî–ì–∏–¥—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –†–∞–±–æ—á–µ-–∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–ª–æ—Ç–∞ (–†–ö –í–ú–§).

The following year, owing to the dire situation of the Great Patriotic War (1941-1945), a Task Force in the Hydrographic Department of the Navy was formed in Moscow by the Chief of the General Staff in order to deal more effectively with the emergency matters caused by the war in Russian soil and waters. In postwar times, after the initial period of reconstruction was over, the Soviet Navy began the challenging task of creating an oceanic fleet carrying nuclear weapons. The 1960-1970 decade saw the introduction and development of ballistic missile submarines as part of the strategical aims of the Soviet fleet. These submarines were designed to be able to navigate in all areas of the oceans, including in the Arctic Ocean under the ice cover. In the field of navigation, during this period radar reflectors, radio beacons and other modernized signal systems were introduced. The technological leap of that decade would impose a radical change in the navigational, hydrographic and hydrometeorological support of the Navy. During this period the need for innovative and detailed survey and mapping of the Earth's geophysics, including gravity and magnetic fields, became of the utmost importance for the Hydrographic Service of the Soviet Union. At that time, using its survey vessels, the department spearheaded a comprehensive study of large areas of the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, as well as of the then little explored Southern Ocean off the coast of Antarctica. As a result, a huge volume of data on bottom topography, physical fields, and hydrophysical characteristics of the water masses, among other pioneering oceanographic information of the oceans, were collected. In 1972, owing to Cold War dictated priorities, the Hydrographic Office of the Navy was overhauled and transformed into the 'General Directorate of Navigation and Oceanography of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR' ‚Äî–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞–≤–∏–≥–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∏ –æ–∫–µ–∞–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏ –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –°–°–°–† (–ì–£–ù–∏–û –ú–û).

These ships were usually renamed and overhauled or transformed before being put into use, for example the GS-13 small hydrographic vessel that had been launched in 1986 in Soviet Lithuania became the Pereyaslav (U512) when it was made part of the Ukrainian Navy in November 1995. Although the basic designs were left unchanged, prominent Communist-era symbols ‚Äîsuch as the hammer and sickle and the red star, were removed from the flags of the Russian Hydrographic Service and the blue and white Russian Navy Ensign was restored. In 2001 a new regulation introduced slight alterations in the symbols that had been adopted in 1992 following the fall of the USSR. In 2006 the name of the Russian Hydrographic Service would be changed to 'Department of Navigation and Oceanography of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation' ‚Äî–£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞–≤–∏–≥–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∏ –æ–∫–µ–∞–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏ –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –û–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ (–£–ù–∏–û –ú–∏–Ω–æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏), its current official name. Russian military presence in Arctic waters resumed in the summer of 2013 when Hydrographic Service vessels belonging to the Northern Fleet sailed to Rudolf Island in Franz Josef Land. The area had been neglected by the armed forces for a long time in the years that followed the fall of the USSR.RT - Russian military resumes permanent Arctic presence (14 September 2013) The heads of the Hydrographic Service of the Russian Federation in recent times have been: *Yuri Zheglov (1988-1994) *Anatoly Komaritsyn (1994-2006) *Sergey Kozlov (2006-2010) *Alexander Shemetov (2010-2013) *Sergey Travin (2013-) Vessels The vessels operating for the Russian Hydrographic Service have been historically of two orders or categories. To the first category belong those vessels that were built specifically as survey ships, of which there are different classes, and to the second, other kind of vessels of the Russian Navy that, although not especially built for the purpose, have eventually engaged in survey operations. The latter usually undertook surveys for specific periods of time during their naval service, such as the a four-masted tall ship Kruzenshtern, which performed hydrographic surveys between 1961 and 1965.L.

In a sequential first-price auction (SAFP), each individual item is sold using a first price auction, while in a sequential second-price auction (SASP), each individual item is sold using a second price auction. A sequential auction differs from a combinatorial auction, in which many items are auctioned simultaneously and the agents can bid on bundles of items. A sequential auction is much simpler to implement and more common in practice. However, the bidders in each auction know that there are going to be future auctions, and this may affect their strategic considerations. Here are some examples. Example 1. There are two items for sale and two potential buyers: Alice and Bob, with the following valuations: * Alice values each item as 5, and both items as 10 (i.e., her valuation is additive). * Bob values each item as 4, and both items as 4 (i.e., his valuation is unit demand). In a SASP, each item is put to a second- price-auction. Usually, such auction is a truthful mechanism, so if each item is sold in isolation, Alice wins both items and pays 4 for each item, her total payment is 4+4=8 and her net utility is 5 + 5 ‚àí 8 = 2\\\\. But, if Alice knows Bob's valuations, she has a better strategy: she can let Bob win the first item (e.g. by bidding 0). Then, Bob will not participate in the second auction at all, so Alice will win the second item and pay 0, and her net utility will be 5 ‚àí 0 = 5\\\\. A similar outcome happens in a SAFP. If each item is sold in isolation, there is a Nash equilibrium in which Alice bids slightly above 4 and wins, and her net utility is slightly below 2. But, if Alice knows Bob's valuations, she can deviate to a strategy that lets Bob win in the first round so that in the second round she can win for a price slightly above 0. Example 2. Multiple identical objects are auctioned, and the agents have budget constraints. It may be advantageous for a bidder to bid aggressively on one object with a view to raising the price paid by his rival and depleting his budget so that the second object may then be obtained at a lower price. In effect, a bidder may wish to ‚Äúraise a rival‚Äôs costs‚Äù in one market in order to gain advantage in another. Such considerations seem to have played a significant role in the auctions for radio spectrum licenses conducted by the Federal Communications Commission. Assessment of rival bidders‚Äô budget constraints was a primary component of the pre-bidding preparation of GTE‚Äôs bidding team.  Nash equilibrium  A sequential auction is a special case of a sequential game. A natural question to ask for such a game is when there exists a subgame perfect equilibrium in pure strategies (SPEPS). When the players have full information (i.e., they know the sequence of auctions in advance), and a single item is sold in each round, a SAFP always has a SPEPS, regardless of the players' valuations. The proof is by backward induction: * In the last round, we have a simple first price auction. It has a pure- strategy Nash equilibrium in which the highest-value agent wins by bidding slightly above the second-highest value. * In each previous round, the situation is a special case of a first-price auction with externalities. In such an auction, each agent may gain value, not only when he wins, but also when other agents win. In general, the valuation of agent i is represented by a vector v_i[1],\\\\dots,v_i[n], where v_i[j] is the value of agent i when agent j wins. In a sequential auction, the externalities are determined by the equilibrium outcomes in the future rounds. In the introductory example, there are two possible outcomes: ** If Alice wins the first round, then the equilibrium outcome in the second round is that Alice buys an item worth $5 for $4,In fact, Alice may pay slightly more than $4 (e.g, if the bids are in whole cents, Alice may pay $4.01). For simplicity, we ignore this infinitesimal difference. so her net gain is $1. Therefore, her total value for winning the first round is v_\\\\text{Alice}[\\\\text{Alice}] = 5+1 = 6. ** If Bob wins the first round, then the equilibrium outcome in the second round is that Alice buys an item worth $5 for $0, so her net gain is $5. Therefore, her total value for letting Bob win is v_\\\\text{Alice}[\\\\text{Bob}] = 0+5 = 5. * Each first-price auction with externalities has a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. In the above example, the equilibrium in the first round is that Bob wins and pays $1. * Therefore, by backward induction, each SAFP has a pure-strategy SPE. Notes: * The existence result also holds for SASP. In fact, any equilibrium-outcome of a first-price auction with externalities is also an equilibrium-outcome of a second-price auction with the same externalities. * The existence result holds regardless of the valuations of the bidders ‚Äì they may have arbitrary utility functions on indivisible goods. In contrast, if all auctions are done simultaneously, a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium does not always exist, even if the bidders have subadditive utility functions.  Social welfare  Once we know that a subgame perfect equilibrium exists, the next natural question is how efficient it is ‚Äì does it obtain the maximum social welfare? This is quantified by the price of anarchy (PoA) ‚Äì the ratio of the maximum attainable social welfare to the social welfare in the worst equilibrium. In the introductory Example 1, the maximum attainable social welfare is 10 (when Alice wins both items), but the welfare in equilibrium is 9 (Bob wins the first item and Alice wins the second), so the PoA is 10/9. In general, the PoA of sequential auctions depends on the utility functions of the bidders. The first five results apply to agents with complete information (all agents know the valuations of all other agents): Case 1: Identical items. There are several identical items. There are two bidders. At least one of them has a concave valuation function (diminishing returns). The PoA of SASP is at most 1/(1-e) \\\\approx 1.58. Numerical results show that, when there are many bidders with concave valuation functions, the efficiency loss decreases as the number of users increases. Case 2: Additive bidders. The items are different, and all bidders regard all items as independent goods, so their valuations are additive set functions. The PoA of SASP is unbounded ‚Äì the welfare in a SPEPS might be arbitrarily small. Case 3: Unit-demand bidders. All bidders regard all items as pure substitute goods, so their valuations are unit demand. The PoA of SAFP is at most 2 ‚Äì the welfare in a SPEPS is at least half the maximum (if mixed strategies are allowed, the PoA is at most 4). In contrast, the PoA in SASP is again unbounded. These results are surprising and they emphasize the importance of the design decision of using a first-price auction (rather than a second-price auction) in each round. Case 4: submodular bidders. The bidders' valuations are arbitrary submodular set functions (note that additive and unit-demand are special cases of submodular). In this case, the PoA of both SAFP and SASP is unbounded, even when there are only four bidders. The intuition is that the high-value bidder might prefer to let a low-value bidder win, in order to decrease the competition that he might face in the future rounds. Case 5: additive+UD. Some bidders have additive valuations while others have unit-demand valuations. The PoA of SAFP might be at least \\\\min(n,m), where m is the number of items and n is the number of bidders. Moreover, the inefficient equilibria persist even under iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies. This implies linear inefficiency for many natural settings, including: * Bidders with gross substitute valuations, * capacitated valuations, * budget-additive valuations, * additive valuations with hard budget constraints on the payments. Case 6: unit-demand bidders with incomplete information. The agents do not know the valuations of the other agents, but only the probability-distribution from which their valuations are drawn. The sequential auction is then a Bayesian game, and its PoA might be higher. When all bidders have unit demand valuations, the PoA of a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a SAFP is at most 3.  Revenue maximization  An important practical question for sellers selling several items is how to design an auction that maximizes their revenue. There are several questions: * 1. Is it better to use a sequential auction or a simultaneous auction? Sequential auctions with bids announced between sales seem preferable because the bids may convey information about the value of objects to be sold later. The auction literature shows that this information effect increases the seller‚Äôs expected revenue since it reduces the winner's curse. However, there is also a deception effect which develops in the sequential sales. If a bidder knows that his current bid will reveal information about later objects then he has an incentive to underbid. * 2. If a sequential auction is used, in what order should the items be sold in order to maximize the seller's revenue? Suppose there are two items and there is a group of bidders who are subject to budget constraints. The objects have common values to all bidders but need not be identical, and may be either complement goods or substitute goods. In a game with complete information: * 1. A sequential auction yields more revenue than a simultaneous ascending auction if: (a) the difference between the items' values is large, or (b) there are significant complementarities. A hybrid simultaneous-sequential form yields higher revenue than the sequential auction. * 2. If the objects are sold by means of a sequence of open ascending auctions, then it is always optimal to sell the more valuable object first (assuming the objects' values are common knowledge). Moreover, budget constraints may arise endogenously. I.e, a bidding company may tell its representative \\"you may spend at most X on this auction\\", although the company itself has much more money to spend. Limiting the budget in advance gives the bidders some strategic advantages. When multiple objects are sold, budget constraints can have some other unanticipated consequences. For example, a reserve price can raise the seller‚Äôs revenue even though it is set at such a low level that it is never binding in equilibrium.  Composeable mechanisms  Sequential-auctions and simultaneous-auctions are both special case of a more general setting, in which the same bidders participate in several different mechanisms. Syrgkanis and Tardos suggest a general framework for efficient mechanism design with guaranteed good properties even when players participate in multiple mechanisms simultaneously or sequentially. The class of smooth mechanisms ‚Äì mechanisms that generate approximately market clearing prices ‚Äì result in high-quality outcome both in equilibrium and in learning outcomes in the full information setting, as well as in Bayesian equilibrium with uncertainty about participants. Smooth mechanisms compose well: smoothness locally at each mechanism implies global efficiency. For mechanisms where good performance requires that bidders do not bid above their value, weakly smooth mechanisms can be used, such as the Vickrey auction. They are approximately efficient under the no-overbidding assumption, and the weak smoothness property is also maintained by composition. Some of the results are valid also when participants have budget constraints.

It is bordered by suburbs of The Gardens on the east and Manurewa on the south. It was formerly part of Manukau City until the 2010 amalgamation of all of Auckland's councils, and is now under the governance of Auckland Council. In 2016 Auckland Council recognised Hillpark as a Special Character Area. The key characteristics of the area include International Style modernist houses, mid-20th century brick and tile bungalows, Arts and Crafts influenced houses, and English Cottage style houses. The area features large open front yards and setbacks, large lots, wide roads, low densities of buildings, and an abundance of trees. Houses were generally constructed from the late 1950s to 1970s following the creation of a garden subdivision around significant stands of native forest. Hillpark suburb is a native sanctuary, which is home to large areas of native forest and parkland including Orford Park, David Park and Hillcrest Grove Reserve. In September 2020 The New Zealand Geographic Board NgƒÅ Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa (NZGB) announced public consultations to officially name Hillpark in Manurewa, Auckland, as a suburb with defined boundaries The NZGB considered a Hillpark Residents' Association proposal to make official the suburb name at its meeting in July, 2020. The Association described its unique natural and heritage characteristics which have helped build a suburban identity and which should be recognised. .  History  In 1910, David Laurence Nathan, son of prominent merchant David Nathan, and his wife Simone built their summer residence in Manurewa and named the property ‚ÄòThe Hill‚Äô. In 1961, with the development of the Auckland Southern Motorway, the estate was sold to accommodate residential growth in South Auckland. The land around the Nathan home was developed as the subdivision named \\"Hillpark Estate\\", while David Nathan Park and Homestead were held as public assets at the request of the Nathan family. The first sections of the Hillpark subdivision went on the market on 2 December 1961. The advertisement from South Auckland Courier in 1961 advertised Hillpark as a modern subdivision \\"developed in accordance with overseas practice in having all underground services, selected street lanterns, spacious proposed neighbourhood shopping area and extensive public reserves\\". The southern motorway extension between Redoubt Road and Takanini was formally opened on 30 May 1963. It included northern on and off ramps at Hill Road. Aerial view of Hillpark subdivision - Nathan Homestead and Hill road - 1961  Area landmarks  = The Nathan Homestead = The Nathan Homestead is a historic mansion built in 1925 and is situated on nine acres of lawn and gardens. This landmark is situated in Hill Rd, Hillpark. The original summer residence of Nathan family was built in 1910 but was destroyed by fire in 1923 and a new permanent residence was rebuilt on the same site in 1925. The former Manukau Borough Council acquired the homestead and surrounding gardens in 1961. It later served as Manukau City Council offices before being restored and reopened as a community and cultural centre in 1978. = Orford Lodge = The Orford Lodge is situated on 8-10 Earls Court, Hillpark. The house was built in 1910 by a lawyer, Mr Edward Russell. It is listed as Grade II historical and architectural merit. The lodge itself shows the hallmarks of the architecture of its time, strongly influenced by Arts and Crafts architect James Walter Chapman-Taylor. The house and 9ha of land were bought for ¬£12,000 in 1928 by Robert Horace Walpole, 5th Earl of Orford. During the Second World War, the lodge and grounds were used by the US Army. The lodge and land were bought by the Manurewa Borough Council in 1961. The lodge and some of the land was sold but the native bush surrounding the property was designated as a council Orford Park. The house is currently a privately owned residence . = Hillpark Native Forest Remnants = Mature native forest is now very rare in urban Auckland. Some examples of mature totara, puriri, kahikatea, pukatea, and kanuka forest are found in a cluster of council reserves in Hillpark. These include the Hillcrest Grove Reserve (73 Hill Road, Hillpark), Orford Park (40 Hill Road, Hillpark), and David Nathan Park (68 Hill Road, Hillpark). The Native forest parks of Hillpark along with the nearby Auckland Botanic Gardens are the home of native and introduced birds tui, rosella, kereru, and morepork.

The trio became an unofficial side project of Fnatic manager Danijel \\"StreeT\\" Remus. After changes in the existing Fnatic Heroes of Newerth roster and the performance of N0tail and his friends, the group merged with the original Fnatic players Henrik \\"FreshPro\\" Hansen and Kalle \\"Trixi\\" Saarinen. Soon, the squad began to achieve wins in online tournaments, obtaining their first LAN victory in DreamHack Winter 2011. Along with his team Johan was able to secure 1st place victories in four consecutive DreamHack events. = Dota 2 = Due to decreasing activity in the professional Heroes of Newerth scene, N0tail decided to transfer to Fnatic's European Dota 2 team together with Jascha Markuse, Tal Aizik and Adrian Kryeziu on March 30, 2012. After a hard start to DotA, N0tail and his team Fnatic.EU won Thor Open LAN on December 9, 2012, beating No Tidehunter, now known as Alliance. Since Fnatic.EU won the LAN, they mostly dominated the pro scene until The International 2013, in which they placed 7-8th after losing to team Orange, which turned out to currently be the Fnatic squad. One year later after not winning any premier tournaments and placing 13-14th in The International 2014, N0tail announced that he is leaving Fnatic together with Fly to create Team Secret, inviting Puppey, s4, and Kuroky to join. After a number of good finishes in five tournaments, Puppey decided to kick N0tail for Arteezy in preparation of the Dota 2 Asia Championships. N0tail decided to join Cloud9, replacing Aui 2000. Following multiple disappointing finishes and 9-12th place in The International 2015, Cloud9 released its squad. On August 28, 2015, it was announced that N0tail together with his teammate Fly which was also kicked from Team Secret have created (monkey) Business, a team featuring Miracle-, MoonMeander, Cr1t-, Fly, and N0tail. Following promising performances, (monkey) Business proceeded to become OG. Despite a slow start during The International 2018's group stage, OG finished fourth and were seeded into the upper bracket of the main event. Considered underdogs during their entire time at the event, OG and Sundstein advanced to the grand finals and won the tournament by defeating PSG.LGD in the best-of-five series 3‚Äì2.

Life Hunt was born in Philadelphia in 1812 to William and Mary Master. She moved to Waterloo in New York in 1845 when she married fellow Quaker Richard Pell Hunt, a prominent local businessman and landowner. As progressive Quakers, Hunt and her husband were believers in social reform and humanitarian causes. They were both active supporters of abolitionism and the women's rights movement. Hunt's home in Waterloo is thought to have functioned as a station of the Underground Railroad, with a carriage house that was converted to a way station for fugitive slaves. Women's membership and role was an important topic of discussion in Hunt's Quaker community, and she worked actively to improve women's position in the church. Hunt was one of the members of a local Quaker monthly meeting which proposed removing the official inequality between men's and women's meetings described in the book of discipline; this proposal was adopted at a regional level at the Genesee Yearly Meeting in 1838. Hunt had four children with her husband (one died at childbirth), and was step-mother to Richard's three children from a previous marriage. Richard Hunt died on November 7, 1856. After his death, Hunt continued to live in the family home. The Seneca Falls Convention In 1848, Jane Hunt was part of a group of women who invited the reformer Lucretia Mott to visit New York, with Hunt offering to host the gathering at her home. Mott stayed with her pregnant sister, Martha Wright, who lived in the area.Martha C Wright, nps.gov; retrieved 16 August 2016. Hunt invited a number of Quaker women including Mary Ann M'Clintock as well as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was not a Quaker. The day at Hunt's home was an important re-meeting between Mott and Stanton, who had met eight years before at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. They had both been invited to the convention but they had to suffer the indignity of sitting separately and not being allowed to speak because they were women. As a result of the meeting at Hunt's home on July 9, it was agreed to arrange an open meeting at Seneca Falls later in the month. Hunt and the other women present drafted a call for attendees that was published in the Seneca County Courier on July 14. The assembly that would come to be known as the Seneca Falls Convention is considered to be the first organized meeting about women's rights.Judith Wellman, \\"Jane Hunt\\", Historical New York, National Park Service, Retrieved 16 August 2016 Hunt and her husband were both signatories to the Declaration of Sentiments and attended the Convention. Death Hunt died in Chicago in 1889; her body was buried in Waterloo beside her husband. Legacy Hunt's philanthropy after her husband's death included funding land for a chapel for Saint Paul's Church in Waterloo. The Hunt House is a registered historic site.

Tapestries Eleven Peter S√≠s-designed tapestries have been commissioned by Art for Amnesty founder Bill Shipsey. =Flying Man= The first tapestry, \\"The Flying Man\\" in honour of Czech dramatist, dissident and then President V√°clav Havel, was commissioned in 2012. Following Havel's death in December 2011 Shipsey's long time friend, Czech-born artist Peter S√≠s, created an illustration in memory of Havel for the front page of Czech newspaper Hospod√°≈ôsk√© noviny, commemorating Havel. Shortly thereafter an online campaign to name Prague Airport as the 'Vaclav Havel Airport' began. When this was successful, and the Czech Government decided to name the Airport in Havel's honour, Shipsey came up with the idea to transform S√≠s' image into a giant memorial tapestry for display at the airport. This tapestry was funded by high-profile supporters of Amnesty International: musicians Bono, Edge, Peter Gabriel, Sting and Yoko Ono. The tapestries were hand-woven by Ateliers Pinton, the renowned tapestry weaving atelier in Felletin-Aubusson, France. The resulting 4 by 5 metre tapestry depicts a striking image of a flock of white birds, in the shape of a man, set against a vivid blue background. Beneath him is the silhouette of Prague Castle and the Vltava river. One of the birds at the centre is shown carrying a red heart, a symbol Havel frequently used when signing his name. Karel Schwarzenberg, Czech Foreign Minister at the time, and long time friend of Havel, praised the tapestry, saying, \\"V√°clav Havel would have been glad about it. Of course, he would have been even happier if he had heard that this wonderful gift in his memory was financed by co-artists‚Äîpeople of the same thinking and talent like him. I know how glad he was to meet any artist, be it from abroad or from the Czech Republic, who came to Prague and visited him. That was his life. They were his people.\\" The Flying Man tapestry currently hangs in Terminal 2 at Prague's V√°clav Havel Airport. =Out of the Marvellous= The second tapestry, Out of the Marvellous, was created in honour of Nobel Literature Laureate, Irish poet and long time Amnesty supporter Seamus Heaney. This tapestry, too, is themed around flight. It portrays Heaney flying over Ireland, using a giant book of his poetry as a parachute. The name \\"Out of the Marvellous\\" comes from Heaney's poem \\"Lightenings viii\\". Lines from the poem are woven into the backdrop of the artwork. The tapestry took five months to be woven in Felletin, and measures 4 by 4.5 metres. It was unveiled by one of its patron's singer Paul Simon in April 2014 and hangs at Dublin Airport's T2. Musician The Edge, another funder of the tapestry, along with his bandmate Bono, said, \\"Seamus Heaney was an inspiration to our band‚Äîas well as to politicians, artists, dreamers and all in between, from every corner of the world. I love the idea that the words of this great poet‚Äîand S√≠s's beautiful tapestry‚Äîwill send travellers from Ireland and beyond safely on their way 'out of the marvellous.'\\" Two smaller (2 square metre) versions of the Out of the Marvellous tapestry have been created, one for Poetry Ireland and one for the Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris. =Yellow Submarine= In July 2015, a third monumental tapestry, in memory of musician and activist John Lennon and in gratitude for his wife Yoko Ono and her generosity to Amnesty International, was unveiled at the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration in New York City harbour. It features Manhattan as a yellow submarine with a small John Lennon figure peeping out of the yellow submarine, flashing his famous peace sign. The tapestry is 7.3 metres wide and 3 metres high. It was paid for by Bono, Edge and Jimmy Iovine. =Flying Madiba= In December 2015, a fourth monumental tapestry, measuring 6 X 3 metres, was unveiled and dedicated at Cape Town International Airport. This artwork honours anti-apartheid leader and former South African President Nelson Mandela. It is titled Flying Madiba and was unveiled on December 10, 2015, International Human Rights Day. The tapestry, somewhat similar to Flying Man, depicts a figure flying over South Africa. This tapestry was funded by Bono, Edge, Sting, Peter Gabriel, and John Legend. =Flying Man ll= In July 2016 a fifth large tapestry, and a second honouring Vaclav Havel, was created by Pinton as a modified version of the original design by S√≠s. This tapestry was funded by Czech philanthropists and art patrons Karel Janecek and Libor Winkler. This tapestry is ultimately destined for the main meeting room of the Vaclav Havel Building of the European Parliament in Strasbourg when its renovation is completed in the spring of 2017. Meanwhile, the tapestry will tour and be displayed in the National Czech & Slovak Museum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; at the Bohemian National Hall in New York City; and at DOX Contemporary Art Centre in Prague. The dimensions of the tapestry are 3 metres long and 2 metres high. =Martin Luther King Tapestries= Three further S√≠s-designed Pinton tapestries were created in 2017 to honor Martin Luther King Jr., slain leader of the U.S. civil rights movement. The tapestries were unveiled in Birmingham, Alabama in November 2017. =Hoopoe Tapestry= A small tapestry (two square metres) depicting the Hoopoe Bird was completed in July 2016. The tapestry was created in memory of Iranian lawyer and pro-democracy advocate Abdorrahman Boroumand, who was stabbed to death in the entrance to his apartment in Paris in 1991 by agents of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Peter S√≠s Peter S√≠s is a highly awarded Czech-born American illustrator and children's books writer. He won the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 2012 for his large legacy of children's book illustrations and is an eight-time winner of the New York Times Best Illustrated Book award. He has also been awarded with the American Library Association's Caldecott Honor for the illustrations of his 1996 book, Starry Messenger, the 1998 book Tibet: Through the Red Box, and his 2007 work, The Wall: Growing Up Behind the Iron Curtain. The latter book also received the ALA's 2008 Sibert Medal for the most distinguished informational book for young readers. He has received a Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Award four times: for Komodo (1993), A Small Tall Tale From the Far Far North (1994), Tibet: Through the Red Box (1999), and The Wall: Growing Up Behind the Iron Curtain (2008). He won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis for Tibet: Through the Red Box. S√≠s won the Golden Bear Award at the 1980 West Berlin Film Festival for an animated short. He also won the Grand Prix Toronto and the Cine Golden Eagle Award. In 2012, when Flying Man was unveiled at Prague airport in memory of Havel, S√≠s explained his design to Radio Prague. He said, \\"You look at the sky, you see the flock of birds, you see somebody who can inspire you for one second, and then the birds fly in different directions and then the person is gone, like V√°clav Havel was gone‚Ä¶ I grew up when he was active with Charter 77 and his Helsinki activities. At the same time, we thought we were into rock'n'roll and we thought we that were in opposition too. But only after all these years have I realised that we should have listened more, that he was amazingly brave and smart about what he was doing.\\" Ateliers Pinton Ateliers Pinton have created fine tapestries in Felletin- Aubusson, France since 1867. They use looms that allow weavers create large- scale tapestries. All of Pinton's fibres and threads are dyed in-house; they have a collection of 10,000 shades of yarn. Each Pinton tapestry carries with it a signature \\"bolduc\\", a label describing the carpet or tapestry and its edition number. Pinton was responsible for weaving the original works of L√©ger, Mir√≥, Calder, Delaunay and others, starting in the 1950s.

Saprykin became a Red Army officer and was a regimental assistant chief of staff when he was caught in the Spas- Demensk pocket in October 1941. Saprykin escaped and reached Soviet lines. He was sent to an NKVD filtration camp, where it was decided that Saprykin had committed treason. He was sent to a penal battalion, where he was wounded. Saprykin became a company commander, regimental chief of staff, and battalion commander in the 144th Rifle Division. During December 1943 in battles in eastern Belarus, Saprykin and a small group of soldiers from his battalion reportedly repulsed numerous counterattacks of superior German forces. After three days, he reportedly called down artillery on his own position and was believed killed. For his actions, Saprykin was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Saprykin was captured by the German troops and sent to a POW camp. After its liberation by British troops, Saprykin emigrated to Canada to avoid imprisonment if he returned to the Soviet Union. After Soviet authorities discovered his survival, Saprykin's Hero of the Soviet Union award was revoked. Saprykin died in Toronto on 24 April 1990. His Hero of the Soviet Union award was posthumously restored on 4 December 1991.  Early life  Saprykin was born on 24 August 1916 in Sukhodol in Tambov Governorate (now Krasninsky District) to a peasant family. He graduated from primary school, technical school, and the Voronezh Pedagogical Institute. He became a secondary school teacher in Olkhovatka in Voronezh Oblast. In November 1939, Saprykin was drafted into the Red Army. He graduated from the Grozny Infantry School in May 1941 and was sent to a unit in Belarus with the rank of lieutenant.  World War II  Saprykin became a platoon commander, a company commander, and a battalion commander. By October 1941 he was assistant chief of staff of the 845th Rifle Regiment of the 303rd Rifle Division. South of Yelnya in early October, the regiment was surrounded. Saprykin broke out and reached Soviet lines in December. He was sent to an NKVD filtration camp. On 15 June 1942 he was sentenced by the military tribunal of the 16th Rifle Division under Article 193 of the RSFSR Criminal Code to ten years imprisonment. Saprykin's sentence was suspended and he was sent to the front with a penal battalion. After being wounded, he was transferred to the 612th Rifle Regiment of the 144th Rifle Division in a month. From 17 July 1942 he became a company commander, assistant chief of staff, and later led the regiment's 2nd Rifle Battalion. On 8 March 1943, Saprykin fought in battles for the village of Krivopuskovo in Tumanovsky District of Smolensk Oblast. He reportedly conducted a personal reconnaissance despite a German firing position and decided to attack the village from the rear. With 35 soldiers, he reportedly eliminated German positions and upon signals from his battalion launched an attack. According to accounts at the time, he threw grenades to submachine gunners in a house and was among the first into the village. On 5 July he was awarded the Order of the Red Star.Order No. 272, 33rd Army, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru On 15 October, Saprykin was awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky for his actions during the recapture of Vyazma, among others.Order No. 363, 33rd Army, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru On 1 December 1943, Saprykin's battalion attacked the village of Krasnaya Sloboda. The battalion captured a line of German trenches on a hill and defended the position for three days against repeated German counterattacks. The battalion was cut off by German attacks, and by the third morning, fewer than thirty soldiers remained. German infantry supported by fifteen tanks launched an attack on the position, reportedly advancing within twenty meters of the Soviet positions. Saprykin called artillery fire on his own position. He was believed killed and posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin on 3 June 1944.Hero of the Soviet Union citation, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru Saprykin was severely wounded in the chest and was captured by German troops while unconscious. Saprykin was treated and sent to a prisoner of war camp. The camp was liberated by British troops at the end of the war.  Postwar  Saprykin emigrated to Canada to avoid imprisonment if he returned to the Soviet Union. He worked as a longshoreman and then a taxi driver. Saprykin graduated from a university with an engineering degree and got a job in the Admiral company, becoming a quality control specialist. In August 1977 his Hero of the Soviet Union award was cancelled because of his survival. Saprykin was also reported to have served with collaborationist forces. Saprykin died on 24 April 1990 in Toronto and was buried at the Russian Cemetery in Toronto. On 4 December 1991 Saprykin's Hero of the Soviet Union award was restored. In July 1999 his ashes were moved to a mass grave in Krasnaya Sloboda.  Legacy  The eight-year school in Sukhodol was named for Saprykin.  Personal life  In 1938, Saprykin married Elena Konnova.

His main work was on nucleic acids, morphine and aporphine alkaloids. His work at University College Nottingham on electrometric titration was important in leading to the discovery of the DNA double helix by James Watson and Francis Crick, and he was described as \\"a great nucleic acid chemist.\\" The Path to the Double Helix: The Discovery of DNA, by Robert Olby Courier Corp. 1974 p.95 He established the Scottish Seaweed Research Association and the Lace Research Council. Life 6 Alva Street, Edinburgh The grave of John Masson Gulland, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh Gulland was born at 6 Alva Street in Edinburgh's west end, the only son of Helen Orme Masson and Dr George Lovell Gulland. His maternal grandfather was David Masson and his maternal uncle was David Orme Masson. His paternal uncle was John William Gulland MP. His father later became Professor of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He attended Edinburgh Academy 1906 to 1917 and was then conscripted into the army in the First World War. He applied for a commission and served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. He was assigned to the Divisional Signals Company and saw little if any enemy action. After the war he graduated with a BSc from the University of Edinburgh in 1921. He then won a Carnegie Research Scholarship and undertook further studies at the University of St Andrews (PhD 1925) and the University of Manchester. He worked in both places with Professor Robert Robinson with whom he would also later work at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory at the University of Oxford from where he graduated MA. He became a demonstrator in chemistry in the University of Oxford in 1924, and in 1926 was appointed as a Lecturer based at Balliol College. In 1927 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir James Walker, George Barger, Alexander Lauder, and Ralph Allan Sampson. In 1931 he moved to the University of London as a Reader in Biochemistry, also acting then as Senior Biochemist to the Lister Institute. In 1936 he moved to University College Nottingham as Professor of Chemistry (the Jesse Boot Chair). In the Second World War he worked for the Ministry of Home Security as Gas Advisor 1939 to 1943 and the Ministry of Supply 1943 to 1945. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1945. In 1947 he became Research Director for the Institute of Brewing. His career was cut short when he was killed in the Goswick rail crash near Berwick-on-Tweed, aged 49. He is buried in the Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh with his parents and uncle, John William Gulland. Gulland and DNA Gulland played a pivotal role in some of the research which led to the decoding of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953. The Nottingham team, which included his colleagues Denis Jordan, Cedric Threlfall, and Michael Creeth, produced three papers in 1947: one led to high quality non- degraded DNA samples extracted without using acids or alkalis,Gulland JM, Jordan D. O., and Threlfall C. J., (1947) Deoxypentose nucleic acids. Part I. Preparation of the tetrasodium salt of the deoxypentose nucleic acid of calf thymus.

Viscosity and streaming birefringence of solutions of the sodium salt of the deoxypentose nucleic acid of calf thymus. J. Chem. Soc. 1947,25 1141‚Äì1145 Five years later Watson dismissed the Nottingham team‚Äôs work incorrectly, and it took a year for him to realise his mistake. Eventually however \\"...a rereading of J. M. Gulland's and D. O. Jordan's papers...made me finally realize the strength of their conclusion that a large fraction, if not all, of the bases formed hydrogen bonds to other bases.\\" Once Watson had recognised the key role of the hydrogen bonds then the decoding of DNA seems to have come within about a week or ten days.Watson James D., 1980 The Double Helix Ed. G. Stent Norton New York p.106 The Nottingham team‚Äôs work was also acknowledged in the first papers concerning the decoding of DNA by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling who reported that \\"Gulland and his collaborators ‚Ä¶ showed that ‚Ä¶ CO and NH2 groups of the bases are inaccessible ‚Ä¶ whereas the phosphate groups are fully accessible.\\" Franklin R.E. & Gosling R.F.

By the time of the DNA decoding in 1953 events had moved on with the break-up of the Nottingham team: Gulland had moved on to become Research Director at the Institute of Brewing shortly before his untimely death in 1947, whilst Jordan and Creeth were both working outside the UK.

Gann & Witkowski, Simon & Schuster, New York (pp196-7) There has been some speculative debate as to whether, if these events had turned out differently, the Nottingham team might have gone on to make the DNA decoding discovery themselves.Manchester, K.

Origins and history 280 Metro Center in Colma, California is credited as the world's first power center. Local real estate developer Merritt Sher opened 280 Metro Center in 1986 as an open-air strip shopping center dominated by big-box stores and category killers. 280 Metro Center was a revolutionary development at a time when retail shopping in North America was dominated by enclosed shopping malls. By 1998, there were 313 power centers in the United States with a combined gross leasable area of ; together, they accounted for over five percent of national shopping center sales. The highest numbers of power centers were in the states of California and Florida. By January 2017, there were 2,258 power centers in the United States with a combined gross leasable area of , which was 13% of the combined gross leasable area of all shopping centers in the United States.International Council of Shopping Centers, U.S. Shopping-Center Classification and Characteristics, January 2017. Canada In Canada, South Edmonton Common in Edmonton is the largest power centre, and one of the largest open-air retail developments in North America. Spread over , South Edmonton Common has more than of gross leasable area. Repurposing malls as power centers In recent years, it has become common for older, traditional shopping malls to: * Become hybrid malls and power centers, where some or all anchors are big box stores, and the mall shops are still mostly national chains typically found in malls. Example: Panorama Mall in Los Angeles, anchored by Walmart and Curacao big box discount stores. * Add outside but adjacent areas with big-box stores and/or strip mall-type buildings. Examples: Puente Hills Mall and Del Amo Fashion Center in Southern California; Deerfoot Meadows in Calgary, Alberta. * To be torn down and replaced with a neighborhood shopping center or power center. Examples: La Mirada Mall and La Habra Fashion Square in Southern California; and Seven Corners Shopping Center in suburban Washington, D.C.. Seven Corners, once anchored by department stores Garfinckel's and Woodward & Lothrop, was an indoor mall with an adjacent strip-style convenience center. The indoor portion was torn down and replaced with a strip of big box stores and smaller shops. Main Street theme Woodbury Lakes outside of Minneapolis, a \\"Main Street\\" in the middle of a power center Some new power center developments have attempted, as have lifestyle centers and regional outdoor malls (e.g. Otay Ranch Town Center,, Atlantic Station), to recreate the atmosphere of an old-town Main Street. Stores line streets where cars may drive and where there is limited parking, with much more parking in lots or garages in the back. The \\"main street\\" particularly serves to house the smaller stores and chain stores once typically found in malls. An example is Woodbury Lakes in Woodbury, Minnesota‚Äîwhere, according to urbanist website streets.mn, the developers \\"dispensed with the integrated anchors and instead plopped down 'Main Street' in the middle of what is otherwise a regional power center\\".

Her performance as the Autumn fairy in Cinderella was less well- received, with Zo√´ Anderson of The Independent noting that \\"the risky, off- balance quality of the solo has gone missing\\". In 2011, she re-injured the same knee that she had injured when she was twelve years old, again interrupting her career. In the 2013 production of Onegin, Takada performed the role of Olga, providing \\"strong support\\" to the main dancers. In 2014, Takada was promoted to first soloist. Writing for dance magazine DanceView, Jane Simpson contrasted Takada's less exciting performance as Princess Florine in The Sleeping Beauty to her more assertive performance as Aurora, calling Takada's dancing \\"clear and unornamented\\" and predicting future success. In December of that year, after dancing the role of Kitri in an afternoon performance of Don Quixote, Takada stepped into the lead role that evening as a mid-performance substitute for Natalia Osipova, who had been injured during the first act. Her performance was praised by Zo√´ Anderson in The Independent, with the critic observing that Takada's qualities suited \\"Kitri's mischievous nature\\". As a first soloist Takada also danced the principal role in Frederick Ashton's The Two Pigeons in 2015. = 2016‚Äìpresent: Principal dancer = Takada was promoted to principal dancer in 2016 at the age of 26, which is relatively young for a principal dancer. Vogue Japan named her one of its 2016 Women of the Year. Takada debuted in the lead role in Giselle later that year alongside Thiago Soares, with Clement Crisp of the Financial Times describing her as a \\"Giselle of subtle power\\". Takada paired with Steven McRae to dance the roles of Titania and Oberon in the Frederick Ashton ballet The Dream in 2017, with Judith Mackrell of The Guardian commending the pair for their footwork and their distinctively dark portrayal of the characters. Takada performed in another Wayne McGregor piece, titled Infra, in 2018, but her performance was criticized for lacking emotional power and weight despite its technical quality. Later that year, as Nikiya in a production of La Bayad√®re, Takada again danced with McRae, drawing praise from Laura Freeman of The Spectator for her \\"air of otherworldly detachment and exquisite lightness of line\\" but criticism for an ineffective pairing. Writing for the Evening Standard, Emma Byrne described Takada in 2019 as \\"one of the Royal‚Äôs most elegant dancers\\". Takada missed the Royal Ballet's 2019 summer tour of Japan, in which she was scheduled to perform the role of Kitri in the Japanese premiere of Don Quixote, due to injury. In November 2019, during a performance of The Sleeping Beauty, Takada was injured during the first act, and was replaced in the rest of the performance by Yasmine Naghdi.  Personal life  As of 2020, Takada has been in a relationship with fellow Royal Ballet dancer Benjamin Ella for several years.

He served as the Bishop of Mantua from 1174 until his resignation in 1177 and held the position of Bishop of Vicenza from 1179 until his murder. The schism that Antipope Victor IV caused enabled him to proclaim his support for Pope Alexander III though leading to his removal from a position at the behest of Frederick Barbarossa. The beatification cause commenced in 1222 under Pope Honorius III and culminated on 30 March 1824 when his beatification received formal ratification from Pope Leo XII upon the confirmation of the late bishop's enduring local 'cultus' - or popular devotion. Life Giovanni de Surdis Cacciafronte was born in 1125 in Cremona to the nobles Evangelista Sordi and Berta Persico. He lost his father as a child and his mother soon remarried the nobleman Adamo Cacciafronte who allowed his stepson to assume his surname and as such treated him as if he were his own child. He was well-educated as a child and his desire to pursue the ecclesiastical life was well received at home. Cacciafronte entered the Order of Saint Benedict in 1141 at their convent of San Lorenzo in Cremona and was later ordained to the priesthood before being appointed as the prior of San Vittore - connected to San Lorenzo - and later being made as the abbot of San Lorenzo itself from 1155 until 1159. The schism that Antipope Victor IV caused - with the support of Frederick Barbarossa - caused the priest to affirm his ardent support of Pope Alexander III. He was banished from his convent after Barbarossa learned that he had supported the pope. The pontiff did not fail to notice the priest's support and so appointed him as the Bishop of Mantua after his predecessor sided with the antipope. But his predecessor later returned repentant and requested to be Mantua's bishop once more. Cacciafronte sent his resignation to Alexander III and returned to hermitage life though the pontiff had other ideas in mind and instead made him the Bishop of Vicenza. One particular initiative of his was to revive public devotion to Ss. Felice and Fortunato and another was to repave roads. He also combatted the heretical Cathars. He also established a theological training school for seminarians in 1184 before his death. Cacciafronte was killed on 16 March 1184. He had reprimanded Pietro - who had been embezzling in an illegal move - and encouraged him to repent though the angered Pietro took his sword and killed the bishop in a merciless encounter. His remains were interred in the Cattedrale di Santa Maria Annunziata though were relocated to a new tomb in that church in 1441. Beatification The sainthood process commenced in 1222 when the late bishop's successor approached Pope Honorius III and requested such a cause open while the official process opened in 1223. The cause tried to resume its proceedings in 1647 under Pope Innocent X but failed though was reinvigorated in 1824. The ratification of the late bishop's enduring and noted local 'cultus' - otherwise known as popular devotion - allowed for Pope Leo XII to issue his formal approval to the late bishop's beatification on 30 March 1824.

It is distributed from the Himalayas to China. The systematic position in subfamily Betoideae is still uncertain.  Description  Acroglochin persicarioides is an erect glabrous annual herb, 30‚Äì80 cm tall. The sparsely branched stems are ribbed and striate, green or purplish. The alternate leaves (up to 6 cm long) are long petiolate, their simple leaf blades are ovate to deltoid with irregularly and coarsely toothed margins. The inflorescences are numerous branched cymes in the axils of almost all leaves, erect-spreading, contracted, with short sterile branches ending needle-like. The hermaphrodite flowers are sessile, without bracts and bracteoles. The perianth is very small and consists of five basally connate tepals, these are linear-oblong, curved upwards, with a green center and membranous margins. There are one to three stamens and an ovary with short style and two short stigmas. The fruit is slightly shorter than the adpressed persistent perianth, and about 1‚Äì4 mm in diameter, it is disciform, depressed and saucer-shaped and opens circumscissile. The fruit wall (pericarp) is free. The horizontal seed is black, with a hard, thin, glossy seed coat. It contains an annular embryo and mealy perisperm (feeding tissue). The flowering and fruiting phase reaches from July to November.  Distribution and habitat  Acroglochin persicarioides is distributed from the Himalayas (northern parts of Pakistan and India), Kashmir, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet to China (Gansu, Guizhou, Hubei, S Hunan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan) The plants grow in disturbed vegetation among rocks, on waste grounds, near cultivations, at forest margins, riversides, open hillsides, or at roadsides.  Systematics  The genus Acroglochin was first established in 1822 by Heinrich Schrader, at the same time describing the single type species, Acroglochin chenopodioides. In the following years, several species of other genera were regarded as identical, especially Amaranthus persicarioides, which was already described in 1810, so that this name has priority. Alfred Moquin- Tandon published the combination Acroglochin persicarioides in 1849 as the accepted name for this species. Synonyms of Acroglochin are Lecanocarpus Nees and Blitanthus Rchb.. Synonyms of Acroglochin persicarioides are: *Acroglochin chenopodioides Schrad. ex J.A. Schultes *Acroglochin persicarioides var. muliensis T.P. Soong *Acroglochin persicarioides var. multiflora T P. Soong *Acroglochin obtusifolia C.H.Blom *Acroglochin schraderiana Schult.f. ex Moq. *Amaranthus acroglochin Spreng. *Amaranthus diandrus Spreng. *Amaranthus cauliflorus Link *Amaranthus persicarioides Poir. *Blitanthus nepalensis Rchb. *Boehmeria amaranthus H.L√©v. *Lecanocarpus cauliflorus (Link) Nees, T. Nees & Sinning *Lecanocarpus nepalensis Nees Acroglochin was usually classified in subfamily Betoideae, because like all other Betoideae, the fruits are circumscissile capsules. But it proved to be phylogenetically isolated. The relationships are yet uncertain, it may probably be classified as a subfamily of its own.

Old Stone Row is situated on the east side of the Middlebury College campus, and consists of three buildings standing atop a low ridge on the east side of Old Chapel Road, a north-south road that forms part of the campus circulation pattern. The campus's modern main quadrangle lies just to the west, while the buildings are actually oriented facing east, across, facing the original campus green and the village center of Middlebury. The three buildings are all stone structures, built of locally quarried limestone laid in irregular courses. Architecturally, their massing is somewhat typical of mill buildings of the period, although the Old Chapel, at the center of the group, is distinguished by a prominent three-stage belltower, and the orientation of its long axis (and main roofline) perpendicular to the others. with Painter Hall, the northernmost of the buildings, was constructed in 1812-16 as part of a building campaign organized in part due to competition with the University of Vermont at Burlington, which had built a substantial brick edifice in 1807. It was built and used mainly as a dormitory, although it has seen other uses in its history. Its design, virtually devoid of ornamentation, is reminiscent of a stone mill (no longer standing) built in Middlebury in 1811. Old Chapel was built in 1834-36, originally providing a chapel and instructional spaces, as well as a prominent visual focus for the campus. Starr Hall, south of the chapel, followed in the 1860s, built as the result of increased enrollment in the late 1850s. Its design is a clear reference to Painter Hall, although it is architecturally distinguished by projecting gabled bays with the entrances at their bases.

Her mother was a member of the Pitjantjatjara people and her father was Yankunytjatjara. When Yilpi was still very young, her parents came to live at Ernabella, a Presbyterian mission in northwest South Australia. She grew up there, and later began working at Ernabella Arts. Batik was one of the first forms of art Yilpi learned to make at Ernabella. Several of her works were shown at an exhibition in Adelaide in 2006, and one of these was bought for the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. Later examples of her batik works were bought by the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Yilpi is also known for making woven items, such as baskets, out of tjanpi (desert grass). She made several objects with a women's project called the Tjanpi Desert Weavers. Yilpi began painting much more recently. She has painted both abstract and figurative works. The abstract works are expressions of her Dreamtime legends, passed down to her from her mother. Her most successful works, however, are the figurative paintings of her life as a child at Ernabella in the 1950s.

Sharp, a graduate of the United States Military Academy and career Army officer, commanded the Visyayan-Mindanao Force during the Philippines Campaign (1941‚Äì42), and surrendered his command to the Japanese after the Fall of Corregidor. He spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of war, and died shortly after his postwar retirement from the army. Early life Sharp was born at Yankton, South Dakota, and graduated as a second lieutenant of field artillery from the United States Military Academy in 1907, before becoming a career Army officer.Military Hall of Honor website, at http://www.militaryhallofhonor.com/honoree-record.php?id=3067 . World War I Sharp commanded the 11th Field Artillery Regiment on the western front in France from July 10 to October 24, 1918. He later was the commanding officer of the 78th Field Artillery Regiment on the western front.The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia, at http://www.pwencycl.kgbudge.com/S/h/Sharp_William.htm . Between the wars In 1929 Sharp was promoted to lieutenant colonel of field artillery.Journal of the Executive Proceedings of the Senate of the United States, Volume 69, Part 1, p. 859. World War II Sharp was assigned to the Philippines and was a colonel prior to the outbreak of war. He was promoted to brigadier general and was given a command in fall 1941. As a brigadier general, Sharp, headquartered at Cebu, was placed in command of the Visayan-Mindanao Force on Nov. 4, 1941, shortly before Japan brought the United States into World War II. Sharp's force lacked many of the supplies it desperately needed and much of the equipment was outdated and not in proper working order. The troops under Sharp also lacked the training they needed to be an effective fighting force. These problems were similar to those faced by commanders on Luzon.The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia.Louis Morton, The Fall of the Philippines (Washington: Center of Military History, United States Army, 1953), 2016 update, p. 499 , at http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_28.htm . In January 1942 Sharp transferred his headquarters to Mindanao. Gen. Douglas MacArthur sent a letter to Sharp telling him if communications between the two generals were broken, that Sharp was to have the powers of a theatre command so as to continue the resistance to the Japanese.Maj Larry S. Schmidt, \\"American Involvement in the Filipino Resistance Movement on Mindanao During the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1945)\\" (MMAS thesis, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, 1982), p. 65. This thesis can be found online at http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix;=html&identifier;=ADB068659 . His forces on Cebu and various Visayan islands became autonomous because of Japanese activity that disrupted communications and travel. One important goal was to protect the airfield at Del Monte, in the north-central section of Mindanao. On Feb. 4 a part of Sharp's command was made independent and on March 4, all the islands except Mindanao were made independent of Sharp, making him the commander of the Mindanao Force only. On April 16, Sharp was again made the commander of the Visayan-Mindanao Force, which meant little with much of the Visayan area now under Japanese control. Shortly before he chose to surrender, Sharp was promoted to major general.Morton, p. 500-6.Schmidt, p. 138. Initially a small Japanese force landed and took Davao City on Dec. 20, 1941. The Japanese made some attempts to expand their control, but had little success until reinforcements were sent. In late April major attacks were launched which saw the Japanese take control of much of the south and central parts of the island by May 10. By that time Sharp's force was badly battered, but he still had troops in the field.Morton, pp. 508-19. On May 6 Lieut. Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright, who had held out on Corregidor Island for a month after U.S. forces on the Bataan peninsula had surrendered, notified Japanese General Masaharu Homma he was surrendering. Wainwright at the same time sent a coded message to Sharp naming him as commander of all forces in the Philippines, excepting those on Corregidor and three other islands in Manila Bay. Sharp was now to report to Gen. MacArthur, now stationed in Australia. This would cause as few troops as possible to be surrendered. General Homma would not allow the surrender of any less than all the troops in the Philippines and considered the troops on and around Corregidor to be hostages to ensure other forces in the Philippines would lay down their arms. Wainwright then agreed to surrender Sharp's men.Morton, pp. 564-70, this section of his book online at http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_32.htm . Gen. Sharp was placed in a difficult position. He knew if he ignored Wainwright's wish for him to surrender that the hostage troops and civilians at Corregidor could be massacred. Though his troops were badly mauled, they could still put up a fight. It had been expected they would fight on as a guerrilla force. In the end, on May 10 Sharp decided to surrender. Sharp's surrender proved problematic for the Japanese, although Sharp and many of his men surrendered and suffered as prisoners of war until liberated in 1945. Many of Sharp's men, the vast majority of them Filipino, refused to surrender. Many considered Wainwright's surrender of them to be made under duress and many ultimately joined the guerrilla movement led by Col. Wendell Fertig.Morton, pp. 576-7. However, Sharp did not surrender all his men. The names of Filipino new recruits, for instance, were omitted from the surrender rosters and were ordered to return to their homes and bury their weapons.Schmidt, pp. 71-2. Sharp was at some point sent to a prison camp in Mukden (today known as Shenyang), Manchuria, where he was released in 1945.\\"General Dies; Visited Here,\\" p. 1. Post World War II For his service in the Philippines from September 1941 to March 1942, Sharp was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal. Gen. Sharp, physically and mentally worn down, retired from the Army in July 1946. He died the following spring, when he visited Fort McPherson, Georgia, for a medical checkup. He was in the process of looking for a place to live in the Sarasota, Florida, area just prior to his death.Waymarking website.Generals.dk website.\\"General Dies; Visited Here,\\" p. 1. Personal life Sharp's wife was Kathryn Lund Sharp, who died July 30, 1955.Waymarking website. Legacy The story of William F. Sharp, and the struggles in Mindanao for that matter, has gathered little interest in the military history of World War II. Sharp told Col. Wendell Fertig and Father Edward Haggerty he had wished to remain a colonel and had no desire be advanced to general rank. Brig. Gen. Bradford G. Chynoweth, a contemporary of Sharp, claimed Sharp did not have the physical or mental agility to adapt to the unforeseen situation in which he found himself in Mindanao. Chynoweth said of Sharp, \\"It was pathetic to give him the responsibility of commanding combat or guerrilla operations on Mindanao.\\"Schmidt, p. 138.The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia, at http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/C/h/Chynoweth_Bradford_G.htm . Chynoweth was very critical of Sharp. Chynoweth only surrendered himself to the Japanese because he thought MacArthur had approved Wainwright's actions. Sharp decision to surrender was made due to concerns the Americans and Filipinos on Corregidor could be massacred. Sharp did set in motion some of the planning to transform his regular forces into guerrilla ones. He also ordered or allowed fudging of the surrender rosters to allow a number of his troops to escape the surrender and to fight on another day. Most of Fertig's American troops had come from Sharp's command and many Filipino guerrillas had also served under Sharp.

She made ceremonial belts and ' (head rings) by spinning hair on a hand-made spindle. When Curtis was still a child, she travelled with her mother to what is now Watarru, her mother's homeland. The family lived for a time on cattle stations, and traded dingo scalps and rabbit skins for flour, tea and sugar. They later settled on the mission at Ernabella. When she was older, Curtis married a man named Bill, and worked at Ernabella spinning wool and making rugs. In the 1960s, she moved back west (closer to her homeland) when the outstation at Ama·πØa was established. She now lives at Nyapari. Artwork Curtis is best known for her acrylic paintings, but she is also still involved in traditional handicraft work (making grass baskets and wooden carvings). The most visible motif in Curtis' paintings are her representations of animals. Her works stand out against other artists from her region because of her subtle use of colours. Her work has been exhibited around Australia since 2007. It was first shown internationally in 2010, in San Sebasti√°n, Spain. Examples of her paintings are displayed in the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, the National Gallery of Victoria, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Australian National University. Curtis was a finalist for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2010 and 2011. She was also one of 16 finalists for the Western Australian Indigenous Art Award in 2011.

He worked for most of his life as a labourer and conservationist. He is the manager and senior traditional owner of Walalkara, a homeland and Indigenous protected area on the A·πâangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. He began work as an artist in 2004, aged in his 70s. His artworks are now held in several major galleries in Australia. Life Robin was born at Walalkara, a place in the Great Victoria Desert near Kaltjiti, South Australia. His father was Pitjantjatjara from the land west of Watarru; his mother was Yankunytjatjara from Makiri, northwest of Walalkara. Robin grew up living a traditional, nomadic life in the area around Kaltjiti. The first time he saw a whitefella was when he was a young teenager. As a young man, he worked on the cattle stations at Welbourne Hill and Everard Park. When he was much older, Robin moved back to Walalkara and set up an outstation for his family on his homelands. He lives there with his wife, Tyayangka, and his children. Kankapankatja is the senior traditional owner (') of Walalkara. The people that live on this outstation are all part of his family. They are the land managers of Walalkara Indigenous Protected Area, a federally protected reserve created from an agreement between the Robin family and the Australian government.

Artwork Robin began working as an artist in July 2004, while he was at home recovering from surgery. His paintings and drawings are about Walalkara. They depict the landscape, animals, and spiritual Dreaming stories associated with it. He is also known for carving traditional tools, such as boomerangs, spears, spear-throwers and shields. Since 2006, Robin's work has been shown in many exhibitions alongside other Kaltjiti artists. In 2007, he was featured at the Mossenson Galleries in Collingwood, Victoria. His work was featured as part of the annual Desert Mob exhibition in Alice Springs, in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. It was also exhibited in Adelaide at the Flinders University City Gallery in 2009, and the South Australian Museum in 2010. In 2012, the Cross Cultural Art Exchange in Darwin held a solo exhibition of Robin's work. The exhibition was called : this is my life from long ago. It showcased a series of drawings that depict Robin's memories from growing up in the bush, and the legendary journeys of his ancestors. In the same year, his work was also shown at the annual Our Mob exhibition in Adelaide, at an exhibition of Kaltjiti Arts in the Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair, and in Germany, in an exhibition at the ArtKelch gallery in Freiburg im Breisgau. Examples of Robin's work are held in the collections of the Araluen Arts Centre, Flinders University, and the National Gallery of Australia.

Life Tiger was born around 1920 (though the exact year is not known). He was born in the bush, at a rockhole called Piltati, which is close to what is now Nyapa·πüi in north-west South Australia. His family were Pitjantjatjara, and they lived a traditional, nomadic life in the bushland around Piltati. When he was a teenager, Tiger's family settled at Ernabella, which at the time was a Presbyterian mission and a sheep station. Tiger grew up on the mission, and learned to speak a little English in school there. He eventually married Nyalapanytja, and they lived in Ernabella for many years. Tiger worked on the station, shearing sheep and building fences. In the 1970s, Tiger and his family moved to Ama·πØa, closer to his homeland. When he aged, Tiger became a ngangka·πüi (traditional healer), an important and respected role in traditional Pitjantjatjara communities. In 1997, the women at Ama·πØa began a community art centre, originally called Minymaku Arts. The word minymaku means \\"women's\\", and they called it this because, at the time, Pitjantjatjara men did not like to paint. After several men began painting in the early 2000s, the centre's name was changed to Tjala Arts. Tiger started painting in September 2004, less than eight years before his death. He had never painted before this, and was better known for woodworking, especially making spears. Although he only began painting in his final years, his work quickly became recognised by critics. In 2005, Tiger was a finalist for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. He became a finalist three more time before his death, in 2006, 2010, and 2011, but he never won. He was also a finalist in the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards in 2009, and again in 2011. Tiger mainly painted for Tjala Arts, but from 2009 he also began working for Tjungu Palya in nearby Nyapa·πüi. Artwork Tiger's painted sacred stories from his Dreaming, mostly to do with Piltati, where he was born. This place is associated with a creation story involving two sisters and their husbands, who change themselves into Wanampi (a giant water snake). According to Tiger's Dreaming, the Wanampi are his family's ancestors who created the country around Piltati. The snake's form can be seen in many of Tiger's paintings, usually painted several different colours. His paintings were known for their bright colours, as opposed to the traditional natural ochre colours used by many other artists of the Western Desert. Tiger died on 16 April 2012, over the age of 90. While he was alive, his paintings were exhibited in several major cities, including Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle and Perth. His work is now held in permanent galleries in most of these cities. He also had work exhitied overseas: at the University of Virginia in 2006, and in Singapore in 2008.

She had a short career as an artist, beginning only in 2002. During this time, however, her work was taken in by several major public galleries. Life Pompey was born on a sand dune near Finke, in the southern Northern Territory. This inspired her name; ' is the word for a sandhill in languages of the Western Desert. Pompey's parents were Yankunytjatjara people from lands further south, around Kalka and Ka·πâpi in South Australia. Pompey grew up in the area around Finke, and then moved south to Ernabella when she was a young woman. At the time, this was a Christian mission set up for Aboriginal people coming in from the desert. While living in Ernabella, learned art and craft at the community's craft room. She learned how to sew, make batik, dye fabrics and spin sheep's wool to make rugs. Pompey's husband, whom she married at Ernabella, was a Pitjantjatjara elder and law keeper for the country around Kaltjiti. They moved to Kaltjiti after it was set up as an outpost in the 1960s. They had 8 children, including six boys and two girls. Pompey started painting for the community's art centre, Kaltjiti Arts, in 2002. She painted regularly and became quickly noticed by critics. In 2003, one of Pompey's paintings, titled Pita, was chosen as a finalist for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Another of her works, Para - Desert Gums, was chosen as a finalist for the competition in 2010. In the ten years that she worked as an artist, Pompey's works became well represented in Australian collections. In 2007, she suffered a mild stroke, which affected the movement in her left hand. She recovered and then continued to paint up until her death. She died on 16 November 2011, in Alice Springs. Artwork Pompey's paintings depict features of the central Australian landscape, such as sand hills, flowers and trees. These are painted with a soft-focus, hazy look. Most of her paintings are minimalist in style, combining basic shapes of colour with dotted fields or lines. She was known for thick brushstrokes and a wide use of colour. Pompey's designs were also used in a series of rugs made by Kaltjiti Arts, which combined traditional Kashmiri techniques with Australian Western Desert designs. Pompey's work has been exhibited widely in Australia, mostly in group exhibitions. The Mossenson Galleries in Melbourne held two solo exhibitions of Pompey's work. The first was in 2005. The second was in 2012, after her death, and showed a selection of her final works. Examples of her paintings are now held in the National Gallery of Victoria, and the Art Gallery of South Australia.

She is perhaps the most well-known artist from this community, and the first to gain a significant level of success for the community's centre, Mimili Maku. Her eldest daughter, Ngupulya, is also a successful painter. Life Milatjari was born in 1928, in the bush in north- western South Australia. She was born at Amuroona, on a cattle station between what are now the communities of Indulkana and Mimili. When she was a young girl, her family encountered stockmen at a waterhole called Victory Well. The family then moved to settle and work at the station, then called Everard Park. Milatjari's father was Nyapi \\"King\\" Everard and her mother was Mantjangka Everard (Everard was the surname given to them). Milatjari met her husband Sam Pumani in Mimili, and they had five children together: Ngupulya, Betty, Ken, Michael and Lewey. Before artists began to paint at Mimili, Milatjari produced traditional pokerwork designs on wooden blocks. She would teach her methods to younger workers. She did not begin painting until 2008, when she was about 80 years old. She painted for the community's art centre, Mimili Maku. Her works from 2008 were featured in Alice Springs later that year, at the annual \\"Desert Mob\\" exhibition. She was featured in the same exhibition again in 2009 and 2010, and on both occasions she was considered the most successful Mimili artist. She had a solo exhibition in 2009, which was held in Adelaide. In 2010 and 2011, she was chosen as a finalist for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. One of her paintings was bought by the Art Gallery of South Australia, and several others are held in the National Gallery of Victoria. Artwork Milatjari paints the Maku Tjukurpa, which is the Dreaming (spirituality) associated with the land around Mimili. Antara, close to Mimili, is a place represented in almost all her paintings. It is her uncle's traditional country, and Milatjari's family would often go hunting and gathering food here when she was young. She and her mother and sister would dig for witchetty grubs (maku) while her father and brothers went hunting. Antara and Ngura Walytja (family's country) are common titles for her paintings. Milatjari uses earthy colours on a dark background to depict the landscape of Antara. She paints figures and stories from the Maku Tjukurpa using fields of dots. Her style and technique has influenced those of many of Mimili Maku's younger artists, including her daughter Ngupulya and Tuppy Ngintja Goodwin.

Built in 1848 and used in active service until 1972, it is one of the few surviving first-generation railroad station buildings in the state. Now used as a retail space, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The former Fairlee Railroad Depot stands on the south side of US 5, adjacent to the now-disused railroad tracks that run between US 5 and the Connecticut River. It is accessed by a gravel drive in the shape of a broad U, with parking in front. It is a single-story rectangular wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The street-facing facade has an irregular plan, with a number of doors and windows of differing sizes, reflecting a variety of historic functions. The building originally housed a lobby and passenger waiting area, occupying about one-third of its space, with the remainder used as a freight storage area. with The station was probably built in 1848 by the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad Company, chartered in 1843 to provide railroad service along the Connecticut River north of White River Junction. The station's precise construction date is not known due to a lack of documentation; the assessment of its age is based on architectural analysis. About 1870, the freight area was enlarged by construction of an addition, and the building's lobby and office area was remodeled around the turn of the 20th century. It is also likely that a bay window bumping out on the track side from the agent's office was added around the same time. Operation of the rail line was taken over by the Boston and Main Corporation in 1870, and it remained in service until 1972.

The Tamu societies are created around the world as a means to preserve Tamu's unique culture outside of Nepal. They organise cultural events, such as festivals of dance, music, and food. They also engage in humanitarian, social and educational activities. There are a number of Tamu Samajs around the world, including: Tamu Samaj Sydney, Tamu Samaj Victoria, Tamu Samaj UK, but some inherit different names such as \\"Gurung Tamu Society\\". Tamu Samajs were originally formed to spread a sense of solidarity among Tamus living in Nepal and abroad. They are a central part of the community's social gatherings, activities and events. History In 1958, Bernard Pignede, a French student of anthropology came to Nepal to study about Gurungs. He spent seven months in a Gurung village Mohoriya (Kaski, Gandaki) and traveled through many neighboring Gurung villages to do his research. He learned to speak tamu-kuwei (gurung dialect) and documented pretty much everything about the gurungs ‚Äì their social structure, culture, religion, history, occupations, legends and myths. He translated pae, a ritual and religious practice that one gurung generation has passed down to another for thousands of years. Pae conveys the oral history of gurungs and is considered very sacred. Unfortunately, Pignede died in 1961 at age of 29. After his death, Professor Louis Dumont published Pignedes work in 1966. The book was immediately recognized as a major contribution to the anthropology of the Himalayas. Later, two noted anthropologists ‚Äì Sarah Harrison and Alan Macfarlane translated it in English and published the first English version in 1993. Harrison and Macfarlane studied further of gurungs and added more to Pignede‚Äôs work. The English version of this book is called ‚ÄúThe Gurungs‚Äù, which is probably the most acclaimed research on Gurungs so far.  Culture  The Gurungs are famous for their culture. Various studies today have, however, shown that this division is an imposition from outside, and the Gurungs are divided into various subgroups; and they did not conform to the caste system. In Gurung society Chima holds the main responsibility for managing the village administration and also settles disputes in the village. Rodhighar is among the major identity of the social system of Gurung. Some have called the Rodhighar a house to thread wool, while others have called it a place to settle for the night.

Whilst in Chester he initially attended the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist church, but later joined the Methodists at the Octagon, the Wesleyan Methodist chapel. Soon after, he began preaching as local preacher, before, in 1801 becoming an ordained Wesleyan Methodist minister, touring various circuits in Wales until 1815, when he began touring on circuits in England. In 1824 he left the ministry for a period, to run a grocery and tea-merchant business in the Leeds area. The worsening health of his wife influenced his decision to subsequently return to Wales, to continue with his grocery business in the Caernarvon area, and where he again served as a local preacher, until within a few weeks of his death.

He was born in Safed, Palestine, and he later emigrated to Baltimore, MD arriving on 23 September 1898. He studied medicine and became a doctor, but he abandoned medicine when Jewish education became his all- absorbing passion.  Theories About Jewish Education  Benderly saw variety of forms of Jewish education, ‚Äúa hodgepodge of congregational schools, khayders, community Talmud Torahs, and private tutors.‚ÄùKrasner, Jonathan. 2011. Introduction. The Benderly Boys and American Jewish Education. Brandeis. He found that the Talmud Torah system would be the easiest to reform. This was because \\"despite their precarious finances and historical association with the impoverished, the schools enjoyed community support. They were generally governed by local boards of directors and supported through a combination of donations, charity benefits, and tuition collections.‚Äùp. 91. Krasner, Jonathan. 2011. The Benderly Boys and American Jewish Education. Brandeis. Benderly was inspired by the writings of Johann Pestalozzi, Herbert Spencer, and John Dewey, and the concept of cultural Zionism. His goal was to modernize Jewish education by making it more professional and ‚Äúcreating an immigrant- based, progressive supplementary school model, and spreading the mantra of community responsibility for Jewish education.‚Äù Unlike some branches of traditional Jewish education, Benderly stressed cognitive learning and ‚Äúcontinued to view as core knowledge Hebrew and Judaism‚Äôs classical texts.‚Äùp. 191. Krasner, Jonathan. 2011. The Benderly Boys and American Jewish Education. Brandeis. He developed a model of education that has also been called the \\"Protestant Model,\\" because it followed the typical schooling model of Protestants in the United States, which separated general education and religious education.Sarna, Jonathan. 1998. American Jewish education in historical perspective. Journal of Jewish Education 64(1-2):8-21. It is described as \\"a philosophical belief that state-funded schools should teach patriotism, civics, and critical skills while separate denominational- sponsored supplementary school should teach religious doctrine and practice.\\"p. 125.

International Journal of the Sociology of Language 237: 119‚Äì137.  Career  In 1910, he began the Bureau of Jewish Education in New York. ‚ÄúHe was the American organizer of Ivrit be-Ivrit pedagogy ‚Äì the use of Hebrew as the language of instruction.‚ÄùJewish Encyclopedia article This \\"teaching Jewish content in Modern Hebrew... reconceptualized Hebrew education not only as a form of language acquisition, but as a means of defining and giving shape to American Judaism for the Jewish immigrant community at that time.\\"p. 119.

International Journal of the Sociology of Language 237: 119‚Äì137. He also supported the founding of the Jewish Teachers Association, seen as ‚Äúa counterweight to the immigrant dominated Agudath Ha-Morim Ha-Ivrim, the Hebrew Teachers Union of New York.‚Äùp. 213. Krasner, Jonathan. 2011. The Benderly Boys and American Jewish Education. Brandeis. A cadre of young men that he encouraged, mentored, and taught went on to be leaders of Jewish education in the USA and became known as the ‚ÄúBenderly Boys.‚Äù This group included Alexander Dushkin, Isaac Berkson, Emanuel Gamoran, and Barnett Brickner. There were also a few women considered \\"Benderly Girls,\\" including Rebecca Aaronson Brickner and Libbie Suchoff Berkson, although, as women, they had fewer opportunities for leadership. The Bureau was also a professional home for other Hebraists in the USA, including Zevi Scharfstein, although Scharfstein, an immigrant, believed Benderly favored American-born recruits with weak Hebrew abilities and credentials over better qualified immigrants because he had greater influence over his local recruits. Morris Waldman, executive secretary of the American Jewish Committee from 1928 to 1945, wrote of Benderly in his autobiography Nor by Power: \\"If a future Jewish historian were some day to write the biographies of, say, the ten most decisive Jews in American history, Benderly would have to be one.\\" References Relevant literature *Chipkin, Israel S.

The composer had a lifetime love for Algeria. In 1873, he visited it for the first time. The theme of the third movement of the suite came to him during that visit. He composed a single-movement R√™verie orientale, which was performed in Paris on 7 June 1879 at a charity concert under composer's direction. His publisher Auguste Durand asked him to write more pieces like this one. So in the summer 1880, which he spent in Boulogne- sur-Mer, Saint-Sa√´ns composed three other movements: on 12 July in a letter to Durand he wrote that he began working on them. By the end of August composition was finished (he reported it in a letter to Durand written on 30 August). The whole suite had its first performance in Paris on 19 December 1880 with √âdouard Colonne as conductor. The audience loved it and the composition was published by Durand, Schoenewerk et Cie. the next year with a dedication to Albert Kopff, an ophthalmologist of Alsatian origin, who became a friend of Saint-Sa√´ns during his stay in Algeria. He was also an excellent pianist and published arrangements of works by Saint-Sa√´ns under pseudonym A. Benfeld.  Instrumentation  The work is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns (2 natural, 2 valved), 2 trumpets (valved), 2 cornets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, triangle, tambourine, cymbals, bass drum and strings.  Structure  The work is written in four movements: # Pr√©lude. En vue d'Alger. Molto allegro (C major) # Rhapsodie mauresque. Allegretto non troppo (D major) # R√™verie du soir. A Blidah. Allegretto quasi Andantino (A major) # Marche militaire fran√ßaise. Allegro giocoso (C major) Each of the movements has a program: # Du pont du navire, encore secou√© par une longue houle, on d√©couvre le panorama de la ville d'Alger. On per√ßoit les bruits vari√©s qui se m√©langent, et au milieu desquels on distingue le cri \\"Ali Allah! Mohammed rassoul Allah!\\". Dans un dernier balancement, le navire s'est ancr√© au port. # Dans un des nombreux caf√©s maures de la vieille ville, les Arabes se livrent √† leurs danses coutumi√®res, tour √† tour lascives ou effr√©n√©es, aux sons des fl√ªtes, des rebabs et des tambourins. # Sous les palmiers de l'oasis, dans la nuit parfum√©e, on entend au loin un chant amoureux et le refrain caressant d'une fl√ªte. # De retour √† Alger. Dans le pittoresque des bazars et des caf√©s maures, voici que s'entend le pas redoubl√© d'un r√©giment fran√ßais, dont les accents guerriers contrastent avec les rythms bizarres et les m√©lodies langoureuses de l'Orient.

Much of the wares were dishes for food made in sets of five, with a high foot. These followed in shape the dishes in lacquered wood, which until then were the preferred dining dishes used by the aristocracy. The Nabeshima used them themselves and gave them to other feudal lords as prestige gifts. Very few were exported until the Meiji period.Smith, Harris, & Clark, 164-165 A variety of designs are used, ranging from the abstract to the representational.

She is most recognised for her batik work, and is one of the most well-known batik artists in Australia. Her works also include acrylic paintings, weaving, ceramics, wood carving and printmaking. Most of Tapaya's paintings depict places and events from her family's dreaming stories. Her batik work is of the classic Ernabella style, which eschews the Indonesian use of repeated block printed designs in favour of hand-drawn freehand designs or \\"walka\\". These \\"walka\\" are pure design and do not refer to, or contain reference to, dreamings or \\"tjukurpa\\". Tapaya is a member of the Pitjantjatjara people. She was born in the desert in the far northwest of South Australia. Her mother had walked from Walytjitjata, in the Northern Territory, and arrived at Ernabella Mission shortly after Tapaya's birth. Ernabella was run by missionaries at the time, and Tjunkaya grew up there. The craft room at Ernabella Mission was established in 1948 and nurtured the artistic talents of Tapaya and other children and adults living on the Mission. The craft room taught spinning and weaving originally but later added batik and painting to its activities, and later still became a professionally run Aboriginal-owned incorporated arts enterprise known as Ernabella Arts, after the Mission was closed and the land returned to its traditional Pitjantjatjara owners. Like most early artists in her community, Tjunkaya's original style came from milpatjunanyi - an ancient Western Desert practice of drawing in the sand to tell stories to children. This is the basis of the classic Ernabella \\"walka\\". Ernabella women began to be taught batik making in 1971. In 1974, Ernabella Arts sent Tapaya to Yogyakarta with several other Pitjantjatjara women to learn more about making batik from Indonesian artists. Tapaya's work has been shown in several exhibitions in Australia, Europe, North America and Southeast Asia. Tapaya has work in the National Gallery of Victoria, the State Library of South Australia, the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, and the British Museum. On 8 June 2020, in the 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours, Tapaya was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in recognition of her service to Indigenous visual arts and the community.

One of his works was chosen as a finalist for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2012. His brother Barney Wangin and his granddaughter Kaylene Whiskey is also an artist. Tjukangku was born around 1939, in the bush near Umuwa in north- western South Australia. The name \\"Whiskey\\" was given to him by one of his friends when he was a young boy. It is said that Tjukangku took this name because he could not pronounce his own Aboriginal name. Tjukangku grew up at the mission in Ernabella and at De Rose Hill, a cattle station located along the Stuart Highway. He never went to school. As a child, he was taught about working with horses and cattle at De Rose Hill. By the time he was a teenager, Tjukangku began working for the station as a jackaroo, mustering cattle. He worked as a stockman for many years, on several stations throughout central Australia. He worked for a long time on the land of the Arrernte people (in the Northern Territory), which he depicts in many of his works. When he was older, he moved back south, closer to his homeland (where he and his family were born). He settled at Indulkana, and has lived there ever since. Tjukangku was one of the first men to begin painting at Indulkana, and was one of the original members of Iwantja Arts. In addition to painting, he also does printmaking using the intaglio method (cutting designs into wooden objects). Beginning in his early 70s, Tjukangku is reported to suffer from dementia. He still works as a full-time artist, however, and makes an average of one or two artworks per week. His artworks depict personal reflections on his travels and experiences in the central Australian desert. It is often just memories, about where he used to work or a place he fondly remembers. This is different to most traditional Yankunytjatjara artists, who usually paint about their ' (Dreaming). A common motif featured in Tjukangku's artworks is pu·πâu (wood that is used for making traditional tools and objects). This is often both his subject and his medium. Objects in his artworks are often more figurative (realistic) than in most Western Desert art, but still contain elements and shapes that are very clearly abstract. Tjukangku paints in natural earthy tones, using rich shades of red, browns, ochres and black. He uses fields and lines of white dots to highlight shapes and movement. Tjukangku's work has been featured in group shows at major galleries since 2010. He held his first solo exhibition in April-May 2011, in Alice Springs. He held a second solo show at the same venue the next year, in July-August 2012. One of the works exhibited at his first solo show was bought by the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne.

His work is now held in several major public galleries in Australia, including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the National Gallery of Australia. His painting ' (Bilby Dreaming Story) was a finalist for the Togard Contemporary Art Award in 2009. In 2010 and 2011, another of Tjutjuna's paintings, ', was chosen as a finalist in both the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards, and the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA). Life Tjutjuna was born around 1930. He was born in the bushland close to what is now the community of Pipalyatjara in the north-west corner of South Australia. Sources disagree on where exactly he was born. Some say he was born at Walytjatjara, a place to the north-east of Pipalyatjara, just over the border in the Northern Territory. Others say that he was born at Mount Davies, a hill that overlooks Pipalyatjara. When Tjutjuna was still young, his family settled at Ernabella. He went to school on the mission there and later worked as a labourer for the community. He later moved back west to live in the communities of Irrunytju and Pipalyatjara after they were established. He moved there with his wives and children to be closer to his homeland. In his later life, Tjutjuna became known as an important traditional healer (') and law man (') for the Pitjantjatjara. Tjutjuna began painting in late 2005, when he was aged in his mid-seventies. He was living again at Ernabella, and began to paint for the community's art company Ernabella Arts. His work at Ernabella depicted Tjukurpa (traditional law or stories from the Dreamtime). It supported a shift in subject matter for the centre's artists, from quite secular to more spiritual subjects. In 2008, Tjutjuna moved back to Pipalyatjara and began work for Ninuku Arts. Artwork Tjutjuna paints concepts and stories from his Dreaming. His main personal totem is a spider ('), and his Dreaming revolves around the (Spider Man Dreaming). According to his Dreaming, which was passed on to him from previous generations, Tjutjuna's ancestor is a powerful being known as the Spider Man. This creature is said to have created Tjutjuna's country in the Dreamtime, and so Tjutjuna associates his country, his heritage and himself with this set of beliefs. In this way, the paintings are autobiographical in addition to depicting traditional stories. Tjutjuna identifies himself as the Spider Man, and his paintings are often seen to symbolise his work as a ' (healer). Because his totem is a spider, he uses spider webs to treat wounds on people's skin. Tjutjuna also paints figures from several other Dreaming stories associated with his country, such as the Wati Ma·∏ªu (Red Kangaroo Man) and the Kungka Mingkiri (Mice Women). Many of the paintings have sexual themes. One of Tjutjuna's most famous paintings, ', is a composition of two Dreaming stories. It depicts the story of the Kungkarungkara (Seven Sisters), which is about the constellations of Pleiades (the Sisters) and Orion. Tjutjuna painted it from the male's perspective. , a shape-shifting man, chases the seven sisters and catches the youngest, raping her. The other story depicted is from the Spider Man Dreaming. The painting was chosen as a finalist for the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards in 2010, and the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2011. Tjutjuna paints in the typical style of the Western Desert, which can be seen as very abstract. The figures in his paintings, ancestral beings, are obscured and encoded for cultural reasons. He uses fields of dots to represent their interactions, and lines to represent their journeys across the landscape. The landscape is depicted with the earthly colours of the desert (reds, oranges, ochres and white). In his works depicting , he often paints circular patterns across the background. This motif is used to represent both a spider's web and the spider man's many women. Tjutjuna is also known for drip paintings.

The two houses and barn are historically associated with a mill, whose breached dams and remnant foundations lie just to the north. One of the houses, built about 1780, is believed to be Royalton's oldest surviving building. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Royalton Mill Complex lies along the eastern bank of the First Branch White River, about north of the village of South Royalton. It is set near a broad bend in the river, and is bounded on the east by Mill Road (Town Road 12). Set nearest the road is a 2-1/2 story wood frame duplex, which was built about 1840 as mill worker housing. West of this is a modest single-story Cape style house, with a five-bay facade and central chimney. This house was built in 1780-81, and probably includes lumber salvaged from mill and residential structures destroyed during the 1780 Royalton raid. South of the house stands a c. 1880 barn, built as part of the mill complex for storage. To the north of the house lie the remnants of the last mill buildings to stand on the site, with now- breached dams spanning the river. with This site on the First Branch White River was first developed industrially about 1776, probably by Isaac Morgan. Morgan rebuilt the mill and house after the 1780 raid, and the site had 190 years of industrial history. In the 19th century, the site included a sawmill, gristmill, fulling mill, nailery, and furniture factory. The surviving millhouse is one of only two 18th-century Cape houses in the town with an intact central chimney, and is believed to be the town's oldest building.

He was briefly a novice in the Society of Jesus, and became influential in establishing Catholic parochial and educational institutions in Washington, D.C. He was the second pastor of St. Patrick's Church for most of his life and was the sixth president of Georgetown College, later known as Georgetown University. Matthews acted as president of the Washington Catholic Seminary, which became Gonzaga College High School, and oversaw the continuity of the school during suppression by the church and financial insecurity. Matthews was vicar apostolic and apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Philadelphia during a period of ecclesiastical turmoil. He was a co-founder and president of the Washington Library Company for thirteen years‚Äîthe first public library in the District of Columbia‚Äîand was co-director and trustee of the District of Columbia Public Schools, where he was one of the superintendents of a school. Matthews was heavily involved in Catholic charitable organizations as well; he was the founder and president of St. Vincent's Female Orphan Asylum and the co-founder and president of St. Joseph's Male Orphan Asylum. He played a significant role in the founding of Washington Visitation Academy for girls, St. Peter's Church on Capitol Hill, and the parish that now includes the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle. He was born into a prominent Maryland family and became a close adviser to Archbishop John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop in the United States. He was also well connected with Washington's political elite, allowing him to preside over the first Catholic ceremony in the White House, and the only Catholic wedding in its history. He believed that because Catholics enjoyed the freedom to practice their religion in the United States under the Constitution, they had a duty to contribute to the \\"moral and physical good\\" of their communities. He also staunchly opposed slavery. For his contributions to religious and civic life, Matthews was informally known as the \\"patriarch of Washington.\\"  Early life  Matthews descended from a distinguished Maryland family that included alt=Oval portrait of Charles Carroll from the bust-up, facing the viewer William Matthews was born on December 16, 1770 in the small village of Port Tobacco in Charles County in the Maryland Colony of British America to a prominent, established Maryland family.. He was the son of William Matthews, Sr. and Mary Neale. The youngest of seven children, his siblings were Joseph, Ignatius, Mary, Susanna, Margaret, and Ann Teresa. His father, with whom he had little interaction, died when he was six years old. William Matthews Sr.'s ancestry traces to the English landed gentry, and includes Thomas Matthews‚Äîan early settler of the Maryland colony who was granted of land in Port Tobacco, Maryland, by the Lords Calvert. His mother descended from Captain James Neale, who settled in the Maryland colony in the mid-seventeenth century. Matthews' matrilineal ancestry traces its origins to the noble O'Neills of Ireland.. His cousin, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, was the sole Catholic signatory of the Declaration of Independence. In 1781, aged eleven, he witnessed British troops burn part of his family's estate during the American Revolution.. He eventually became the maternal uncle of Senator Richard T. Merrick and Judge William Matthews Merrick, and the brother-in-law of Senator William Duhurst Merrick.. From his parents, Matthews received a sizable inheritance that he drew from throughout his life for the advancement of the church. Many of Matthews' matrilineal relatives entered the priesthood. Six of his mother's seven brothers became Jesuits, and one died during the Jesuit novitiate. His uncle, Bennett Neale, was one of the first Jesuits in the English colony. His other maternal uncles were: Francis Neale, who both preceded and succeeded him as president of Georgetown College; Leonard Neale, the Archbishop of Baltimore and also president of Georgetown; and Charles Neale, the superior of the Jesuits in America. His aunt, Ann Mathews, and two of his sisters‚ÄîSusanna (Sister Mary Eleanora) and Ann Teresa (Sister Mary Aloysia)‚Äîbecame Carmelite nuns.. = Education = Matthews was sent, aged twelve, to Li√®ge in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge (modern-day Belgium) to be educated at the College of St Omer, an English Jesuit school,. where he studied classics. This made him one of the last Americans to be sent to the English school at Li√©ge.. He returned to America in his early twenties to briefly study theology at Georgetown College. While at Georgetown in 1796, he was chosen to be the first student to greet President George Washington upon his visit to the college.. He entered St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore in 1797.. Although a student at St. Mary's Seminary, Matthews frequently served as an instructor of English at Georgetown College because the professors and seminarians at St. Mary's were asked by Bishop John Carroll to assist with the teaching duties of the Jesuits at Georgetown.. His physical appearance in adulthood was described as \\"short, stocky, [and] dark-haired\\", with a prominent Aquiline nose..  Priesthood  Returning to his alma mater, Matthews was appointed a professor of rhetoric at Georgetown in 1796, where his lectures were described as monotonous.. On December 23, 1798, he took his minor orders. He was strongly attracted to the Jesuits, likely influenced by his uncle Ignatius Matthews' membership in the Society.. Matthews became a subdeacon on August 22, 1799 and was ordained as a transitional deacon on March 26, 1800.. Matthews was ordained at St. Peter's Church in Baltimore, on March 29, 1800 by Bishop John Carroll.. With his ordination, he became the fifth Catholic priest ordained in the United States and the first such person born in British America. Later, he served as a missionary in southern Maryland and occasionally as a teacher at Georgetown. = St. Patrick's Church = alt=Black and white photograph of a St. Patrick's Church and the street in front Matthews became the second pastor of St. Patrick's Church, succeeding the Dominican priest Anthony Caffry.. St. Patrick's was the largest parish in the District of Columbia at the time. and the first Catholic church to be constructed in the City of Washington.. Matthews held the post from 1804 until his death. He self-financed the purchase of eight lots near St. Patrick's, believing the location would become the heart of the growing city. Three further Catholic parishes, three schools, and an orphanage were established on the land.. Matthews oversaw construction of a new, larger church in 1809 on the site of the original building.. The brick, Gothic Revival church was completed in 1816. This new St. Patrick's was consecrated by Archbishop John Carroll, and the mass was concelebrated by Leonard Neale. During the War of 1812, British troops invaded Washington, D.C., in 1814. Matthews barricaded himself and others inside the sanctuary of St. Patrick's Church while most of the city's population fled. As the troops advanced to within two blocks of St. Patrick's, fire from surrounding buildings spread to the roof of the church. Matthews went to the roof to put out the fire,. then persuaded General Robert Ross not to destroy the church.. During his tenure as pastor, Matthews fostered an unusually large number of conversions to Catholicism. Among his parishioners were Chief Justice Roger Taney, Pierre L'Enfant, James Hoban, Mayor Robert Brent, and Mayor Thomas Carbery.. His parish produced a great many seminarians for the priesthood and novices to become nuns. He performed baptisms for a considerable number of black freedmen and slaves. He was said to have \\"detested slavery,\\" and on at least one occasion, he purchased a mother and her child at a slave auction to grant them freedom. Matthews purchased a pipe organ for St. Patrick's from an Episcopal church in Dumfries, Virginia‚Äîlikely the first organ in the District of Columbia. He acted as trusted adviser to Bishop John Carroll, whose ecclesiastical jurisdiction as Bishop of Baltimore and later as Archbishop of Baltimore, included the City of Washington and served as a liaison between the bishop and Catholic institutions and priests in Washington. Matthews was also involved in raising money for St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore by selling lottery tickets to parishioners.. From 1827 to 1830, Charles Constantine Pise was Matthews' assistant at St. Patrick's.. Another one of his assistants was Gabriel Richard. = St. Peter's Church = alt=Photograph from the street looking up at St. Peter's Church In 1820, Archbishop Carroll tasked Matthews with establishing the second Catholic parish in Washington: St. Peter's Church. While construction started on a church building, the project quickly ran out of money and went into debt. Matthews ensured that the project was completed. He decided a new site should be chosen and secured a donation of land on Capitol Hill by Daniel Carroll.. The church was eventually completed in 1821.. He opposed the control of St. Peter's Church properties by lay trustees, as the issue of trusteeism was still active in American Catholic Church. This opposition motivated his subsequent selection for an ecclesiastical mission in Philadelphia. In 1821, the Propaganda Fide in Rome removed Norfolk, Virginia from the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Baltimore, placing it within the new Diocese of Richmond. This upset Matthews, who arranged for Archbishop Ambrose Mar√©chal of Baltimore to use the diplomatic pouch of the French ambassador to the United States to express his misgivings; the ambassador would deliver the archbishop's letters to French ministers to the Holy See, who would present the communications. This would have provided some weightiness to Mar√©chal's petitions, but it is unclear if he made use of this arrangement.. = Recovery of Ann Mattingly = One of Matthews' parishioners, Ann Mattingly, suffered from a tumor in her breast for at least six years. She was in poor health; several doctors and numerous other witnesses had attested to Mattingly's advanced and worsening illness and their inability to treat the disease with the medicine of the time. By 1824, her physicians and attending priests, including Matthews, expected her imminent death.. Matthews, along with Stephen Dubuisson and Anthony Kohlmann, turned to the German priest and reputed miracle worker Prince Hohenlohe who prescribed a novena for his cures to be effective; he also set aside the tenth day of each month for offering Mass for the sick outside Europe. Following nine days of public prayer at St. Patrick's parish,. on the night of March 9, 1824, Matthews visited Mattingly at 10 pm to hear her confession. The following morning, she received communion during a Mass said by Dubuisson at 4 am. It was then reported to Matthews that she was instantly restored to health and that large ulcers on her back vanished. Matthews immediately went to visit her; according to him, she was smiling and greeted him at the door. Mattingly's quick recovery was noted by several prominent Washington physicians, and by those attending to her in bed, as shocking. When word of the event circulated, it was sensationalized by the local press. Matthews responded by criticizing the priests who exaggerated the story, but described the event to the National Intelligencer as a miracle. He compiled A Collection of Affidavits and Certificates Relative to the Wonderful Cure of Mrs. Ann Mattingly, Which Took Place in the City of Washington, D.C., on the Tenth of March, 1824.. By way of Anthony Kohlmann, this pamphlet made its way to Pope Leo XII, who had it translated into Italian and published by his personal printer..  Academic career  = Georgetown College = Old North Hall were completed.|alt=Fa√ßade of Old North viewed at an upward-looking angle By 1806, Matthews had become vice president of Georgetown College, and by 1808, he had become a member of its board of directors,. where he served until 1815.. He was elected president on February 28, 1809, succeeding his uncle Francis Neale. On the same day that he became president, Matthews entered the Jesuit novitiate, which was highly atypical for someone of his age and position. Although working at the college, Matthews chose not to live there and instead moved into St. Patrick's Church. Soon after his election, Matthews became disillusioned with the Society of Jesus and quit the Jesuits on November 1, 1809, resigning the presidency of the Jesuit-run Georgetown at the same time. His uncle, Francis Neale, once again resumed the presidency of Georgetown. The Jesuits had been wary of accepting Matthews' full membership because he had been a member of the Corporation of Roman Catholic Clergymen of Maryland, which considered itself a continuation of the Jesuits in America during the suppression of the Society of Jesus. After the Society was restored, there was friction between the Jesuits and the enduring Corporation.. Matthews' relationship with Anthony Kohlmann, a subsequent president of Georgetown, was particularly difficult. Two of Matthews' pupils were Charles Boarman‚Äîthe son of one of the college's professors, who left Georgetown College to join the Navy‚Äîand William Wilson Corcoran, who became the first president of Georgetown's alumni association in 1881. Under Matthews' presidency, the towers of Old North Hall were finally completed. = Washington Seminary = alt=Black and white image from the waist-up of Matthews seated, with a handwritten caption below As St. Patrick's parish grew, Matthews sought to obtain several assistant curates. At the same time, Georgetown College sought to move its seminarians to a location removed from \\"worldly distractions\\", and several within the Society of Jesus wanted to turn St. Patrick's into a Jesuit parish. Consequently, on June 13, 1815, despite his earlier disagreements with the Society, Matthews offered the Jesuits a plot of land adjacent to the church on which to build a house of Jesuit priests who would assist him in his parochial duties and simultaneously accommodate the relocated Jesuit seminarians. While the Jesuits prepared to move into the new building, they allowed George Ironside, an educator and former Episcopal priest who converted to Catholicism,. to use the structure as a school for lay students beginning in 1817. Subsequently, Anthony Kohlmann returned to Washington and continued operation of the school as its superior. This gave rise to the Washington Catholic Seminary (a school primarily for lay students, not seminarians) on September 8, 1821, contrary to the initial intentions of Matthews‚Äîwho sought to build a rectory‚Äîand the Jesuits, who sought to use the building as their seminary.. Since this arrangement did not provide Matthews with the assistant priests he initially sought, he wrote to Archbishop Mar√©chal expressing his desire that the Jesuits, who he viewed as trying to take over his parish, be removed from the land of St. Patrick's. Nonetheless, Matthews succeeded Adam Marshall as third president of Washington Catholic Seminary‚Äîlater Gonzaga College High School‚Äîin 1824. He also taught as a faculty member at the school. He served as a figurehead president so that the school could accept tuition; Jesuits were forbidden from accepting tuition, but Matthews was permitted to do so because he was a secular priest no longer affiliated with the Society. This arrangement allowed the school to prosper. From the start of his presidency until 1827, Matthews worked with Jeremiah Keiley, who was a Jesuit; Matthews oversaw the finances and admissions of the school, while Keiley, as the superior of the Jesuit house, oversaw the curriculum. When word of the arrangement reached the Jesuit Superior General in Rome, Luigi Fortis, he ordered that the Seminary be suppressed on September 25, 1827. Matthews, without success, repeatedly petitioned the Superior General to permit the continuation of the school.. Upon the seminary's suppression, Keiley left the Society of Jesus and founded a new, short-lived school. Matthews remained and oversaw the school that was now officially closed but still operating despite the order.. He remained president until 1848 when the Jesuits, now permitted to accept tuition, resumed control of the school. After Matthews, John E. Blox became president. Upon the resumption of Jesuit administration, the school was renamed Washington College and again as Gonzaga College in 1857..  Civic life  = Washington Library = 1841 lithograph by Charles Fenderich of Matthews wearing an alt=Bust of Matthews facing right, wearing an epitrachelion In 1811, Matthews co-founded the District of Columbia's first permanent public library, the Washington Library Association,. which secured its congressional charter as the Washington Library Company on April 18, 1814, preceding the District of Columbia Public Library. Along with 200 other benefactors, Matthews contributed money by purchasing substantial stock in the library. He served on several of the library's committees, which were responsible for drafting its rules and purchasing books.. He was elected the library's second president on April 18, 1821, succeeding the pastor of the F Street Presbyterian Church, Dr. James Laurie.. The library prospered under Matthews, where it was used by employees of the federal government and private citizens. He led a successful campaign to raise money by selling library stock, which was invested in Washington's banks and real estate.. In the spring of 1827, he purchased a Masonic lodge on Eleventh Street as the first permanent home for the library. Throughout his presidency, its collections steadily increased in size. Matthews acquired 3,000 volumes of Peter Force's collection on American history, doubling the Washington Library's holdings; doing so required a personal loan from him. His presidency came to an end in April 1834 when he was succeeded by Samuel Harrison Smith and Peter Force.. = Washington Public Schools = Matthews was a trustee of the District of Columbia Public Schools from July 13, 1813 to 1844. For a part of his term, he served as co-director of the school system, and as one of three members of the board of trustees who collectively acted as superintendents of the Lancasterian school‚Äîone of three schools of the public school system alongside the Eastern and Western schools.. In this capacity, he visited the school quarterly, and oversaw instruction of the students and performance of the teachers.. The school system was perpetually underfunded by the Washington City Council; as a result, the less resource-intensive Lancasterian system was instituted and the school suffered insufficient facilities for many years. It was periodically taken over by the District of Columbia Militia for training, which disrupted studies.. On several occasions, the board of trustees requested that Matthews obtain the funds from the City Council that were statutorily promised to them; he separately solicited private donations as well. Matthews further acted as a member of a committee charged with persuading President James Madison to sell his stable on Fourteenth and G Streets to be used as the new schoolhouse for the Lancasterian school. He sat on another committee that was charged with making rules and regulations for the school system in 1815, and the reorganization of the system in 1816.. = St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum = alt=Black and white three-quarter view of St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum building In 1825, Matthews founded the St. Vincent's Female Orphan Asylum near St. Patrick's Church in Washington. He had requested that several nuns of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul in Emitsburg go to Washington to care for the orphaned girls of the city.. Matthews gave $400 and a small, white house on F Street to the three sisters who came to found the orphanage. During Matthews' time as its president, the institution was run by the nuns. Funding for the institution came initially from parishioners of St. Patrick's; the parish would hold fundraising events for the asylum, which became the center of parish life. This allowed it to expand to a larger facility on 10th and G Streets in 1828. In 1832, Matthews persuaded Congress to equally divide between St. Vincent's and the Washington Orphan Asylum a plot of land that was valued at $20,000.. The orphanage was incorporated by an act of Congress, which also remitted some of its taxes until Congress exempted it from property taxes entirely. Matthews' friendships with many of Washington's social elite drew contributions to the orphanage from people such as Mayor Thomas Carberry and President Andrew Jackson. He was also well acquainted with Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and Roger Taney. These friendships were partly the result of Matthews' strong Federalist and later Whig views.. The initial purpose of the institution was to be an orphanage for girls, but since its founding, it was operated as a free school for poor children of Washington that educated orphans and non-orphans alike. This educational function became integral to the institution's purpose, and the number of non-orphaned students eventually far exceeded the number of orphans. In 1831, a board of trustees and a board of female lay managers were created, the latter of which was composed of prominent women in the District who were able to enlist financial support for the institution. On May 14, 1849, to accommodate the institution's growth, the cornerstone for a new building was laid at the same site. Matthews served as president of the asylum from its founding to his death in 1854. = Visitation Academy = Early photograph by alt=Black and white photograph of Matthews holding a hat by his side in his right hand and with his left hand tucked in between his coat buttons Eventually, a female counterpart to the Washington Seminary was established as the Washington Visitation Academy. Its purpose was to educate girls of a higher social class than those at St. Vincent's, as education in Washington was socioeconomically divided at the time. By 1850, a school for girls at Ninth and F Streets, on land that was owned by St. Patrick's Church, prospered. The school was initially run by the Daughters of Charity, but the rules of their order eventually required them to leave the school. It was then taken over by the Sisters of the Visitation from the Georgetown Visitation Convent, who sought to create a school similar to the Georgetown Visitation Academy. At a time when it was considered improper to educate girls in higher academic subjects, but rather only in how to behave in polite society, the Visitation Academy sought to educate girls in both skills. Matthews was not involved in the direct management of the institution but provided financial support. The school moved into a mansion originally intended as the French ambassador's residence, but it was unable to pay the $3,000 mortgage. The superior, Mother Juliana, requested assistance from him. Matthews declined, as he had previously offered them land and a building free of charge. Several days later, however, he contributed $10,000 to support the school. = St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum = In mid-1853, the board of trustees of St. Vincent's Asylum approved the creation of St. Joseph's Male Orphan Asylum, later renamed the St. Joseph's Home and School for Boys. Matthews had attempted to create a male orphanage in October 1843, but this closed by 1846. He and Timothy O'Toole, his successor as pastor of St. Patrick's Church,. oversaw the establishment of the new orphanage, and Matthews served as president of its board from its founding. Matthews died before its opening in February 1855. His will bequeathed $3,000 to the boys' orphanage that, like St. Vincent's, relied on private donations and government assistance for funding..  Vicar Apostolic of Philadelphia  St. Mary's Cathedral, depicted in 1829, was one of the centers of the trustee dispute.|alt=Color image of St. Mary's Cathedral with people on sidewalk On February 26, 1828, the Prefect of the Propaganda Fide, Cardinal Mauro Cappellari, instructed Archbishop Ambrose Mar√©chal of Baltimore to effectuate the appointment of Matthews by Pope Leo XII as vicar apostolic and apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Philadelphia... This order was promulgated because Bishop Henry Conwell of Philadelphia had been recalled to Rome by the Holy See due to a long-brewing schism over lay trusteeism, and Mar√©chal had been ordered to oversee the diocese during his absence... Alongside his appointment as administrator, Matthews was also appointed by Bishop Conwell as senior pastor and superior of the clergy at St. Mary's Cathedral,. which was one of the centers of the trustee dispute. When Bishop Conwell attempted to return to his diocese from Rome against the orders of the Propaganda Fide during their investigation, the congregation empowered Matthews to announce Conwell's suspension from episcopal office.. As apostolic administrator, Matthews took part in the First Provincial Council of Baltimore and acted as a theologian for the participating bishops.. He also acted as a representative of the Diocese of Philadelphia at the council, in place of Bishop Conwell. He was later appointed the coadjutor of the Diocese of Philadelphia, which would have elevated him to the episcopate, with the expectation that he would eventually become Bishop of Philadelphia, but he declined the position and the elevation. Instead, Matthews expressed his desire to step down as vicar apostolic,. and his term came to an end in 1829. In his place, Francis Kenrick was appointed coadjutor bishop in 1830. At one point, Matthews also declined being appointed the coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Richmond.  Return to Washington  alt=Bust portrait of William Matthews in ecclesiastical attire Matthews had a strong spiritual commitment, and he was especially fond of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, encouraging it in his parish and in churches in Baltimore. For this reason, he was chosen by the Visitation Sisters as their spiritual director in 1831... The following year, Matthews officiated at the wedding of Mary Anne Lewis‚Äîa ward of President Andrew Jackson and a Catholic‚Äîand Joseph Pageot, the secretary of the French diplomatic legation to the United States. The wedding took place on November 29, 1832 in the East Room of the White House,. and signified the first Catholic ceremony in the history of the White House, and the only Catholic wedding in its history. One year later, Matthews again presided over a ceremony in the White House, this time in the Red Room, with the baptism of Lewis and Pageot's only son, Andrew Jackson Pageot. This baptism marked the second Catholic ceremony in the residence's history. Matthews believed that since Catholics were granted the freedom to practice their religion by the Constitution of the United States, they had a duty to contribute to the \\"moral and physical good\\" of their communities. In the 1830s, Matthews sold his house to fund the building of a new church on the northeastern corner of 15th and H Streets near the White House to alleviate overcrowding at St. Patrick's Church. A new parish was founded in 1839 and the new church was completed in 1840; it was dedicated on November 1 that year. The church was named St. Matthew's Church in honor of both Saint Matthew and William Matthews.. The building was replaced by the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle as the parish's church in the 1890s.  Death and legacy  Matthews depicted in a mural by alt=Mural painting of various religious figures together, with a cardinal in the center Matthews died on April 30, 1854 and was buried in the cemetery adjacent to St. Patrick's Church. In the mid-1870s, to allow for construction of a new church, his body was exhumed along with the rest of those in the cemetery. While being transferred to a new coffin, it was observed that the body was remarkably preserved. The corpse was laid in front of the altar, where it remained during the All Souls' Day Mass, before being reinterred in the priests' section of Mount Olivet Cemetery.. It was reported that at his death, he requested that he be \\"laid upon the floor to expire\\" because he \\"did not deserve to die in his chair\\". During the latter part of his life and after his death, Matthews was nicknamed the \\"patriarch of Washington\\" due to his contributions to the religious and civic worlds of the city.. On his gravestone in Mount Olivet Cemetery, the Serra Club placed a bronze plaque in 1973, commemorating his life. In his will, he bequeathed monies to St. Vincent's Asylum, enabling the construction of a larger school on G Street in 1857. The school endured through the nineteenth century, playing a major role in educating girls in Washington. In the center of a mural by Edwin Blashfield above the doors of St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, Matthews is depicted alongside other important figures of the early Catholic church in America; he stands beside Archbishop Michael Curley and Cardinal James Gibbons. Matthews is also depicted in the interior frieze of the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore. The relief depicts his ordination, where he is shown kneeling with his head bowed as Bishop John Carroll places his hands on Matthews' head..

Other volumes were reprinted as they stood, but Sir Percy Buck, who was also involved with the OUP's Tudor Church Music, revised the first two volumes (1929 and 1932), and edited a new introductory volume (1929). The introductory volume included a contribution from Sylvia Townsend Warner.Anne Pimlott Baker, ‚ÄòBuck, Sir Percy Carter (1871‚Äì1947)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 16 Aug 2016 (subscription or membership of a UK public library required) In 1940 H C Colles added a seventh volume, Symphony and Drama, 1850-1900.

In addition, he helped launch the television networks BET and MSG, a predecessor of the USA Network.  Early life and education  Rosencrans was born on March 26, 1927, in New York City. His parents were Alvin, an Austrian immigrant who imported ornaments for women's hats, and Eva Greene, a Russian immigrant who was a fashion designer. Rosencrans was raised in Woodmere, New York. He had plans to attend Dartmouth College until his older brother died in combat during World War II. Rosencrans enlisted and served in the United States Army Air Forces, then earned bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from Columbia University in 1949.  Career  Panelists discussing the first use of a satellite to distribute cable television programming, the 1975 \\"Thrilla in Manila\\" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Left to right: Monty Rifkin, Jack Cole, Hubert Schlafly, Sid Topol, Bob Rosencrans, Gerald M. Levin, Brian Lamb. After several jobs in retailing, Rosencrans joined Box Office Television (BOT), which produced programming for hotels and wanted to offer closed-circuit programming, such as sports games and live theater, to movie theaters. Rosencrans conceived the idea of a cable system after BOT purchased TelePrompTer in 1956 with the goal of expanding its closed-circuit programming. In 1961, he and other investors began acquiring cable systems in smaller towns. In 1975, Rosencrans' Columbia Cable Systems (which later became UA-Columbia Cablevision) invested nearly $100,000 to become the first cable operator to install a satellite receiving station. The company did so in order to broadcast \\"Thrilla in Manila\\", the third and final boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, to its subscribers in Florida. Rosencrans is credited for persuading Madison Square Garden to launch the television network MSG. He and Kay Koplovitz helped create this as a sports channel, which later expanded its programming to become USA Network, the first basic cable channel distributed via satellite. Rosencrans offered Robert L. Johnson air time on Friday evenings, which led to the creation of BET, a basic cable and satellite television channel targeting African American audiences. He was an early financial backer and founding board chair of C-SPAN, an American public affairs television network. In 1977, while serving as president of UA- Columbia, Rosencrans and his partner Ken Gunter contributed $25,000 and convinced other industry leaders to contribute an additional $450,000 to launch the network. C-SPAN began broadcasting on March 19, 1979, with additional funding from UA-Columbia and several other cable television companies. Rosencrans served on the C-SPAN board for nearly 40 years and was designated its chairman emeritus until his death. Rosencrans' role at UA- Columbia was eliminated when the company split in 1984. He started the cable multiple system operator Columbia International, which sold in 1995 for an estimated $600 million. In 2000, Rosencrans was inducted into the Cable Hall of Fame, which recognizes \\"ground-breaking leaders who have shaped and advanced\\" the cable telecommunications industry. Note: User must click on \\"2000 Honorees\\" in the right sidebar. The honor was bestowed by The Cable Center, a nonprofit, educational organization serving the industry. In addition to his work in cable television, Rosencrans was an early investor in PublicAffairs, a publishing company established in 1997 by Peter Osnos. He was also an investor in the video discussion website Bloggingheads.tv in 2007.  Personal life  Rosencrans was Jewish and described by The New York Times as a \\"political liberal\\". As of May 2012, Rosencrans was retired and living in Connecticut. Rosencrans died at a hospital from stroke complications on August 3, 2016, in Greenwich, Connecticut, at the age of 89.

History The property was constructed in 1951, and initially operated as Bunny's Bar, popular among employees of the nearby Nellis Air Force Base. In April 1974, Marvin E. Coleman (also known as Mickey Coleman) and his wife, Laura Coleman, purchased of land, including the bar. The Colemans added a casino and reopened the property as the Poker Palace later that year. The casino was approximately and featured one blackjack table, two pool tables, eight slot machines, and one bar. In June 1979, the Colemans purchased an adjacent of land, directly east of the Poker Palace. In 1994, the Poker Palace became the first casino in the Las Vegas Valley to introduce a tax service within the property, an idea that was well received by customers. The concept was initially dismissed by other locals casinos for being unusual, but the Palace Station and Mahoney's Silver Nugget later adopted the idea. In 1997, the Poker Palace was one of nine casinos in the Las Vegas area to offer SportXction, a new interactive betting system. In November 1998, to improve on the image of North Las Vegas, the Colemans opened a new, upscale restaurant at the Poker Palace named Laura's Vineyard. The Poker Palace was one of two Las Vegas casinos to provide sign-up services for SportXction, until the service was suspended in May 2000. In June 2000, the Poker Palace was approved for a expansion of the property to include a senior citizen bingo hall. Marvin Coleman also planned to construct a 114-space parking lot for employees. In November 2003, it was reported that the Poker Palace's blackjack-like table game was largely tilted toward the casino's advantage. The Poker Palace celebrated its 30th anniversary with a $30,000 giveaway throughout May 2004, with a special anniversary party planned for June 5, 2004. In late 2006, the Nevada Gaming Control Board launched an investigation into the Poker Palace after sportsbook audits revealed unusually high handle on racing wagers placed at the casino. With the help of an undercover board agent, investigators discovered that three Poker Palace employees engaged in various illegal race book activities. In August 2008, Jeff Haney of the Las Vegas Sun gave the Poker Palace a zero-star rating on his list of the best sportsbooks in Las Vegas, calling it, \\"An extremely low- limit locals joint. We do mean locals. If you're a tourist and you end up here, you're probably very, very lost.\\" In May 2009, the Poker Palace was fined $250,000 for the illegal race book activities, while Marvin Coleman was cited for failure to adequately supervise his casino and its employees. Poker Palace's large sign in 2013. Maddy's Paddy Cafe, a coffee shop named after the Colemans' granddaughter, operates inside the Poker Palace. In September 2012, Maddy's Paddy Cafe was chosen as \\"Dining Pick of the Week\\" by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The Poker Palace celebrated its 40th anninversary on April 1, 2014, with a guest appreciation celebration offering complimentary cake and champagne. On the morning of January 26, 2015, the Poker Palace's large sign caught on fire while having work done. Firefighters were contacted at approximately 11:00 a.m., and took approximately 10 minutes to extinguish the fire, which destroyed the sign and created a smoke plume that was visible for miles. As of 2016, the Poker Palace features a casino, with 280 slot machines, seven table games, eight poker tables, a bingo hall, and a sportsbook.

Course The river is about long. The source is in Staple Hill in the Blackdown Hills. It flows on a roughly southern course through Bishopswood, briefly forming the boundary between Devon and Somerset, then between Devon and Dorset following a tripoint of all three counties, through Marsh. It continues to form a river valley for much of the rest of its course, passing between Yarcombe, Stockland, Dalwood and Membury until it meets the River Axe just southwest of Axminster, which continues to the English Channel. The A303, a major road across southern England, runs across the Yarty on a high viaduct at Marsh. Further south, the A30 crosses the river east of Yarcombe, slightly west of the Devon ‚Äì Dorset border. History The name is of an uncertain origin but is believed to be derived from Old English. The villages of Yarcombe and Yartyford are both named after the river. The upper area forms one of several bisections of the otherwise hilly area around the Blackdown Hills. As the river is based in a relatively deep valley, it is prone to flooding. There have been numerous formally recorded reports of property damage near the Yarty since the 1960s. The land across the flood plain of the Yarty is boggy and difficult to cross. In the late spring of 1685 during the Monmouth Rebellion, this caused problems when Lord Albermarle's army were unable to defend the advancing Duke of Monmouth northwards from Lyme Regis towards Sedgemoor.

Joyce still blames Victor, her first son, for abandoning the family as the man of the house when he went to jail and is fearful that he will be a negative influence on Duke and she warns him to stay away from her son Duke. Duke realises that there will never be enough money to buy the drugs his mum needs and pay for his tuition fees. He decides to become a car thief and comes up with a gimmick to steal cars. He enlists the help of his friend from the hood, Lati Asunmo (Rotimi Salami) and Lati's ex-girlfriend Keji Anuola, (Judith Audu) completes the team. The idea is that they would steal cars under the guise of being a newly wedded couple returning from their wedding ceremony in a decorated car. Their very first operation is very successful. Lati who is a mechanic breaks into the vehicles and hot-wires them. They decorate the car and change into their costumes. Keji acts as the Bride, while Duke is the Groom and Lati is the Driver. Victor is totally unaware of his brother's new found life and is struggling to find a job and trying to win back his mother's love which is totally futile. Keji and Victor begin a relationship that is kept quiet. As the months go by and Duke is able to buy drugs for his mum and he is able to stay in school though his grades are affected. But the new found life gets the better of him and he eventually drops out of school. The team realise that they are being cheated by their buyer Ekun (Gregory Ojefua) who pays a flat amount for every car stolen. They want more and he isn't willing to pay more. Lati tell the team that he heard of a new buyer who would be willing to pay more. They decide to go see him. They meet with YJ (Brutus Richard), an ex-convict and former cellmate of Victor. They strike a deal and begin stealing cars for YJ. Victor finally gets a job as a delivery boy. He still tries to make peace with his mother but she is unforgiving. Consistently working with Keji, Duke is also beginning to feel something for her. Duke asks Lati if he should proceed, Lati encourages him to go on. On one of their deliveries to YJ, Duke meets his brother at YJ's place, and Duke is introduced as one of his ‚Äúboys‚Äù. Victor tries to warn Duke to leave the life of crime he's begun to lead but Duke is very strong-headed and determined to see it through. His words ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be poor‚Äù. Duke and Keji finally go out on a date. Duke wants out and he tells Keji he wants to stop stealing cars and start something legitimate. But she's not ready to give it up yet. According to her, they all just got started. The new guy pays way better and life is really good. Just when he is about to tell Keji how he feels about her, Lati comes in with news that his mum has passed on. This brings Duke and Victor's world tumbling down. He goes underground for a while. Duke decides to go back into robbery but this time with an exit strategy. He wants to go to Malaysia to continue his education. They go on a spree and exceed their deliverable. YJ is happy, but a wrong move on Duke's part causes YJ to send his men to find out their Mode of Operation. During one of their operations, Duke sees ZEB (L.A.S.E) one of YJ's thugs following them. He confronts YJ about this and ends up getting a serious beating. Duke decides that it is time to cut ties with YJ. On their way to tell Keji, they meet Victor. They decide to call it quits but Lati has been mismanaging his funds and begs them to do one last run. YJ who has been spying on Duke the whole time tries stealing the money from Duke but Victor comes looking for his brother. YJ tells him that his brother has been nabbed by the police. They get into a fight and Victor ends up killing YJ. The team go on their last trip but end up in a car chase with the police as YJ had tipped the police off. They try to run off on foot. Lati gets caught. An ambush has been laid for Keji at her home. Duke gets to the hotel where he has been staying only to find his brother being carted away by the police. Again his brother has taken the fall for Duke. Duke leaves town.

Career As a young religious sister she taught at schools in Stone. In 1860, Sister Rose Columba became vicaress in the community at the Church of Our Lady of the Angels in Stoke-upon-Trent. She was appointed vicaress (later prioress) at St. Mary Church in Torquay in 1866, and served there until 1883. In the summer of 1883, Mother Rose Columba left that work to lead a group of eight overseas to Australia, where Dominican sisters were called to nurse. She kept a journal of the six-week voyage. In Adelaide, the sisters opened a school, embroidered, painted, and cared for the sick, while Mother Rose Columba worked to establish a spiritual component to the community. She designed a Gothic Revival chapel for the convent, but did not live to see it completed.

Originally known as the New York Section, it was formed in 1894 and officially renamed the America Section in 1919. The main activity of the America Section is the awarding of several prizes in chemistry: the Perkin Medal, the Chemical Industry Medal and the Gordon E. Moore Medal. The America Section also works with the American Chemical Society (ACS) and others to support scholars in chemistry and chemical engineering. History The creation of the Society of Chemical Industry (SCI) in London in 1881 led to the eventual formation of a number of satellite groups. A number of informal meetings were held in 1894, with the goal of organizing a New York section of the Society of Chemical Industry. On May 2, 1894, analytical chemist Arthur McGeorge met with seven other members of London's Society of Chemical Industry who were active in New York. At a second meeting, with Alfred H. Mason as chairman and McGeorge as secretary, it was decided to invite all New York-based members of the London society to an organizational meeting. At this third meeting, at the College of Pharmacy, 36 members of the Society of Chemical Industry signed a petition requesting the London organization to form a New York section, the first section to be created overseas. Their proposal was enthusiastically received by London president E. C. C. Stanford, who wrote \\"We are pleased to add the stars and stripes to our highly respectable old colours.\\" The first official meeting of the new New York Section was held in November 1894. The new section had a membership of 350 members, about 1/10th of the entire organization. The London group's president Thomas Tyrer and foreign secretary Ludwig Mond attended the October 1895 fall meeting in New York, which was rescheduled so that they could participate. In contrast to the American Chemical Society, which required its members to hold university degrees, the Society of Chemical Industry was open to a broad range of working chemists in industry, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. Mason emphasized that the new organization did not intend to compete with the ACS, but rather to bring together academic and manufacturing chemists: Members of the America section benefited from the activities of the parent society, which held scientific conferences and published The Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry to inform chemists throughout the world about development in the field. From the beginning, the America Section's focus was networking, engaging its members in collegial activities. The second chairman, Charles F. Chandler, said \\"It serves to bring us together, to make us acquainted, and it enables us to help each other.\\" Members of the New York section helped to establish The Chemists' Club in New York City in 1898, using it for lectures and meetings, and establishing a members' library. In the beginning, talks were presented at the monthly meetings and published in the parent journal. Guest speakers included important international figures like Leo Baekeland, Carl Duisberg, and J≈çkichi Takamine. In 1904, the New York Section hosted the first annual meeting of its parent organization to be held in the United States. The New York section was briefly involved in practical work on standardization in 1902-3, when they established a Subcommittee on Uniformity of Analysis of Materials. Two samples of Portland cement were analyzed by 14 chemists, and 3 samples of zinc ore were analyzed by 42 chemists. The results were critiqued by William Francis Hillebrand, who became chief chemist at the National Bureau of Standards. The committee dissolved and was replaced in 1904 by a new committee formed by the ACS. The American section also engaged in early lobbying efforts, as in 1907, when they passed a resolution protesting that Rules and Regulations published by the Department of Agriculture displayed a \\"lack of expert knowledge.\\" However, such activities never became a major focus of the organization. In 1919, the New York group was renamed the America Section. Governance The Society of Chemical Industry (America Section) is a registered nonprofit organization, with administrative offices in Philadelphia, PA. SCI America is directed by a set of officers including a chair and vice-chair, and an executive committee. Craig A. Rogerson, Chairman, President, and CEO of Hexion Inc. was named chair of SCI in March 2018. Previous chairpersons include Max Tishler, Ralph Landau, Harold Sorgenti, Charles O. Holliday, and Christopher D. Pappas. Resa Thomason serves as the Executive Director. Activities =Awards= The major activities of SCI America are two yearly events for the presentation of awards. SCI America presents the Perkin Medal (established 1906), the Chemical Industry Medal, first awarded 1933), and the Gordon E. Moore Medal (first awarded 2004). The first Perkin Medal was awarded to chemist William Henry Perkin to mark the 50th anniversary of his discovery of the aniline dye mauveine. This anniversary was celebrated internationally as the Perkin Jubilee. SCI America commemorated a visit by Perkin and his family to the United States in the fall of 1906 by inviting 400 guests to a dinner in his honor at Delmonico's and presenting him with the first Perkin Medal. The Perkin Medal is considered the highest honor in applied chemistry to be given to a chemist residing in the United States. It is administered jointly by a committee whose representatives include the chairs or presidents of the ACS, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the Science History Institute, and SCI America. From 1920 to 1932, SCI America awarded the Grasselli Medal, on behalf of the Grasselli Chemical Company, for a paper presenting the most useful suggestions in applied chemistry before the Society. This award was replaced in 1933 by the Chemical Industry Medal, which was given to a person who had made a valuable contribution by applying chemical research in industry. Since 2004 SCI America has awarded a medal in honor of Gordon E. Moore, for early-career innovation involving the application of chemistry. =Scholars= SCI America also works with the ACS and others to support scholars in chemistry and chemical engineering.

History The origin of the surname Lanza is much debated: according to many historians, the surname comes from the Bavarian dukes. The thesis is supported by Robert Guiscard's document of 16 December 1080 in which he writes: (La) Ideo ad humilem supplicationem nobilis consanguinei nostri, fidelis dilecti Conradi Lanza, militis, ad praesens unius ex capinaeis nostrae militiae et descendentis ex ducibus Bavariae, nobis perrectam et suis maiorumque suorum consideratis servitiis et benemeritis (En) So humble supplication made by our blood relative, the faithful and belove soldier Corrado Lanza, currently ore of captains of our warfare and a descendant form the Dukes of Bavaria, and considered the services and the merits of his and of his ancestors According to the Biographical dictionary of Italians it derives from the first exponent known with this name, Manfred I Lancia: it owes its name to the fact that he was the captain of the great spear (lancifero or capitano della grande lanciain Italian) of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, but his service to the emperor is not confirmed by sources. According to some genealogists Manfred was the son of Guglielmo del Vasto, first Marques of Busca. Other historians argue that Lanzas are Dukes of Bavaria and Ernesto Wittelsbach originated the noble family Lanza or Lancia, in 970 he was nicknamed captain of the great spear (capitano della grande lancia translated in Italian), from which the name. And from Ernesto Lanza derived Corrado Lanza, his son. Sicily The original branch is that of the Barons of Longi by Galvano Lanza, Lord of Brolo (1200). In the 17th century, the Lanza family was divided into the main branches of the Dukes of Brolo and the princes of Trabia. From the first came the Marchesi Lanza (from 1814), of the Dukes of Brolo, Baroni di Piraino, Baroni di Longi, Baroni of Marcatobianco, of Butti and Mangaliviti, Barons of Malaspina and Baroni of the Supplements of Trapani, Sciacca and Mazara; from the Princes of Trabia, however, came the princes and dukes Lanza and the princes of Mirto [9]. In Sicily, everything would start with Bonifacio count d'Agliano son of Corrado I (of the Dukes of Bavaria) d'Agliano and brother of Manfredi. The nobleman had four children by Costanza Maletta: Bianca (who was actually called Beatrice Lancia) who married Emperor Frederick II of Swabia; Galvano who was executed with Corradino of Swabia in 1268; Jailbird. Other sources want Bianca Lanza, daughter of Corrado Lanza of the Dukes of Bavaria and Lord of Brolo, Count of Fondi and sister of Galvano Lanza, Baron of Longi and Count of the Principality. Then summarizing another genealogy: Founder Ernesto of Bavaria in 990, then Conrad of the Dukes of Bavaria, Federico Lancia Count of Fondi, Don Corrado Lancia of the Dukes of Bavaria of Brolo, Count of Fondi 1168 and then his son Galeotto. From Galeotto, I Baron of Longi and Lord of Brolo (1255, son of Galvano, Count of the Principality, Prince of Taranto and perhaps of Salerno, Lord of Longi), were born: Blasco, II Baron of Longi and I Baron of Ficarra and Brolo and Corrado III Baron of Longi and II Baron of Ficarra and Brolo, was Grand Chancellor of the Kingdom of Sicily in 1297, Lord of Castemainardo and founder of the barons of Longi, Ficarra and Brolo and of the barons then princes of Trabia and Federico, Viceroy of the Kingdom of Sicily in 1258, during the reign of Manfredi of Sicily, son of Bianca Lancia. In 1256 Manfredi Lancia was a royal castellan and straticoto of Messina to be identified perhaps with the same captain who was the executioner of Malta and Gozo. The first to possess the fief of Trabia is BlascoLanza (Catania 1466 - Palermo 1535) of the Barons of Longi (his grandfather Blasco was the 7th Baron of Longi), famous jurist, judge of the Great Court of the Kingdom in 1507 (charge conferred by King Ferdinand II of Aragon \\"the Catholic\\" and later by the emperor Charles V), deputy of the Kingdom in 1508, vicar general in Sicily in 1514 and other positions still. Thanks to the marriage with Leonardo's daughter Bartolomeo, protonotary and president of the Kingdom of Sicily, he obtained the territory of Trabia. With the privilege of 14 November 1509 made executive from 11 June 1510, this territory becomes a noble feud. Blasco's son, Cesare Lanza is the first baron of Trabia, as well as Castanea, a fief inherited from his mother: in 1564 he was also the first count of Mussomeli. Trabia soon moved to Principality and Ottavio Lanza was the first prince of it in 1601. Giuseppe Lanza, Duke of Camastra, is known to have been the proponent of the reconstruction of Catania and Val di Noto after the earthquake of 1693. The years and the members pass of the family, when Ignatius Prince of Trabia, became courtly councilor of the emperor Charles VI of Habsburg, combining the position of captain of Palermo in 1717 and praetor in 1737. Giuseppe Lanza di Trabia (1750-1855), Sicilian archaeologist and collector, gentleman of the chamber and knight of the Order of San Gennaro, minister of ecclesiastical affairs, made an excellent and profitable marriage joining with Stefania Branciforte of the princes of Leonforte and princess of Butera : in this way all the titles and assets of the two families were brought together. In 1658, Pietro Maria Lanza, XV Baron of Longi (son of Baldassarre II Lanza XIV Baron of Longi and Donna Paola Romeo), was the last male of the Lanza to own the Barony of Longi, in fact he did not want to respect the so-called \\"Agnatizia Successione \\"in favor of the second-born branch of his brother Giuseppe Lanza, Baron of Malaspina, to favor his only daughter, Flavia Lanza, who by marrying Gaspare di Napoli, in fact brought the first and historic barony of the Lanza of Sicily into the family of Naples. First and last example of Sicilian Succession (towards other families) in the main branch of the Lanza of Sicily. There were bitter struggles in the family (the brothers Pietro Maria and Giuseppe died), between the cousins Donna Flavia and don Filippo Lanza (and Filingeri), between 1658 and 1665. There was a truce described by Federico Lancia and Grassellini in his work : Dei Lancia di Brolo family tree and biographies, ed. Gaudieno, 1879. From the Baron Filippo Lanza and Filingeri and Donna Maria Antonia Maniaci of the princes of San Michele and of San Giorgio and of the dukes of Santa Maria, Baron Michele Lanza, Baron of Malaspina, of the Dukes of Brolo, of the Barons of Longi and Baron of Supplements was born of Trapani, Sciacca and Mazara (from 1722), who married the heir of the Spinotto family, Maria Rosalia. Corrado Lanza was born, Baron of Malaspina, of the Dukes of Brolo, of the Barons of Longi, Baron of Supplements of Trapani, Sciacca and Mazara from 1751, Senator, Mayor and Attorney General of Palermo, Rational Master of the Patricians of Palermo, Member of the Brotherhood of Bianchi and Governor of Pio Monte di Piet√† and Opera Pia of Navarro. From Corrado Lanza and Spinotto who married the noble Eleonora Morello and Colnago of Santa Venera, were born: Michele and Ferdinando Lanza and Morello: the first gave birth to the Sicilian Firstborn branch and inherited the paternal titles: of the Dukes of Brolo, of the Barons of Longi, Baron of Supplements of Trapani, Sciacca and Mazara (1791) and Baron of Malaspina and by Sicilian succession by his grandmother: Barone di Marcatobianco and Barone di Butti and Mangaliviti. He was named Marquis of Marcatobianco in 1814 (Protonotary of the Kingdom, Italian historical and noble encyclopedia of the MarquisVittorio Spreti, Ed. Italian Historical-noble Encyclopedia, 1968, vol. 4). The Second-born, Ferdinando Lanza of the Dukes of Brolo, of the Barons of Longi, of the Barons of the Supplements of Trapani, Sciacca and Mazara, of the Barons of Malaspina, was Colonel of the Real Army of the Two Sicilies, Commander of the Val Demone, Knight of Law of the Real Military Order of San Giorgio della Reunion (1819), Gold Medal of Military Valor in 1799, married in Palermo with the Countess of the Holy Roman Empire, Donna Maria Santa Testa, moved to Naples and founded the Lanza Neapolitan Branch of Sicily. Colonel Ferdinando Lanza (and Morello), had many children and among them: the Cav. Firstborn Corrado (without male descendants), Cav. Don Gaetano Lanza, second son, with male offspring and Don Raffaele, accepted in the Royal Guard Corps of Horse 1843, as reported by the historian Bonazzi. From Don Gaetano Lanza develops the legitimate branch of the Lanza di Brolo, of the barons of Longi up to our days, in chronological sequence: the cav. Don Ferdinando, don Corrado, don Michele, don Eduardo (with his son don Salvatore and with Assunta), Corrado (with his sons don Michele and don Francesco), and don Ferdinando. [Without source] Corrado Lanza (and Spinotto), son of Michele Barone of Malaspina and Baron of Supplements 1722 (of Filippo, of Giuseppe, of Baldassarre II XIV Baron of Longi), of the Dukes of Brolo, of the Barons of Longi, Baron of the Supplements of Trapani, Sciacca and Mazara (1751) and Barone di Malaspina (1733), was a great man of the Sicilian institutions, was Senator of Palermo in the years 1751-52 and 1760‚Äì61, was Mayor of the Senate of Palermo (Grande di Spagna of First Class), several times between 1770 and 1790, Attorney General, was Rational Master of the Noble Patrizii of Palermo, Governor of the Pio Monte di Piet√†, Governor of the Opera Pia di Navarro, Councilor of the Compagnia dei Bianchi of Palermo (exclusive to Nobili only), he was the forefather of the Lanza of Barons of Longi and the Dukes of Brolo and the Barons then Marc hesi of Marcatobianco for Sicilian Succession from his mother, Maria Rosalia Spinotto (sister of the Consul of Genoa in Palermo, Barone di Marcatobianco, of Butti and Mangaliviti), He died in Naples in September 1791 and was buried in the historic Church of S. Anna of the Royal Palace a few steps from her Neapolitan home. Among the other historical representatives of the Lanza, Francesco Girolamo Lanza di Scalea who fought in the ranks of the Thousand of Giuseppe Garibaldi: Francesco later became a senator of the Kingdom of Italy. Curiosity is that on the same front, but opposite to the Thousand, was present the Lieutenant General of the Bourbon army, Ferdinando Lanza (only namesake of the Lanza, not belonging to the branch of the Lanza of Sicily, in fact it came from Nocera dei Pagani, province of Salerno, also reported by historian Federico Lanza and Grassellini, historian of the Lanza family, in the great work: \\"Dei Lancia di Brolo, genealogical tree and biographies\\", publisher GB Gaudieno, 1879. Legends on the Origin of the Lanza Surname These are the three suggested origins of the Lanza surname. The most suggestive one speaks of a Corrado, grandson of Ernesto di Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria and Pomerania, who goes to the Holy Land and there, with the help of the priest Orion, finds the tip of the Lancia with which Longino struck our side's, Lord Jesus Christ. The most likely, it is \\"from serious German authors\\": it speaks of an Ernesto younger brother of the Duke of Bavaria who resolves a conflict, born between his brother and the Duke of Saxony, winning in a tournament with the Lancia; The most fascinating, referring to Flaminio Rossi, to Guglielmo Paradino and to Filippo Cirni, tells that an Ernesto of the Dukes of Bavaria and Duke of Pomerania, in a tournament wins a hundred German knights beating them all with the Lancia.

The principle and fundamental purpose of Islamic morality is love: love for God and love for God's creatures. The religious conception is that mankind will behave morally and treat each other in the best possible manner to please God.Leaman (2006), p. 416Moral System of Islam: The Standard of Morality. (2006). IslamReligion.com Retrieved 19 Aug 2016. Teachings on morality and moral conduct constitute a major part Islamic literature. The Quran and the Hadith ‚Äì the central religious texts of Islam ‚Äì serve as the primary source for these teachings.Clark (2011), p. 283 Both the Quran and the hadith often instruct Muslims to adopt a morally upright character. Showing kindness to people and charity to the poor and the helpless are the most emphasized moral virtues in the Quran.Leaman (2006), p. 415 In particular, helping people in their time of need, forgiving others' offenses, respecting parents and elders, fulfilling promises, being kind to people and to animals, being patient in adversity, maintaining justice, being honest, and controlling one's anger appear as major virtues in the Islamic concept of morality. Sources The Quran, which Muslims believe to be the verbatim word of God, serves as the primary source of moral teachings in Islam. The Sunnah, which is the teachings, deeds and sayings, silent permissions (or disapprovals) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, as well as various reports about Muhammad's companions, also serves as an important source for Islamic moral teachings. Besides these, the works of Islamic scholars and philosophers, and the moral examples set by important Islamic personalities (such as the four rightly guided caliphs) are other sources for Islamic ethical and moral guidance. General principle Islamic secondary sources and later Islamic scholarly works have made detailed discussions and laid down detailed instructions on moral issues. However, some general principles can be found in case of following morality. One typical Islamic teaching on morality is that imposing a penalty on an offender in proportion to their offense is permissible and just; but forgiving the offender is better. To go one step further by offering a favor to the offender is regarded the highest excellence.Nigosian (2004), p.116 Another principle is that whatever is good and beneficial for mankind is morally good, and vice versa. According to Islamic sharia, a Muslim is expected to act only in good mannersLeaman (2006), p.252 as bad manners earn vices. Muhammad is reported as saying \\"It is not possible that you indulge in rebuking and reviling and remain righteous at the same time\\".Al-Ghazali, chp. 14. Significance Much emphasis has been attached in Islamic tradition on developing strong moral values. Faith is considered incomplete without having sense of morality.Al-Ghazali, chp. 2. In Islamic sharia, a worshiper devoid of morality is seen as someone who has failed to realize the true significance of worshiping. In other words, the prayers which can not keep a person away from wrongdoings are seen worthless.Maariful Quran. Chapter 29, verse 45. Muhammad is reported as saying that a real poor person is he who will appear on the Day of Judgment with a lot of rewards earned by his prayers, fasting, zakat; but in his life he had also abused someone, had falsely accused someone, had illegally taken another's property, had murdered somebody; so all his virtues will be distributed to the victims, and he will be thrown to hell (). Islamic tradition holds that moral qualities and good actions elevate the status of a man. Since the pursuance of moral qualities are more of a voluntary nature, their observance falls into the category of supererogatory worshipping, and is seen as the key to attaining the nearness of God.Leaman (2006), p. 139-143 Islamic prophet Muhammad said, \\"The best among you are those who have the best manners and character\\" (). Emphasis on good character Character primarily refers to the assemblage of qualities that distinguish one individual from another. Character can be good or bad. A good character is the one that has good moral qualities. There was a debate among the early Islamic moralists as to whether character could be changed. They recognized the dual aspect of character ‚Äì innate and acquired ‚Äì and thus noted that with conscious practice it could be changed to a certain degree. As a religion, Islam promotes the idea of good character as is evident from its canonical texts. The Quran describes Muhammad as being 'on exalted quality of character' () and refers to him as 'an excellent example' () which ultimately means that the religious and moral examples, set by Muhammad, are to be followed and cultivated by the Muslims in order to construct a morally good character. Muslim moralists have discussed the ethico-religious importance of having a good character as well as the ways of acquiring it. Imam Birgivi, a 16th-century Muslim scholar and moralist, says that 'To cure yourself of a bad feature of character is an obligation'.Birgivi (2005), p.110 Continuous practice of moral virtues and a conscious effort to internalize those qualities can lead to the formation of a morally good character.Birgivi (2005), p.108 Al-Isfahani says that purification of soul means the control, not the elimination, of desires. According to Birgivi, changing of character depends on such things as 'a person's wish' and 'the strength of one's understanding', and the preservation of a good character requires the avoidance of the company of evil-charactered people who indulge into indecent activities, drunkenness, and meaningless gossip.Birgivi (2005), p.111 There are numerous sayings of Muhammad that highlight the importance of good character. Some of them are: * Anas ibn Malik reported that the Prophet said: The one with good morals and character already owns the best of this world and the Hereafter (Tabarani and Abu Dawud). * Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: I have been sent for the perfection of character (Imam Ahmad and Bayhaqi). * Anas ibn Malik reported that the Messenger of Allah said: A person reaches the best and most honored levels in the Hereafter as a result of good character.... And bad character condemns a person to the lowest depths of Hell (Tabarani). * One can repent for any sin but bad character ‚Äì because with bad character, before a person can attempt to ask forgiveness for one sin, he commits a worse (Tabarani, Isfahani). Major virtues =Charity and philanthropy = Numerous holy verses of the Quran and the sayings of Mohammad Ô∑∫ tell the Muslims to be generous with their wealth and to respond to the calls of the mankind's needs. Muslims believe that spending wealth for others, especially for the needy, and helping people are a fundamental duty for them,Stefon (2010), p. 92 and these things earn God's mercy and reward in the afterlife. Similarly, caring for one's kinsmen and neighbors has also been emphasized. The Quran says that the righteous are those people who fulfill their promises, and feed the needy, the orphans and the captive for the love of AllahÔ∑ª (). At another place, it says \\"Those who (in charity) spend their goods by night and by day, in secret and in public have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve\\" (). In a long hadith collected in Sahih Muslim, Jarir (R.A) narrates that once they were with Muhammad Ô∑∫ when some poor people came. They were ill- clad with torn dresses and were starving. When Muhammad Ô∑∫ saw them, the color of His Ô∑∫ Holy face changed. He Ô∑∫ asked Bilal (R.A) to assemble the people and then delivered a speech, and said \\"Everyone should give in charity dinar, dirham, cloth, dates, wheat, etc.\\" He Ô∑∫ went on till He Ô∑∫ urged: \\"Give, even if it is a stone of a date.\\" After this, a man from Ansar brought a bag so full of materials that it was slipping from his hand. Other people also brought things to be given in charity till there were two big heaps of eatable goods and clothes. At that, the face of Mohammad Ô∑∫ glowed with joy.Al-Ghazali, chp. 15. Miserliness is discouraged in Islam,Nigosian (2004), p.117 and the hoarding of wealth which is not used to redress the miseries of the needy and the poor is seen to be a cause of punishment in the afterlife. Helping people in time of their needs is seen more important than praying in the mosque.Hashmi (2009), p. 68-9 =Forgiveness= As a virtue, forgiveness is much celebrated in Islam, and is regarded as an important Muslim practice, inspired by both the Quran and the Sunnah. The issue of forgiveness can take on two different forms: God's forgiveness for human beings for their sins, and forgiveness among fellow human beings for each other. In the first instance, human beings have been asked to seek God's forgiveness for their sins, and they have been promised God's mercy and forgiveness. In the second instance, human beings have been encouraged to practice the act of forgiveness among themselves.Leaman (2006), p. 213-16 To forgive a person who has done moral offense, and not to be cruel to him is seen as a noble virtue.Maariful Quran. Chapter 7, verse 199. In Islamic theology, the act of forgiveness is not meant to deny or underplay the moral injury suffered by the victim; rather it involves a positive change in mentality toward the offender. Thus, an act of forgiveness means rising above one's self-interest or narrow-mindedness, and achieving nobler quality of heart. Those who practice the act of forgiveness have been promised reward by God.Mohammad Hassan Khalil. (2012). Islam and the Fate of Others: The Salvation Question. Oxford University Press. pp 65-94. In a frequently quoted hadith, Muhammad is reported as saying: 'the best deeds before God are to pardon a person who has wronged you, to show affection for relatives who have broken ties with you, and to act generously towards a person who has deprived you.' =Tolerance= In Islamic context, to be tolerant of one another comes both as a teaching and an injunction which is to be cultivated at personal, social, and religious levels. After its introduction in 610 CE, Islam sought to moderate the violent attitudes, prevalent among the people of pre-Islamic Arabia, with the practice of tolerance and other virtues.Al-Ghazali, chp. 14.Leaman (2006), p.414-5 Islam expects people to practice tolerance in their family and social life. It is the teaching of Islam that when faced with ill-treatment by any unwise person, a sensible person should be less reactive and more tolerant. The misbehavior of others should not provoke him to do the same. During the initial years of Islam, Muslims faced persecutions by the Meccan pagans.Buhl, F.; Welch, A. T. (1993). \\"Mu·∏•ammad\\". Encyclopaedia of Islam 7. pp. 360‚Äì376. During this period, Muhammad was once asked by his companions to invoke God's wrath on the persecutors. Muhammad became displeased with such a request and advised them to be more tolerant.Khan (1980), p. 40 Once a Bedouin became discontented and expressed his dissatisfaction even after receiving gifts from Muhammad. Muhammad understood his nature, showed tolerance to him, and satisfied him with more gifts, thus paving the way for the Bedouin to take lesson from this. In the History of Islam, Abdullah ibn Ubayy was known as the \\"leader of the hypocrites\\".William Montgomery Watt, \\"Abdullah b. Ubayy\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam The activities of the hypocrites were condemned by several verses in the Quran. After Ubayy's death, at his son's request, Muhammad offered his own shirt as Ubayy's shroud.Maariful Quran. Vol 4, p. 438. (Sura 9, verse 84.) At his son's second request, Muhammad even led his funeral prayer. When Umar objected about this, Muhammad said: \\"If I knew that Allah will pardon Ubayy if I pray for his forgiveness more than seventy times, I would even do that.\\"Maariful Quran. Vol 4, p. 441. (Sura 9, verse 84.) On social and state levels, the importance of tolerance comes from the fact that it is related to such greater issues as peace and justice which are said to be the desired goal of Islam.Leaman (2006), p. 655-57 Given that diversity is a natural phenomenon in this world, the Quran puts much emphasis on the observance of tolerance in order to maintain peace and security. In , the Quran recognizes the diversity among people: 'O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you.' By mentioning the common origin of mankind, the Quran reminds them of their relating to each other, and urges them to 'rise above' the racial and national divisions. In a nutshell, it is the teaching of Islam that the diversity or difference in social, cultural, political,financial or religious spheres are to be accepted by members of communities to secure a peaceful co-existence. About religious tolerance, the Quran says: 'Let there be no compulsion in religion' (). No forceful conversion is recognized in Islam. According to Islamic jurists, forced conversion is not possible in Islam because faith basically relates to heart, and not so much to external affairs.Maariful Quran. Chapter 2, verse 256. =Honesty= In Islam, honesty implies maintaining sincerity and truthfulness in all actions, interactions, and transactions, and the issue of honesty touches almost all aspects of human life. Here, honesty serves as an umbrella term having some basic components like speaking truth; fulfilling commitments, whether written or verbal; remaining truthful to one's word; rendering the assigned duty sincerely and as meticulously as possible; imparting everyone's due rights without the person's asking for it; being objective in evaluating any case and giving judgments; avoiding falsehood, deception, and favoritism.Alkhuli (2006), p. 12-3 Selection and promotion of personnel in an organization based on merit and not on favoritism is also a part of honesty. As Islam is a God-centered religion, honesty demands that it be maintained not only in public but also in private, not only when supervised but also when not supervised. Honesty has particularly been emphasized in business transactions, not only in selling and buying but in issues like pricing and advertising policies. Correct measurement is to be maintained. Again, Muhammad has instructed that the sellers should put the commodities of poorer quality in clear display so that the customers are not deceived.Clark (2011), p.297 Hiking the price to gain more profit or lowering the price to put the competitors at trouble are considered unethical.Ali (2015), p. 169 Similarly, exaggerated claims and suppression of unfavorable information in advertising are discouraged.Ali (2015), p. 169-170 Honesty is regarded by Muslim scholars as one of the five essential qualities for any Muslim accountants.Ali (2015), p. 264 =Kindness and leniency= The Quran and the hadith describe God as being kind and merciful to His creatures, and tell people to be kind likewise. Among the 99 Names of God in Islam, the most common and famous are \\"the Compassionate\\" (al-ra·∏•mƒÅn) and \\"the Merciful\\" (al- ra·∏•ƒ´m).Bentley, David (1999). The 99 Beautiful Names for God for All the People of the Book. William Carey Library. . The Quran says, \\"Verily, Allah is kind and merciful to the people\\" (). Numerous sayings of Muhammad tell the Muslims to be kind and merciful to the creatures of God. In Sahih Bukhari, it is said \\"He who is not merciful to others, will not be treated mercifully (by God)\\" (). Narrated in Sahih Muslim, Muhammad said, \\"Verily, Allah is mild and is fond of mildness, and He gives to the mild what He does not give to the harsh\\" (). He also said, \\"He who is deprived of kindness is in fact deprived of goodness (). Muhammad has been described as being kind and compassionate to people and animals. Biographies of Muhammad record incidences showing his kindness and leniency to others. Once, a man came to him and said that he had committed a certain sin. As reparation for his sin, Muhammad asked the man if he could free a slave upon which the man expressed his inability. Muhammad asked him if he could fast for two months upon which the man replied in the negative. Muhammad asked him again if he could feed sixty poor men upon which the man replied that he was even unable to do that. In the meantime, a bag of dates was brought there as gift for Muhammad. Muhammad gave the bag of dates to the man and told him to distribute the dates among the poor as reparation. The man passionately said \\"who is poorer than me in Medina?\\" Hearing this, Muhammad smiled and told the man to distribute the dates among his own family members.Shibli Nomani, vol 2 =Kind treatment to animals= Islam has prescribed kind treatment not only to humans but also to animals.D'Silva (2012), p. 129 Prophet Muhammad was probably the first in history to talk about the rights and proper treatment of animals.Imam Kamil Mufti (2006). Humane Treatment of Animals. IslamReligion.com Retrieved 19 Aug 2016. Kind and humane treatment earn virtue, and can even be a means of salvation. Similarly, cruelty towards animals can lead to punishment by God.D'Silva (2012), p. 130 Islamic tradition narrates the story of a man who got salvation for showing mercy to a thirsty dog.D'Silva (2012), p. 130 On one occasion, the man saw a dog which was about to die because of extreme thirst. He realized its plight, went down into a well, brought some water for the dog, and saved its life. God became pleased with him and pardoned all his previous sins (). It also narrates the story of a woman who locked up a cat. She neither fed the cat nor set it free to feed for itself. For her cruelty, she was punished by God. The early rulers in Islamic world used to instruct people in behaving properly to the animals.D'Silva (2012), p. 132 For proper treatment of animals, Islam has specified some guidelines: * All pet and farm animals have the rights of proper food and shelter. The owner has the obligation to arrange for food and shelter for his animals. * Animals which are used to carry goods should not be over-loaded.D'Silva (2012), p. 131 * Animals must not be tortured, beaten, or hurt unnecessarily. They are not to be killed for recreation. Also, the body parts of any live animal must not be mutilated. * Islam has prohibited the old custom of setting live animals or birds as targets for shooting practices. * Prophet Muhammad has forbidden separating the birds from their off-springs. * Animal slaughtering process should be such which is the least painful to the animal. Slaughtering of one animal in front of another is prohibited in Islam. =Justice= The Quran uses the words adl, qist, qast, wasat, and mizan in referring to justice, with the word adl being mostly used and literally meaning to straighten, to balance, to depart from wrong, or to be equal.Khadduri (1984), p. 6 Its meaning is thus \\"a combination of moral and social values denoting fairness, balance, temperance and straightforwardness.\\"Khadduri (1984), p. 8 In Islam, justice is not only a moral virtue but also an obligation to be fulfilled under all circumstances. The Quran at its two hundred places warns people against injustice, and at its one hundred places directs people to establishing justice.Khadduri (1984), p. 10 The Quran served for the early Muslims, as it serves for the present Muslims, as the primary source for the notion of justice. As his capacity as a prophet, the Quranic notion of justice was explained and translated into practice by Muhammad in dealing with various social issues, thus setting moral and legal examples and standards of justice in society and paving ways for the later Muslim theologians and scholars to \\"formulate theories of justice\\". The obligation to establish justice comes as a fundamental principle in the Quran, second in importance only to the oneness of God. The Quranic injunction of fairness and fair dealing is equally applicable to all people, irrespective of caste, creed, and color.Justice in Islam. 2006. IslamReligion.com Retrieved 19 Aug 2016. According to the scholars of the Quran, rendering justice to people is a trust from God entrusted on mankind, and this should be fulfilled with a sense of responsibility, not just as a formality. =Fulfillment of promise= In Islamic sharia, fulfilling a contract is regarded as compulsory,Maariful Quran. Chapter 17, verse 34. and is one of the three qualities necessary for becoming a true Muslim,Maariful Quran. Chapter 2, verse 177. as the famous hadith says \\"Three are the signs of a hypocrite, even if he observed fast and prayed and asserted that he was a Muslim: when he spoke he told a lie, when he made promise he acted treacherously, and when he was trusted he betrayed\\" (). Both the Quran and the hadith have attached importance to respect a contract once it has been made, and whether the other party is a Muslim or non- Muslim.Al-Ghazali, chp. 9. Apart from the ordinary verbal promises, fulfillment of business contracts and repayment of loans come as a special instruction for the Muslims. Business contracts and words are not to be breached in pursuance of more profits. Similarly, admonition has been issued against the non-payment of loans as it is said to ruin the afterlife of a believer. In Islamic tradition, fulfillment of promises has some other dimensions. Islamic belief holds that before creating humans in this world, God assembled their souls and asked them if He was not their Lord upon which they replied in the affirmative. Thus, accepting Allah as true God and following His commands in all sphere of life is regarded as the greatest fulfillment of that covenant.Maariful Quran. Chapter 7, verse 172. Again, in case of Muslim marriage, full payment of Mahr ‚Äì the amount of money which a bridegroom needs to pay to the bride at the time of their marriage ‚Äì has been emphasized. Non-payment, partial payment, or manipulation of mahr (jointure) is seen as the disruption of marriage contract. A hadith in Tibrani says \\"If a man has married a woman and in his heart he has the intention of not paying that mahr, then he has deceived her. If he dies and he has not paid her right, then on the Day of Judgment he will be presented before Allah as a rapist. And a man who has borrowed money from another man while he did not have the intention of re-paying the debt, then he has deceived him, and consequently he defrauded him. If he dies in this condition, without paying back his debt, then he will meet Allah as a thief.\\" =Modesty and humility= \\"Every religion has its characteristic, and the characteristic of Islam is modesty (Haya).\\" This saying of Muhammad, collected in al-Muwatta, shows the unique position modesty holds in Islam. Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of decency and modesty. Here, modesty is seen no less important in speech and behavior than in dressing. Again, modesty has a dual aspect in Islam: modesty is to be maintained in public which is generally related to people, as well as in private which is related to God.Imam Kamil Mufti (2006). Modesty: An Overview. IslamReligion.com Retrieved 19 Aug 2016. Islam expects that a Muslim who believes in God will feel shy in front of God, and this shyness will prevent him from disobeying God, from committing any sinful or immodest act, whether in public or private, because he has awareness of God. Muhammad has said, \\"Modesty is part of faith\\" (). Thus Islam has linked modesty with faith. Islam also expects that a Muslim will be polite in his behavior with others. Display of anger, indecent behavior, or indecent exposure of body parts are highly discouraged. Modesty is seen as a human trait that distinguishes human beings from other animals.Turner, Bryan S. (2008). The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory. p. 5. SAGE. Muhammad has been described as being more bashful than a maiden. Modesty in dressing has particularly been emphasized. According to Islamic Law, known as sharia, Muslims are required to cover their body parts with proper dressing.Long (2011), p.93 Sharia has also laid down specific guidelines for men and women regarding their dressing. Covering everything from 'navel to knee' is mandatory for men. In some Muslim societies, women wear the niqab, a veil that covers the whole face except the eyes, or the full burqa, a full-body covering garment that occasionally does cover the eyes. Following is the most frequently cited verse of the Quran regarding modesty: \\"Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. God is Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their chests, and not to reveal their adornment\\" (). Humility is defined as being modest and respectful. The prophetic narrations and Muhammad's own examples of simplicity and humbleness inspire the Muslims to practice humility in their life. According to tradition, Muhammad was rare to engage in argument with others. He was rare to laugh in a loud voice; rather, he preferred soft smiling. During the conquest of Mecca, when Muhammad was entering into the city riding on a camel, his head lowered, in gratitude to God, to the extent that it almost touched the back of the camel.Khan (1980), p. 234 =Decent speech= Islam has instructed its followers to maintain decency in speech, and misuse of tongue has been admonished. Excessive or absurd talking, or useless gossiping are generally discouraged.Al-Ghazali, chp. 11. The person who talks too much is seen as having greater chances of making mistakes. Speech that hurts others' feelings or insults people are prohibited. Similarly, calling someone by any name that harms the honor of the person is prohibited. Decent and gentle speech has been encouraged as it is seen both as a virtue and as a means of cultivating goodness among people. Muhammad has preferred maintaining silence than engaging in meaningless talks. Polemics in speech or heated arguments with ignorant people are disapproved of in Islam. In The Quran and the hadith, there are many instructions regarding the decent use of tongue. Some of them are: * \\"The faith of a man cannot be straight unless his heart is straight, and his heart cannot be straight unless his tongue becomes straight.\\" (Musnad Ahmad) * \\"The faltering of the feet cause much less harm than the faltering of the tongue.\\" (Baihaqui) * Muhammad Ali once advised Abu Zar in this way: \\"Adopt silence. This is a way of causing Satan to run away, it is a support to you in the matter of your religion.\\" (Musnad Ahmad) * \\"Before Allah the most hated are the quarrelsome person\\" (). * ‚ÄúSuccessful indeed are the believers who are humble in their prayers, and who shun vain conversation, and who are active in deeds of charity.\\" (Quran ) * \\"Say to My servants that they should say those things that are best. Verily, Satan sows discord among them. Verily, the Satan is for man an open enemy.\\" (Quran ) * ‚ÄúA kind word with forgiveness is better than charity followed by injury. Allah is Free of All Wants and Most Forbearing.\\" (Quran ) * \\"And argue not with the People of the Book unless it be in a better manner than that.\\" (Quran ) =Trustworthiness= Trustworthiness, which is connected to fulfilling assigned responsibilities properly, has a wide field of application in Islam and conveys a wide range of meaning.Maariful Quran. Chapter 4, verse 58. Islam has made every person responsible for returning the trust to their due recipients; and this command applies to both the common people and the ruling men. Misappropriation or breach of trust has been condemned severely. Anas ibn Malik narrates that there was hardly any occasion where Muhammad had delivered a speech but he had not said this \\"The person who lacks trustworthiness also lacks faith. And the person who does not keep promises has no religion.\\" Muhammad has said, \\"Every one of you is a guardian and everyone will be asked about his subjects. Imam is a guardian. He will be asked about his subjects. A man is the guardian of the persons in his household. He is answerable about them. A woman is the guardian of her husband's house. She will be asked about her responsibility. The servant is the guardian of the articles of his master. He is answerable about this responsibility of his\\" (). Performing one's duty sincerely and honestly is a trust. It means that a person will have the intention to properly carry out the duties entrusted to him, and will do it in the best possible manner without indulging in corruption.Al-Ghazali, chp. 8. Receiving undue advantages from office is seen as corruption. The rulers of the state or the government officials who do not care for the welfare of their citizens and thus cause sufferings to them are seen as the worst deceiver and have been warned with the direst consequences in afterlife. Adi bin Umaira narrates that he has heard the Prophet as saying: \\"Whomsoever we have given some post and he has concealed a needle or a thing smaller than that, then it will be a misappropriated thing with which he will have to appear on the Day of Judgment\\" (). Similarly, trust demands that posts be offered to able and deserving persons: persons who will be able to keep the trust of organizations. To deny the public posts to those whose deserve them most, or to make appointments at public posts through nepotism is seen as misappropriation against God, His messenger, and the people. Those who make such unfair appointments have been warned that their prayers would not be accepted, and hell would be their destination. Sahih Bukhari narrates that a man asked Muhammad when the Doomsday would occur. Muhammad replied \\"When deposits in trust would start being lost, then wait for the Doomsday.\\" He was asked again, \\"What is the meaning of loss of trusts?\\" He replied: \\"When responsibilities are entrusted to unfit persons, then wait for the Doomsday\\" (). According to Islamic theology, the wealth and abilities given to a man is a trust from God which means that they should be used in ways recommended by God, and these should not be abused for illegal activities. Protecting the confidential information of the meetings and the secret information of others is also a trust provided that these are not related to illegal activities. Disclosing family secrets, especially that of the wife, is seen as the worst type of misappropriation. It is narrated in Sahih Muslim that \\"On the Day of Judgment before Allah, the greatest act of misappropriation will be that a man may love his wife and the wife may also be inclined towards her husband and then he may disclose his wife's secrets to others.\\" After Muhammad started his preaching in 610 CE, his relationship with his own tribesmen, the Quraysh people, deteriorated gradually. Despite this, the Quraysh people of Mecca used to deposit their valuable things at Muhammad because of his honesty and trustworthiness.Shibli Nomani, vol 1 When Muhammad was compelled to leave Mecca because of Quraysh opposition, he directed his cousin Ali to return those deposits at their due recipients after his leave. =Patience= The issue of patience is of special interest in Islam. Islamic tradition holds that God has made this world a testing ground for mankind, especially for the believers, and that the sincerity and strength of their faith will be judged through various trials.Al-Ghazali, chp. 16. Patience is one of the moral qualities which Islamic sharia considers necessary for a Muslim in order to keep away from evildoings, and in a broader sense, to protect his faith. This is because Islamic holy scriptures say that believers will be tested with various adversaries in their life, and only those who can prove their faith and can remain grateful to God despite those adversaries will earn His blessings.Maariful Quran. Chapter 2, verse 155.Maariful Quran. Chapter 29, verse 2-3.Leaman (2006), p. 554 In Islamic theology, the solution to any crisis in a Muslim's life lies in two things: prayer and patience (Quran ), and Muslims have been asked to seek God's help through these two things.Maariful Quran. Chapter 2, verse 153. =Truthfulness= Truthfulness has been much emphasized in Islam, not only as a virtue, but also as a religious obligation; and falsehood has been admonished severely. Islam demands that its followers lead their life on the basis of truthfulness and fair dealing. Falsehood and dishonesty must be avoided because they mark departure from religion.Al-Ghazali, chp. 7. Telling lie is one of the major sins in Islam.Imam Birgivi, p. 236 Muhammad was asked whether a Muslim could be a coward. He answered: 'Yes.' He was asked whether a Muslim could be a miser. He answered: 'Yes.' He was again asked: 'Can a Muslim be a liar?' He replied: 'No.' Falsehood is seen as something which is against the general characteristics of human nature: it corrupts the human soul and paves the way for many other evil activities. According to the Quran, truthfulness was a characteristic virtue of the prophets (Quran ; ; ; ; ). Islam has some other considerations regarding truthfulness: * The virtue of truthfulness is to be maintained even in matters which are not serious in nature. Telling lies in jokes, or inventing false stories to amuse people are highly discouraged. * Telling lies to even children is prohibited. Prophetic tradition narrates that \\"Anybody who called a child saying that he would give him a certain thing, and did not give it, then it is a lie\\" (Ahmed). Children should be accustomed to truthfulness from their childhood so that they can grow up with this virtue. * Inventing falsehood and false story about God and His messengers, or inventing any false element in religion is seen as a grave sin.Imam Birgivi, p. 238 * Exaggeration in praising someone is prohibited. Exaggerated praising of any powerful of rich person in order to get illegal advantage falls into this category. Praise should be made to the extent a person knows about someone. Abu Hurairah narrates that \\"the Prophet has commanded us that we should throw dust in the face of those who indulge in exaggeration in their praises\\" (Tirmizi). * Giving false evidence against someone is seen as the worst type of falsehood, and is considered a major sin in Islam. A person is required to maintain truth in giving evidence even if that goes against their own interest. * Bringing false charge of adultery against any woman is a punishable act in Islamic law which orders to flog the accuser eighty lashes.Maariful Quran. Chapter 24, verse 4. =Anger management= Anger management comes as an important issue in Islamic tradition as anger is seen to destroy human conscience and to become the cause of many evil and violent activities. Anger is considered one of the characteristic features of pre- Islamic period ‚Äì a period known as age of ignorance. A hadith in Tirmizi says, \\"Adam's sons have been created of different types. ‚Ä¶ the best people among these are those who get angry late and immediately repent.\\" In a famous hadith Narrated Abu Huraira, Muhammad said \\"The strong is not the one who overcomes the people by his strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself while in anger\\" (). Controlling anger is seen as a virtue and a sign of righteous person.Aisha Stacey (2012). Anger management in Islam: Controlling anger is a sign of righteousness. IslamReligion.com Retrieved 19 Aug 2016. Muhammad is reported as suggesting several methods to assuage anger for a man when he gets angry: to sit down if he is standing, and/or to lie down if he is sitting; to perform ablution (Islamic way of washing hands and face); to seek refuge from God against the influence of Satan.Aisha Stacey (2012). Anger management in Islam: Islam offers several methods to overcome anger and rage. IslamReligion.com =Sincerity= In Islam, sincerity of intention determines the significance of any act, that is to say, the value of any act depends on the motivation behind the act, not on the act itself.Al-Ghazali, chp. 10. Good intention is said to earn reward and God's pleasure while bad intention God's displeasure. In Islamic theology, this applies not only to general act but also to prayers and worshiping. Thus, any act of worshiping which is done to attain worldly fame, or any act of charity which is given to impress people, is considered invalid and is regarded as a sinful act by Islamic jurisprudence. Only those acts of prayer or charity which are done to seek God's pleasure or to benefit people are granted by God.Maariful Quran. Chapter 22, verse 37. In Islam, sincerity of intention has some other significances: a) if a person sincerely intends to do any good deed and then becomes unable to materialize it into action due to any reason, he is still said to get reward for it; b) an act of worshiping done to gain worldly fame and not to seek God's pleasure is regarded as lesser shirk; c) the reward for a righteous act increases from ten to thousand times depending on the sincerity of the doer's intention. =Respecting the elders= The family and the social tradition in Islamic world has long fostered the idea of respecting the elders of family and society.Rassool (2014), p. 64Haddad, Yvonne Yazbeck. Muslim Women in America: The Challenge of Islamic Identity Today Elders are generally honored by the young members as part of both Islamic culture and religious duty. It is one of the important Islamic good manners found in Islamic world. Examples of respecting elders include, among others, not walking ahead of the elders, allowing them to talk first in meetings, avoiding argument with them, and not raising voice before them.Rassool (2014), p. 65 Prophetic tradition narrates that 'he who does not love the younger and does not respect the elders is not one of us' (Sunan al-Tirmidhi). Anas ibn Malik narrates that Muhammad said, 'If a young man honors an elderly on account of his age, Allah appoints someone to honor him in his old age' (Sunan al-Tirmidhi). Islamic traditions generally do not separate the older into old homes, rather accommodate them into their own houses. They are also respected as the guardian of the house. Among the elderly members of a family, the parents occupy a special position in case of receiving veneration by their children. With regard to the rights of parents, the Quranic injunction is to behave well with them, to take care of them especially in their old age, not to be rude to them, and to show highest respect to them.Maariful Quran.

The latter would be functionally indistinguishable, at both user- and system-level, from a conventional UNIX system. It became a forerunner of Sun Microsystems' Network File System (NFS). The name derives from the research group at Newcastle University, under Brian Randell, which developed it. The term \\"UNIX United\\" describes the scheme of combining the overall filesystems of the participating UNIX machines; \\"Newcastle Connection\\" describes the undelying communication layer which enables this. A UNIX United system constructed with the Newcastle Connection is functionally indistinguishable from a centralised UNIX system at the system-call level. In essence, the concept of the \\"parent directory\\" was re- interpreted at the root of the filesystem, where it originally had no significant meaning, to mean \\"this directory is on a remote machine\\", similar to subsequent \\"Super-root (Unix)\\" usage. UNIX United As a reminder, a typical single UNIX directory tree might resemble: * / ** home *** brian (current directory '.') **** a **** b UNIX United acts as an extra level the \`/\` root. If the example machine is named \\"unix1\\", an overall UNIX United scheme with an additional second machine, \\"unix2\\", would look like: * /.. ** unix1 *** home **** brian (the current directory '.') ***** a ***** b ** unix2 *** home **** brian ***** b ***** c If we wish to copy file \`a\` from \\"unix1\\" to \\"unix2\\" to sit alongside files \`b\` and \`c\`, example equivalent commands might be: * \`cp /home/brian/a /../unix2/home/brian/a\` * \`cp a /../unix2/home/brian/a\` * \`( cd /../unix2/home/brian ; cp /../unix1/home/brian/a a )\` Internals It required no changes to the UNIX kernel. Rather, it ran in user-space, using a modified version of the C standard library of its day which was capable of recognising these new semantics. To a first approximation this was to recognise pathnames beginning with \`\\"/..\\"\`. A match would divert such a reference through to the new software, which then used remote procedure calls to the remote machine. All other pathnames would simply go through to the local kernel as usual. (If the current working directory was itself remote, this needed to be taken into account.) It did, however, require that all software intended to use it, including shells, the \\"cp\\" command, etc. needed to be re-linked with this new library. Continuing one of the previous examples, the \\"cp\\" command attempts, as expected, to open the two files: * \`open(\\"a\\", ...)\` * \`open(\\"/../unix2/home/brian/a\\", ...)\` Assuming the command has been relinked with the revised C-library, the first \`open()\` happens as normal on the local system. The second, however, is diverted into the \\"Newcastle Connection\\" software because of the filename's leading \\"\`/..\`\\". Portability The original implementation at Newcastle was for UNIX V7 on a set of PDP-11 computers connected by a Cambridge Ring network. Subsequent implementations added support for other versions of UNIX (including BSD 4.2 and System V), network technologies, protocols and hardware architecture (VAX, Motorola 68000).

Corbally led Syracuse University from 1969‚Äì71 before becoming president of the University of Illinois system from 1971 to 1979. He held roles in numerous non-profit organizations, including a decade as the first president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Early life Corbally was born in South Bend, Washington on October 14, 1924 to John E. Corbally Sr., a University of Washington education professor, and Grace (n√©e Williams) Corbally. During World War II, Corbally held the rank of lieutenant junior grade in the United States Navy. He saw battle in the Pacific Ocean theater and received a Purple Heart. After the war, Corbally returned to school, where he met his wife Marguerite Walker; they married in 1946. In 1947, with a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington, he took a job as a high school chemistry teacher in Tacoma. He pursued further education at the University of Washington, graduating with a master's degree in 1950. He earned a doctorate in 1955 from the University of California, Berkeley and put his degree in educational administration and finance to work by taking an associate professor position at Ohio State University, where he would eventually become provost and vice president of academic affairs, positions held until he accepted the chancellor position at Syracuse University in 1969. University president =Syracuse University= Corbally replaced William Pearson Tolley as chancellor at Syracuse and reorganized the school's administration structure to match what he had experienced at Ohio, adding a provost and multiple vice president positions as opposed to the single vice chancellor position that the university had before. During his short time as chancellor, Corbally faced crises spurred on by civil unrest surrounding the Vietnam War and race relations. Tolley, his predecessor, was a proponent of military education on campus; this included the establishment of a Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program. By the time Tolley left office, the university faced major financial issues and there was uncertainty regarding the future of the ROTC program. Corbally advocated for keeping the program and its academic accreditation, an idea which was opposed by students hostile to a military presence on campus, some of whom participated in a sit-in of the ROTC building in February 1970. The matter was referred to the school senate, a democratic body composed of students, faculty, and administrators, which voted to keep the program open, a move which many students felt was forced by the chancellor. Later that same year, on May 4, the shooting of four students at Kent State protesting against the United States' invasion of Cambodia led directly to the student strike of 1970, a nationwide protest by students on college campuses against US involvement in Vietnam, including at Syracuse. Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow the students to protest without police or administration interference arguably resulted in more moderate protests than at other colleges. The peace was short lived, however, as in August 1970, eight black players on the Syracuse Orange football team did not show up for preseason practice, citing systemic racism in the program and discrimination by coach Ben Schwartzwalder. The move was a continuation of a boycott of spring practice by the players, and they were automatically suspended as a result. A university report released in December of that year declared that there was a chronic problem of racism in the Syracuse athletics programs, though in some cases the discrimination was unintentional. In response, Corbally reinstated the players and approved the creation of the Athletic Policy Board to oversee athletics at the school. The board would include input from students and ensure that all students, regardless of race, were entitled to fair treatment. =University of Illinois= In early 1971, Corbally was offered the presidency of the University of Illinois system, which he readily accepted. The suddenness of his resignation at Syracuse led to speculation that he had been pressured to leave due to the tense events of 1970 or that he wanted to jump ship from a school still facing financial difficulties. However, John Robert Greene, in a 1998 book on the history of Syracuse, argues that none of that is true: Corbally handled the student protesters and football boycott admirably, despite criticism at the time from some alumni of the school, and he, along with his vice chancellor Ronald Brady, had improved the financial status of the school much in the two years since Corbally took office. According to Greene, the chancellor took the new job \\"simply because he received a better job offer\\". Corbally was succeeded by his provost Melvin Eggers. At Illinois, Corbally replaced David D. Henry, who stated he was stepping down in favor of a younger president with fresh ideas. Almost immediately, Corbally sought to raise capital to fund construction and programs at what was then the ninth-largest university system in the country, especially focusing on the Chicago campus and the school's veterinary medicine and agriculture programs. Corbally enlisted the help of alumni from these programs to raise money for two new buildings on the Urbana-Champaign campus. In 1976‚Äì1977, Corbally sought to preserve funding to University of Illinois at a time when Governor Dan Walker was seeking cuts to state university budgets. Continued funding was secured from the state legislature in 1977 by way of a campaign by current and former students of the school organized by Corbally.  MacArthur Foundation Corbally was elected to the board of directors of the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation in 1979. He later resigned his position at the University of Illinois to become the first president of the foundation, serving from 1979‚Äì89, after which he remained on the board of directors, and as chairman of the board from 1995 to 2002. He is credited with starting the MacArthur Fellows Program, as well as guiding the foundation through its legal troubles of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when J. Roderick MacArthur ‚Äì son of founder John D. MacArthur ‚Äì sued several board members over alleged mismanagement of foundation funds. Personal life Corbally was a Presbyterian and the first of that denomination to become chancellor of Syracuse, a historically Methodist university. After his time at the MacArthur Foundation, Corbally retired to his home state of Washington, where he served as a board member for various Seattle-area organizations, including the Rural Development Institute, now known as Landesa. He died on July 23, 2004 from brain cancer, aged 79, at his home in Mill Creek, Washington.

The collective sought to reorder Vermont (and beyond) according to libertarian-socialist principles governed by an empowered town meeting system of direct democracy. History Founded by David Van Deusen, Xavier Massot, Johnny Midnight, and Natasha Voline, this first generation of the collective came together shortly after the 1999 Seattle WTO protests and was greatly influenced by the Situationist International, Vermont's militant anti-colonial history, and libertarian-socialism. It is unclear how many people were associated with the group, but one report by Van Deusen describes a small cadre occupying a single home, and supporting themselves by a combination black marketeering, \\"occasional manual labor\\" and a student loan.http://news.infoshop.org/anarchist-news/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-green- mountain-anarchist-collective/ At its inception, GMAC strove to further a popular resistance to capitalism through the building of a more organized and more effective militant apparatus within the political left: for the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective this meant organizing, expanding, and making tactical adjustments to the Black Bloc. The collective took part in a number of Black Bloc actions including those in opposition to the proposed FTAA treaty (Quebec City, 2001), and against fascist organizing attempts in New England (Lewiston Maine, 2003). Individual members of GMAC, prior to the collective taking form, marched in numerous other Black Blocs. From these experiences GMAC observed that the lack of internal organization within the Bloc prevented it from reaching its potential as a vehicle for popular combat (and thus its potential as a vehicle for radicalizing class consciousness). Seeking to address these perceived short comings GMAC penned the pamphlet A Communique On Tactics, which was widely distributed and debated within the anarchist community. The pamphlet, among other things, advocated for the temporary election of tactical officers within the Bloc. These officers would be democratically empowered to make swift decisions on behalf of the whole when engaged in conflict with the state. While GMAC argued that this adaptation was necessary in order to increase mobility (the life blood of a minimally equipped street fighting force), other aspects of the anarchist community criticized these prescriptions as authoritarian in nature and therefore contradictory to the principles of anarchism. GMAC countered that their proposals were in line with those witnessed during the Spanish Civil War via the CNT and FAI. Of those groups that supported the basic tenets of GMAC's views were the Barricada Collective (Boston-MA), and Columbus Anti-Racist Action (Ohio). Aspects of GMAC's proposed tactical reforms were field tested with some success at the Festival De La Pueblo 5 May action in Boston in 2002, and the siege of the Lewiston Armory (in opposition to a failed neo-Nazi organizing meeting), Maine, 2003. While the collective was influential in better defining basic best practices concerning the Black Bloc tactic, and ultimately reached a receptive intercontinental audience of fellow travelers, a number of its recommendations continue to be met with some controversy in aspects of the anarchist community. GMAC published a book on the Black Bloc in 2002; The Black Bloc Papers: An Anthology of Primary Texts From The North American Anarchist Black Bloc. The Green Mountain Anarchist Collective did not limit its scope of activity to the Black Bloc. While GMAC sought to tear down capitalism (and combat fascism), it also sought to grow the movement towards libertarian-socialism. Here its focus was aimed within the confines of the Green Mountain region of northern New England. Often working with the Vermont Workers' Center, organized labor, and mass organizations, GMAC prioritized projects that built up directly democratic expression though the creation of grassroots counter-institutions. The major projects it was involved in include the Peoples Round Table Organizing Committee (a project led by the Vermont State Employees' Association), the Dairy Farmers of Vermont (founded in part by future State Senator Anthony Pollina of the Vermont Progressive Party), and the Montpelier Downtown Workers Union-UE Local 221 (a project of the Vermont Workers Center and the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America).Montpelier Downtown Workers Union: Building Working Class Democracy One City at a Time, By David Van Deusen, Northeastern Anarchist, 2005. As a kind of revolutionary road map charting the way to the Vermont it worked to realize, the collective produced the pamphlet Neither Washington Nor Stowe: Common Sense For The Working Vermonter in 2004. In addition to organizing, GMAC attempted to gain a wider audience among Vermont's working class and small farmers by producing a seasonal newspaper called Catamount Tavern News (named after the headquarters of the Green Mountain Boys). The paper, which was worker-owned (by the collective) and affiliated with the Teamsters Local 1L, was formed in 2002 and was printed regularly into 2009. It had a statewide distribution of 1500, with 50 distribution points across Vermont (note: Vermont's population was just over 600,000). The paper's bread and butter consisted of articles relating to working class Vermonters, small farmers, as well as providing analysis of local Native American struggles and other major social/political events unfolding in Vermont. Although not a primary focus, the paper also covered regional news (possessing a Quebec Affairs Desk), national news, and international news, through original content. In order to broaden the paper's appeal, Catamount Tavern News also reported on the Vermont Golden Gloves competition, had regular columns on hunting (written by Jacob \\"Black Jack\\" Banis), wild plant gathering, handy hints (for rural living), a crossword puzzle, occasional art & poetry, Vermont history and an obituary page. CT New's last article, published in 2009, was an obituary, written by Xavier Massot, for the newspaper itself.

The show was hosted by beauty queen Riitta V√§is√§nen during its first three runs and by Cristal Snow in its current iteration. Pasanen developed the programme specifically in order to promote V√§is√§nen. V√§is√§nen achieved five consequetive Telvis Awards, for Best Female Performer, for her appearances on the show between 1986 and 1990. The TV format was a panel-style program, where five Finnish celebrities appeared in sound-proof booths and try to guess a word based on a clue from one contestant. The clue giver and the correct guessers are awarded points. The awarded points-sum decreases the more correct guesses there are. If all or none of the contestants guess the word, the clue giver receives minus points. The points were supposedly converted to prize money in Finnish Marks and, after 2001, euros - with the highest prize for one guessed word being 1000 marks (later ‚Ç¨200). However, in actuality the contestants only received a standard performance fee, with the over-all winner's fee being larger. On the children's hospital representative round of the show, the contestants donated their prize money to charitable causes. Broadcast History Kymppitonni originally achieved fame on Kolmoskanava and later on MTV3 where it attained huge success (including a Venla Award for best \\"puheohjelma\\" = \\"talk show\\" in 1986). MTV3 planned to cancel the show soon after Spede Pasanen's death in 2001, but this was prevented by public outcry. The show was eventually cancelled in 2005, after a run of 1093 episodes. The programme was relaunched in 2009 on SuomiTV and cancelled again in 2011. The official reason given by SuomiTV was that they wanted to attract a younger audience. On SuomiTV, the programme peaked at 10'000 viewers, with an average 7000 viewers on reruns. Kymppitonni was featured on Radio Suomipop from 2012 onward, as a simultaneous radio show and internet video stream. The show was cancelled in 2016 after V√§is√§nen was let go from the network. Starting in 2018, the Finnish division of the FOX network began airing a new version hosted by Finnish drag queen Cristal Snow.

Though he was responsible for the construction of over 300 single family houses and 150 commercial construction projects, he is best known for the construction of the John F. Kennedy Memorial in Hyannis, Massachusetts. The memorial was commissioned by the citizens of Barnstable, Massachusetts and dedicated on July 8, 1966. Architect Donald Durell was responsible for the overall design and the Kennedy bust sculpture was created by Agop Agopoff. The inscription, \\"I believe it is important that this country sail and not lie still in the harbor\\" is part of JFK's Radio and Television Report to the American People on the State of the National Economy on August 13, 1962. Materials were sourced from across the Northeastern United States, primarily from Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The memorial uses the center of the pool as a focal point and was inspired by the eternal flame at the John F. Kennedy Memorial in Arlington, Virginia. Lanza and his wife of 54 years, Susanne, currently reside in Simsbury, Connecticut, where he has been active in the town building committee, historic district commission and design review board.

Demby also hosts an accompanying podcast by the same name. Founding Demby founded PostBourgie in 2007. He had begun blogging a few years earlier, prompted by frustration with the state of media conversations about race. Speaking to Colorlines in 2012, Demby recalled in particular an occasion when a CNN reporter approached him on a basketball court to ask for comment on Bill Cosby's Pound Cake speech at the 2004 NAACP Image Awards. Demby said, \\"I pushed back on him pretty hard...There are people who think black people's condition in the world would be better if we just looked better. 'Pull up your pants.' It seemed so petty that we were having these conversations.\\" In search of an alternative, Demby founded PostBougie as a group blog, inviting collaborators who shared his desire \\"to have conversations that assumed that black people were human beings who were complicated and imperfect, a space that wasn't super didactic.\\" Writing in The New Republic, Jamil Smith situates the origins of PostBourgie in a decade of outlets founded \\"[a]s the number of black journalists in newsrooms inched up in the 1990s, the number of formal race beats declined. Racial coverage began to migrate to media organizations and websites that covered it full time,\\" including Colorlines, Racialicious and This Week in Blackness in addition to PostBourgie. Smith: \\"These sites don‚Äôt bring in corporate dollars like Vox or FiveThirtyEight, but they have survived and even thrived by concentrating their coverage on issues affecting people of color, and by providing opportunities for writers to write on these subjects with a frankness rarely seen in mainstream publications.\\" Format and content The PostBourgie blog operates as a \\"volunteer effort.\\" PostBourgie has drawn notice for its commentary on topics including television, film, music and language, gentrification, hair politics, and race and violence. Speaking to New York Magazine, Jamil Smith cited PostBourgie as one of the blogs that \\"really set the bar for...spaces that were made available to [African-Americans and other people of color]. Even if you were working for traditional media, you didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to offer your perspective, to tell the unvarnished version of the truth that you see every day...it really hearkens back to the tradition of the black press.\\" In an interview with the Boston Review, novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie mentioned her admiration for the \\"irreverence and un-safe-ness\\" of PostBourgie's commentary. Influence and alumni In The Washington Post, Alyssa Rosenberg noted PostBourgie's accomplishments in \\"building a ladder for all its participants. The blog gave the people who wrote there a chance to workshop their voices and refine their ideas for a smart audience, even when they didn‚Äôt have paying assignments for an idea. When one PostBourgie writer got a new job, he or she encouraged others to freelance for that new outlet and to apply for fellowships and jobs there.\\" In The New Republic, Smith agreed that PostBourgie \\"served as a launching pad for celebrated black journalists.\\" Alums have included Shani O. Hilton, now executive editor of news for BuzzFeed, and BuzzFeed writers Joel Anderson and Tracy Clayton. Demby is now lead blogger for NPR's Code Switch project on race and culture, as well as co-host of the Code Switch podcast. Podcast Demby hosts an accompanying podcast, also called PostBourgie, that's been widely praised. Mashable named it to a list of \\"11 diverse podcasts to give you a fresh perspective on life,\\" saying \\"PostBourgie's topics run the gamut, but always include intelligent conversation between Demby and various media personalities he invites to chat.\\" Blavity named it one of \\"23 Black Podcasts You Should Add to Your Playlist,\\" and Buzzfeed to its list of \\"13 Awesome Podcasts Bringing Black Voices To The Mic,\\" saying \\"You should listen if: You‚Äôre looking for a gabfest that‚Äôs rooted in real- world reporting.

Lisa Lovatt-Smith, writer, editor, journalist and child activist, is the former Photo Editor of British Vogue, Fashion Director of Spanish Vogue and founder of OAfrica, a charity that supports vulnerable children. Resident in Accra, Ghana since 2002, she has brought her contacts in international fashion and culture to spread awareness about African excellence in journalism, fashion, wellness, design and music through her public speaking and digital presence, supporting global recognition of African talent. Early life Lovatt-Smith was born in Barcelona, Spain. Her parents are from a working class area in the north of England and moved to the Mediterranean coast. She was a child model, and a scholarship child who already knew she wanted to be a writer. After her parents divorced she lived between Rome, Paris and Barcelona as an adolescent, and as a result has been quatri-lingual from an early age. Professional life She won a writing competition for Vogue magazine at the age of 17 in 1984 and was awarded a job in London with the magazine. At age 19, she was made picture editor by Anna Wintour, becoming the youngest editor in the magazine's history and by the age of 21 she was fashion director of the newly launched Spanish Vogue, and the youngest person in Conde Nast to become a fashion director, a record she holds to this day. She was instrumental in opening what is now Spanish GQ, Spanish AD and German AD. During her time with Vogue Lovatt-Smith edited 13 books on fashion photography and design. She collaborated with Franca Sozzani at Italian Conde Nast from 1985 until Franca's death in 2016, including supporting Franca with \\"Fashion For Development\\" in Africa. In 2014 Lovatt-Smith's memoir \\"Who Knows Tomorrow\\" was published in the USA and UK.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Who-Knows-Tomorrow-Lisa- Lovatt- Smith/dp/1602862702/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1471598473&sr;=1-1&keywords;=who+knows+tomorrow There were later French, Spanish and Australian editions. Charity Work At the age of 23, Lisa fostered an orphan girl named Sabrina. In 2002, during a volunteering trip to Ghana with Sabrina, Lisa founded OAfrica, an organization focused on keeping kids out of orphanges and reuniting them with their families. OAfrica helps more than 5,000 children a year, providing healthcare, startup capital, resettlement packages and scholarships and they also find foster families for the few with no possible family placements. Since 2002, Lisa has been working in Ghana, campaigning against corrupt private orphanages, helping children separated from their families by poverty, the H.I.V. - AIDS epidemic or the exodus from rural to urban areas. Lisa gave two TED talks, in Abidjan and in Accra on this work. Since 2015, OAfrica is increasingly involved in advocacy, on and off-line, for positive behaviour change around child rights. In 2012 Lovatt-smith won the Clarins Woman of the Year Award in Paris, France and the Face Africa award in New York City. In 2014 Lovatt-Smith began implementing a strategy to have OAfrica entirely locally run, which culminated in the unusual move of voluntarily handing over her CEO position to local staff in 2017.

It is initially launched as Kawasaki Barako 175 but with the implementation of stricter regulation laws and an extremely competitive market, an enhanced version, the Kawasaki Barako II 175 was later launched. There are two variants available in the market in which differs on how the motorcycle is started: a standard Barako with only a kick start and a higher variant of Barako both equipped with a kick start and an electric starter.  Features  Since the launch of the Kawasaki Barako in the Philippine market, this motorcycle has been known to be more powerful even with heavier loads thanks to its 177 cc displacement. Its four stroke engine is best suited for utility and business use and as with later model, the Barako II, the engine was tweaked to produce up to 15% more power and to be up to 13% more fuel efficient than earlier Barako. It has the power and versatility for pulling and carrying heavy loads and it maintains fuel efficiency of up to 57 km per liter. Like the other utility motorcycles, the Barako series has a long seat was placed behind the fuel tank to accommodate extra passenger. The frame was also modified for its future use for sidecar operation. It is equipped with Kawasaki Automatic Compression Release KACR, which makes kick starting much easier. The Compression release reduces rider pressure, ensuring a smooth operation.

Born in Sheffield, Hobson completed an apprenticeship in metalworking, and worked until the 1890s with Britannia metal at Atkin Brothers. In 1866, he joined the Britannia Metal Workers' Union and, after a few years, became its delegate to Sheffield Trades Council.Helen Mathers, \\"Hobson, Charles (1845-1923)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.VII, pp.121-123 By the mid-1880s, Hobson was one of the more prominent trade unionists in Sheffield. He was the secretary of a committee investigating products falsely claiming to be made in Sheffield. In 1887, he was elected as secretary of the trades council, in which role he increased its membership, gaining affiliations from more engineering unions. In 1895, he enthusiastically led the council into the Industrial Union of Employers and Employed, although this did not get widespread support from trade unions, and soon collapsed. Hobson was a supporter of the Labour Electoral Association, and the Sheffield Labour Association, which supported working men as Liberal- Labour candidates. He was elected to Sheffield Town Council in 1887, representing St George's ward, and also to the Sheffield School Board in 1893, and the Board of Guardians in 1894. He was proposed as a candidate for the 1894 Sheffield Attercliffe by-election, although this was opposed by much of the Liberal Party, who did not want a worker as a candidate. This experience increased support for the new Independent Labour Party (ILP), with which Hobson had some sympathy, although he never joined, instead retaining membership of the Liberal group on the council. Hobson also attended the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and he was elected to serve on its Parliamentary Committee in 1900 and 1901. During the 1890s, Hobson became wealthier, setting up first a greengrocers' shop, then a brick making firm, and finally dealing in property. However, his business partner, Warrington Slater, was declared bankrupt in 1903. During proceedings, it emerged that Hobson had been involved in corrupt dealings: while a member of the city's Health Committee, he had received a ¬£100 commission from Slater after the committee had bought some land owned by Slater. Hobson refused to resign, but Arnold Muir Wilson, a Conservative Party councillor, brought a prosecution against him, and he was sentenced to three months in prison. Following his imprisonment, Hobson resigned all his positions, but he retained significant public sympathy. On release, he again became involved with the trades council, and arranged a deal between its rival Liberal-Labour and Independent Labour Party supporters. However, this soon broke down, and in 1908 the council split, with Hobson re- elected as president of the Lib-Lab version of the council.

It arose as a ballot bill sponsored by Mike Wood MP, following Government review and consultations on the subject, and it received Ministry of Justice support to expedite its passage. Background As a result of the 2011 England riots, significant problems were exposed concerning the administration of claims intended to be indemnified under the scheme established under the Riot (Damages) Act 1886. An independent review of the Act reported in 2013 that: :* the language of the Act needed to be modernized, :* compensation payable to insurers should be capped, :* it should be extended to cover other types of property such as motor vehicles, :* it should be based on the replacement value of the property damaged, but not include any consequential loss, :* the Home Office should work with the insurance industry to improve claims administration, and :* interim payments should be made available with respect to claims. Following a round of public consultations, the Government broadly accepted the reviewer's recommendations, including extending limited compensation for damage to motor vehicles whose policies do not have coverage for riot damages, and further specified that the statutory definition for a riot should be drawn from the Public Order Act 1986. The implementing bill was introduced on 24 June 2015, and received royal assent on 23 March 2016. Significant changes The Act introduces several key changes, including: :* Allowing insurers who have met claims from people or businesses to claim compensation from the local policing body.s. 1(2) :* Allowing people and businesses, which are not insured, to claim compensation from the local policing body.s. 1(1) :* Requiring that the amount of compensation must reflect only the loss directly resulting from the damage, destruction or theft of the property, and in particular, must not reflect any consequential loss resulting from it.s. 8(2) :* Ending unlimited compensation, setting a ¬£1m cap on each claim;s. 8(1) and :* Allowing for claims on motor vehicles which are not insured for riot damage, but which are covered by an insurance policy at the time.s. 2 and Schedule Coming into force Authority for making necessary regulations by way of statutory instruments. 11 came into effect on royal assent.

He was president of the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company from 1890 until his death in 1904. He helped found the American Bowling Congress, which set in place a legislative body to establish the rules and regulations used in modern ten-pin bowling. Bensinger was also an innovator of billiard table design and manufacture. Early life Bensinger was born August 17, 1839, in Louisville, Kentucky. He was the son of Nathan and Lena Bensinger. Bensinger went to Louisville public schools while a child. Upon graduation, he apprenticed to a jeweler. He started his own jewelry business in 1859. Mid life Bensinger became an employee of Brunswick, a manufacturer of billiard and pool tables, in 1869. Brunswick's headquarters for his business was in Cincinnati, Ohio, and he had a branch office in Chicago. Bensinger, Brunswick and a couple of others formed the J. M. Brunswick Billiard Manufacturing Company in October 1872. Bensinger became a vice president and was general manager in charge of the Chicago branch. In January 1874 the Brunswick Company merged with a rival firm. This competitive company, owned by Julius Balke, had factories in Cincinnati and St. Louis, Missouri. On July 8, 1879, the new merged company formed was incorporated and called Brunswick & Balke Company. The incorporators were Brunswick, Bensinger, Julius Balke Sr., A. F. Troescher and Leo Schmidt. This company then merged in 1884 with another manufacturer of billiard and pool tables run by Hugh W. Collender. The name then became Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company. Bensinger was the motivating force in bringing about this conglomerate. Brunswick died in 1886. The company extended its business into bowling manufacturing in 1888 and Bensinger was made president of this new company in 1890. Bowling in 1890 was a disorganized sport with no rules or regulations, played mostly by Germans in dimly lit Chicago saloons and basements of buildings. Bensinger helped coordinate and was the prominent figure in bringing about the initial organized set of rules and regulations for the sport of modern ten-pin bowling. He started then to make bowling balls and pins for new bowling alleys. His company also made the bowling lanes for these alleys. The first commercial regulation ten-pin bowling alley licensed was installed at the Plaza Hotel in north Chicago (Clark Street) in 1891. Bensinger sponsored traveling all-star bowling teams, managed by William V. Thompson, proprietor of the Plaza Bowling Alley, to promote Brunswick bowling products. Within two decades there were over two hundred commercial regulation ten-pin bowling alleys in Chicago alone. American Bowling Congress Bensinger, Brunswick's German-Jewish son-in-law, was influential in setting up the American Bowling Congress (A.B.C.) in 1895. On September 9, 1895, the A.B.C. was officially formed as a permanent organization at Beethoven Hall on east Fifth Street in New York City. The A.B.C. had their first formal annual meeting four days later on September 13 at the Elephant club on Fulton Street in Brooklyn and adopted the proposed constitution and by-laws. The new organization took effect officially on October 15, 1895. The basic organization was a legislative body that enforced uniform bowlers' rules and regulations, through a set of by-laws and a constitution of Articles, for all in the United States to follow as the official standard for ten-pin bowling. The organization, since incorporated into the United States Bowling Congress, standardized and still governs all bowling equipment for modern ten-pin bowling. Family Bensinger married Eleanora Brunswick, the daughter of John M. Brunswick, in 1867. They had two daughters, Cora and Edna, and one son, Benjamin Edward. Bensinger's son Benjamin became president of the Brunswick-Blake-Collender company upon his death. Benjamin's son Robert took over in 1931, making him the third generation of the Bensinger family to hold the office as the company's president. Later life and death Bensinger held the position of president of the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company from 1890 until his death. He died in French Lick, Indiana, on October 14, 1904. The cause of death was heart failure. His remains are interred at Rosehill Cemetery. Billiard table manufacturing Bensinger experimented and researched improved billiard tables and gear, leading to significant patents for rubber bumpers and other innovations. In 1880 Bensinger, as part owner of J. M.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 59 resources, including 38 contributing buildings, one contributing structure, one contributing object, 18 non- contributing buildings, and one non-contributing object. The district covers the original central business district. The commercial buildings are from one to three stories in height, and Late Victorian architectural styles dominate. The period of significance dates from 1873, with the construction of the oldest recognizable surviving building, to 1966, with the completion of the Mahanay Memorial Carillon Tower. The tower dominates not only the district, but Jefferson as well. Planning for the tower began before World War II. The Modern Movement, limestone sheathed, structure stands on the southwest corner of the courthouse square, and rises to an enclosed viewing platform and open- air 14-bell carillon. The Greene County Courthouse (1917), a statue of Abraham Lincoln (1918), and a Lincoln Highway Marker (1928) are all on the square and are individually listed on the National Register. All four structures are also along the old Lincoln Highway, which passed along the south side of the square beginning in 1913. That was during a period of peak economic growth for the community (1912-1917) and the buildings along the square were substantially completed at that time.

Many later changes were made to the building, both inside and outside, with no substantial 19th century features remaining. It is thought to be the inspiration for the pub in Life on Mars. The pub is owned by Enterprise Inns. It has a central bar, a function room (formerly a games room) and a beer garden. In February 2016, it won a CAMRA award for \\"Pub of the season\\". In 2014, it was threatened with demolition, along with Bootle Street police station and Manchester Reform Synagogue, to make way for a redevelopment of the area led by Gary Neville. A Change.org petition to save the pub was signed by over 3,500 people. An application by members of the Campaign for Real Ale to list the building was declined by Historic England as the building was not of \\"national interest\\".

Bred and owned by Sir John Jacob Astor and trained by Dick Hern he showed great promise a two-year-old in 1972 when he won his first three races before looking a somewhat unlucky loser when finishing third in the Royal Lodge Stakes. In the following year he improved to become a top- class miler with a marked preference for soft ground. He finished third in the 2000 Guineas and then recorded back-to-back Group One successes in the Irish 2000 Guineas and the Prix Jean Prat. When matched against older horses he was well-beaten when favourite for the Eclipse Stakes before ending his season by finishing third in a strongly-contested edition of the Champion Stakes. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in Europe and Australia and had some success as a sire of winners. Background Sharp Edge was a \\"big, strong\\" grey colt bred in Ireland by his owner Sir John Jacob \\"Jakie\\" Astor (1918-2000). He was from the penultimate European crop of foals sired by Silver Shark, a top-class performer in France, whose wins included the Prix de l'Abbaye and the Prix du Moulin. Silver Shark was subsequently exported to Japan. Cut Above's dam Cutle was descended from Felucca, the foundation mare of Dick Hollingsworth's stud whose other descendants included Bireme, Longboat, Bolas (Irish Oaks), Dash for Cash (Australian Guineas) and Daffodil (AJC Oaks). Cutle who had been acquired by Astor in a \\"foal swap\\" with Hollingsworth went on to produce the St Leger winner Cut Above. Astor sent his colt into training with Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Racing career =1972: two-year-old season= Sharp Edge began his racing career in the Kennett Maiden Stakes over six furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in July and won by one and a half lengths from the Bernard van Cutsem-trained favourite Noble Decree. On his next appearance, the colt won the Home Ales Stakes over the same distance at Nottingham Racecourse but was not particularly impressive as he had to be driven out to prevail by half a length from Prince Gourmet. In the New Ham Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse Sharp Edge won again, beating the Windsor Castle Stakes winner Adams Pet by a length. On his final appearance of the season, Sharp Edge was moved up in class and distance for the Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse. In a rough and unsatisfactory race, he was repeatedly blocked as he attempted to obtain a clear run before finishing strongly to take third place behind Adios and Noble Decree. The form of the race was subsequently boosted when Noble Decree won the Observer Gold Cup and in the winter of 1972/1973 British bookmakers made Sharp Edge the 8/1 second favourite for the 2000 Guineas. =1973: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old contested the Craven Stakes (a major trial for the 2000 Guineas) on firm going at Newmarket Racecourse in April and finished fifth behind My Drifter. He sustained a shoulder injury in the race and was never again asked to run on firm ground. His participation in the 2000 Guineas on 5 May was in doubt until overnight rain softened the track but he produced a very good effort to finish third of the eighteen runners behind Mon Fils and Noble Decree with Thatch in fourth place. In the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh two weeks later Sharp Edge was ridden by Joe Mercer, and started 5/2 joint-favourite alongside Dapper, the Vincent O'Brien-trained winner of both the Tetrarch Stakes and the Gladness Stakes. The other runners included Pitskelly (Tote Free Handicap), Tudenham (Middle Park Stakes), Midsummer Star (2000 Guineas Trial Stakes), Hail the Pirates and Conor Pass. After being restrained towards the rear of the sixteen-runner field, he made rapid progress in the straight, took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by three lengths from Midsummer Star with similar gaps back to Dapper and Klairvimy in third and fourth. On 3 June, Sharp Edge was sent to France for the Prix Jean Prat over 1800 metres at Chantilly Racecourse and started 3.2/1 third choice behind Verkade (Prix La Force) and Rose Laurel (Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte, Prix Daru). With Mercer again in the saddle, He won easily from the outsiders Black Melody and Some Crack. Although the racecourse judge reported the winning margin as three lengths, photographs of the finish indicated that Sharp Edge won by at least five lengths. The colt bypassed the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot and was then matched against older horses for the first time. He started favourite but was unable to recover after being badly hampered by Moulton in the straight and faded to finish sixth behind Scottish Rifle. Sharp Edge was off the course for well over three months before returning for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October. He proved the best of the male runners as he finished third behind Hurry Harriet and Allez France and ahead of Scottish Rifle, Moulton and Mysterious. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1972: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France published their own ratings of horses which had raced in those countries. In the British Free Handicap Sharp Edge was assigned a weight of 127 pounds, making him the seventh-best juvenile, six pounds behind the filly Jacinth and three pounds behind the top- rated colt Noble Decree. The independent Timeform organisation felt that he had been over-rated by the official handicapper and gave him a rating of 112, twenty-one pounds inferior to Jacinth and eighteen pounds behind the French colts Targowice and Simbir. In 1973 he was given a rating of 123 by Timeform, thirteen pounds behind Thatch, who was their highest-rated three-year-old colt. In the British handicap, he was rated the seventh-best three-year-old male behind Thatch, Sandford Lad, Rapid River, Morston, Mon Fils and Peleid. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Sharp Edge was syndicated at ¬£12,000 a share, giving him a theoretical value of ¬£480,000. He began his stud career at the Sussex Stud, West Grinstead in 1974. He stood in Europe until 1977 when he was exported to Australia where he died in 1989. The best of his offspring included Rom's Stiletto (VRC Oaks, The Thousand Guineas), Perfect Bliss (The Thousand Guineas) and Dalby Jaguar (Norwegian Triple Crown). Pedigree *Sharp Edge was inbred 4 √ó 4 √ó 4 to Nearco, meaning that this stallion appears three times in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

A Fist Within Four Walls is a Hong Kong television drama created by Jazz Boon for TVB. It is a martial arts action serial drama, and revolves around kung fu masters living in the triad-ridden Kowloon Walled City during the early 1960s. The drama stars Ruco Chan as the series' protagonist, a gifted martial arts novice who, along with a group of young kung fu masters, take down the walled city's largest criminal organisation, the Fellow Association. The drama also stars Nancy Wu, Benjamin Yuen, Philip Ng, Yuen Qiu, Grace Wong, and Moon Lau in lead roles. Protagonists =Chor Au-Kuen= Chor Au-Kuen (, meaning \\"left-hooked fist\\"), portrayed by Ruco Chan, is the main protagonist. He is often referred to as Kuen Lo (Êã≥‰Ω¨; \\"Fist Guy\\"; alt. \\"Boxer\\") by his friends, and is an extremely gifted martial arts novice. Kuen is described as an \\"optimistic and hot-blooded\\" natural-born leader, but is flawed with his impulsive and competitive nature. Kuen is kind- hearted, sometimes to the point of naivety. Yeung Hoi-pok portrayed 10-year- old Kuen. Kuen was born Chiu Yeung (ÊúùÈôΩ; Ziu1 Joeng4), and was the son of Chiu Mang-san, a Bajiquan master of the Chiu style. He and his younger sister Chiu Ha were both diligent Bajiquan students of their father. In 1945, when Yeung was 10, his family moved into the Kowloon Walled City to start a new living. They get acquainted with Duen Tung-tin, a Bajiquan master of the Duen style. Master Duen had long been a protector of the walled city; his Bajiquan kwoon was established to defend the walled city against oncoming triads, who were trying to take the ungoverned walled city as their base. Wanting to protect the walled city with them, Yeung asked his father to teach him his signature move, \\"Scaling Tiger\\" (ÁåõËôéÁ°¨Áà¨Â±±), but his father said the move was too powerful for someone as young as Yeung to learn. Yeung was forcibly separated from his family when Master Duen died under mysterious circumstances. Duen's students claimed that Yeung's father was the murderer, as they were seen fighting right before Duen's death. The doctor ruled the cause of the death to be blunt trauma, and only Chiu's \\"Fierce Tiger Climbing Mountain\\" strike had enough power to kill. Yeung's parents were then beaten to death by Duen's students, and Yeung was separated from his younger sister. Yeung then escaped to Macau to live with his great aunt. In 1959, 26-year-old Yeung, now named Chor Au- kuen, returns to the Kowloon Walled City to search for his sister. He meets But Tak-liu, a general contractor, who brings him into the walled city and introduces him to a water labouring job so he can pay his rent to the landlady Tiu Lan. By chance, he meets Duen Ying-fung, Master Duen's now adult son, and learns that the Duen family no longer operate a Bajiquan kwoon due to increasing intimidation of the Fellow Association, the walled city's largest triad organisation. Master Duen's death had indirectly led to the rise of the Fellow Association's power in the walled city. Kuen feels regretful and responsible--if his father had not killed Duen, the walled city may not have fallen victim into the wrong hands. He also learns from Fung that his sister had died from a mountain fire 15 years ago while attempting to escape the walled city. Kuen develops survivor's guilt as a result. Wanting to atone his sins, Kuen decides to stay in the walled city and takes on the duty of protecting its people. Believing that his father's \\"Fierce Tiger Climbing Mountain\\" to be the strike that had killed Master Duen, Kuen refuses to re- learn Bajiquan, and seeks help from his neighbour Thai Por, a retired master in Wing Chun and Muay Thai. Kuen is a quick learner, and immediately adapts to Thai Por's fighting style, and uses her moves to defeat his enemies. After defeating underground Muay Thai champion Lung Shing-fu, who is also Thai Por's son, Kuen and Fung form the Kowloon Walled City Welfare Association to break the Fellow Association's stronghold in the walled city. While attempting to rescue his Fa Man, he suffers head trauma causing blindness. Together with Fa Man's death and his loss at the hands of Fung he leaves his friends and becomes homeless. Tiu Lan soon convinces him to return and trains to fight without his eyesight. He later helps fight Yeung. =Duen Ying-fung= Duen Ying-fung (, meaning \\"welcome the wind\\") portrayed by Benjamin Yuen, is Kuen's friend and occasional rival. He is also a dentist, and is often referred to as Ngah Lo (Áâô‰Ω¨; \\"Tooth Guy\\"; alt. \\"Tooth Man\\"). Fung is calm, perceptive, and level-headed, a stark contrast to Kuen's impulsiveness. Fung is the same age as Kuen, having met when they were kids, though Fung does not learn of this encounter until later on. Alvin Lau portrayed 10-year-old Fung. Fung was the son of Duen Tung-tin, a highly skilled Bajiquan master who used to be a protector of the walled city. After his father's death, the family kwoon falls apart and the walled city descends into anarchy, with triads being its virtual ruler. Fung is advised by his uncle to only practice his Bajiquan in secret so he won't fall into the same fate as his father. Along with his uncle, Fung becomes a dentist and opens up a dental clinic in the walled city. Fung's good looks and kind temperament has made him quite popular with the ladies, winning the affections of even Tiu Lan and her tenants. After witnessing Kuen's bravery while trying to save Yam-yam from the Fellow Association leader Fung Ha-moon, Fung decides that he can no longer stay silent. Along with Kuen, he forms the Kowloon Walled City Welfare Association to protect the walled city's people against the intimidation of the Fellow Association. His uncle, upset with this decision, alienates him. No longer welcomed back at the clinic, he moves in with Kuen and Tiu Lan. He gets warped into investigating a drug operation when Bajiquan fighter Fa Man, who appears to be allied with Fellow Association leader Fung Chun-mei, asks for his help to destroy the supply. He later proposes to Fa Man, but is deeply shocked as his whole family is killed before his wedding. He later helps kill Yeung in revenge for his family and Man's death, and starts to teach Bajiquan to the residents. =Tiu Lan= Tiu Lan (), portrayed by Nancy Wu, is Kuen's landlady and the owner of a local hair salon within the walled city. She is feisty, bossy, and can be at times too overbearing, but is innately honourable, protective, and compassionate. Her name, Tiu Lan, is a homophone of the word ÂàÅÈõ£ (Diu1 Laan1), meaning \\"to give someone a difficult time.\\" Tiu Lan is introduced at the start of the drama as a stingy hair stylist who Kuen meets on his first day back to the walled city. She accepts Kuen as her tenant, but only under the conditions that he takes the night shift job at her salon without pay. Though they often bicker, Kuen and Tiu Lan bond over a shared secret, which is having a past that they wish to keep hidden. Tiu Lan has an obvious crush on Fung, which Kuen uses to his advantage. When Yam-yam dies in Tiu Lan's arms, Tiu Lan gets triggered and kills all of Yam-yam's captors. She suffers a heart attack, but is saved by Kuen and Fung. It is revealed in later episodes that Tiu Lan was trained to be an assassin as a child, under the code name Sun Mei (ËæõÊú™; San Mei). Suffering from a difficult heart condition and no longer willing to kill for The Order, she escaped her captors to live a life of freedom. When her former partner Kap San reappears in her life, he reminds her that she was one of the child assassins who had lent a helping hand in killing Kuen's father. =Lung Shing-fu= Lung Shing-fu (, meaning \\"dragon makes tiger\\"), portrayed by Philip Ng, is Kuen and Fung's rival. He is a trained fighter in Muay Thai, and is one of the walled city's most highly skilled martial artists. His mother and Audrey call him by his nickname, \\"Kitty\\" (Ë≤ì‰ªî; Maau1 Zai2). Fu is composed, stoic, and extremely protective of those he cares about. Fu was born in Thailand, and is the only son of Yuk Bo-fung and a Thai Chinese merchant. After his father's death, his mother brought him to the Kowloon Walled City to start a new life. Wanting to provide his mother with a better life, he becomes an underground Muay Thai boxer to earn prize money, and also impresses triad boss Or Man-cheung, later becoming his right-hand man(as revealed in episode 14, Fu killed Or Man-Cheung's previous right-hand man). His mother dislikes Fu's decision of joining the triads and they have a falling-out. Fu occasionally visits his mother at her store, though it always ends up with a scolding. When Or Man-cheung's daughter, Audrey, returns to Hong Kong from graduating university, Fu is assigned to be her bodyguard. Audrey's kind and warm-hearted personality is unlike that of her father. When Audrey is kidnapped by Fuk Sau-kam, another member of the Fellow Association who believes that Or Man-cheung stole his drugs, Fu nearly sacrifices his life to save her. After Or Man-Cheung's retirement from the Fellow Association, Fu becomes his new restaurant's manager and repairs his relationship with his mother when he begins teaching Muay Thai for a living. Despite Lung shing-fu having the boldness of a man, he completely lacks relationship skills as shown when Or Tak-Li was unimpressed with his attempted proposal at a street foodstand. He asks his mother for advice, then attempts a second proposal in the traditional Thai style with a bucket of water, but it didn't go according to plan. Later on when he encounters Yeung chuk-luen trying to kill Or Tak-li, Fu fought vehemently to defend her from Yeung, he discovered Yeung was the assassin that Chor Au-Kuen was looking for and the one responsible for the mysterious death of Duen's father. In addition, he discovered his iron shirt skill, as his well-executed strikes was doing no damage to him. Fu was later injured, stabbed in the stomach by a steel rod and dies in Audrey's arms. =Fa Man= Fa Man (), portrayed by Grace Wong, is the owner of a wealthy brothel establishment in the walled city, and appears to be allied with Fung Chun-mei at first. She often uses her beauty and charm to achieve her goals, and weakens her enemies with poisonous traps. Her real identity, however, is a Bajiquan master, disguising herself as a striptease performer so she can infiltrate the Fellow Association. In Episode 13, it is revealed that Fa Man is actually Chiu Ha (ÊúùÈúû; Ziu1 Haa4), Kuen's younger sister whom he believes to be dead after she ran away . Man was separated from her older brother after her parents were framed and beaten to death in 1945. While Kuen escaped to Macau with their great aunt, Man stayed to bury her parents. Man was believed to have died after she cremated her parents, as the cremation caused a wildfire all over the mountainside. Believing her father's innocence, Man assumes a new identity and infiltrates the Fellow Association to search for the true killer. She discovers that the Fellow Association's three leaders-- Fung Chun-mei, Or Man-cheung, and Fuk Sau-kam--were the three men who attacked her father in prison. Fuk Sau-kam becomes her first victim when he plans to escape the walled city. Fung Chun-mei is her second victim, Fa Man kills him after betraying and ruining him. She was unable to fulfill her last task at killing Or Man-cheung, as he was aware that there was someone targeting him. When all seemed at peace at the Walled City Fa Man and Duen Ying-fung gets married, but happiness is not long lived when Fung's entire household is murdered on their wedding day. Fa Man finds out that Yeung Chuk-luen is the mastermind behind all the evil in the Walled City after picking up dope at his pastry shop. She was later ambushed by Kap San and his henchmen who severely injure her. With her brother's failed attempt to protect Fa Man from the assassins, she was stabbed in the stomach by one of the assassins and died. =Or Tak-li= Or Tak-li (), portrayed by Moon Lau, is the daughter of Or Man-cheung. Also known by her English name Audrey, she is introduced at the start of the show as a university graduate who recently returned to Hong Kong from overseas. Fascinated with the culture of the walled city, she volunteers for a teaching post at a local public school in the city and becomes acquainted with Kuen, who she takes a liking to. After discovering her father's involvement with the Fellow Association, she threatens to leave him, forcing him to retire. Audrey develops a close relationship with her body guard, Lung Shing-fu. It is later revealed that Audrey's actual biological father is Yeung Chuk-luen who had an affair with Or Man-cheung's late wife. =Yuk Bo-fung= Yuk Bo-fung (), portrayed by Yuen Qiu, is the mother of Lung Shing-fu. She is known as Thai Por (Ê≥∞Â©Ü; \\"Thai Lady\\"; alt. \\"Thai Hag\\") by her neighbours, and owns a general store across the street from Tiu Lan's hair salon. The two do not get along, but they share similar concerns about the Fellow Association's growing power within the walled city. A Master in Wing Chun and Muay Thai, Thai Por becomes Kuen's pseudo-mentor, and teaches him various methods to defend himself against the fighters of the Fellow Association. Thai Por is originally from Mainland China, but she moved to Thailand after marrying a Thai Chinese merchant. After the death of her husband, she and her son, Fu, move to Hong Kong to start a new living. Thai Por is against Fu's decision of joining the Fellow Association, and they have a falling-out until Fu becomes Cheung's new restaurant's manager. After Fu's death, she closes down her store and opens a restaurant and teaches her new daughter-in-law fighting skills. Main antagonists =Or Man-cheung= Or Man-cheung (), portrayed by KK Cheung, is one of the three triad leaders of the Fellow Association. He is the father of Audrey Or, who is also his only daughter. Cheung controls most of the gambling operations within the walled city, including the city's biggest underground fighting ring. After Fuk Sau- kam's old drug-maker tries to assassinate him, he nearly dies and has a change of heart, retiring from the Fellow Association and transforming his casinos into restaurants. Cheung is a master in Tai Chi and was one of the three assassins who attacked Kuen's father in prison fifteen years ago. His supposed reform was a lie to appease his daughter and lure out who killed the other two Fellow Association leaders. In order to take back control of the Walled City he plans a fake truce gathering to blow up Kuen, Fung and everyone associated with the Walled City Welfare Association and in the end kills Siu Chi. Cheung becomes outnumbered when he is no match to fight Kuen, Man and Fu, who turns against him after seeing his true colors. While trying to escaped the walled city he encounters Luen, who beats Cheung to death and then reveals to a dying Cheung his real identity and that Audrey is not his biological daughter but Luen's biological daughter because he had an affair with Cheung's late wife, shocking Cheung as he died. =Fung Chun-mei= Fung Chun-mei (), portrayed by Carlo Ng, is one of the three triad leaders of the Fellow Association. He and his younger brother, Fung Ha-moon, control most of the city's brothels and performance clubs. Mei is a master in the Eagle Claw, and is one of the most highly skilled martial artists in the walled city. His feminine appearance and demeanor hides his true persona of a ruthless, cruel and sadistic triad boss. When his brother was beaten to death by Fu, Mei made it his life mission to destroy Fu and everyone associated with him. Mei becomes the Fellow Association's temporary chairman after Or Man-cheung retires and was one of the three assassins who attacked Kuen's father in prison fifteen years ago. After devising a gambling plan causing almost all the walled city citizens to be in-debt to him as a tactic to destroy Kuen and Fung, it backfires when Fa Man betrays and then killed him. =Fuk Sau-kam= Fuk Sau-kam (; alt. \\"Opium Kam\\"), portrayed by Vincent Lam, is one of the three triad leaders of the Fellow Association. He controls most of the city's drug rings, and is also a drug addict himself. He is a master in the Piguaquan, and takes medication to neutralise his sensitivity to pain. Kam has a sadistic mind, and takes joy in torturing others for his entertainment. He is one of the three assassins who attacked Kuen's father in prison fifteen years ago. When Fung Chun-mei frames Or Man-cheung for Kam's stolen drug shipment, Kam kidnaps Audrey for exchange of the drugs. After Audrey escapes from Kam, Cheung puts up a bounty for his life. Kam soon becomes the most targeted person in the walled city with everyone after his life. While trying to escape the walled city he is killed by Fa Man. =Fung Ha-moon= Fung Ha-moon (), portrayed by Oscar Li, is Fung Chun-mei's younger brother, and co-rules his prostitution empire. He is a notorious pervert that rapes all the new girls sold into prostitution and of age walled city virgin female citizens he fancies. His obsession to deflower Lee Wai-yam causes Kuen to start an uprising against Moon and his brother Mei, with the help of Yuk Bo-fung and Duen. He is large and bulky which makes him a skilled wrestler, a stark contrast to his brother's stylistic Eagle Claw. He is later beaten to death by Lung Shing-fu when he tries to rape Audrey. =Yeung Chuk-luen= Yeung Chuk-luen (), portrayed by Jimmy Au, is the owner of a put chai ko(ÁºΩ‰ªîÁ≥ï) factory, is the main villain. He helps the walled city citizens whenever possible, however to protect his employees he is blackmailed by Fuk Sau-kam into smuggling drugs outside of the walled city. Finding out how despicable Fuk Sau-kam is, he cut ties with him and joins the Walled City Welfare Association to side with Kuen. It is later revealed that he was the one who killed Duen's father, Or Man-Cheung and is the mastermind of an assassination society. He has trained his body to be as tough as an iron shield that not only gained him the near immortal ability, but also protects him from being injured by any strikes. However, this capability also leaves him vulnerable to anything caused by gravity (falling) and external elements (fire). Eventually Kuen found his weak-spot and allows him and Duen to kill him with the Scaling Tiger strike. It is believed that Otto Chan portrayed a younger Yeung Chuk-Luen. Supporting characters =But Tak-liu= But Tak- liu (), portrayed by Lam Tsz-sin, is Kuen's roommate and one of Tiu Lan's tenant. He works as a general contractor and was the first person to bring Kuen into the walled city.

He is a Bajiquan master and the original owner of the Duen family's Bajiquan kwoon. Keung falls in love with Fa Man who uses this as an advantage to extract the truth of what happened in 1945. Keung cowardness in 1945 leads him to frame Kuen and Man's father for the death of his brother, when in fact he knows who the actual killer of his brother is. Jonathan Wong portrayed a younger Duen Chit-keung. He is later killed by Yeung Chuk-luen's 'fierce tiger climbing mountain'. =Wong Siu-chi= Wong Siu-chi (), portrayed by Jonathan Lee, is a mentally challenged young man that produces candy at the Duen's dental clinic. He is Kuen first Bajiquan mentor and later sacrificed himself to protect his uncle from Cheung's bomb attack. =Lau Tai= Lau Tai (), portrayed by Zoie Tam, is But Tak-liu's wife who also works for Tiu Lan at her hair salon. =Lee Wai- yam= Lee Wai-yam (), portrayed by Bella Lam, is an employee at Tiu Lan's hair salon. Her gambling-addicted father sells her into prostitution to the Fung brothers to pay off his debts. With the help of Tiu Lan, Kuen, and Fung, Yam-yam escapes the walled city and finds a job at a newspaper agency in the main city with her father. Yam-yam dreams to be a news columnist, but her dream never gets realised as her father sells her again to a gambling parlor triad boss after he fails to pay his debts. She is later raped by the gambling parlor leader and whipped by his gang, dying in Tiu Lan's arms when the trio tries to save her. Other characters *Lee Fat (), portrayed by Ngai Wai- man, is Yam-yam's father. He is a greedy gambling addict who is willing to do anything for money.

In order to divide Kuen and Fung he later kills Fung's uncle and entire household the night before Fung's wedding. After Fa Man finds out Luen has been behind all the evil doings in the Walled City, San is sent to kill her.

It was founded in 2013, and is headquartered in Erbil, Iraq. Established to further the political objectives of the Assyrian people in Iraq, the party currently holds one seat in the Kurdistan Region Parliament. According to its official website, the party exists as a renewed commitment to the Assyrian national cause, for the betterment of the Assyrian people, and to advance their struggle for legitimate rights in Iraq.Sons of Mesopotamia Statement Dated July 20, 2013 The party is named after Mesopotamia, also known as Beth Nahrain, or \\"the land of rivers\\" which was the historical location of Assyria, the ancient empire that encompassed Iraq, Syria, and parts of Iran and Turkey.Ancient History Encyclopedia: Mesopotamia The chosen name reflects on the ethnic identity of the party's members, as well as their ongoing struggle to reclaim rights for Assyrians in their ancestral lands. The Sons of Mesopotamia is the first and only Assyrian-led political party with a female president, currently headed by Galeta Shaba.SBS Interview with Galeta Shaba, President of Abnaa AlNahrain Foundation The Sons of Mesopotamia was founded as a splinter group after a number of its members became disillusioned with the leadership of the Assyrian Democratic Movement (ADM). In a statement issued on July 20, 2013, former members of the ADM, led by Sons of Mesopotamia founder and current board member, Shmaiel Nanno,ANB Interview with Shmaiel Nanno, Abnaa Al-Nahrain Board Member announced the split. In the statement, since published on their website, the party acknowledges that their departure from ADM was not an easy decision, but was necessary as conditions for Assyrians in Iraq drastically worsened. The party specifies a number of reasons for the split, citing mistrust and misguided leadership under ADM's current Secretary General Yonadam Kanna, a complete monopolization of authority, continued violations against the party's principles and regulations, and disputes regarding strategy. The split came as a devastating blow to the ADM, as several notable members‚Äîincluding Shmaiel Nanno, Mikhael Benjamin, Khlapieel Benjamin, and Srood Maqdasy‚Äîwere among those who left the party and joined the Sons of Mesopotamia. Their departure created confusion and a loss of confidence in ADM leadership, causing friction among community members. Still, the majority of members remained with the ADM, however, the party's support has since weakened. Since the split, the Sons of Mesopotamia have earned one seat in the Kurdistan Region Parliament, which was formerly held by the Chaldean Syriac Assyrian Popular Council.Ishtar TV: 2013 KRG Parliament Election Results Despite the split, Sons of Mesopotamia has reaffirmed their support for ADM's stated principles and policy platform, and reference legendary ADM martyrs Yousip, Youbert, and YoukhannaThe Heroes of the Assyrian Democratic Movement in their mission statement. Many members and supporters see the political party as a realization and restoration of ADM's original mission. Political ideology The Sons of Mesopotamia claims to have maintained its commitment to universal Assyrian objectives to secure the rights of Assyrians in Iraq, specifically in northern Iraq and the Nineveh Plain.

In general, ballot marking devices neither store nor tabulate ballots, but only allow the voter to record votes on ballots that are then stored and tabulated elsewhere. The first ballot marking device emerged in the late 19th century, but were only widely used starting in the 1960s. Today, electronic ballot markers (EBMs) have come into widespread use as assistive devices in the context of optical scan voting systems. In the context of paper ballots, pens and pencils are used to record votes on ballots, but they are general-purpose items.  Terminology: BMD or EBM?  There is no consensus about the terminology used to refer to ballot marking devices or electronic ballot markers, and where a jurisdiction uses one term, there is frequently no reference to the other. For example, Hart InterCivic and the state of Colorado only list BMD and ballot marking device in their glossaries.Tom W. Farley, Voting Systems Acronyms, Hart Intercivic, Feb. 8, 2014.Election Rules [8 CCR 1505-1], Colorado Secretary of State, Aug. 6, 2015. The Minnesota and IEEE P 1622 glossaries, on the other hand, refer to EBM and electronic ballot marker (or electronically-assisted ballot marker).2016 Election Terminology Guide, Minnesota Secretary of State, Apr. 1, 2016.Glossary, IEEE Voting System Standards Committee 1622 (VSSC/1622), Mar. 23, 2015. The Canadian government appears to prefer the term assistive voting device.Joan Fraser (Chair) and John D. Wallace (Deputy Chair), Report on the use of Assistive Voting Device for Persons with Disabilities, Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Oct, 2010. These terms are not, strictly speaking, synonyms. Ballot marking device defines a broad category, while electronic ballot marker excludes older mechanical devices, and assistive voting device only applies when the device serves as an assistive device.  History  The first ballot marking devices specifically designed for use in elections emerged in the late 19th century along with proposals to use various punched-card ballot forms. Kennedy Dougan filed for patents on a punched-card system using a ballot marking device in 1890.Kennedy Dougan, Ballot-Holder, , granted Nov. 11, 1890.Kennedy Dougan, Mechanical Ballot and Ballot-Holder, , granted Nov. 11, 1890. Urban Iles filed a proposal for a more sophisticated system in 1892.Urban G. Iles, Ballot-Registering Device, , granted June 20, 1893. The patents for these machines suggest that their primary goal was to provide for mechanical vote tabulation while retaining paper ballots that could be used to verify the operation of the tabulator in the event of any question. The punched cards used by these early machines were not designed to be compatible with any other data processing equipment. In 1937, Frank Carrell, working for IBM applied for a patent on a ballot marking device that recorded on standard punched cards. This was incorporated into a full-sized voting booth with voter interface that resembled a mechanical voting machine, but recording on ballot cards that could be tabulated on standard punched-card tabulating machines.Fred M. Carroll, Voting Machine, , granted Apr. 2, 1940 A Votomatic vote recorder. None of these machines was commercially successful. The first commercially successful ballot marking device was the Votomatic. This was based on the Port-A-Punch, a handheld device for recording data on pre-scored punched cards. Joseph Harris filed his first patent on what would become the Votomatic in 1962.Joseph P. Harris, Data Registering Device, , issued Aug. 17, 1965. Ballot cards punched on a Votomatic could be tabulated by standard punched card tabulating machines or sorted on card sorters. The machines cost only $185 each in 1965 dollars, and weighed only 6 pounds. This was one of the first machines to attract serious thinking about accessibility; John Ahmann filed for a patent on a punching stylus for the Votomatic adapted for use by voters with motor disabilities in 1986.John E. Ahmann, Punching Stylus for Handicapped Users, , granted Feb. 10, 1987. IBM marketed the Votomatic until 1968, when it spun off Computer Election Systems Inc. to produce and market the system. By 1980, the Votomatic system was used by over 29% of U.S. voters. By 1992, the Votomatic had replaced mechanical voting machines as the dominant voting system used in the United States. The dominance of the Votomatic ended abruptly following the Florida election recount of 2000.Douglas W. Jones and Barbara Simons, Broken Ballots, CSLI Publications, 2012; see Sections 3.4-3.6, pages 48-55. One of the major benefits of the Votomatic was that the machines were inexpensive enough that a polling place could have several machines, each with a ballot label printed in a different language. The needs of minority voters also drove the development of electronic voting in Belgium. In 1991, a Belgian, Julien Anno working with a group from Texas Instruments filed a patent application for an electronic ballot marker.Julien Anno, Russel Lewis, and Dale Cone, Method and System for Autonated Voting, , issued Feb. 23, 1993. The Jites and Digivote systems used in Belgium are similar to this, although they use magnetic stripe cards instead of the bar codes used in the TI patent to record the ballot.Expert Visit on New Voting Technologies, 8 October 2006 Local Elections, Kingdom of Belgium, OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Nov. 22, 2006. Belgium continues to use ballot marking devices, although the new machines use thermal printers to print human readable text along with a machine-readable bar code. The AIS \\"Sailau\\" voting system developed in Belarus and Kazakhstan is conceptually similar to the Belgian system, except that it records votes on smart cards instead of bar codes or magnetic stripe cards.Douglas W. Jones, The Sailau E-Voting System, Direct Democracy: Progress and Pitfalls of Election Technology , Michael Yard, ed., International Foundation for Electoral Systems , Sept. 2010; pages 74-95. One weakness of punched card ballots is that, while voters can, in principle, verify that the punches on the ballots correspond to the choices the voter intended, this is difficult.Douglas W. Jones and Barbara Simons, Broken Ballots, CSLI Publications, 2012; see Section 3.7, pages 55-57. In the case of the Belgian magnetic-stripe cards and Kazakh smart cards, independent voter verification of the contents of the ballot card is impossible. ballot marking device. The passage of the Help America Vote Act in 2002 required new voting systems to be accessible. This led Eugene Cummings to file for a patent in 2003 on a machine that became the AutoMARK.Eugene Cummings, Ballot Marking System and Apparatus, , issued Jul. 25, 2006. This machine has a touch screen, tactile keyboard, and headphone jack, as well as support for several other assistive devices, and it records votes on ballots used by several widely used optical scan voting systems.Douglas W. Jones and Barbara Simons, Broken Ballots, CSLI Publications, 2012; see Section 5.5, pages 111-115, and Section 9.3, pages 218-221. By 2016, the AutoMARK was used statewide in 10 states in the United States, and widely used in 19 additional states.Election Systems and Software (ES&S;) AutoMARK, Verified Voting, accessed Aug. 2016. Sanford Morganstein also filed for a ballot-marking device patent in 2003, primarily motivated by the desire for a voter-verified paper audit trail.Sanford J. Morganstein, Advanced Voting System and Method, , issued Oct. 23, 2007. Morganstein founded Populex Corporation to commercialize this system, and by 2004, the system was brought to market, certified to meet the 2002 Voting System Standards.New Populex Voting Machine Receifes Federal Approval (press release), PR Newswire, Populex Corp, Dec. 16, 2004. Like Julien Anno's ballot marking device proposal, the Populex system prints a compact summary ballot containing a bar code that is scanned as the voter drops the ballot in the ballot box. Unlike Anno's system, however, the Populex system also prints a human-readable summary on the ballot for voter verification. Morganstein's system never achieved deep market penetration, although it was used in Worth County, Missouri in 2012.PopulexSlate, Verified Voting , 2012. Several other ballot marking devices have come on the market to compete with the AutoMARK. All of these print human readable content on paper ballots, but in several cases, these machines follow the Populex model by adding a machine-readable bar code. Voters cannot easily verify that the bar code matches the human- readable print, but in an audit, a hand count of the human-readable ballots can be compared with a machine count of the bar-coded content to verify that the electronic ballot marker was honest. It has been noted that the information incorporated into the barcode or QR code may not match the human- readable information printed on the ballots, and it would be impossible to determine if that is the case without audits by computer coding specialists. https://bradblog.com/?p=12505 References See also *Voting machine *DRE voting machine *Optical scan voting system Election technology ","title":"Ballot marking device"},{"id":"51344714","text":"Robert Griswold is an American swimmer.

It also used two axial and four radial bipropellant thrusters for station keeping and attitude control. It included enough propellant for orbit circularization and 8 years of operation. Its payload is composed of a antenna fed by thirty-two 27 MHz Ku band transponders for a total bandwidth of 864 MHz. The Ku band transponders had a TWTA output power of 20 Watts. History With the opening of the Japanese satellite communications market to private investment, Japan Communications Satellite Company (JCSAT) was founded in 1985. On June of the same year, JCSAT awarded an order to Hughes Space and Communications for two identical satellites, JCSAT-1 and JCSAT-2, based on the spin-stabilized HS-393 satellite bus. JCSAT-1 would become the first commercial Japanese communications satellite. It was successfully launched aboard an Ariane-44LP on March 6, 1989 at 23:29:00 UTC. Originally expected to be retired in 1997, it was finally sent to a graveyard orbit on 1998.

Dietterich is emeritus professor of computer science at Oregon State University. He is one of the founders of the field of machine learning. He served as executive editor of Machine Learning (journal) (1992‚Äì98) and helped co-found the Journal of Machine Learning Research. In response to the media's attention on the dangers of artificial intelligence, Dietterich has been quoted for an academic perspective to a broad range of media outlets including National Public Radio, Business Insider, Microsoft Research, CNET, and The Wall Street Journal. Among his research contributions were the invention of error-correcting output coding to multi-class classification, the formalization of the multiple-instance problem, the MAXQ framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning, and the development of methods for integrating non-parametric regression trees into probabilistic graphical models.  Biography and education  Thomas Dietterich was born in South Weymouth, Massachusetts, in 1954. His family later moved to New Jersey and then again to Illinois, where Tom graduated from Naperville Central High School. Dietterich then entered Oberlin College and began his undergraduate studies. In 1977, Dietterich graduated from Oberlin with a degree in mathematics, focusing on probability and statistics. Dietterich spent the following two years at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. After those two years, he began his doctoral studies in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. Dietterich received his Ph.D. in 1984 and moved to Corvallis, Oregon, where he was hired as an assistant professor in computer science. In 2016, Dietterich retired from his position at Oregon State University. Throughout his career, Dietterich has worked to promote scientific publication and conference presentations. For many years, he was the editor of the MIT Press series on Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning. He also held the position of co-editor of the Morgan Claypool Synthesis Series on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. He has organized several conferences and workshops including serving as Technical Program Co-Chair of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-90), Technical Program Chair of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS-2000) and General Chair of NIPS-2001. He served as founding President of the International Machine Learning Society and he has been a member of the IMLS Board since its founding. He is currently also a member of the Steering Committee of the Asian Conference on Machine Learning.  Research interests  Professor Dietterich is interested in all aspects of machine learning. There are three major strands of his research. First, he is interested in the fundamental questions of artificial intelligence and how machine learning can provide the basis for building integrated intelligent systems. Second, he is interested in ways that people and computers can collaborate to solve challenging problems. And third, he is interested in applying machine learning to problems in the ecological sciences and ecosystem management as part of the emerging field of computational sustainability. Over his career, he has worked on a wide variety of problems ranging from drug design to user interfaces to computer security. His current focus is on ways that computer science methods can help advance ecological science and improve our management of the Earth's ecosystems. This passion has led to several projects including research in wildfire management, invasive vegetation and understanding the distribution and migration of birds. For example, Dietterich's research is helping scientists at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology answer questions like: How do birds decide to migrate north? How do they know when to land and stopover for a few days? How do they choose where to make a nest? Tens of thousands of volunteer birdwatchers (citizen scientists) all over the world contribute data to the study by submitting their bird sightings to the eBird website. The amount of data is overwhelming ‚Äì in March 2012 they had over 3.1 million bird observations. Machine learning can uncover patterns in data to model the migration of species. But there are many other applications for the same techniques which will allow organizations to better manage our forests, oceans, and endangered species, as well as improve traffic flow, water systems, the electrical power grid, and more.  Dangers of AI: an academic perspective  The most realistic risks about the dangers of artificial intelligence are basic mistakes, breakdowns and cyberattacks, Thomas Dietterich, an expert in the field says ‚Äì more so than machines that become super powerful, run amok and try to destroy the human race. \\"For a long time the risks of artificial intelligence have mostly been discussed in a few small, academic circles, and now they are getting some long-overdue attention,\\" Dietterich said. \\"That attention, and funding to support it, is a very important step.\\" Dietterich's perspective of problems with AI, however, is a little more pedestrian that most ‚Äì not so much that it will overwhelm humanity, but that like most complex engineered systems, it may not always work. \\"We are now talking about doing some pretty difficult and exciting things with AI, such as automobiles that drive themselves, or robots that can effect rescues or operate weapons,\\" Dietterich said. \\"These are high-stakes tasks that will depend on enormously complex algorithms.\\" \\"The biggest risk is that those algorithms may not always work. We need to be conscious of this risk and create systems that can still function safely even when AI components commit errors.\\" Dietterich said he considers machines becoming self-aware and trying to exterminate humans to be more science fiction than scientific fact. But to the extent that computer systems are given increasingly dangerous tasks, and asked to learn from and interpret their experiences, he said they may simply make mistakes. Most proponents of taking AI seriously as an existential risk do not believe that machines will become self-aware, either (see e.g. here). Additionally, there is nearly universal agreement among the people that advocate for taking the existential risk from AI serious, that advanced AI systems will not suddenly develop a negative intent (hate or anger) against humanity. and then decide to run amok. Instead, much of the work done in the AI safety community does indeed focus around accidents and design flaws. It is thus unclear in how far Dietterich is merely attacking a straw man version of the argument for existential risk from artificial intelligence. \\"Computer systems can already beat humans at chess, but that doesn't mean they can't make a wrong move. They can reason, but that doesn't mean they always get the right answer. And they may be powerful, but that's not the same thing as saying they will develop superpowers.\\" Dietterich believes that more immediate and real risks will be to identify how mistakes might occur, and how to create systems that can help deal with, minimize, or accommodate them. He believes that some of the most imminent threats computers will pose in a malicious sense will probably emerge as a result of cyberattacks. Humans with malicious intent using artificial intelligence and powerful computers to attack other computer systems are a real threat and thus would be a good place to focus the first work in this field. Dietterich has been noticed by many media outlets for giving his academic perspective on the dangers of artificial intelligence. He was the plenary speaker at Wait What? a future technology forum hosted by DARPA on September 11, 2015. In an article by Digital Trends in February 2015, Dietterich was tapped for his expertise on the topic: Dietterich lists bugs, cyberattacks and user interface issues as the three biggest risks of artificial intelligence ‚Äì or any other software, for that matter. \\"Before we put computers in control of high-stakes decisions,\\" he says, \\"our software systems must be carefully validated to ensure that these problems do not arise.\\" It's a matter of steady stable progress with great attention to detail, rather than the \\"apocalyptic doomsday scenarios\\" that can so easily capture the imagination when discussing AI. In July 2015, Dietterich was interviewed for NPR's On Point Managing the Artificial Intelligence Risk\\". Dietterich was also featured by Business Insider, Business Insider Australia, FedScoop, CNET, Microsoft Research, PC Magazine, TechInsider, U.S. Department of Defense; was filmed by Communications of the ACM and KEZI; and has been mentioned in articles by The Wall Street Journal, Tech Times, and The Corvallis Advocate.

Early life Whitney Shumate was born in Rock Run, Virginia, near Bassett, Virginia in rural Henry County, Virginia. His father was John Wesley Shumate and his mother was Martha Wells Shumate, who died soon after childbirth. His first name was given in honor of the inventor, Eli Whitney, but due to the sudden death of his mother, he never received a middle name. Whitney was the youngest of ten children. His father later remarried, to Susan \\"Susie\\" Ann Philpott, and the couple then had six children by that marriage. As a boy, Whitney would take a different path in order to hunt and trap on the way back and forth to school, near the existing Rock Run School. What he caught was usually what they had for supper that night. John W. Shumate worked in tobacco Sharecropping, and the early years of his life was spent living in a log cabin alongside the Rock Run. From both his parents he received Methodist instruction in Social justice (his father was named after John Wesley) and the Wells family were also strong members of what is today the United Methodist Church. When Whitney was twelve years old the family moved to Martinsville, and he finished three years of high school there. Marriage After a few years as a letter carrier in Martinsville, he began selling furniture and household goods. He married Jessamine Shumate. She later said in her autobiography, \\"While I was going to school in Martinsville, I met a young man named Whitney Shumate. We started dating and went together for three years before we were married. The family teased me, because Whitney had a large car and when he came to Preston, Virginia to visit, always took me and a few members of my family for rides. When he bought a coupe, everyone said he was getting serious and wanted to leave my family at home when he took me for rides! It must have been true, because we were married on December 13, 1922.\\"\\"Ada Jessamine Shumate\\" IN: Hadden, Robert Lee. 1990. The Shamrock and the Fleur de Lys: the Family Histories of the William James Hadden family and the Whitney Shumate Family. Page 138. Whitney and Jessamine Shumate had two daughters, Ada Margaret S. Hadden (Mrs. William J. Hadden) and Jessamine \\"Jeppy\\" White S. Calhoun. His grandson and Namesake, Whit Haydn, is a noted magician and entertainer. Business enterprises Whitney began several businesses before settling on furniture sales. He established the \\"Shumate Furniture Store\\" in Martinsville, later named the \\"Shumate-Jesse Furniture Store\\". He also was involved in development, and constructed over 100 homes in Henry County for lower and middle class owners, both black and white. He especially worked to improve living conditions for black members of the community, constructing new homes that were affordable for the black residents. Some of his early business projects didn't work. An early store went bankrupt and his partner fled the area. Whitney not only paid off his own debts, but he also paid off the ones owed by his partner in the business. The business leaders in Martinsville respected his integrity and honesty in business deals. He later became one of the directors and president of the Mutual Savings and Loan Association in Martinsville (an early Mutual savings bank). For the county, he was also a member of the \\"Board of Assessors\\" and the \\"Board of Equalization\\" for taxes. Fireworks store He also started a firecracker store during the 1930s The store caught fire and burned down on December 12, 1936, but only after scaring the citizens of Martinsville who thought bank robbers were shooting up the town with machine guns when the firecrackers went up in the flames. \\"Whatever the cause, the fireworks lit up downtown Martinsville and the Saturday afternoon Christmas shopping crowd. The newspaper described it as 'pandemonium . . . deafening roars . . . a roaring blaze leaping the full height of the three-story building . . . skyrockets whistling across the square to land on the courthouse lawn . . . and bright red and white Roman candles rolling along the paved street.' Within a few seconds, the town square was empty of people. Several hundred residents had visualized everything from screaming comets, earthquakes, rebel air raids, bursting boilers and bank robbers with machine guns.\\"Casey, Dan. 2016. \\"Casey: More on the Franklin Road bridge project ‚Äî and a fireworks disaster\\". Roanoke Times. July 9, 2016. Page 1. Civic life He became a Justice of the peace in 1945, and served for several years for Henry County. He was present at the county jail every Sunday morning to help release the Saturday night drunks. Whitney also was elected several times to the Martinsville City council. He also worked on the local Democratic Party (United States) offices, and was a member of the Martinsville Development Council. Affordable housing Whitney Shumate was an early advocate of Affordable housing and slum clearance, especially for the black community in Henry County. Growing up in a log cabin, he was always acutely aware of the terrible effects of poor housing and a lack of electricity, water and sewage or even paved roads. During the time of racial segregation in Virginia, many of the blacks in Martinsville and Henry County were not able to either finance or acquire modern housing, especially for the growing black middle class in post-war Virginia. During the 1950s when segregation was still legal, and when many banks habitually refused loans to black families, Whitney Shumate worked to provide modern housing for the under-served population. By raising private funds, he was able to bring together private, corporate and banking interests to provide financing and access to banking services for the black community. He helped clear out a portion of Martinsville called \\"Mill Town\\", which had sub-standard rental housing originally provided in the 19th century for the defunct cotton mill employees. New homes were constructed in the neighborhood, built with sound materials and with all city services for the first time. What had originally been considered a depressed civic area rapidly became a center of progress as middle class blacks finally began to prosper. As an editorial in the local newspaper noted, \\"One of the projects which won him considerable attention and praise was the instigation of the redevelopment of what was once known as Martinsville Cotton Mill Village. He and associates purchased about 50 houses in North Martinsville, and using private capital rather than federal aid, rebuilt them into comfortably inhabitable homes, making it possible for many persons to purchase homes within their financial range.\\"Martinsville Bulletin. March 3, 1966. \\"City Loses Citizen who Helped Make it a Better Community.\\" Death and burial During a church service at the Broad Street Christian Church in Martinsville, where he was an elder, he suffered a heart attack, and after completing the communion service, went to the hospital where he died on February 28, 1966. The Martinsville Bulletin newspaper had an editorial that said: \\"Such was the nature of this unassuming man, whose integrity and ability were widely recognized and highly respected. Martinsville and Henry County are much better places in which to live because Whitney Shumate lived here and helped make it so in his quiet and unassuming manner.\\" He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Martinsville, Virginia.\\"Whitney Shumate\\" References External link 1896 births 1966 deaths People from Henry County, Virginia People from Martinsville, Virginia Businesspeople from Virginia Virginia Democrats ","title":"Whitney Shumate"},{"id":"51344887","text":"Joshua K.

Satellite description The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by Hughes on the HS-393 satellite bus. It had a launch mass of , a mass of after reaching geostationary orbit and an 8-year design life. When stowed for launch, its dimensions were long and in diameter. With its solar panels fully extended it spanned . Its power system generated approximately 2,350 Watts of power thanks to two cylindrical solar panels. It also had a two 38Ah NiH2 batteries. It would serve as the main satellite on the 150¬∞E longitude position of the JSAT fleet. Its propulsion system was composed of two R-4D LAE with a thrust of . It also used two axial and four radial bipropellant thrusters for station keeping and attitude control. It included enough propellant for orbit circularization and 8 years of operation. Its payload was composed of a antenna fed by thirty-two 27 MHz Ku band transponders for a total bandwidth of 864 MHz. The Ku band transponders had a TWTA output power of 20 Watts. History With the opening of the Japanese satellite communications market to private investment, Japan Communications Satellite Company (JCSAT) was founded in 1985. On June of the same year, JCSAT awarded an order to Hughes Space and Communications for two identical satellites, JCSAT-1 and JCSAT-2, based on the spin-stabilized HS-393 satellite bus. JCSAT-2 was successfully launched aboard a Commercial Titan III along Skynet 4A on January 1, 1990 at 00:07 UTC. Originally expected to be retired in 2000, it was finally sent to a graveyard orbit on 2002.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 34 resources, including 26 contributing buildings and 8 non-contributing buildings. with The district covers parts of four blocks of the central business district. The commercial buildings are mostly masonry structures constructed with locally produced bricks and concrete blocks. Eleven of the buildings are frame construction. The buildings are from one to two stories in height, and Late Victorian architectural styles dominate. Because of the hilly terrain, buildings on one side of Main Street have exposed basements, while those on the other side of street are built into the side of a hill. The Bennedsen, Boldt, and Hansen Building is individually listed on the National Register. Danish immigrants were central to settling the town. Decorative elements that call attention to the Danish presence include scalloped concrete cornice moldings on three of the buildings, and a swastika that decorated a bank building at one time. The arrival of the Atlantic Northern Railroad in 1908 lead to brief period of economic expansion in the town that culminated in a peak in commercial building construction in 1918. An agricultural depression in the 1920s and decline in rail usage for transporting goods to and from the area led to a general decline in the town. For the most part the older buildings were maintained rather than new construction. The town hall, however, was built in 1942 by the Works Progress Administration to replace the opera house, which had been torn down.

He rose to power as a young man and was sub-chief under his cousin Chief Walkara when the Mormon pioneers first arrived in Timpanogos territory. He was one of the principal clan leaders over a band in southern Utah Valley, along with Chief Peteetneet and Grospene. He was a grandson of Turunianchi, who was the leader when the Timpanogos first contacted the Europeans during the Dominguez‚ÄìEscalante Expedition. Turunianchi's grandsons made up the royal line of \\"brothers\\" (even though they were cousins) referred to by Brigham Young.Timpanogos Tribe: History Tabby-To-Kwanah means \\"Child of the Sun.\\" Tabiona, Utah is named after him. After the Mormon pioneers established Fort Utah along the Provo River in the northern part of Utah Valley, there began to be significant conflict between the pioneers and the tribe that lived along the Provo River. In February 1850, Brigham Young issued an extermination order of the Timpanogos in all of Utah Valley.BYC, Microfilm reel 80, box 47, folder 6. Brigham Young is quoted as stating: \\"I say go [and] kill them. . . . Tell Dimick Huntington to go and kill them‚Äîalso Barney Ward‚Äîlet the women and children live if they behave themselves. . . . We have no peace until the men [are] killed off‚Äînever treat the Indian as your equal.\\" When the Mormon militia attacked the Timpanogos along the Provo River, the main party fled to southern Utah Valley, where Chief Tabby-To-Kwanah's band was situated. The Mormon militia then came to the Timpanogos villages along the Spanish Fork River and the Peteetneet Creek. The Mormons promised to be friendly to the Timpanogos, but then lined up the men to be executed in front of their families. Some attempted to flee across the frozen lake, but the Mormons ran after them on horseback and shot them. At least eleven Timpanogos were killed. Altogether, 102 Timpanogos were killed in the Battle at Fort Utah. The Timpanogos who had died were decapitated and left unburied. When Chief Tabby-To-Kwanah returned with Chief Peteetneet and Grospene, they found the decapitated bodies of their band members and angrily confronted the settlers at Fort Utah. Chief Tabby-To-Kwanah was instrumental in trying to establish peace between the Mormon pioneers and the Timpanogos. He was one of the main chiefs that sat in peace negotiations and signed the Shoshone Goship treaty of peace in 1863 and the Spanish Fork Treaty in 1865.Timpanogos Tribe: Our ancestors When Antonga Black Hawk led the Black Hawk War in Utah, he led the Timpanogos who wanted peace on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. While he strove to have his people follow the terms of the Spanish Fork Treaty, the US government did not follow their side of the treaty, partially because Brigham Young did not have authority to speak for the US government. As a sign of protest, he led the Timpanogos into Thistle Valley in Sanpete County to hunt and dance in the spring of 1872. This made the Americans uneasy, and he was able to get the Americans to fulfill their obligations for that year.
