History Life Time Athletic, Chanhassen, Minnesota Life Time Inc. facility, Alpharetta, Georgia The company was founded by chairman and chief executive officer, Bahram Akradi. The company was incorporated in 1990 as FCA, Ltd., a Minnesota corporation, and registered the name Life Time Fitness in 1992. The first club opened in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. Several locations were added to the Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul area before the chain expanded to suburban communities in other states. Most Life Time Fitness centers are located in exurban or fringe suburban areas in medium to large-sized metropolitan areas, with some locations in central city or inner suburban areas. The oldest facility is in Eagan, Minnesota. In December 2019 they opened up a new facility inside of the Southdale Mall in Edina, Minnesota, replacing the former tenant J.C. Penney. Clubs in more populated affluent metropolitan areas fall under the \\"Life Time Athletic\\" name while others in smaller metropolitan regions are known as \\"Life Time Fitness\\" clubs. In addition to its health clubs, the company has created or acquired, as of 2012, more than 200 annual races in the United States. These include the Life Time Tri Series, the Leadville Race Series, the Chequamegon Fat Tire Festival in Hayward, Wisconsin, the Dirty Kanza gravel bicycle race, and the Miami Marathon. In August 2014, Life Time Fitness, a publicly traded company, considered becoming a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) in response to pressure from its largest shareholder, Marcato Capital Management. In March 2015, Life Time was acquired by private equity firms TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners in a leveraged buyout. Lawsuit Several employees of Life Time Fitness took the firm to court for withholding wages in 2004. In 2009, a court ruled in favor of employees in the case of Baden-Winterwood v. Life Time Fitness Inc., with a judgment that employees must be paid in accordance with federal and state wage-and-hour laws which require overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek.

It is currently listed as endangered, mostly due to bycatch mortality in unrelated fisheries. Description The devil fish is larger than its close relative the lesser devil ray. It grows to a maximum recorded length of , making it one of the largest rays. It possesses a spiny tail. The devil fish is the largest species in the genus Mobula. It is the only mobulid species that lives in the Mediterranean Sea. The species has been observed to have a maximum disk width of 5.2 meters (roughly 17 feet). The species is also considered endangered given its decreasing population density. Distribution and habitat Mobula mobular Devil fish are most common in the Mediterranean Sea and can be found elsewhere in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, off the southwest coast of Ireland and south of Portugal, and possibly in the northwest Atlantic. The species has been recorded in a number of Mediterranean countries such as Croatia, Greece, Italy, and Turkey, which shows that the species has a basin-wide distribution. They predominantly prefer deep waters. Devil fish inhabit offshore areas to the neritic zone, their range as deep as several thousand meters. They are typically observed in small clusters, and may occasionally form larger groups. Giant devil rays are usually seen in deep coastal waters but are occasionally seen in shallow waters. In a tagging experiment conducted by the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA), three giant devil rays were tagged and their depth was observed throughout different times of the day. The rays reached a maximum depth of 600-700 meters (1960-2300 feet) but mostly spent their time between 0 and 50 meters (0 and 165 feet); they prefer warmer waters with a temperature between 20¬∞C and 29¬∞C (68¬∞F and 84¬∞F). The giant devil rays also deep dive at random times, instances not correlated to the time of day unlike how other species deep dive at specific times of day. In other observations studying ray abundance and habitat, giant devil rays were observed alone and occasionally in groups with a maximum of 18 rays. The same study also emphasizes that the rays undergo a species migration across the Mediterranean Sea with the seasons, taking advantage of warm, highly productive waters. Ecology The average lifespan of a giant devil ray is 20 years. It is an epipelagic species. It has a very low reproductive capacity. This means that the species gives birth to a single offspring at unknown intervals. The species is ovoviviparous: the young hatch from their eggs inside the mother's body and emerge later when they are more fully grown. It can be predicted that at the rate that its population is declining now, the population will decline by at least 50% in the next 60 years. This is due to a number of threats including the poor likelihood of recovering from declining populations. Devil rays feed on planktonic crustaceans and small schooling fish, which are trapped using the modified gill covers (branchial plates) responsible for its \\"devil-like\\" silhouette. It mostly eats euphausiid shrimp (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) and small mesopelagic and clupeid fishes.

As a result, it is sensitive to environmental changes. Its population trend is decreasing. Most of the information on the giant devil ray has been gathered through bycatch data because the species has a high bycatch mortality. Giant devil ray mortalities are mostly reported as bycatch from swordfish nets, and occasionally reported as bycatch from longlines, purse seines, trawls, trammel nets, and tuna traps. There are many threats against the giant devil ray such as fishing, resource harvesting (being taken as bycatch in different fisheries), industrial garbage, and solid waste. The main threats to this species come from pollution in the Mediterranean and bycatch capture in various fishing equipment including trawls, tuna traps, and dragnets meant for swordfish. All species of the genus Mobula have been targeted by recreational and commercial fisheries for centuries. Fisheries in Gaza and Egypt are reported to catch giant devil rays for local consumption, and they are reported as bycatch in various places including the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The 2004 IUCN Red List listed the devil fish as a vulnerable species. It was reclassified as endangered in 2006 due to low population resilience coupled with continued high bycatch mortality. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the devil fish as \\"Data Deficient\\" with the qualifier \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. Off of the Adriatic Sea, the giant devil ray is legally protected in Italy and Croatia. Fishing, transportation, landing, and trade of the giant devil ray is forbidden in Albania. The giant devil ray is also protected under the Bern and Barcelona conventions.

It has a wingspan of and a body length of . When perched, this bird appears all black. However, in flight a white rump and flight feathers become visible. Its morphology is comparable to that of other harriers, with a slim body, narrow wings and a long tail. Male and female plumages are similar. Juveniles have buff under- parts and heavily spotted breasts.  Distribution and Migration  In South Africa, the distribution of the black harrier is distinctly polarised in both the Western and Southern coastal plains. Nests are concentrated either along the coastal strip or inland in a more montane habitat. Nests are generally absent from transformed and cultivated lands. There is, however, some evidence from sightings and prey remains that the black harriers do forage in these environments even if they do not breed there. Black harriers are migratory birds and their annual movements cover the southern half of the land surface of South Africa (including Lesotho) however, there is great individual variability. The majority of these birds undertake an unusual west‚Äìeast migration. They begin from their breeding areas in south-western South Africa and migrate towards the Eastern Cape, the south-west region of Kwa-Zulu Natal, the south-west region of Mpumalanga and the north-east region of Lesotho during the summer months. Pair members do not travel together and they don't use the same non-breeding areas either. It has been suggested that black harriers migrate in order to deal with declines in food availability. Unusually, black harriers travel almost twice as fast during their summer post-breeding migration as they during their winter/spring pre-breeding migration. In many other species this is often reported the other way round. One reasoning for this is that it is part of their pre-breeding behaviour and that the extra time is used to find the best breeding areas. Home ranges during the breeding seasons and non-breeding seasons are of similar sizes, suggesting similar levels of food availability. Black harriers show some degree of fidelity to breeding areas (they return to breeding areas they have used previously) as well as natal philopatry (they return to their birthplace to breed) however, large breeding dispersal may also occur.  Diet  The black harrier is a small mammal specialist which feed mostly on small rodents and birds and will occasionally take reptiles, catching them while flying low over its hunting grounds. The Four- striped Mouse, Rhabdomys pumilio, is the main prey. Regional differences in diet have also been recorded with a greater consumption of birds inland than at the coast Variation in diet is thought to be associated with local weather conditions. Early in September the diets are similar however, this then shifts with seasonal changes. Inland, during hot temperatures the proportion of small mammals in the harrier's diet declines, because the hotter temperatures reduce the activity of South African small mammals during the day. Higher temperatures may also lead to poorer environmental conditions for breeding resulting in a decreased abundance of small mammals. The breeding season of the four-striped mouse is only three months in the Karoo (where the inland black harriers are located) rather than six months as in the fynbos (where the coastal black harriers are located). In the Karoo, temperatures can reach almost 40 degrees Celsius during the day in summer. Whilst in coastal regions the proportion of small mammals in the diet increased with higher winter rainfall. This is because the winter rainfall promotes the reproduction of small mammals.  Breeding  The greatest number of breeding pairs can be found in the Western Cape province, South Africa. In this area loose colonies aggregate around coastal wetlands. Breeding in Namibia is suspected but not confirmed. Like other harriers it nests on the ground in tall vegetation. Egg laying takes place from June to November with peak laying months in July and September. Two to four eggs are laid and incubated for 35 days. In a recent study, brood size averaged 2.3 ¬± 1.1 (n = 61 broods) and fledged broods averaged 1.9 ¬± 1.2 (n = 53 broods). Egg hatchability (the proportion of viable eggs in fully incubated clutches) was 74% (n = 25 clutches), and the hatching success (the proportion of eggs that successfully become hatched young) was 63% (n = 48 clutches). A quarter of the nests were subject to nest predation both egg predation and nestling predation. More evidence is needed but it may be that after a breeding year, black harriers take a 'Sabbatical year\\" in reproduction to recover from the physiological stress of breeding.  Conservation Issues   Habitat Loss  The black harrier population has declined in recent years to fewer than 1000 birds, and it is now considered endangered in South Africa, Lesotho and Namibia. This is due to the destruction of its original breeding habitat, South Africa's natural shrubland, the fynbos, which has been greatly reduced by encroaching cereal culture and urban expansion as well as the invasion of alien plant species. Because of this, the black harriers have been displaced from their lowland Renosterveld and Fynbos habitats into a more montane habitat which unlike the Renosterveld and Fynbos is not characterised by foraging and nesting opportunities. The harriers in the montane environments are not as successful as those along the coastal strip which has fynbos, they breed poorly, take a wide range of prey and are subject to high levels of nest predation. Breeding at coastal sites is more successful than breeding at montane sites as they start breeding earlier, hatch larger broods and fledge more young. They are also subject to lower levels of nest predation. This land transformation has therefore negatively effected the black harriers  Pollutants  Carotenoids are pigments which are responsible for the yellow, orange and red coloration of traits such as the eye and plumages, displayed by many avian species. These play a large role in bird communication and social interactions. In nestlings these colourations likely play a role in parent off-spring communication. For example, for parents to assess nestling conditions and needs and to then adjust their care and feeding appropriately. Black harriers display carotenoid based colouration from a few days of after birth. These carotenoid pigments cannot be synthesised and need to be ingested by the harriers. Nestlings with a bird rich diet have higher levels of circulating carotenoids and display a greater carotenoud based colouration than those consuming more mammals. However, both circulating carotenoids and carotenoid based colouration have been shown to be affected by non-organic (like heavy metals) and organic (like persistent organic pollutants) contaminants. These pollutants may interfere with the communication processed that rely on carotenoid coloured traits. They may also potentially impose stress that alters nutrient requirements and use. DDT contaminated black harrier nestlings have significantly lower levels of circulating carotenoids and carotenoid-based coloration  References   External links  * Black Harrier - Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds * BirdLife Species Factsheet * Black Harrier videos on the Internet Bird Collection * Black Harrier at Raptors Namibia * Black harrier photos at Fernkloof Nature Reserve black harrier Category:Birds of Southern Africa Category:Birds of prey of Sub-Saharan Africa black harrier ","title":"Black harrier"},{"id":"7192537","text":"Alfred Karl Gabriel Jeremias (24 February 1864 in Chemnitz, Kingdom of Saxony - 11 January 1935) was a German pastor, Assyriologist and an expert on the religions of the Ancient Near East.

A member of the Irish Republican Army and later the Official Irish Republican Army, he was active in politics from the early 1960s and participated in the early years of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. He was shot dead, after being confronted by RUC Special Branch and British paratroopers in 1972. Early life He was born in the Lower Falls area of Belfast, and spent most of his life there and in the nearby Markets area of the city. His mother died when he was four years old leaving behind Joe and three other children. His father remarried having another three children with his second wife. He was educated in the Christian Brothers school on Barrack Street in Belfast, where he developed an interest in the Irish language. A bricklayer by trade, he joined the Fianna √âireann at age 14 and the IRA in the early 1960s. In 1964 he was involved in a riot on Divis Street in Belfast in opposition to the threat from loyalist leader Ian Paisley to march on the area and remove an Irish tricolour flying over the election office of Billy McMillen. In 1965 he was arrested for the possession of bayonets with five other men. The five refused to answer questions in custody or to speak in court and were sentenced to a three years in prison. They served nine months in Crumlin Road jail. He had expressed an interest in the priesthood while a teenager and became more religiously committed in prison. He joined the Third Order of Saint Francis in his later teens. McCann was active in the IRA's involvement in the civil rights activism, protesting against the development of the Divis Flats which were being built to replace the old tenement slums in the Lower Falls. McCann became Officer Commanding (O.C.) of the IRA in the Markets, involved in housing issues and any matters which related to local government. In 1969, after sectarian rioting in Belfast, the IRA split into two factions: the newly created Provisional Irish Republican Army, traditionalist militarists, and the existing organisation, which became known as the Official IRA, Marxist-Leninist-oriented socialists. McCann sided with the Officials as he felt they had a better political analysis. His brothers Dennis, Patrick and Brian, also joined the OIRA. Personal life McCann married Anne McKnight who hailed from a strong republican family in the Markets area in Belfast. Anne's older brother, Bobby, was part of the 1956‚Äì62 border campaign and was arrested and jailed, as well as later being interned. Anne's brother Se√°n sided with the Provisionals after the 1969 split, and went on to represent South Belfast for Sinn F√©in. IRA activities McCann was appointed commander of the OIRA's Third Belfast Battalion. By 1970, violence in Northern Ireland had escalated to the point where British soldiers were deployed there in large numbers. From 3‚Äì5 July 1970, McCann was involved in gun battles during the Falls Curfew between the Official IRA and up to 3,000 British soldiers in the Lower Falls area that left four civilians dead from gunshot wounds, another killed after being hit by an armoured car and 60 injured.Patrick Bishop, Eamon Mallie, The Provisional IRA (1988), p159 On 22 May 1971, the first British soldier to die at the hands of the Official IRA, Robert Bankier of the Royal Green Jackets was killed by a unit led by McCann. McCann's unit opened fire on a passing British mobile patrol near Cromac Square, hitting the patrol from both sides. He was the fourth British soldier to die on active service & the seventh overall since the conflict began.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald, INLA ‚Äì Deadly Divisions, 1994, p. 10 In another incident, McCann led a unit which captured three UVF members in Sandy Row. The UVF had raided an OIRA arms dump earlier that day and the OIRA announced they would execute the three prisoners if the weapons were not returned. McCann eventually released the three UVF members because they were \\"working class men like yourself\\". His most famous act came on 9 August 1971 when his unit took over the Inglis bakery in the Markets area and fortified it after the introduction of internment without trial by the Northern Ireland authorities (see Operation Demetrius). They defended it throughout the night from an incursion by 600 British soldiers, looking to arrest paramilitary suspects.Jack Holland, Henry McDonald, Deadly Divisions, p10 The action allowed other IRA members to slip out of the area and avoid arrest. He was photographed during the incident, holding an M1 carbine, against the background of a burning building and the Starry Plough flag, one of the most striking early images of The Troubles. In early February 1972, he was involved in the attempted assassination of Ulster Unionist politician and Northern Ireland Minister for Home Affairs John Taylor in Armagh City, outside the then Hibernian Bank on Russell Street. McCann and another gunman fired on Taylor's car with Thompson submachine guns, hitting him five times in the neck and head, but he survived, though badly injured. In another incident he and a comrade were standing outside a Belfast cinema to purchase tickets for the film Soldier Blue when McCann spotted a British Army checkpoint. Death McCann was killed on 15 April 1972 in Joy St in The Markets. He had been sent to Belfast by a member of the Dublin command as he was at the top of the RUC Special Branch wanted list. He was told by the Official IRA Belfast command to return for his own safety to Dublin. However he ignored their requests and remained in Belfast. The RUC Special Branch was aware of his presence in Belfast and were on the look out for him. On the morning of his death, he was spotted by an RUC officer who reported his whereabouts to the British Parachute Regiment, who were carrying out a road block in the immediate area at the time. McCann was approached by the RUC officer who informed him that he was under arrest. McCann was unarmed and tried to run to evade arrest when confronted by the soldiers. He was shot dead at the corner of Joy Street and Hamilton Street after a chase on foot through the Markets. Ten cartridge cases were found close to his body, indicating that he had been shot repeatedly at close range. Bullet holes were also visible in the walls of nearby houses.Holland, McDonald, Deadly Divisions, p11 McCann was the leader of the most militant of the OIRA's members in Belfast and was much more enthusiastic about the use of \\"armed struggle\\" in Northern Ireland than the OIRA leadership. His killing was closely followed by the organisation calling a ceasefire. As a result, it was rumoured that the reason that McCann was unarmed when he was killed was that the Official leadership had confiscated his personal weapon, a .38 pistol. Some former OIRA members have even alleged that McCann's killing was set up by their Dublin leadership.Holland, McDonald, p11 Five days of rioting followed his death. Turf Lodge, where McCann lived, was a no-go area and was openly patrolled by an OIRA land rover with the words \\"Official IRA ‚Äì Mobile Patrol\\" emblazoned on the side. The OIRA shot five British soldiers, killing three, in revenge for McCann's killing, in different incidents the following day in Belfast, Derry and Newry. Funeral and tributes McCann's funeral on 18 April 1972 was attended by thousands of mourners. A guard of honour was provided by 20 OIRA volunteers and a further 200 women followed carrying flowers and wreaths. Four MPs including Bernadette Devlin were also in attendance. Cathal Goulding the Official IRA Chief of Staff, provided the graveside oration in Milltown Cemetery. Goulding said; \\"By shooting Joe McCann [the British Government] their Whitelaws and their Heaths and their Tuzos have shown the colour of their so called peace initiatives. They have re-declared war on the people...We have given notice, by action that no words can now efface, that those who are responsible for the terrorism that is Britain's age old reaction to Irish demands will be the victim of that terrorism, paying richly in their own red blood for their crimes and the crimes of their imperial masters\\".Holland, McDonald, p. 14 In spite of this hardline rhetoric, however, Goulding called a ceasefire just six weeks later, on 29 May 1972. One of the more surprising tributes to McCann came from Gusty Spence, leader of the Ulster Volunteer Force loyalist group. Spence wrote a letter of sympathy to McCann's widow, expressing his, \\"deepest and profoundest sympathy\\" on the death of her husband. \\"He was a soldier of the Republic and I a Volunteer of Ulster and we made no apology for being what we were or are...Joe once did me a good turn indirectly and I never forgot him for his humanity\\". This is thought to refer to an incident in which three UVF men wandered into the Lower Falls, were captured by OIRA men, but were released unharmed on McCann's orders.Bishop, Mallie, p238-239 In 1997, a plaque was unveiled at the spot on Joy street in the Markets where McCann was killed. Members of the various republican factions, the Workers' Party of Ireland (ex Official IRA), Sinn F√©in (political wing of the Provisional IRA) and the Irish Republican Socialist Party (a splinter, along with the Irish National Liberation Army from the Official republican movement in 1974) were all in attendance. A ballad about Joe McCann has been authored in tribute by Eamon O‚ÄôDoherty. Inquiry and trial A Historical Enquiries Team investigation into the killing of Joe McCann found it was unjustified. The report stated: \\"The HET considers that Joe's actions did not amount to the level of specific threat which could have justified the soldiers opening fire in accordance with the Army Rules of Engagement or their standard operating procedures.\\" The report was welcomed by his wife and children.http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/22675 1972 Killing of Joe McCann 'unjustified', Mark Moloney, An Phoblacht, 29 January 2013 Two British soldiers, currently known as Soldier A, aged 67, and Soldier C, 65, were arrested and were charged in December 2016 for his murder.

Lady was arrested in Panama on July 18, 2013. He had been a fugitive from Italian police after being convicted of kidnapping Nasr in February 2003, in what the Italian press are referring to as the Imam Rapito (or \\"kidnapped imam\\") affair. He was released on July 19, 2013, and immediately boarded a flight directed to the United States. Background Lady grew up in Honduras and became a New Orleans Police Department police officer in the 1970s. The Imam Rapito affair Italian authorities proved in court that in 2003, Lady helped a team of CIA agents kidnap Nasr (see extraordinary rendition) as he walked to his mosque in Milan for noon prayers. Lady is said to have travelled to Egypt soon after the operation, where Nasr was interrogated and tortured. Lady initially claimed diplomatic immunity in an effort to avoid judicial proceedings against him in Italy, but in November 2005, an Italian judge rejected this request, stating that Lady had forfeited his immunity when he retired from the CIA, and also that the alleged abduction was in any case a crime serious enough to disqualify him from immunity. Lady, and his wife Martha, retired to northern Italy, near Asti, in September 2003. When the Italian police raided his home in June 2005, Lady was not there. Since that time there are reports that he is living in Honduras or the United States. 2007 indictment In January 2007, an Italian court ordered Lady's home in the Piedmont region of Northern Italy seized to cover court costs. On February 16, 2007, an arrest warrant was issued for Lady for the kidnapping of Abu Omar. An Italian prosecutor, Armando Spataro, was scheduled to begin trying the case in June 2007. Lady's Italian lawyer, Daria Pesce, withdrew from the case shortly after the beginning of legal proceedings, saying her client refused to cooperate with the court proceedings because he believed the matter should be settled through a political, rather than legal solution. Lady dismissed his attorney soon afterwards, although the court in Milan has appointed a public defense attorney for him. The trial against Lady and the other US defendants began in absentia later that month, although it was quickly adjourned until October 2007. In an interview with GQ Magazine in March 2007, Lady said of his superiors at the CIA that \\"the agency has told me to keep quiet and let this blow over.\\" 2009 Interview In June 2009, Robert Seldon Lady was quoted by Il Giornale as saying of the kidnapping, > I'm not guilty. I'm only responsible for carrying out orders that I received > from my superiors ... When you work in intelligence, you do things in the > country in which you work that are not legal. It's a life of illegality ... > But state institutions in the whole world have professionals in my sector, > and it's up to us to do our duty. He said of Abu Omar's abduction, \\"Of course it was an illegal operation. But that's our job. We're at war against terrorism.\\" 2009 Conviction On November 4, 2009, Italian Judge Oscar Magi convicted Lady, along with 22 other accused CIA employees, of kidnapping, handing down an eight-year sentence. The New York Times called this decision a \\"landmark ruling\\" and an \\"enormous symbolic victory\\" for Italian prosecutors because it \\"was the first ever to contest the United States practice of rendition, in which terrorism suspects are captured in one country and taken for questioning in another, presumably one more open to coercive interrogation techniques.\\" On July 18, 2013, according to the Italian Justice Ministry, Lady was arrested in Panama. He was released the next day. See also * The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, a 1974 book on the culture of lawlessness in the CIA. *Eliana Castaldo *Joseph L.

Overview A related school of thought is the Bible-Babel school, which regarded the Hebrew Bible and Judaism to be directly derived from Mesopotamian (Babylonian) mythology; both are forms of hyperdiffusionism in archaeology. Both theories were popular in Germany, and Panbabylonism remained popular from the late 19th century to World War I. Prominent advocates included Friedrich Delitzsch, Peter Jensen, Alfred Jeremias and Hugo Winckler.Gold, Daniel. (2003). Aesthetics and Analysis in Writing on Religion: Modern Fascinations.

Kanarc Books. p. 18. Panbabylonist thought largely disappeared from legitimate scholarship after the death of one of its greatest proponents, Hugo Winckler. The claims of the school were largely discredited by astronomical and chronological arguments of Franz Xaver Kugler (a Jesuit priest).Jong, Teije de.

Cash balls The earliest type was a two-piece hollow wooden ball which ran along sloping rails, carrying cash and sales docket or receipt. One set of rails sloped down from sales desk to cash office and another set sloped in the opposite direction. This was known as a cash railway. William Stickney Lamson of Lowell, Massachusetts patented this system in 1881. His invention soon attracted the interest of other shopkeepers and in 1882 the Lamson Cash Carrier Company was incorporated in Boston. A working example can be seen in the Co-operative store at Beamish Museum in North East England and one is still in its original location in the Up-To-Date Store, now a museum, at Coolamon, New South Wales.  Wire carriers  Rapid Wire carrier in Dartford Museum, Kent The next type was a carriage suspended on pulleys from a wire between sales desk, launched from a catapult. The best-known types were \\"Rapid Wire\\" and \\"Air-Line.\\" ; Air-Line Company: The Air-Line Company was based in the United States. It manufactured a Gipe designed system. A cord passed over multiple pulleys to propel the car. Lamsons took over Air-Line and cars usually have \\"Air-Line\\" on one side and \\"Lamson\\" on the other. ; Baldwin: Baldwins were based in Chicago. Their cash carrier systems were usually known as \\"Baldwin Flyers\\". ; British Cash & Parcel Conveyors: A British competitor to Lamson which eventually was subsumed. ; Dart Cash: Dart Cash was a British company established by a grocer from Stoke on Trent, William Alfred Edwards. It was a simple gravity carrier patented in 1918. Later enhancements included a spring for propulsion. As well as wire systems, Dart also made Pneumatic cash carriers. ; Gipe: Gipe were an American company founded by Emanuel Clarence Gipe of Freeport, Illinois. Gipe installations were popular in England. ; Lamson: The Lamson Company dominated the market. It was known at various times as the Lamson Cash Carrier Company, the Lamson Cash Railway Company, the Lamson Store Service Company, the Lamson Consolidated Store Service Company, the Lamson Company Inc. and in the UK the Lamson Engineering Company Ltd. Lamsons purchased the Rapid Service Store Railway Company of Detroit which licensed an invention by Robert McCarty of Detroit, Michigan and their system became known as Lamson Rapid Wire. They also made cable systems and pneumatic tube systems. ; Sturtevants: Sturtevants of Boston, Massachusetts was an offshoot of an American company. They purchased part of Reid Brothers around the early 1920s and the pneumatic tube business of Cooke, Troughton and Simms. In 1949 they sold up to Lamson.The Times, 27 April 1950  Pneumatic tube systems  Several of the above companies also made pneumatic tube systems - see Lamson tube. They are still installed in a few shops. Modern pneumatic tube systems are also now used in supermarkets for moving cash in bulk from tills to the central cash office.

History  The Association for Project Management was founded in 1972 as the UK branch of INTERNET, now the International Project Management Association. Weaver (2007) recalled, that: :\\"The UK branch of INTERNET (now the APM), was originated by the ‚Äòpioneering seven‚Äô whose meeting at an INTERNET (later IPMA) expert seminar in Zurich in 1971 inspired them to start a UK branch, which held its first meeting in London in May 1972. The first executive meeting on INTERNET(UK) was held in the lobby of the Sheraton Hotel, Stockholm on 13 May 1972 during the 3rd annual world congress of INTERNET.

Topics   Qualifications  APM Qualifications are designed with the intention of demonstrating to employers, clients and suppliers that the recipient is a skilled and committed project professional. Through alignment with the four level certification programme of the International Project Management Association (IPMA) they also aim to provide international recognition. Membership grades and Qualifications are not automatically linked. The 4-level certification programme comprises: * Project Fundamentals Qualification, or PFQ (formerly known as Introductory Certificate), to assess fundamental knowledge of project management and professional practice. This is assessed by a multiple-choice test. * Project Management Qualification, PMQ (formerly APMP), at SCQF Level 7, testing a broader range of knowledge, comprehension and basic skills. This is comparable to, though not equivalent to the PRINCE2 qualification. The qualification is assessed by means of a written paper. * Project Professional Qualification, PPQ (was Practitioner Qualification) at IPMA Level C. There are two pathways to this, one involving interviews and workshops; the other by classroom (or equivalent study) and a series of assessments against the various PPQ (subject area) modules. * Registered Project Professional (previously Certificated Project Manager), at IPMA Level B, providing recognition to qualified and experienced project managers. The qualifications were rebranded in 2016.  Risk Certificate  The APM Project Management Risk Single Subject Certificate, also known as the Risk Certificate, is a two level qualification which focuses on the project management subject of risk management. Level 1 assesses knowledge of risk management, to the degree that a candidate may be able to contribute to project risk management; Level 2 additionally assess understanding and capability of risk management, to the degree that a candidate may be able to formally undertake project risk management. Level 1 is assessed by a one-hour- long, 60 question, multiple-choice examination. Level 2 is assessed by a 3-hour and 15 minute written examination, consisting of three questions: one compulsory question and two questions selected from four optional questions. Level 1 is not a pre-requisite for Level 2, and the Level 2 certificate can be obtained without having the Level 1 certificate. However, the Level 2 certificate examination assumes that the candidate has the prior knowledge required to pass the Level 1 certificate examination. Registered training providers offer training as well as the opportunity to sit both levels of the exam. An Open Exam for either level may also be taken directly with the APM.  APM Body of Knowledge +  The APM Body of Knowledge defines the breadth of the project, programme and portfolio management profession. It makes up one of the FIVE Dimensions of Professionalism. APM has created a unique online resource that allows its users to contribute to the organic growth of the APM Body of Knowledge. This is a growing resource from the Association for Project Management featuring definitions, discussions, case studies and articles on all areas of projects, programmes and portfolios.  Award  The APM Project Management Awards recognise what people can achieve through project management and have been celebrating excellence in the profession for over 20 years. The robust judging criteria recognise the broadening range of possibilities within project management. With a focus on achievement; the judging criteria put an emphasis on the outputs and outcomes of projects; what they aim to achieve and what their success gives back to the profession.

Biography Born in Pozuelo de Calatrava (Ciudad Real), Spain, son of the Madrilenian doctor Ildefonso de la Fuente Villanueva and Pozuelo de Calatrava native Anastasia Ramona Morales Hornero, he was the second of nine children, of whom only four reached adulthood. He began training as a priest by studying Latin in Moral Calatrava, and completed his studies in the seminaries of Toledo and Ja√©n. During breaks in these studies, he sent an insect, identified by him as Pycnogaster graellsi (an orthopteran in the subfamily Bradyporinae), to Ignacio Bolivar Urrutia, professor of entomology at the . Urrutia, after confirming Morales's accurate identification, sent him three trays of insects to encourage him in his investigations and to identify new species that he might find. That excited the scientific sense of the young seminarist, and so started him on the path which led to his becoming one of the European leaders in entomology. He was a priest in Ciudad Real in 1879, and he moved to Almagro in 1888. There he dedicated himself to adding to his collection of reptiles and amphibians and composed a booklet of poetry that is conserved in the Museum of Ciudad Real. After about a year in Ciudad Real he became co-assistant of the parish of San Bartholomew between 1890 and 1891. Finally he fulfilled his great desire, expressed in his poetry, to return as a priest to his town, Pozuelo de Calatrava, where he was assigned permanently. He began intensive entomological activity, for which he learned different languages in order to understand the specialized bibliography. There he also completed an important library specializing in entomology of more than four hundred volumes in several languages and an important collection of insects that is also conserved with other works in the Museum of Ciudad Real. Two years later, the arrived in Pozuelo to begin a collaboration. The first communication appeared in the Actas of 1893, with the description of two new species of Orthoptera. A visit to the bath of Archena in Murcia because of his rheumatism led to his discovery of a great number of new species. In 1897, he began to publish Datos para la fauna de la provincia de Ciudad Real.

Taking from his own website, Matthew Burtner \\"explores environmental systems (ecoacoustics), technological embodiment, and extended polyrhythmic and noise-based musical systems. His instrumental and computer music is performed widely and he tours regularly with the metasaxophone, an augmented computer instrument of his own creation.\\" His most recent work at the University of Virginia includes MICE, the mobile interactive computer ensemble. Life and music Born into a fishing family, Burtner heard music in the ice and snow melting as well as other nature sounds. Once into grade school, he began learning the saxophone, playing in jazz bands, school bands and performance groups throughout his young years. In college, he studied philosophy, composition, saxophone and computer music at St. Johns College, Tulane University (BFA 1993), Iannis Xenakis's UPIC Studios, the Peabody Institute of JHU (MM 1997), and Stanford University's CCRMA (DMA 2002). At Stanford he studied and worked closely with Max Mathews, Jonathan Harvey, Brian Ferneyhough and Jon Berger. Burtner is currently Professor of composition and computer music at the University of Virginia where he is Associate Director of the VCCM Computer Music Center and the Chair of the University of Virginia's Music Department. He was an Invited Researcher at IRCAM/Centre Pompidou in Paris in 2005, an Artist in Residence at the Cite International des Arts in Paris, as well as Composer-in-Residence at Musikene in San Sebastian, Spain. There are many works by Burtner, including music and sound art for instrumental ensembles, digital sound and multimedia, as well as pieces that he performs on the Metasax. Excerpts of his music can be heard in the \\"Listening Room\\" on his website. They are also available on several published recordings. Metasax Burtner developed the Metasaxophone in 1999. The Metasax, an acoustic tenor saxophone retrofitted with an onboard computer microprocessor, and an array of sensors that convert performance data into independent continuous control messages for a computer. It is also with a unique microphone system allowing for detailed control of the amplified sound. While maintaining full acoustic functionality, the metasax is a versatile computer controller and an electric instrument. Ecoacoustics Musical Ecoacoustics is an approach to embedding environmental systems into musical and performative structures using new technologies. It draws on techniques of sonification, acoustic ecology and soundscape composition (Truax, Westerkamp, Keller and others). The data from nature may be audio information from wind or ocean waves, or it may be some measurable parameter such as temperature, geological change, etc. Burtner's instrumental and electroacoustic music draws environment into the musical structure, and attempts to decentralize human notions of time and form, searching for more universal, ecology-centered forms.

To make hirayachi, one should mix wheat flour, an egg, salt, and soup stock lightly, while letting water in little by little. Next, put leeks cut around three centimeters, and stretch it out thinly in the frying pan in oil on medium fire. Finally, when holes appear on the surface, bake it light brown. Tuna, corned beef, Mozuku (a family of seaweed), Goya, and so on can be added. It is also made with very simple materials such as leeks and green onions at home. The surface is crisp and fragrant, and the texture is chewy. It is classic to eat hirayachi with the Worcestershire sauce in Okinawa. Because it is made easily by using one frying pan, Okinawan people often make it if they cannot go out, such as when a typhoon hits. The taste is not decorated, and not flashy, so many people of Okinawa feel the \\"taste of home\\" or \\"mother of taste\\" in Hirayachi.

The operation began during the early hours of 27 September 2006. The stated goal of the operation was to root out corrupt police as well as offer assistance to the residents of the area in rebuilding. An estimated 2,300 Iraqi army troops and 1,000 British soldiers took part in the operations with another 2,000 in close proximity, in preparation for handing over security of the city of Basra to the Iraqi government. Rebuilding The rebuilding portion of the project was primarily carried out by Iraqi engineers with \\"low level immediate impact projects\\" such as school repairs and basic infrastructure such as foot bridges. Other basic tasks include street cleaning and fixing of street lights, fixing power cables and improving water systems. Midterm programs include hospital repairs and renovation as well as distribution of educational materials. Long term civil programs include the restoration of the local farm plantations. Military aspect The military aspect was to remove, to root out the corruption that plagued the Iraqi police as Shi'ite militias began infiltrating them. Forces consisting of \\"transition teams\\" of Royal Military Police were planned to be inserted into local police stations looking for those \\"unable or unwilling to perform their duties\\", the teams to operate in each station for up to 30 days. Although comparisons have been made with the U.S. and Iraqi security drive in Baghdad named \\"Operation Together Forward\\", where the militias are first removed and then civil affairs projects follow, the problems in Basra were significantly different; with an almost wholly Shia population, the sectarian violence and Sunni insurgency seen in Baghdad are not major issues, but criminality and factional in- fighting were. During the operation there were numerous insurgent attacks on the British and other coalition forces that resulted in casualties. Timeline While the operation was ongoing a bus carrying seventeen police trainers was stopped near Basra on 29 October, and all of the occupants kidnapped. All seventeen were found executed four hours later. A police chief from the Serious Crime Unit was arrested on 22 December, along with six other officers. It is thought that he led the death squad responsible for the killing of the trainers. On 25 December 2006 British forces backed up by the Iraqi army attacked the headquarters of the Serious Crime Unit in Basra after intelligence was received that corrupt police officers were preparing to execute all 127 prisoners kept there. The British destroyed the building killing seven gunmen.\\"UK troops storm Iraqi police HQ\\", BBC All of the prisoners were rescued, some reportedly showing signs of torture. On 28 January 2007, acting on intelligence, British soldiers conducted dawn raids in Az Zubayr, near Basra. Ammunition, light rockets, bomb-making paraphernalia, radio equipment and timer units were discovered at a house. Around 500 mortar rounds were later seized from a compound where troops had earlier spotted men transferring weapons into two vehicles. Up to five militants were captured. On 18 February 2007, the operation ended, and almost immediately British prime minister Tony Blair stated in a televised address that in the coming months 3,000 of the more than 7,000 British troops will be withdrawn from Iraq.\\"Blair to Announce Iraq Withdrawal Plan\\", THOMAS WAGNER, The Associated Press, Wednesday, 21 February By July 1,500 troops were withdrawn but the new British prime minister Gordon Brown stated that no more troops would be coming out of Iraq, saying that if any more troops would withdraw the remaining soldiers would not be able to defend themselves.

He founded the Sultanate of Banten, as well as the Sultanate of Cirebon on the north coast of Java. Gunungjati was born Syarif Hidayatullah ( ) in 1448 CE, the child of a dynastic union between Syarif Abdullah Maulana Huda, an Egyptian of Hashemite descent, and Nyai Rara Santang, daughter of Prabu Siliwangi, King of Sunda (Pajajaran). As such, Syarif Hidayatullah could claim descent, on his paternal side, from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and on his maternal side, a Hindu Devaraja of the Sunda Kingdom. There is much historical uncertainty as to his early life and later career in the Indonesian Archipelago. Some say that he was born in Pasai, one of the earliest centres of Islam in Southeast Asia; whilst others say that he was born in Pajajaran, capital of his maternal grandfather's Kingdom of Sunda. He is reported to have married a sister of Trenggono, Sultan of Demak, and to have led military expeditions for Demak against Sunda. As Fatahillah - so the story goes - he defeated the Portuguese at their base in Sunda Kelapa, and renamed it Jayakarta in 1527. To this day, his victory over the Portuguese is commemorated as the official anniversary of the founding of Jakarta. The many conflicting stories about Sunan Gunungjati led some scholars to conclude that he might be a conflation of more than one historical figure.Sejarah Indonesia: Wali Songo  Education  Syarif Hidayatullah studied Islam under the guidance of venerated scholars in Egypt, some of whom probably included leading Sufis, during his fourteen years of peregrinations overseas. It is assumed that he must have also undertaken his pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.  Leadership  Sunan Gunungjati was the only one of the Wali Songo to have assumed a sultan's coronet. He used his kingship - imbued with the twin authority of his paternal Hashemite lineage and his maternal royal ancestry - to propagate Islam all along the Pesisir, or northern coast of Java.  Proselytization  In dawah (Islamic proselytization), Gunungjati upheld the strict methodology propagated by Middle Eastern sheikhs, as well as developing basic infrastructure and building roads connecting isolated areas of the province. He and his prince Maulana Hasanuddin took part in several expeditions, particularly in Banten; the leader of Banten later voluntarily submitted the leadership of the region to Sunan Gunungjati but was eventually appointed as the new leader of the province which later became the kingdom of Banten. Around the age of 89, Sunan Gunungjati started to focus on dawah and began moves to appoint a successor. Pangeran (Prince) Pasarean later became the new king.  Death  thumb In 1568 Sunan Gunungjati died at the age of 120 in Cirebon.\\"Graveyard Mountain Sembung\\"\\"Cirebon\\" He was buried in Gunung Sembung, Gunung Jati, around 5 km to the north of the town centre of Cirebon. His tomb has become one of Java's most important pilgrimage points. The tomb enclosure is embedded with porcelain plates, which are replaced with new pieces bought by well wishers. Today the pieces are largely of European or Japanese origin.Schoppert, P., Damais, S., Java Style, 1997, Didier Millet, Paris, p. 49, See also *Islam in Indonesia *The spread of Islam in Indonesia (1200 to 1600) References *Sunyoto, Agus (2014).

It was formed on 1 July 2006 following the mergers of the former West Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (WYMAS), South Yorkshire Ambulance Service (SYAS) and Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service (TENYAS). It is one of ten NHS Ambulance Trusts providing England with emergency medical services, free at the point of care and as part of the National Health Service it receives direct government funding for its role. Services Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust (YAS) serves a population of five million people and employs over 4,500 staff and supported by over 1,000 volunteers. On an average year, YAS will respond to 700,000 emergency calls and conduct one million patient transport journeys. YAS's main roles are to: * receive 999 calls in two Emergency Operations Centres (EOC), based in Wakefield and York, and deploy the most appropriate response to meet patients' needs * respond to 999 calls by getting medical help to patients who have serious or life-threatening injuries or illnesses as quickly as possible * provide the NHS 111 urgent medical help and advice line in Yorkshire and the Humber as well as Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire * take eligible patients to and from their hospital appointments with our non- emergency patient transport service Emergency response In 2013‚Äì14, YAS staff received 795,750 emergency and urgent calls, an average of over 2,180 calls a day. YAS responded to a total of 708,883 incidents by either a vehicle arriving on scene or by telephone advice. Of these, 267,716 were categorised as immediately life-threatening. Like other English ambulance trusts, YAS has experienced year-on-year growth in activity since it was established in 2006; overall response activity was up by 2% from 2012‚Äì13 to 2013‚Äì14. YAS delivered the national emergency response target (75% of immediately life-threatening calls were reached in eightminutes and 95% of these calls within 19minutes) for the third consecutive year in 2013‚Äì14. This was only achieved by YAS downgrading a large number of calls to a less serious category, they are due to be investigated by the CQC for this. NHS 111 Logo for the NHS 111 telephone service YAS runs the NHS 111 service in Yorkshire and the Humber, Bassetlaw, North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. The service took its one millionth call in February 2014 and is one of the highest performing NHS 111 services in England. Up to the end of 2013‚Äì14, the service responded to 1,100,599 calls, 94.9% of which were answered within 60seconds (the national target is 95%). Patient transport service YAS patient transport service (PTS) is the largest ambulance provider of non-emergency transport in Yorkshire and the Humber. In 2013‚Äì14, YAS PTS undertook 886,312 non-emergency journeys. Transport is provided for people who are unable to use public or other transport due to their medical condition. This includes those: * attending hospital outpatient clinics and community-based care * being admitted to or discharged from hospital * needing life-saving treatment such as chemotherapy or renal dialysis University first responders Students from the Hull York Medical School (HYMS) and community first responders (CFR) from across Yorkshire received training from YAS at Hull Royal Infirmary. In 2012, there were 63 medical students who trained as CFR in Hull and York. Following the success of this scheme, a similar scheme-LMSCFR-was launched by medical students from the University of Leeds in December 2016. This scheme now has around 40 volunteer responders from all years of the Leeds undergraduate medical course working to provide responder cover in Leeds, especially within the city centre, Hyde Park and Headingley areas. YAS Community and Commercial Training The YAS Community and Commercial Training Department has provided first aid and other training services to the NHS, local community and many other organisations for over 15 years. Income generated from these commercial activities is used directly to help fund YAS community initiatives in Yorkshire and the Humber. Geography YAS covers the counties of West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire, and North Yorkshire (not including the boroughs of Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland or Stockton-on-Tees, which are covered by the North East Ambulance Service). The headquarters of YAS is located within the Wakefield 41 Business Park to the north of Wakefield city centre and near to junction 41 of the M1 motorway, with a satellite Administration and Control Centre based in Skelton, York; this building was the former headquarters for Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust. Prior to 2019, YAS had another Administration and Control Centre based in Moorgate, Rotherham which was the former headquarters for South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service NHS Trust, having closed the control room there in 2008. Accident and Emergency operations are divided into the following Clinical Business Units (CBUs) almost conterminous with the geographic boundaries: * North Yorkshire * Hull & East Riding of Yorkshire * Airedale, Bradford and Leeds (ABL) * Calderdale, Kirklees and Wakefield (CKW) * South Yorkshire Organisation  Leadership  The Chief Executive is Rod Barnes who was made substantive in his role in May 2015 and prior to this, was the Interim Chief Executive and Executive Director of Finance and Performance. His background is generally finance-based and he has worked in a number of other NHS provider organisations including Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Great Western Ambulance Service. He began his NHS career at Airedale and Harrogate district hospitals and has held a wide variety of leadership positions. He replaced David Whiting, who was Chief Executive between February 2011 and November 2014. Other former Chief Executives were Jayne Barnes OBE (1 July 2006 ‚Äì 14 January 2008) and Martyn Pritchard (15 January 2008 ‚Äì June 2010). Barnes emigrated to Australia to take up the post of Assistant Commissioner of Queensland Ambulance Service (South East region) and Pritchard left to take up a role at the Strategic Health Authority. Previous members of the executive team have left under less than auspicious circumstances. David Forster, the Policy and Strategy Director, resigned his position in 2010 after stating that the NHS employed \\"too many who are lazy, unproductive, obstinate, militant, aggressive at every turn\\" he also claimed some employees \\"couldn't secure a job anywhere outside the bloated public sector where mediocrity is too often shielded by weak and unprincipled HR policies\\". On 8 March 2016, the trust announced that the incumbent Chairman, Della Cannings QPM would be standing down from her position after six years with her final date in office being 9 May 2016. Staff roles YAS employs 4,679 staff, who together with 1,055 volunteers, provide a vital 24-hour emergency and healthcare service. The largest proportion of staff, over 62%, are employed in operational patient-facing roles including Accident and Emergency, Patient Transport Service, NHS 111, Hazardous Area Response Team, Yorkshire Air Ambulance paramedics, Emergency Operations Centre, Resilience and Special Services, Private and Events, Resource and Embrace paediatric and neonatal transport service. There are various job roles which enable the service to operate, here are a few that are directly involved in the frontline and the control room of the service: Emergency Operations Centre Operational A&E; Frontline Operational Patient Transport Services Frontline Patient Transport Services Communications Voluntary Fleet YAS operates just over 500 emergency vehicles which are a mix of Double Crewed Ambulances (DCAs), crewed by two members of staff (usually a qualified Paramedic or Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) working with an Emergency Care Assistant) and Rapid Response Vehicles (RRVs) which are crewed by a single paramedic, EMT or Emergency Care Practitioner. The emergency fleet is primarily made up of Mercedes Sprinter ambulances, Fiat ducato DCAs and Skoda Octavia rapid response vehicles. YAS also has over 450 Patient Transport Service (PTS) vehicles which are operated by around 696 PTS staff. YAS can deploy rescue helicopters, including two Airbus H145s of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance to emergencies and incidents across the service area, however the Air Ambulance Service is a charity and not an integral part of YAS ‚Äì paramedics are provided by YAS and work on a rota with doctors who are voluntary members of the BASICS (British Association for Immediate Care) to offer additional medical skills. The trust entered into a contract with Medical (Europe) of Malton trading as North of England Ambulance Service by which it could call on up to 13 ambulances, each with two crew members, to cover staff shortages in 2012. This contract was ended in early 2014, however YAS has the ability to call on private companies and St John Ambulance to provide cover in times of extreme need, and a long term contract is held with St John to provide fully crewed ambulances to YAS for emergency and non- emergency work. Yorkshire Ambulance Service Charitable Fund YAS has its own Charitable Fund which receives donations and legacies from grateful patients, members of the public and fundraising initiatives throughout Yorkshire. The Charitable Fund exists to support the work of the trust. Key uses of funds include the provision of additional training and equipment for services over and above the level that would normally be delivered as part of core NHS funding. During 2013‚Äì14 and continuing into 2014, the Charitable Fund has been focusing its efforts on raising money for community medical units, which provide on-scene medical treatment for patients with minor injuries and illnesses, and public access defibrillators. History Yorkshire Ambulance Service was formed on 1 July 2006, around the same time as many of the ambulance services in England merged with neighbouring services to become conterminous with the government regions following the 2005 publication of the Taking Healthcare to the Patient: Transforming NHS Ambulance Services report by Peter Bradley CBE. The previous ambulance services are outlined below: West Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service WYMAS was formed in 1974, covering the then new metropolitan county of West Yorkshire and the Craven district of North Yorkshire. It brought together some of the individual city ambulance services which existed across the area and in 1992, it became an NHS trust, providing 24-hour emergency and healthcare services to more than 2.1million people across the region. WYMAS had 21 ambulance stations within its operating area. Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service TENYAS was formed on 1 April 1999, as a merger of the former Cleveland, Humberside and North Yorkshire ambulance services and served the urban areas of Middlesbrough, York and Hull along with the rural areas of the Yorkshire Dales and Yorkshire Wolds. South Yorkshire Ambulance Service SYAS was formed in 1974 as the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service covering the then new metropolitan county of South Yorkshire. On 1 April 1992, it became an NHS trust and served over 1.4million people in an area of over .

According to an ancient origin myth, the Vietnamese people are descended from a dragon and a fairy. Dragon emerging from the clouds, Nguy·ªÖn dynasty (1842) To Vietnamese people, the dragon brings rain, essential for agriculture. It represents the emperor, the prosperity and power of the nation. Like the Chinese dragon, the Vietnamese dragon is the symbol of yang, representing the universe, life, existence, and growth. The legend The 5th-generation grandson of Shennong, L·∫°c Long Qu√¢n, king of the dragonkind living near the ƒê√¥ng sea, married a goddess, √Çu C∆° who was the daughter of the birdkind king ƒê·∫ø Lai. √Çu C∆° bore 100 eggs, which hatched into 100 sons. The first-born son became the king of L·∫°c Vi·ªát, the first dynasty of Vietnam, and proclaimed himself Emperor H√πng V∆∞∆°ng. The First was followed by H√πng V∆∞∆°ng The Second, H√πng V∆∞∆°ng The Third and so on, through 18 reigns. This is the origin of the Vietnamese proverb: \\"Con R·ªìng, ch√°u Ti√™n\\" (\\"Children of Dragon, Grandchildren of Immortal Sages\\"). center Historical development of Vietnamese dragon image Prehistory The Vietnamese dragon is the combined image of crocodile, snake, cat, rat and bird. Historically, the Vietnamese people lived near rivers, so they venerated crocodiles as \\"Giao Long\\", the first kind of Vietnamese dragon. There are some kinds of dragons found on archaeological objects. One group is that of the crocodile-dragons, with the head of a crocodile and the body of a snake. The cat-dragon excavated on a glazed terracotta piece in B·∫Øc Ninh has some features of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát period dragon: it does not have a crocodile head, its head is shorter and it has a long neck, its wing and backfin are long lines, and its whiskers and fur are found in the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát dragon image.  Ng√¥ Dynasty (938‚Äì965)  On the brick from this period found in C·ªï Loa, the dragon is short, with a cat-like body and a fish's backfin.  L√Ω Dynasty (1010‚Äì1225)  The L√Ω Dynasty is the dynasty which laid the foundation of Vietnamese feudal culture. Buddhism was widespread and VƒÉn Mi·∫øu, the nation's first university, was created. The slender, flowing dragon of this period represents the vassal kingdom. These dragons rounded bodies curve lithely, in a long sinuous shape, tapering gradually to the tail. The body has 12 sections, symbolising 12 months in the year. On the dragon's back are small, uninterrupted, regular fins. The head, held high, is in proportion with the body, and has a long mane, beard, prominent eyes, crest on nose (pointing forwards), but no horns. The legs are small and thin, and usually 3-toed. The jaw is opened wide, with a long, thin tongue; the dragons always keep a ch√¢u (gem/jewel) in their mouths (a symbol of humanity, nobility and knowledge). These dragons are able to change the weather, and are responsible for crops.  Tr·∫ßn Dynasty (1225‚Äì1400)  The Tr·∫ßn Dynasty dragon was similar to that of the L√Ω Dynasty but looked more rugged. The Tran dragon had new details: arms and horns. Its fiery crest became shorter. Its slightly curved body became fat and smaller toward the tail. There are many kinds of tail (straight and pointed tail, spiral tail) as well as many kinds of scale (a regular half- flower scale, slightly curved scale). The Tran dragon symbolised the martial arts, because the Tran kings were descended from a mandarin commander. The Tran era was also marked by a series of devastating invasions by the Mongol followed by repeated incursions by Champa.  L√™ - M·∫°c Dynasty  In this period, the Vietnamese dragon's image was evolved into typical form of Vietnam's dragons. Differing from those of the previous dynasty, dragons in this age are not only represented in a curved posture among clouds but also in others. These dragons were majestic, with lion-heads. Instead of a fiery crest, they have a large nose. Their bodies only curve in two sections. Their feet have five sharp claws. Dragon style of Le dynasty  Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty  The dragon form of Nguyen dynasty is the typical dragon of Vietnamese. The dragon is represented with a spiral tail and a long fiery sword-fin. Its head and eyes are large. It has stag horns, a lion's nose, exposed canine teeth, regular flash scale, curved whiskers. Images of the Dragon of the emperor have 5 claws, was also decorated on the crown-prince's gown in motif of \\"dragon's face\\" with 4 claws. Dragons of Nguyen dynasty represent the powerful southern emperors with glory and honor. Typical dragon of Vietnam center  Dragon in literature  One of four dragons in front of Ngu Long Mon Some proverbs and sayings mention dragons but imply something else: \\"R·ªìng g·∫∑p m√¢y\\": \\"Like dragons greeting clouds\\" ‚Äì favourable conditions. \\"ƒê·∫ßu r·ªìng, ƒëu√¥i t√¥m\\": \\"A dragon's head but a shrimp's tail\\" ‚Äì something which starts well but ends badly. \\"R·ªìng bay, ph∆∞·ª£ng m√∫a\\": \\"The dragon flies and the phoenix dances!\\" ‚Äì Used to praise someone's calligraphy who writes Chinese ideograms well. \\"R·ªìng ƒë·∫øn nh√† t√¥m\\": \\"The dragon visits the shrimp's house\\" ‚Äì A saying used to dictate behaviour between a host and their guest: the host must portray themselves like a humble shrimp and their guest like a noble dragon. \\"ƒÇn nh∆∞ r·ªìng cu·ªën, n√≥i nh∆∞ r·ªìng leo, l√†m nh∆∞ m√®o m·ª≠a\\": \\"You consume like a coiled dragon, you talk like a climbing dragon, but your work is like cat's vomit\\" ‚Äì A criticism of someone who talks the talk, but does not walk the walk Vietnamese place-names, and other things, named after dragons Ha Noi (Vietnamese: H√† N·ªôi), the capital of Vietnam, was known in ancient times as ThƒÉng Long (from ThƒÉng, meaning \\"to grow, to develop, to rise, to fly, or to ascend\\" and Long, meaning \\"dragon\\"); the capital is still referred to by this name in literature. In 1010, Emperor L√Ω Th√°i T·ªï moved the capital from Hoa L∆∞ to ƒê·∫°i La, which decision was explained in his Chi·∫øu d·ªùi ƒë√¥ (Royal proclamation of moving capital): he saw a R·ªìng v√†ng (gold dragon) fly around on the clear blue sky, so he changed the name of ƒê·∫°i La to ThƒÉng Long, meaning \\"Vietnam's bright and developed future\\". Furthermore, one of ThƒÉng Long Four Defense Deity (Vietnamese: ThƒÉng Long T·ª© Tr·∫•n) is Long ƒê·ªó Deity (literally: dragon's navel- where is the center, the place that Earth and Sky meet each other- according to orient's view, the belly has a role which is as important as the heart is in western view). Long ƒê·ªó Deity helped L√Ω Th√°i T·ªï to build ThƒÉng Long citadel. Many place-names in Vietnam incorporate the word Long, or R·ªìng (also meaning dragon): H·∫° Long Bay (v·ªãnh H·∫° Long), the section of the Mekong river flowing through Vietnam contains 9 branches and is called C·ª≠u Long (meaning nine dragons); H√†m R·ªìng Bridge, Long Bi√™n Bridge. The city of Da Nang has a bridge shaped like a dragon, facing the sea. Other things named after dragons include: Thanh Long (dragonfruit), v√≤i r·ªìng (waterspout), x∆∞∆°ng r·ªìng (Cactaceae), long nh√£n (dragon eyes: Vietnamese cognate word for longan fruit).

Built in 1862, Dixmont was once a state-of-the-art institution known for its highly self-sufficient and park-like campus, but a decline in funding for state hospitals and changing philosophies in psychiatric care caused the hospital to be closed in 1984. After more than two decades of abandonment, it was finally demolished in 2006. The campus spanned a total of . Reed Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Dorothea Dix Early years The Western Pennsylvania Hospital at Pittsburgh ended its first year of operation in 1853, and it was evident that there were a greater number of patients in jails and almshouses than could be provided for in the 26 beds designated for that express purpose at the hospital. Managers of the hospital used a $10,000 appropriation from the state to purchase a large amount of farmland on a hill overlooking the Ohio River to the north of Pittsburgh in what is now suburban Kilbuck. Planners originally wanted to build the institution in the city, but this idea was rejected by Dorothea Dix. Construction began in 1859, and opened in 1862. A grand ceremony took place on July 19, 1859, where the cornerstone of the Dixmont Kirkbride building was laid in the foundation. A glass jar was placed in the cornerstone containing numerous objects, papers, and a letter from Dorothea Dix herself. Also contained was a copy of her 1845 \\"Memorial\\", the 55-page county by county study of the conditions for the mentally ill in Pennsylvania, which had a great part in jump-starting early mental health care reform in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, when the time capsule was recovered prior to demolition, the jar had broken and many of the contents were in poor condition. The original patient population of the hospital was a meager 113 patients who were transferred from the Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh. Before the 1800s were over, somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 patients called the hospital home. In 1907, the facility was individually incorporated as the Dixmont Hospital for the Insane after separating from the Western Pennsylvania Hospital system. Dixmont was completely self-sustained from the beginning. It had its own farmlands, livestock, rail station, and post office. Also part of the facility was a water treatment plant, a sewage treatment plant, and electricity generating facilities. They had their own butchers, bakers, farmhands, electricians, laborers, pipe fitters, botanists, chefs, and even a barber and a dentist. Financial troubles Like many psychiatric hospitals, Dixmont became overcrowded during the 1920s due to the rise of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients from World War I. The hospital took in as many patients as they could fit until beds lined the hallways, but was eventually forced to stop accepting new admissions. Dixmont began experiencing financial difficulties as early as the Great Depression where they could only afford to supply employees with room and board; no salary. In 1946, the PA Department of Welfare had to step in and Dixmont became a state-owned hospital. During this time, the hospital began using previously decried procedures such as lobotomies, electro-shock therapy, and use of restraints. By the mid-1970s, Dixmont had reached financial crisis due to the state's desire to shut down the hospital. As the concept of deinstitutionalization and use of Thorazine progressed, large state institutions were becoming obsolete and patient numbers decreased rapidly. With the patients' rights movement, they were no longer allowed to work for profit, something which had previously generated the hospital revenue. Many of the buildings were in need of renovation, but state funding was scarce. By 1983, several floors of Reed Hall were empty and unused buildings such as the canteen and men's annex were demolished to prevent fire hazards. In July 1984, the hospital was closed down and the 300 remaining patients were transferred to nearby institutions. Post-closure and demolition The hospital's cemetery Shortly after the hospital's closure, several proposals were made to reuse the facilities; the leading bid was St. John's General Hospital which planned to use the geriatric and infirmary buildings to house a 200-bed nursing home and Reed Hall as independent senior-citizen living. Several proposals were also made to upgrade Dixmont's sewage treatment plant for use with Kilbuck Township. However, none of these plans came to fruition. From 1985 to 1988, Holy Family Institute leased the Cammarata building as a temporary home after their facility was damaged by fire. In the late-1980s, plans were set in place to build a county jail on the site of Dixmont. However, the proposal was unpopular with local residents and the plan was canceled in 1989. By 1999, time and many fires had left the crumbling building useless, and the State sold the property to a private owner. In 2005, a local developer made an agreement to convert the of that land that contained most of the buildings and demolition began in preparation for a shopping center that would be anchored by a Walmart Supercenter. Subsequent excavation destabilized the hillside and landslides covered Pennsylvania Route 65 and the Pittsburgh Line railroad tracks on the Ohio River side, shutting them both down for weeks. After numerous complaints by Kilbuck Township residents for fear of another collapse, due to the instability of the \\"rebuilt\\" landslide as well as interest in the nearby borough of Economy to build a Walmart in order to help revitalize the dilapidated Northern Lights Shopping Center located next door to that proposed Walmart site, Walmart decided not to build on the property on September 26, 2007, and the land will be left to return to nature.kdka.com - Wal-Mart Won't Develop Kilbuck Twp. Site Even if Walmart hadn't bought the property, the Hospital would have likely been demolished anyway, due to teenagers dangerously trespassing on the property on a regular basis as well as the buildings containing both asbestos insulation and lead paint, both of which have since been outlawed for health reasons, and in the case of asbestos, has been getting removed from buildings since the 1980s. In addition, Pennsylvania law prohibits the state from selling grave sites, so the hospital's own cemetery, in which many of the patients were buried with simple stones marked only with index numbers, remains state-owned. The purchasers of the Dixmont property own the log book that identifies the markers with each patient and their number and have made the information available. Buildings An aerial view of Dixmont State Hospital in 2005 prior to its demolition Reed Hall Reed Hall was the main building at Dixmont and was named after the first superintendent of Dixmont, Dr. Joseph A. Reed. It was typical of other Kirkbride facilities with the exception that the outermost wings swept forward instead of to the rear in the typical V-shape. This was to afford a better view of the river valley and better airflow, which was said to be more calming to the patients in keeping with the want of a serene setting. Early on, it had gas lighting, a central hot air system for heat, and more than ample supply of water from the Ohio River. Construction of the west wing was not complete until 1868, at which time construction of the east wing began. The center section of the building contained the front lobby, administrative offices, and chapel. This was mostly destroyed by fire in 1995. Dietary building The dietary building was located directly behind Reed Hall and connected through suspended walkways. Built in the early 1900s and designed by Frederick John Osterling, this building contained the main kitchen at Dixmont, the large freezers, and storage areas where food was kept. The cafeteria and auditorium were located on the second floor. Also part of this building were the loading docks, cleaning supplies, and staff quarters on the third floor. Cammarata Building The Cammarata Building The $2 million Cammarata Building was the geriatric center of Dixmont and housed a significant portion of the hospital's patients towards the final years. Built in 1971, its architecture stylings were modern and sleek compared to the more traditional design of Reed Hall. This building was renovated in 1999 and served as the home to the Glen Montessori School from 2001 until 2012 . It is the only building left of Dixmont that still stands today. Hutchinson Building The Hutchinson Building was built in 1954 and was named after the hospital's late superintendent. Construction started in 1949, but was brought to a halt when the entire foundation slid down the hill, creating a landslide much like the one that occurred in 2006. The construction site was moved to a different location and the building's design had to be altered to prevent further sliding.http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/s_472767.html This building contained the intensive care unit, x-ray facilities, a small cafeteria, barber shop, isolation units, physical therapy areas, and observation rooms, and instrument sterilization equipment. Each floor had patient rooms on the ends of the building surrounding a nurses pod, all separated by half-glass walls so the nurses could easily observe all of the patients. Also in this building were the morgue, laboratory, and autopsy unit. Prior to the demolition of Dixmont, the building was assessed to decide whether it could be reused like the Cammarata Building. However, poor drainage had completely flooded the basement and renovation costs were figured to be greater than the value of the building itself, so it was demolished. Other buildings Reservoir/water treatment plant, smokestack, and boiler building At one point, the Dixmont campus contained over 80 structures. However, in an effort to modernize the hospital, many of the unused and obsolete buildings were demolished in 1967. These included the Men's Annex (which housed many of the patients who were trusted with work details in the further reaches of the property), greenhouses, stables, barns, garages, and many cottages. To the left of Reed Hall stood the maintenance building which housed the carpenters', electrical, and machinist shops, as well as a basketball and shuffleboard court on the upper level. The four-story Industrial Arts building (sometimes referred to as the Garment Building) was built in 1933 and allowed patients to manufacture textiles, shoes, and furniture. Behind the Hutchinson building was the Rosenzweig House, an old white house that originally was home to the hospital's superintendents, but was later used as the security office. Near the service entrance on Ohio River Boulevard was the boiler building, reservoir/water treatment building, coal storage building, laundry building, and the iconic smoke stack. A sewage treatment plant was located adjacent to Tom's Run and still remains today.

Following Ridout, Thomas Clarkson, also a founding member and founder of Clarkson Gordon & Co served as president until 1854. It grew slowly, and had only acquired 60 members by 1856. Until the 1860s, most members were traders, specifically wholesalers. In 1884, it was amalgamated with the Toronto Corn Exchange Association. The Old Toronto Board of Trade Building (1892‚Äì1958), which housed the board, was Toronto's first skyscraper at seven storeys. In 1932‚àí33, the board's name was officially changed to \\"The Board of Trade of Metropolitan Toronto\\". In 2012, the board changed its name to \\"Toronto Region Board of Trade\\".

The 2006 World Solar Rally in Taiwan was a solar vehicle auto race held in September 2006 in Taiwan. Ten teams from five countries, most university-based, competed in a series of races around the island for the trophy. Race The race was preceded by a parade on September 16 through the city of Kaohsiung, followed by a circuit race at Pingtung Airport on September 17, with the actual rally taking place in three stages on the following three days. The total race was about long. Most of the race consisted of untimed transit stages, while the eight timed sections totaled up to about long. The route went past landmarks and cultural destinations including the Shueishang Tropic of Cancer Park in Chiayi County, Lugang Mazu Temple in Changhua County, Da-Jai as Jenlan Temple in Taichung, Chulu Pasture in Taitung, and Fong Kong in Pintong. The terrain on all three days of the rally was very diverse. Most of the first day was on gently curving two-lane roads, and was generally uphill. The first day concluded with a very steep hill climb. The second day's timed stages were on roller-coaster- like four-lane highways, while the third and last day's route was on flat, straight highway. Each day presented its own unique challenges for planning strategy. Results The awards ceremony was held on 21 September. The top three from the circuit race at Pingtung Airport were Sky Ace TIGA from Ashiya University in Ashiya, Japan, Apollo V from the National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences in Taiwan, and Tokai Falcon from Tokai University in Japan. Six teams placed in the rally; the other five did not complete all of the rally and thus could not place. First place went to Ashiya University from Ashiya, Japan. Second place was Apollo V from the National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences; third place was the team from Southern Taiwan University of Technology. Teams Ten teams competed in the event. The National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, who hosted the event, fielded two cars, bringing the total number of cars to eleven. A twelfth car, the #101 from Aurora Vehicle Association in Australia, entered the event but was not able to attend.

It is a known oxidizing agent and produces a green flame when heated, a result of the barium ions. History The first naturally occurring barium chromate was found in the country of Jordan. The brown crystals found perched on host rocks were named hashemite in honor of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The hashemite crystals range in color from light yellowish-brown to a darker greenish-brown and are usually less than 1mm in length.Hauff, Phoebe L; Foord, Eugene E; Rosenblum, Sam; and Hakki, Walid.

The reaction releases oxygen and water. : \\\\mathsf{{4BaCrO4}+2Ba(OH)2 ->[\\\\ce{NaN3}] {2Ba3(CrO4)2} +O_2{\\\\uparrow} + 2H2O{\\\\uparrow}} Common Uses Barium chromate has been found to be useful in many capacities. The compound is often used as a carrier for the chromium ions. One such case is the use of barium chromate as a sulfate scavenger in chromium electroplating baths.Jones, Allen R; Meng, John; Newboy, Kenneth R. (1993) Use of barium chromate as a sulfate scavenger in chromium electroplating baths\\" US Patent No. 5207890 A. Over time the chromium concentration of the bath will decrease until the bath is no longer functional. Adding barium chromate enhances the life of the bath by adding to the chromic acid concentration. Barium chromate is an oxidizing agent, making it useful as a burn rate modifier in pyrotechnic compositions. It is especially useful in delay compositions such as delay fuses.Espagnacq, Andre; Morand, Philippe. (1997) \\"Pyrotechnic composition for delay fuses\\" EP Patent No 0630876 B1. Barium chromate is used as a corrosion inhibitive pigment when zinc-alloy electroplating surfaces.Fountoulakis, Stavros G; Humayan, Arif; Lezzi, Robert A. (1985) \\"Electroplated product and method\\" EP Patent No. 0140564 A2. When mixed with solid fumaric acid, barium chromate can be used in the removal of impurities and residual moisture from organic dry-cleaning solvents or from petroleum fuels.Jackson, Herman R. (1993) \\"SOlid fumaric acid-solid barium chromate catalyst for removing impurities and residual moisture and method for its use\\" US Patent No. 5154726 A. Barium chromate is also used in the composition of a catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation.Ruettinger, Wolfgang; Jacubinas, Richard. (2013) \\"Chromia Alumina Catalysts for Alkane Dehydrogenation\\" US Patent No. 20130072739 A1. Barium has also been used to color paints. The pigment known as lemon yellow often contained barium chromate mixed with lead sulfate.Douma, M. curator. (2008) Pigments through the Ages. Institute for Dynamic Educational Development. http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/ Due to its moderate tinting strength lemon yellow was not employed very frequently in oil painting.K√ºhn, H. and Curran, M., Strontium, Barium and Calcium Chromates, in Artists‚Äô Pigments. A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, Vol. 1: Feller, R.L. (Ed.) Oxford University Press 1986, p. 205 ‚Äì 207. Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet are known to have painted with lemon yellow.Lemon yellow, ColourLex Research In 2004 a method was found for making single- crystalline ABO4 type nanorods. This method consisted of a modified template synthesis technique that was originally used for the synthesis of organic microtubules. Nanoparticles are allowed to grow in the pores of alumina membranes of various sizes. The varying sizes of the pores allow the growth to be controlled and cause the shapes to be reproducible. The alumina is then dissolved, leaving the nanoparticles behind intact. The synthesis can be carried out at room temperature, greatly reducing the cost and constrictions on conditions.Mao, Yuanbing; Wong, Stanislaus S. (2004) \\"General, Room- Temperature Method for the Synthesis and well as Arrays of Single-Crystalline ABO4‚àí Type Nanorods.\\" J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126(46), 15245-15252. In 2010, a study was conducted on four hexavalent chromium compounds to test the carcinogenic effects of chromium. The chromium ions accumulate in the bronchial bifurcation sites, settling into the tissue and inducing tumors. Using zinc chromate as a standard, it was discovered that barium chromate is both genotoxic and cytotoxic. The cytotoxicity was determined to most likely be a result of the genotoxicity, but the cause of the genotoxicity is yet unknown.Wise, Sandra S; Holmes, Amie L; Qin,Qin; Xie, Hong; Kafsifis, Spiros P; Thompson, W Douglas; Wise, John Pierce Sr. (2010) \\"Comparative Genotoxicity and Cytotoxicity of Four Haxevalent Chromium Compounds in Human Bronchial Cells.\\" Chem. Res. Toxicol. 23, 365-372. Safety Barium chromate is toxic. Chromates, when pulverized and inhaled, are carcinogens.

The purchase of C√∫ram was part of the investments IBM is making to support the convergence of health and human services issues and gives healthcare organizations the ability to focus on the ‚Äúwhole individual‚Äù when addressing the causes of health and disease. The commitment is ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù in that it allows IBM customers to implement strategies that improve the health of the population as well as the patient experience while also managing the growth of costs. IBM‚Äôs acquisition of C√∫ram brought enterprise capabilities into IBM‚Äôs broader Smarter Care strategy. At the time of acquisition, IBM‚Äôs software division capabilities expanded significantly when the almost 300 local C√∫ram staff were added to the 1,000 IBM staff already working on software as part of the Smarter Care offerings. These capabilities resulted in C√∫ram being chosen as a key component for New York State‚Äôs Medicaid redesign program.

Biography Boris Brasol was born in Poltava, Ukraine (then part of Imperial Russia), in 1885. His father was the notable homeopath Lev Evgenevich Brasol (aka L√©on Brasol or L√©on Brazol)Under the name L√©on Brasol, Lev was the author of a work titled Samuel Hahnemann: A Sketch of His Life and Career (London: Adland and Son, 1896) (Reprinted from Transactions of the International Homoeopathic Convention, 1896) (1854 - January 1927), who was Superintendent of the Petrograd Homoeopathic Hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. After graduation from the law department of St Petersburg University, Boris served in the Imperial Russian Ministry of Justice, where he took part in the prosecution of the Beilis blood libel case, in which Jewish factory superintendent Menahem Mendel Beilis was accused of ritual murder. In 1912, Brasol was sent to Lausanne to study forensic science. During World War I, Brasol held the rank of Lieutenant in the Tsar's army. In 1916, he was recalled from the front and sent to the US to work as a lawyer for an Anglo- Russian purchasing committee. After the October Revolution in Russia Brasol stayed in the US as an emigrant. During his time in the United States, Brasol was an ardent supporter of restoration of the monarchy in Russia, and served as the official representative of Kirill Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia in the United States. He was a founding member of the Russian Imperial Union Order. Brasol had an extensive publishing career in the United States. He published \\"Socialism vs. Civilization\\" (1920), \\"The World at the Cross Roads\\" (1921), \\"The Balance Sheet of Sovietism\\" (1922), \\"Elements of Crime\\" (1927), and \\"The Mighty Three: Poushkin, Gogol, Dostoievsky\\" (1934).

He is best known for his work with Fleischer Studios and its successor, Famous Studios. Biography Early years Kneitel was born in New York City where he graduated from P.S. 10 in Manhattan and attended the High School of Commerce, taking commercial art courses. He also took evening classes at the National Academy of Design. His father died when Kneitel was still in high school, and he needed work to provide support for his mother and sister. He was able to attend an annex of Commerce HS and work after school and Saturdays for Bray Studios, coloring drawings for Colonel Heeza Liar cartoons. On graduation, he was able to find employment with a small company, L.F. Cornwell, producers of a series called Ebinizer Ebony, which were being made in a now-defunct color process known as Kelly Color. He began as an office boy and within a year was one of their three animators. From 1925 to 1927, he worked as an inbetweener at Max Fleischer's \\"Out of the Inkwell\\" Studio, and was there for two years when he was offered a position at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios in California as a junior writer. Kneitel spent six months at MGM writing sub-titles for silent pictures, but was dismissed when sound pictures arrived. Heading back East he worked briefly for an outfit that produced cartoons based on the popular Joe Jinks comic strips (the cartoons never were seen publicly). In 1928 he worked for six months at Loucks and Norling on industrial films and the Mutt and Jeff series. Fleischer Studios In 1928, Kneitel returned to Fleischer Studios as an inbetweener, staying there for fourteen years (1928‚Äì1942), He was there only about six months when he became an animator, and a year later became a head animator. During his time there he provided animation for many films, including the Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor series, Talkartoons, Screen Songs (with the famous \\"bouncing ball\\"), and the studio's first feature-length film, Gulliver's Travels. In early 1939, Kneitel suffered a heart attack, and was absent from the studio until 1941. Kneitel returned just when Fleischer obtained the right to animate Superman. Kneitel wrote several Superman episodes with Isadore (Izzy) Sparber, and directed one short, The Mechanical Monsters (1941). In January 1942, the Fleischer brothers were forced to resign from the studio they had created; they had borrowed money from Paramount between 1938 and 1941 to finance their expanded Miami facilities and two feature films. After the failure of their second feature, Mister Bug Goes to Town, the studio called in their loans, effectively foreclosing the studio. The successor studio was re-formed by Kneitel, Sam Buchwald and Isadore Sparber and renamed it Famous Studios. Famous Studios Kneitel, Buchwald and Sparber ran Famous Studios for 11 years (1942‚Äì1953), after which Paramount Pictures subsidized the studio, and Kneitel was employed as director of production. Kneitel himself had become one of the most prolific directors of the Popeye shorts and also directed many of the Casper the Friendly Ghost shorts. Famous Studios also created a series called Noveltoons that included the three popular series; Casper the Friendly Ghost, Herman and Katnip and Baby Huey. He produced cartoons until the day he died. Popeye the Sailor TV series In the summer of 1957, Paramount ceased production of theatrical Popeye shorts. King Features Syndicate, aware of the high ratings that the Popeye shorts had earned on television, commissioned a new series of Popeye shorts for syndication in 1960. Kneitel, head of the Paramount Cartoon Studios (renamed from Famous Studios in 1956), supervised one of four animation units assigned to this project. Due to the usage of limited animation, the quality of these films is inferior to those produced by the Fleischer and Famous Studios. Death Kneitel died of a heart attack on July 30, 1964. Three years later, Paramount shut down their animation studio. Kneitel's last cartoon credit was Space Kid (1966). Personal Kneitel was married to Ruth Fleischer, becoming Max Fleischer's son-in-law, Dave Fleischer‚Äôs nephew-in-law, and director Richard Fleischer's brother-in-law. He was also the nephew of musician Sammy Timberg, who wrote many of the scores for Fleischer's cartoons. Kneitel also had a cousin Abner Kneitel, who was the animator and assistant animator for Fleischers and Famous from 1935 to 1944. His son, Tom Kneitel, an avid amateur radio operator (License K2AES), was the founding editor of Popular Communications magazine, and he died on August 22, 2008 at the age of 75. His daughter, Virginia, headed a design and exhibition office for the Smithsonian Institution. Seymour's youngest son, Kenneth, a major collector of vintage material, established and ran the store 'Fandango,' in New York City. Kenneth also designed and published many books, and worked several years for Peter Max.

Production of the car ran between 1938 and 1942 and then, after a brief production run of 20 in early 1945, restarted in mid-1946. It was sold until 1949, by when it had been replaced by the 203. Launch Production started in January 1938, and the car was formally launched on 2 March 1938 with a dinner and presentation for the specialist press in the fashionable Bois de Boulogne district of Paris. The previous autumn, at the 1937 Paris Motor Show, Peugeot had staged a massive \\"referendum\\" among visitors to the show stand to find out what customers expected from the new small car then under development. It is not clear whether there would still have been time to incorporate any of the suggestions of the public in the car as launched, but the participative nature of the exercise certainly generated positive pre-launch publicity for the 202. The body The steel bodied 202 was instantly recognisable as a Peugeot from the way that the headlights were set, as on the older 302, close together, in a protected location behind the front grille. Most customers chose the four-door berline (saloon) version which by 1948 came with a steel-panel sliding sun roof included in the price. However the boot/trunk was small and could be accessed only from within the car, there being no outside boot lid. The two-seater two-door cabriolet \\"d√©capotable\\" did have a separate boot lid but cost approximately 30% more than the berline. Priced very closely to the berline was a structurally similar four-door four-seater \\"berline d√©couvrable\\", which featured a full fold away hood: this type of body would become difficult to provide using the monocoque body structure then becoming mainstream and which would be a feature of the Peugeot 203. Both the Peugeot 202 and the Peugeot 203 had frontal suicide doors. Between 1947 and 1949 the manufacturer produced 3,015 timber bodied \\"hatch\\" (hatchback) conversions: this model cost 55% more than the berline, and anticipated future Peugeot policy by using a slightly longer chassis than that used on other 202 versions. The extensive use of timber took the company back to a technology that it had abandoned in 1931 when production of the Type 190 ended, and according to the manufacturer was above all a response to shortage of sheet steel in post-war France.Mus√©e de l'Aventure Peugeot. The exhibit label (2012) states: ¬´...Mod√®le original de par l'utilisation de bois dans la carrosserie, aussi bien pour l'ossature que pour le garnissage ext√©rieure. Cette particularit√© √©tait due surtout aux difficult√©s d'approvisionnement en t√¥le d'acier dans les ann√©es d'apres- guerre. ‚Ä¶ ¬ª There were only two models offered in France in this class offering so wide a range of body types; the other was the still popular but soon to be replaced Simca 8. Chassis, engine and running gear With the body removed, an eye catching aspect of the 202's chassis was the positioning of the battery, located below and ahead of the radiator (itself conventionally sited ahead of the engine). This arrangement, which made inspection or replacement of the battery exceptionally easy, was made possible by the \\"streamlined\\" sloping front grill, shared with the manufacturer's larger models introduced during the late 1930s, such as the Peugeot 402 and its derivative, the 302. The 202 was powered by a 1133 cc water-cooled engine giving a maximum of at 4000 rpm and a top speed of approximately .Odin, L.C. World in Motion 1939, The whole of the year's automobile production. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG. Fuel-feed came via overhead valves, at a time when the most obvious competitor, the recently introduced Renault Juvaquatre, was still powered by a side-valve power unit. Power was transferred to the rear wheels by means of a three-speed manual transmission featuring synchromesh on the top two ratios. Back in 1931 the 202's predecessor, the Peugeot 201, had been the first mass market volume model to feature independent front suspension. Independent front suspension, widely held to improve both the road holding and the ride of the car, was again incorporated on the new 202, meaning that this was a feature across the entire Peugeot range: the same claim could not be made for the range on offer from rival Renault. As on the contemporary Citro√´n Traction, relatively elaborate \\"Pilote\\" style wheels, featuring alternating holes and structural metal support sections round the outside of the inner hub, were replaced by simpler (and cheaper to produce) pressed disc wheels when, following a heroic reconstruction effort at the Sochaux plant, production could be resumed in 1946 following the war. Improvements Small improvements continued to be implemented almost until the point where production ended. Hydraulic brakes were a new feature for 1946. Shortly after this the dashboard was redesigned to incorporate a (very small) glove box. For 1948 the wheels were embellished with chrome plated hub caps and the car received redesigned hydraulic shock absorbers (which turned out to be of the design recently finalised for the forthcoming new 203 model). A final fling, exhibited in October 1948 for the 1949 model year, was the Peugeot 202 \\"Affaires\\", a reduced specification version, with the heater removed and thinner tires fitted. The 202 Affaires also lost the sliding-steel-panel sunroof which by now had become a standard fitting on the regular 202 Berline (sedan/saloon). The list price was 320,000 Francs which represented a saving of more than 6% on the list price for the standard car. The bargain basement marketing may have helped clear accumulated component inventory, but the cabriolet version was nevertheless delisted shortly after the October 1948 Motor Show closed: by now commentators and potential customers were focused on the Peugeot 203, formally launched in 1948, by which time it had already been the subject of extensive pre-launch promotion and publicity by Peugeot for more than a year. Commercial 104,126 were built.

Life and career  Lindon was born at Clifton-upon-Dunsmore just outside Rugby, England, he set up home and shop at 6/6a Lawrence Sheriff Street, Rugby, immediately opposite the front doors of the Quadrangle of the Rugby School. As a boot and shoemaker, Lindon supplied footwear to the townsfolk of Rugby including the teachers and pupils of the school. Balls in those days were not spherical, but more plum-shaped. This was because a pig's bladder was inflated by mouth through the snapped stem of a clay pipe then encased in panels of stitched leather. As such, the individual bladder dictated the shape of each ball. By 1849, Lindon, now aged 33, who naturally had regular supplies of boot leather delivered, found himself bombarded by the boys of Rugby School to manufacture footballs for them. Lindon and his wife worked flat-out producing more balls than shoes. Mrs Rebecca Lindon, (b 1830) besides being the owner of her own employment agency for servants as well as the mother to 17 children, was the official \\"green\\" pig's bladder inflator. Blowing pig's bladders was not without its hazards. If the pig was diseased, it was going into Mrs Lindon's lungs. Eventually Mrs Lindon blew on enough infected pig's bladders to fall ill and consequently die. Around 1862 Lindon sought a safer substitute to the pig's bladder and came up with the India rubber bladder as an alternative. India rubber was too tough to inflate by mouth and after seeing an ordinary medical Ear Syringe he produced a larger brass version to blow up his footballs, which he demonstrated, and won medals for, at an exhibition in London. This allowed the production of the first round ball, though it still had a button at each end of the ball to hold the stitching together, at the point where the leather panels met. \\"Buttonless balls\\" became a prime selling point for suppliers and manufacturers by the 1880s. The Rugby School boys still wanted an oval ball produced to distinguish their hand and foot game from association football, so Lindon created a bladder design which allowed a more egg-shaped buttonless ball to be manufactured. This was the first specifically designed four-panel rugby ball and the start of size standardisation. By 1861 Richard Lindon was recognised as the principal Foot- Ball Maker to Rugby School, Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin Universities. Lindon's \\"Big-Side Match Ball\\" was recognised as the true rugby ball and was successfully manufactured by both Richard Lindon and subsequently, his son, Hughes John Lindon for 50 years. Lindon did not patent his ball, his bladder or his pump.  Death  On 10 June 1887, he died in his own home.  Richard Lindon & Co.  Richard Lindon & Co. (Rugby, England) hold the Registered Design for the Original Punt-about ButtonBall. A rugby ball hand stitched to the same standards and texture as the 1850s original is displayed in the museum at Rugby School. Around 1854 at Rugby School, the ball was kicked high in the air, dropped down a disused chimney and was lost behind wooden panels for over a century and a half. A hybrid 7-panel ButtonBall, made before the split between the Rugby Football Union and Football Association, it is the world's oldest known \\"template\\" ball, inflated with an India-rubber bladder which revolutionised ball manufacture and allowed the spread of the game throughout the world. It is the only original known to survive. This Punt- about ButtonBall holds the remains of one of Richard Lindon's India Rubber inflatable bladders and resembles the shape of the earliest plum rugby ball. The \\"panel and button\\" design led to the creation the first soccer balls.

Completed in 1877, it was one of the first to be built on a cylindrical iron foundation, an innovation by Maj. George H. Elliot to address shifting ice that is regarded to be very important in lighthouse design. The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 as Southwest Ledge Lighthouse. Description The Southwest Ledge Light is located at the southwestern end of a breakwater on the eastern side of the main channel into New Haven Harbor. The breakwater was built upon an underwater rock formation that the light was originally built as a warning for. The light consists of a three-story structure, which is mounted on a circular iron structure set in concrete surrounded by riprap. The structure is octagonal in shape, with an open balcony and railing around its main level, supported by large metal brackets. It is covered by a mansard roof, above which the lantern house rises. The lantern house is also surrounded by a railing, and is covered by a bellcast roof. The building's architectural styling is Second Empire, with bracketed window surrounds, bracketed eaves, and round-arch dormers in the roof. Most of these parts are cast iron; the interior chambers are framed in wood. History Historic Photo Construction on the Southwest Ledge Lighthouse started in 1873 and was finished in 1877. The superstructure originally intended for this light was put on display at the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876; in order to more quickly finish the light, however, a duplicate superstructure was built and installed at this light. The original house remained at the exposition until its close, and was then used for the Ship John Shoal Light in Delaware Bay. The foundation of the lighthouse was reinforced in 1911, and boat cranes (of which only foundations remain today) were added in the 1930s to facilitate access. The lighthouse was automated in 1973, and remains an active aid to navigation. It was placed up for sale in August 2016, and was sold to Dr. Casey Jordan of Beacon Preservation, Inc., in September 2016. Head keepers * Elizur Thompson (1877 ‚Äì 1881) * Henry C.

The film is narrated in ballad form. Summary Some animation is employed in the film to show the coming and going of the Ice Age when the lakes were born, but most of the other episodes of lake history are suggested by camera tricks that affect the canoeist and so emphasize the change. There is, for instance, a scene where open water suddenly turns to ice, freezing the canoe in mid-paddle. Then the canoe is left in midair high above the water, illustrating the melting of the ice, and causing the canoeist to crash to the water below. At another point, he is almost run over by a huge freighter, illustrating the befouling of the waters by shipping. Such slapstick effects are employed to mark the major changes in the history of the Great Lakes. At intervals the camera examines surviving evidence of the passage of the Ice Age, such as the striations of the rocks and the folds in the earth of farm landscapes viewed from the air. Toward the end of the film the canoeist seems finally to be safe from violent change. He dips his cup for a drink, but with his second sip discovers that the water has been fouled by human-produced industrial waste. Production The Rise and Fall of the Great Lakes was created by the NFB for the educational market, with the working title Evolution of the Great Lakes. The film proved so popular with children and teachers in test screenings that it was blown up to 35 mm for theatrical distribution. However, Mason was disappointed when the NFB producer made several changes to his finished work, feeling he had lost creative control.

History  Congregation Zichron Ephraim was established by Rabbi Bernard Drachman and Jonas Weil to promote Orthodox Judaism as an alternative to Reform Judaism popular on the Upper East Side.Application for National Historic Site status The building was built in 1889-1890. The architects were Schneider and Herter who designed numerous tenements on New York's Lower East Side as well as Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods. The building is similar to other synagogues built at the time which were in the Moorish Revival style that also featured a prominent Rose Window. One of the most remarkable characteristics is the asymmetrical twin towers with the eastern tower being taller (most other synagogues of the period featured twin towers of similar height). The towers are also adorned differently. Each of the towers originally was also topped by a bulbous dome which has since been removed. It is one of fewer than a hundred surviving nineteenth-century American synagogues.\\"Rediscovering Jewish Infrastructure: Update on United States Nineteenth Century Synagogues,\\" Mark W.

Over the doorway engraved in granite and written in Hebrew is a verse from Psalm 100. \\"Enter into His Gates with Thanksgiving and into His courts with praise.\\" Rabbi Drachman served as spiritual leader for fifty-one years. He died in 1945. Zev Zahavy was appointed rabbi of the synagogue on September 1, 1952. He was known as a dynamic spokesman for Orthodox Judaism. More than 200 of his sermons were reported on in the New York Times. He and his wife Edith, a noted educator, founded the Park East Day School. On March 16, 1957, Robert Briscoe, the Jewish Lord Mayor of Dublin, carrying his tallis bag, visited and prayed at the synagogue on Shabbos morning. Since 1962, the synagogue's rabbi has been Arthur Schneier. The Assistant Rabbi is Benjamin Goldschmidt. Rabbi Harold Einsidler is the religious spiritual organizer and principal of the religious school, his wife Toby is the dynamic office and youth leader. The synagogue's Chief Cantor is Yitzchak Meir Helfgot and its Cantor is Benny Rogosnitzky. The Park East Day School now educates children from early childhood through eighth grade. The synagogue building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI visited the synagogue in the midst of a visit to New York City. This was the third papal visit to a synagogue and the only such visit in the United States of America. The Pope was given a box of matzahs and a silver Seder plate (it was almost Passover when the visit occurred); members of both the Catholic and Jewish religions wore their respective skullcaps.Paul Vitello, \\"In Another Historic Act, Pope Benedict Visits a Manhattan Synagogue\\", The New York Times, April 19, 2008. In 2016, the synagogue was the subject of international press coverage when members of the synagogue heckled and jeered U.N. Director General Ban Ki-moon as he gave an address in honor of International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In his speech, he called the Holocaust a \\"colossal crime\\" and added that he is \\"deeply disturbed by the massacres in South Sudan, by the continued carnage in Syria, and by the atrocities being inflicted by Daesh and Boko Haram.\\" Earlier he had criticized Israel's occupation of the West Bank, and congregants were angry regarding his criticism of Israel, claiming it promoted terrorism. He later repeated his criticism of Israel but added that he in no way condoned terrorism.UN chief heckled at NY synagogue during holocaust speech Times of Israel, Feb 11, 2016.

Mineral dust is atmospheric aerosols originated from the suspension of minerals constituting the soil. It is composed of various oxides and carbonates. Human activities lead to 30% of the dust load in the atmosphere. The Sahara Desert is the major source of mineral dust, which subsequently spreads across the Mediterranean (where it is the origin of rain dust) and Caribbean seas into northern South America, Central America, and eastern North America, and Europe. Additionally, it plays a significant role in the nutrient inflow to the Amazon rainforest. The Gobi Desert is another source of dust in the atmosphere, which affects eastern Asia and western North America. Characteristics Mineral dust is mainly constituted of the oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, FeO, Fe2O3, CaO, and others) and carbonates (CaCO3, MgCO3) that constitute the Earth's crust. Global mineral dust emissions are estimated at 1000-5000 million tons per year, of which the largest part is attributed to deserts. Although this aerosol class is usually considered of natural origin, it is estimated that about a quarter of mineral dust emissions could be ascribed to human activities through desertification and land use changes. Large dust concentrations may cause problems to people having respiratory problems. Another effect of dust clouds is more colorful sunsets. Saharan dust Satellite photo of a Saharan dust cloud (2000) over the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. The Sahara is the major source on Earth of mineral dust (60-200 million tons per year). Saharan dust can be lifted by convection over hot desert areas, and can thus reach very high altitudes; from there it can be transported worldwide by winds, covering distances of thousands of kilometers. The dust combined with the extremely hot, dry air of the Sahara Desert often forms an atmospheric layer called the Saharan Air Layer which has significant effects on tropical weather, especially as it interferes with the development of hurricanes. Graph linking dust to various coral deaths across the Caribbean Sea and Florida. Images showing Saharan dust crossing the Atlantic. There is a large variability in the dust transport across the Atlantic into the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. In some years African dust is observed along much of the East Coast of the United States and is visible in the sky. Due to the trade winds, very large concentrations of mineral dust can be found in the tropical Atlantic, reaching the Caribbean; moreover episodic transport to the Mediterranean region.Stuut,J-B.,Smalley,I.J.,O'Hara-Dhand,K. 2009. Aeolian dust in Europe: African sources and European deposits. Quaternary International 198, 234-245. doi:10.1016/j.quaint 2008.10.007. Saharan plumes can form iberulites (a particular tropospheric aggregation of aerosols) when these plumes travel through North Africa and the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, and often reach the circum-Mediterranean areas of Western Europe. In the Mediterranean region, Saharan dust is important as it represents the major source of nutrients for phytoplankton and other aquatic organisms. Saharan dust carries the fungus Aspergillus sydowii and others. \\"On a spring clear day, the persisting airborne fungi were Alternaria alternata, Geotrichum candidum, Penicillium chrysogenum, and P. glabrum. However, during two dust events the fungal population was dominated by Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger, A. thomii, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Penicillium chrysogenum, and P. griseoroseum. This study suggests that Saharan and other desert dust events in the East Mediterranean have a significant effect on the airborne microbial populations, which might impact on health, agriculture, and ecology.\\" Aspergillus borne by Saharan dust falls into the Caribbean Sea and possibly infects coral reefs with Sea Fan disease (aspergillosis).

Researchers from Hacettepe University have reported that Saharan soil may have bio-available iron and also some essential macro and micro nutrient elements suitable for use as fertilizer for growing wheat. It has been shown that Saharan soil may have the potential of producing bioavailable iron when illuminated with visible light and also it has some essential macro and micro nutrient elements. In this study the impact of various growth media on development of some bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) cultivars have been investigated. As a four different nutrient media, Hewitt nutrient solution [1], illuminated and non-illuminated Saharan desert soil solutions and distilled water have been utilized. Shoot length (cm.seedling-1), leaf area (cm2 seedling-1) and photosynthetic pigments [chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids, mg ml-1 g fresh weight (g fw)-1] have been determined. The results of this study indicate that, wheat varieties fed by irradiated Saharan soil solution gave comparable results to Hewitt nutrient solution.Y√ºcekutlu, Nihal; Terzioƒülu, Serpil; Saydam, Cemal; Bildacƒ±, I≈üƒ±k (2011).\\"Organic Farming By Using Saharan Soil: Could It Be An Alternative To Fertilizers?\\" Hacettepe Journal of Biology and Chemistry. 39 (1): 29‚Äì38. Effect on hurricane frequency According to a NASA article,Sharan Dust has chilling effect on North Atlantic NASA satellites have shown that \\"the chilling effect of dust was responsible for one-third of the drop in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures between June 2005 and 2006, possibly contributing to the difference in hurricane activity between the two seasons.\\" There were only 5 hurricanes in 2006 compared with 15 in 2005. It is known that one of the major factors that create hurricanes is warm water temperatures on the surface of the ocean. Evidence shows that dust from the Sahara desert caused surface temperatures to be cooler in 2006 than in 2005. Asian dust Aizuwakamatsu, Japan shrouded in Asian Dust on April 2nd, 2007. Aizuwakamatsu, Japan with clear skies. In Eastern Asia, mineral dust events that originate in the Gobi Desert (Southern Mongolia and Northern China) during springtime give rise to the phenomenon called Asian dust. The aerosols are carried eastward by prevailing winds, and pass over China, Korea, and Japan. Sometimes, significant concentrations of dust can be carried as far as the Western United States.University of Utah Department of Meteorology. Dr. Kevin Perry is quoted in BALTIMORE SUN article, \\"Blowing in the Wind\\". Retrieved on 2007-06-10. Areas affected by Asian dust experience decreased visibility and health problems, such as sore throat and respiratory difficulties. The effects of Asian dust, however, are not strictly negative, as it is thought that its deposition enriches the soil with important trace minerals. An American study analyzing the composition of Asian dust events reaching Colorado associates them to the presence of carbon monoxide, possibly incorporated in the air mass as it passes over industrialized regions in Asia. Although dust storms in the Gobi desert have occurred from time to time throughout history, they became a pronounced problem in the second half of the 20th century due to intensified agricultural pressure and desertification.  North American dust  Mineral dust originates from several sources on the North American continent including the Southwest, the Great Plains, and Alaska. In the Southwest, dust impacts human health, visibility, lake productivity, and the rate of snowmelt in the Rocky Mountains. Dust deposition has increased dramatically since the early 1800s compared to the natural background due to the intensification of human activities.  Relationship to drought  Arid and semi-arid regions are naturally prone to dust emissions. Soil moisture is an important variable controlling dust emissions, along with vegetation cover, wind speed and soil type. Several studies based on modern observations show positive relationships (i.e. increasing drought increases dust) between dust and drought conditions in each dust cycle phase, from emissions, to atmospheric burden, to deposition. However, studies based on paleo records of dust deposition (e.g. using lake sediment) that specifically looked at megadroughts show both increases and no change in dust deposition. The study by Routson showed an increase in deposition during megadroughts but used a measure of dust concentration rather than accumulation that is affected by the rate of sedimentation. The Routson study instead used dust accumulation rates and found no difference between dust deposition during drought years and megadroughts and deposition during normal hydroclimate conditions. Instead, they found that dust deposition is more likely controlled by transport mechanisms and sediment supply than by hydroclimate. Similarly, Arcusa found no evidence for higher dust deposition during drought on multi- decadal and centennial scales. They also found that sediment supply played a key role as evidenced from a 60% increase in deposition in the 1800s due to accelerating land disturbance.

It is a societal level within the African-American community that primarily began to develop in the early 1960s, when the ongoing Civil Rights Movement led to the outlawing of de jure racial segregation. Definition of middle class As of the 2010 Census, black households had a median income of $32,068, which placed the median black household within the second income quintile. 27.3% of black households earned an income between $25,000 and $50,000, 15.2% earned between $50,000 and $75,000, 7.6% earned between $75,000 and $100,000, and 9.4% earned more than $100,000. Although the composition of the Black middle class varies by definition, the Black middle class is typically divided into a lower-middle class, core middle class, and an upper-middle class. The black lower-middle class is concentrated in sales, clerical positions, and blue-collar occupations, while the black upper-middle class (sometimes combined into the black upper class) is characterized by highly educated professionals in white- collar occupations, such as health care professionals, lawyers, professors, and engineers. History of black middle class in the United States Row houses in a historically black neighborhood of Chicago Many African-Americans had limited opportunities for advancement to middle class status prior to 1961 because of racial discrimination, segregation, and the fact that most lived in the rural South. In 1960, 43% of the white population completed high school, while only 20% of the black population did the same. African-Americans had little to no access to higher education, and only 3% graduated from college. Those blacks who were professionals were mainly confined to serving the African-American population. Outside of the black community, they often worked in unskilled industrial jobs. Black women who worked were frequently domestic servants. However, black women in the post-slavery emerging middle class also worked as teachers, nurses, businesswomen, journalists and other professionals.Carter G. Woodson, and Lorenzo Johnston Greene, The Early Black History Movement, University of Illinois Press, 2007, p 85 Economic growth, public policy, Black skill development, and the civil rights movement all contributed to the surfacing of a larger black middle class. The civil rights movement helped to remove barriers to higher education. As opportunities for African-Americans expanded, blacks began to take advantage of the new possibilities. Homeownership has been crucial in the rise of the black middle class, including the movement of African-Americans to the suburbs, which has also translated into better educational opportunities. By 1980, over 50% of the African-American population had graduated from high school and eight percent graduated from college. In 2006, 86% of blacks between age 25 and 29 had graduated from high school and 19% had completed a bachelor's degrees.Koditschek, Theodore, Cha-Jua, Sundiata Keita, and Neville, Helen. Race Struggles, p. 31. (2009) As of 2003, the percentage of black householders is 48%, compared to 43% in 1990.African-American History Month, US Census Bureau, February 2003. Rise and decline of middle-class blacks The rise to the middle class for African-Americans occurred throughout the 1960s; however, it leveled off and began to decline in the following decades due to multiple recessions that struck America throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Blacks and other lower-class groups suffered the brunt of those recessions. There is also evidence to suggest the wealth gap has been exacerbated by the housing market bubble in 2006 and the recession that followed from late 2007 to mid-2009, which took a far greater toll on depleting minority wealth. Racial wealth gap According to a 2011 study from Pew Research Center, whites possess 20 times more wealth than African-Americans and 18 times that of Latinos. Whereas white families have accumulated $113,149 of wealth on average, black households have only accumulated $5,677 in wealth on average. As shown on Eurweb.com, of the 14 million black households in the U.S. in 2015, only 5% had more than $350,000 in net worth, and less than 1% of black families had over $1 million in net assets. As of 1999, Blacks and whites similarly situated within the \\"educational middle class\\" live in distinct wealth worlds. Whereas educationally middle-class whites possessed $111,000 in median net worth, educationally middle-class Black families had only $33,500; in terms of assets, the disparity was $56,000 to $15,000. Looking at only \\"the occupational middle-class\\", an equally pronounced gap is visible: middle-class whites had $123,000 in median net worth and $60,000 in median net financial assets compared to $26,500 and $11,200 for middle-class African-Americans. According to Thomas Shapiro (2004), white families possess \\"between three and five times as much wealth as equally achieving Black middle class families.\\" A 2016 article entitled \\"Black Wealth Hardly Exists, Even When You Include NBA, NFL and Rap Stars\\" related recent findings of the Corporation For Economic Development (CFED) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), which calculated that \\"it would take 228 years for the average Black family to amass the same level of wealth the average white family holds today in 2016... According to the Institute on Assets and Social Policy, for each dollar of increase in average income an African-American household saw from 1984 to 2009 just $0.69 in additional wealth was generated, compared with the same dollar in increased income creating an additional $5.19 in wealth for a similarly situated white household.\\"http://inequality.org/black-wealth-exists/ \\"Black Wealth Hardly Exists, Even When You Include NBA, NFL and Rap Stars\\" Importance of home equity Most contemporary wealth is built in America on home equity. Present-day income is thus an insufficient measure of household socioeconomic status. Looking at disparities between wealth accumulation among African-Americans and whites paints a far more accurate picture of racial socioeconomic differences. The estimated median wealth of black households is $35,000, while white households estimated their parents' median wealth at $150,000. African-Americans, who were historically denied access to housing wealth, face a substantial wealth disparity compared to whites. Asset poverty affects an African-American's ability to procure other forms of middle class lifestyle and other forms of wealth. Impact of discrimination upon African-American middle class Housing discrimination A 1936 \\"residential security\\" map of Philadelphia, classifying various neighborhoods by estimated risk of mortgage loans. In a project conducted by the University of Washington's Civil Rights and Labor History Program in 2010, it was found that records of more than 400 properties in Seattle suburbs alone contained now-illegal discriminatory language that formerly excluded several ethnic groups. Another barrier is discriminatory mortgage lending patterns and redlining. Although informal discrimination and segregation had existed in the United States, the specific practice called \\"redlining\\" began with the National Housing Act of 1934, which established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). During the heyday of redlining, the areas most frequently discriminated against were black inner city neighborhoods. For example, in Atlanta in the 1980s, a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles by investigative reporter Bill Dedman showed that banks would often lend to lower-income whites but not to middle-income or upper- income blacks. The use of blacklists is a related mechanism also used by redliners to keep track of groups, areas, and people that the discriminating party feels should be denied business or aid or other transactions. In the academic literature, redlining falls under the broader category of credit rationing. In a 2001 book entitled Housing Discrimination and Residential Segregation as Causes of Poverty, author John Yinger asserted that when applying for a home mortgage, African-American and Hispanic customers are 82% more likely to be turned down for a loan than were white customers. Black renters also favored a 10.7 percent chance of being totally excluded from housing made available to comparable white renters and a 23.3 percent chance of learning about fewer apartments. Discrimination in housing practices and residential segregation leads to substantial wealth gaps across races. Home ownership is typically a source of insurance against poverty. However, for blacks and Hispanics, home ownership rates have never made it past 50% [as of 2001]. Residential segregation Segregated housing patterns also keep African-Americans far from suburbanizing jobs and associated job information networks. This mismatch between residential locations and employment reduces the employment options for middle- and lower-class African-Americans. There is a significant black suburbanization lag in which African-Americans are less likely than others to adopt suburban residential patterns. Black suburbs tend to be areas of low socioeconomic status and population density. Many are former manufacturing suburbs with weak tax bases, poor municipal services, and high levels of debt, compromising the secure middle-class lifestyle of its African-American inhabitants. Achievement gap Structural and institutional explanations for achievement gap The disparity in expenditures on education between inner cities and affluent suburbs exist almost entirely due to the system of property taxes which most school systems rely on for funding. By attending spatially segregated school systems, children of the black middle class do not have access to the same educational and employment opportunities as their white counterparts. In general, minority students are more likely to reside in lower or middle class inner city neighborhoods, meaning minority students are more likely to attend poorly funded schools based on the districting patterns within the school system. Schools in lower-income districts tend to employ less qualified teachers and have fewer educational resources. Research shows that teacher effectiveness is the most important in-school factor affecting student learning. Good teachers can actually close or eliminate the gaps in achievement on the standardized tests that separate white and minority students.Gordon, Kane & Staiger (2006). 'Identifying Effective Teachers Using Performance on the Job.' Brookings Institution. Cultural explanations for achievement gap The culture and environment in which children are raised may play a role in the achievement gap. One explanation that has been suggested for racial and ethnic differences in standardized test performance is that standardized IQ tests and testing procedures are culturally biased toward European-American middle class knowledge and experiences. Social psychologist Claude Steele suggests that minority children and adolescents may also experience stereotype threat‚Äîthe fear that they will be judged to have traits associated with negative appraisals and/or stereotypes of their race or ethnic group which produces test anxiety and keeps them from doing as well as they could on tests. According to Steele, minority test takers experience anxiety, believing that if they do poorly on their test they will confirm the stereotypes about inferior intellectual performance of their minority group. As a result, a self-fulfilling prophecy begins, and the child performs at a level beneath his or her inherent abilities. Some researchersSteele, C., and J. Aronson, \\"Stereotype Threat and the Test Performance of Academically Successful African Americans\\" (pp. 401‚Äì430), in C. Jencks and M. Phillips (Eds.), The Black-White Test Score Gap (Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, 1998). also hypothesize that in some cases, minorities, especially African American students, may stop trying in school because they do not want to be accused of \\"acting white\\" by their peers. It has also been suggested that some minority students simply stop trying because they do not believe they will ever see the true benefits of their hard work. As some researchers point out, minority students may feel little motivation to do well in school because they do not believe it will pay off in the form of a better job or upward social mobility.

Its salts are typically referred to as being metal triflimidates. Applications The anion is widely used in ionic liquids (e.g.trioctylmethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide), since it is less toxic and more stable than more \\"traditional\\" counterions such as tetrafluoroborate. This anion is also of importance in lithium-ion and lithium metal batteries (LiTFSI) because of its high dissociation and conductivity. It has the added advantage of suppressing crystallinity in poly(ethylene oxide), which increases the conductivity of that polymer below its melting point at 50 ¬∞C. Triflimidic acid The conjugate acid of bistriflimide, which is frequently referred to by the trivial name triflimidic acid, is a commercially available superacid. It is a crystalline compound, but is hygroscopic to the point of being deliquescent. Owing to its very high acidity and good compatibility with organic solvents it has been employed as a catalyst in a wide range of chemical reactions. Its pKa value in water cannot be accurately determined but in acetonitrile it has been estimated as ‚àí0.10 and in 1,2-dichloroethane ‚àí12.3 (relative to the pKa value of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid), anchored to zero to crudely approximate the aqueous pKa scaleAbsolute pKa values in DCE are about 45 units higher, making their values very large for all but the strongest superacids (see: J. Phys. Chem. A 2015, 119, 735).), making it more acidic than triflic acid (pKaMeCN = 0.70, pKaDCE(rel. picric acid) = ‚Äì11.4). Naming Developing an IUPAC name for bistriflimide that indicates the structure and reactivity is challenging, and changes to current names have been proposed. The main difficulty arises from the ambiguous use of the word amide to mean an acylated (including sulfonylated) amine or the anionic form of an amine. Likewise, imide can refer to a bisacylated amine or a twice deprotonated amine. Thus, depending on the system used, there is ambiguity as to whether amide or imide is being used to refer to the parent acid or the anion. (The anion has been referred to as an amidate or imidate in an attempt to distinguish it from the acid.) The complications in naming these compounds was highlighted in an article by the IUPAC. Since then, the IUPAC has recommended (2013) that derivatives of anionic nitrogen can be named as azanides, so bis[(trifluoromethane)sulfonyl]azanide would be an acceptable and unambiguous name for bistriflimide anion. The parent acid, whose trivial name is triflimidic acid, would then be called bis[(trifluoromethane)sulfonyl]azane.

Blockage of this artery is often called the widow- maker infarction due to a high death risk. Structure It passes at first behind the pulmonary artery and then comes forward between that vessel and the left atrium to reach the anterior interventricular sulcus, along which it descends to the notch of cardiac apex. Although rare, multiple anomalous courses of the LAD have been described. These include the origin of the artery from the right aortic sinus. In 78% of cases, it reaches the apex of the heart. Branches The LAD gives off two types of branches: septals and diagonals. * Septals originate from the LAD at 90 degrees to the surface of the heart, perforating and supplying the anterior 2/3rds of the interventricular septum. * Diagonals run along the surface of the heart and supply the lateral wall of the left ventricle and the anterolateral papillary muscle. Function The artery supplies the anterolateral myocardium, apex, and interventricular septum. The LAD typically supplies 45-55% of the left ventricle (LV) and is therefore considered the most critical vessel in terms of myocardial blood supply. Wellens' Warning. Right: The same patient after reperfusion. Widow maker Widow maker is an alternative name for the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery. The name widow maker may also apply to the left coronary artery or severe occlusions to that artery. This term is used because the left main coronary and/or the left anterior descending supply blood to large areas of the heart. This means that if these arteries are abruptly and completely occluded it will cause a massive heart attack that will likely lead to sudden death. The blockage that kills is made up of platelets streaming to the site of a ruptured cholesterol plaque. Even a small amount of plaque in this area can (for a variety of poorly understood reasons) rupture and cause death; bypassing chronic blockages or trying to open them up with angioplasty does not prevent heart attack but it can restore blood flow in case of a sudden blockage or heart attack and if performed within a rapid time period can minimize the damage done. An example of the devastating results of a complete occlusion of the LAD artery was the sudden death of former NBC News Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert, as well as the near-death of film director Kevin Smith.https://www.livescience.com/61863-kevin-smith-widow-maker-heart- attack.html From the minute a widow maker heart attack hits, survival time ranges from minutes to several hours. Rapidly progressing symptoms should signal the need for immediate attention. Symptoms of initial onset may include nausea, shortness of breath, pain in the head, jaw, arms or chest, numbness in fingers, often of a novel but imprecise sensation which builds with irregular heart beat. Early symptoms may be mistaken for food poisoning, flu or general malaise until they intensify. A widow maker cannot kill instantly but induces cardiac arrest which may do so within 10 to 20 minutes of no circulation. A victim with no pulse or breath is still alive, living off oxygen stored in the blood and may be able to be rescued if treatment is begun promptly within this window.

The club was first led by the American conductor Michael Hurley Cross (1833‚Äì1897), who was one of its original founders. Well over a century later, in 2012, the conductors of the group are John Shankweiler (Conductor) and Clyde R. Dengler, Jr. (Conductor Emeritus). The Orpheus club performs its Christmas, winter and spring concerts at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and at the Kimmel Center. Its Twelfth Night Revels performance is held at the Orpheus clubhouse on South Van Pelt Street each January.  History  The Orpheus Club of Philadelphia gave its first performance at the Musical Fund Hall in 1872. Its founders, including the conductor Michael Hurley Cross, had broken away from the old Abt Society in the summer of that same year. Article 11 of the club's charter reads: \\"[The Orpheus Club's] object shall be in the attainment of the greatest possible excellence in the performance of part songs for male voice.\\" In the first season, 319 men were proposed and elected as associate members. Headquarters were in a room in the A.P.A. building at 1415 Locust Street. That location was soon abandoned, however, in favor of more satisfactory quarters at the northwest corner of 12th and Chestnut Streets, where meetings and rehearsals were held for five additional seasons. During the club's second season, in addition to three concerts at the hall owned by the Musical Fund Society, the club made its first appearance at the Academy of Music. Its members sang two works in a program marking the centennial of the Boston Tea Party on December 17, 1873. In May 1889, the club moved to the Academy of Music, having outgrown the capacity of the Musical Fund Hall. Subsequently, in 1928, after several moves, the male singing club settled permanently in the clubhouse that, as of June 2012, continues to exist at 254 South Van Pelt Street.  Euredice Chorus  The Euredice Chorus was formed in November 1886 on identical lines as the Orpheus Club: for the purpose of singing choral works written for women's voices. The women of Euredice gave two concerts each year and it was reported that the quality of their work was excellent. For over 25 years, Euredice shared conductors with Orpheus, used the club's rehearsal room and sang in many concerts with the men of the Orpheus Club.  Guest artists  Through the years, the club has been assisted by a list of guest artists whose abilities and artistic talents have enhanced the reputation of the Orpheus Club. These have included Maude Powell, violinist, who accompanied and played in no less than seven formal concerts between 1886 and 1897; Victor Herbert, cellist (1896); Pablo Casals, cellist (1904); Marcel Tabuteau, oboist: William Kinkaid, flautist: Louise Homer, operatic contralto; David Bisham, baritone (coincidentally a member of the Orpheus Club and a star of the Metropolitan Opera); Noah Swayne and Wilbur Evans, bassos (also members of the Orpheus Club).  Charitable work  The members of the Orpheus Club established a tradition of performing for charity as early as June 9, 1873, when they gave an open-air concert at Belmont Mansion for the benefit of the Children's Hospital. Traditions A favorite Club tradition is private singing after rehearsals, when members retire to an upstairs meeting room at the Club house for a Round Table, which involves the participation of guests who are introduced and invited to sing a song or tell a story, after which they are required to call upon anyone in the room to follow suit. And so it goes from member to member until all in the room have contributed. The Orpheus Club presents an annual Twelfth Night Revels performance, a yearly production given at the Annual Dinner since 1893, which has become something of \\"an honored tradition\\". The musical review is written, produced, acted and directed by a group of singing members and includes popular songs (current and ancient) with appropriate lyrics all held together by a somewhat tenuous plot. Many of the Round Table contributions have found inspiration from these shows. In early June the club gathers for its Annual Outing, using the grounds of Philadelphia Cricket Club for a strenuous day of sports, singing and fellowship, culminating in the traditional dinner and singing on into the night. An important aim of the Orpheus fellowship is to pass on the joy of these occasions to its younger members.

History  He was born Jaafar As-Sadiq, the son of Sunan Ngudung and Syarifah (sibling of Sunan Bonang), thus the grandson of Sunan Ampel. It is said that he was the son of an Egyptian sultan who had migrated to Java. In the Sultanate of Demak, he was appointed commander of the army. He went forth with Sultan Prawata, battling against Adipati Jipang, Arya Penangsang.  Activities  He learned a lot from Sunan Kalijaga and applied most of the methods in dawah, taught by Kalijaga. Kudus then fled to Central Java to the most empty place there such as Sragen, Simo and also Gunung Kidul. He was so tolerant to the local culture and even more softer than the other wali up to the point that if someone said to be having difficulty making dawah in Kudus they will refer back to Sunan Kudus as the most successful person in this area. He makes good use of the symbols appearing in Hinduism and Buddhism and manifested it into architecture especially mosques, minarets, entrance gates and ablutions symbolizing the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism. On one occasion, he deliberately called the locals to listen to his sermon by tying his cow named \\"Sapi Gumarang\\" in the mosque courtyard, the Hindus who revered cows as their deity soon became sympathetic after listening to the explanation made by him in Sura al-Baqara. Up until then, those people in Kudus refuse to slaughter bulls and cows because of their ancient beliefs in the sanctity of cows. Sunan Kudus also compiled stories on tawhid into series and made the crowd became enthusiastic in listening to those stories.

The character was created by Scott Lobdell, Jeph Loeb and Gene Ha. She first appeared in Askani'Son #1 (January, 1996), though her true identity was revealed in Uncanny X-Men # -1 (July, 1997). She's a member of the Askani and as such, her story ties into that of Rachel Summers and Cable.  Fictional character biography  Madame Sanctity was originally Tanya Trask, daughter of Dr. Bolivar Trask, the creator of the Sentinels. Like her brother Larry, Tanya was a mutant, though she possessed time travelling powers, as well as telepathic and psychokinetic abilities. When these manifested, Tanya was lost in the timestream, until she was pulled into the Askani future by Rachel Summers. Tanya became a member of Rachel's Askani Sisterhood and took on the alias Sanctity. The trauma of being displaced in time and the extreme conditions of the Askani's war against Apocalypse caused Tanya to become extremely ruthless, manipulative and even mad. After she learned to control her powers, Sanctity travelled back in time in order to prevent the rise of Apocalypse, which she knew was tied to the fabled Twelve. Rachel followed her into the present to prevent her plan of programming Master Mold with the identities of the Twelve and the directive of destroying them. Tanya pretended to comply with Rachel, but she had already uploaded the information into Master Mold's core programming, which prevented Bolivar Trask from discovering Tanya's actions. However, the information Sanctity uploaded was not accurate, presumably as a way to protect Cable, Jean Grey and Cyclops. Following the death of Rachel/Mother Askani, Sanctity became Madame Sanctity and took over the Askani Sisterhood. In order to ensure Cable's birth and his confrontation with Apocalypse, she sent Cyclops and Jean Grey back to the 19th century in order to ensure the transformation of Nathaniel Essex into Mister Sinister and his rebellion against Apocalypse, which were necessary for the birth of Cable. She constantly manipulated Cable, as well as others, through astral projections and agents, such as Ch'vayre. Sanctity received the young Nathan Dayspring (Cable) into the Sisterhood so he could be trained in the use of his powers. However, when the New Canaanites, a faction that had taken over Apocalypse's throne, attacked the Askani lands, Madame Sanctity was kidnapped by Stryfe, Nathan's evil clone. Recognizing the similarity of his psi-signature to those of her messiah, Sanctity allied with him and trained him in the use of his psychic powers. Powers and abilities Tanya is a mutant possessing time travelling powers, as well as telepathic and psychokinetic abilities.  Conflicting origins  The origin of Sanctity poses a continuity issue caused by an error. Uncanny X-Men #minus 1 depicts her as Tanya Trask, Bolivar Trask's mutant teenage daughter. However Phoenix #3, written by John Francis Moore, shows a little girl named Sanctity under the care of the Order of Witnesses. This is not the only continuity issue caused by the Phoenix limited series.

Location The Stratford Shoal Light is located roughly midway between New York and Connecticut (hence its alternate name Middleground or Middle Ground Light), from Old Field Point Light in New York and from Stratford Point Light in Connecticut. There was some debate about whether the lighthouse is New York or Connecticut. It was originally the state of New York, not Connecticut, which ceded the area on which the lighthouse is located to the federal government, but most modern official maps place it within Connecticut's side of Long Island Sound by about .USGS topo quad for cited location available by clicking on the Coordinates in the title bar and going to GPS Visualizer - USGS Topo The lighthouse is located on Stratford (or Middleground) Shoal which is a little over a mile in diameter and as little as nine feet below mean lower low water. The shoal has been identified as a danger to navigation for centuries. History Adriaen Block, the first European to explore Long Island Sound, identified two low islands at the site of current Stratford Shoal during his 1614 voyage. These islands were eroded below the surface of the water within 100 or 200 years. The shoal was first marked for navigation in 1820 by a pair of spar buoys placed on its north and south ends. In 1831, Congress appropriated $1,000 to erect a warning beacon on the shoal, but no further action was taken on the project. The beacon was to have had the shape of an iron spindle. Lightship LV-15 Congress next appropriated $10,000 for the construction of a \\"floating light for Middle Ground, Long Island Sound\\". Built in Norfolk, Virginia 1837, the lightship constructed was long and weighed 100 tons. It carried a lantern on each of its two masts, plus a hand-operated bell and a foghorn as fog signals. The lightship was anchored off the southeastern edge of Stratford Shoal on January 12, 1838; just eight days later, it drifted off its station. The lightship would display a chronic inability to hold its station in future years, even after its single anchor chain was supplemented with second and third anchors. It was dragged from its station by ice more than half a dozen times, most notably in 1875 when it ran aground at Orient Point, and in 1876 when it drifted to Faulkner Island. When standard hull numbers were assigned to lightships in 1867, the Stratford Shoals lightship was named LV-15; previously it had been known as \\"Middle Ground floating light\\", \\"Stratford Shoal Light Vessel,\\" or \\"Stratford Point Light Vessel\\". Lighthouse The Stratford Shoal lighthouse was completed in 1877 to replace the lightship. The lighthouse was constructed on a small, man-made island (on the spot of two former natural islands that were washed over by the sea). Originally, lighthouse keepers were utilized to maintain the facility. The lighthouse was automated in 1970 and is currently an active aid to navigation. It has historical significance as an example of the masonry lighthouse design used in waterbound U.S. lighthouses immediately before the use of sparkplug lighthouses. It is similar to some Hudson River lighthouses, and \\"embodies the enormous cost and heroic effort required to put these designs in place in the treacherous waters of Long Island Sound.\\" and Yacht Racing Several local yacht clubs located on Long Island Sound use the lighthouse as a midpoint or rounding marker for races all called the Stratford Shoals Race. One annual regatta dating back to 1931 organized by Riverside Yacht Club continues to this day; while others are more recent including 2018 races by Lloyd Harbor YC, Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club, and the New York Athletic Club.

It is approximately 45 miles southeast of Ironwood, Michigan in Gogebic County. Early history As the Ojibwe Nation divided into two and expanded westward from the Sault Ste. Marie region, the southern branch of Ojibwe came to the area now known as Lac Vieux Desert. The Lake Superior Band of Chippewa included twelve bands in historic times. This lake, known as Gete-gitigaani-zaaga'igan (\\"Lake of the old garden\\") in the Anishinaabe language, is located near several major watershed boundaries. It served as an ideal travel/trade hub connecting major waterways and trails to Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Wisconsin River. The Lac Vieux Desert Band was one of three in Michigan. The other nine bands of Lake Superior Chippewa resided in what became organized as Wisconsin and Minnesota under the United States rule. All twelve bands were signatory to several treaties with the United States. Chiefs of the Lac Vieux Desert Band signed the Treaty of St. Peters of 1837, Treaty of La Pointe of 1842, and Treaty of La Pointe of 1854, by which they ceded tribal communal land in Michigan to the United States. The second La Pointe Treaty of 1854, added to include a band newly included in US territory because of international boundary changes, also established the Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation. It is known as Gete-gitigaaning in the Anishinaabe language. Under the federal Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, which otherwise encouraged tribes to re-established self-government, the Lac Vieux Desert Band lost their independent federal recognition. Together with the formerly independent L'Anse and Ontonogon bands, they were classified as members of the newly named Keweenaw Bay Indian Community. But they continued to reside separately in the Watersmeet area. Independent federal recognition Indian activism was on the rise in the 1960s, as tribes organized to assert their rights and sovereignty. Beginning then and for nearly 20 years, the Band worked to regain independent federal recognition as a self-governing group. They had had an independent, historic relationship with the federal government, as documented by their many treaties and their separate reservation. The band finally achieved recognition through a Congressional bill: on September 8, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the \\"Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians Act\\" (H.R. 3697) that officially recognized the Band as a separate and distinct tribe apart from the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community. The Lac Vieux Desert Band independently joined the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, Inc. in 1988. It was formed in 1966 to represent tribes in Michigan, share management resources, and gain funding through joint programs. As the tribes have grown and developed more of their own programs, the council has transferred functions to them. Economic development The tribe owns and operates the Northern Waters Casino Resort on its reservation in Watersmeet, Michigan. The resort includes the Dancing Eagles Hotel and the Lac Vieux Desert golf course. Seasonal events include ice fishing competitions in winter. The tribe has established an online, short- term installment loans business to serve underbanked Americans. The business has brought new employment opportunities and had generated financial support for other tribal business ventures and social programs for the reservation. The tribe established Big Picture Loans (https://www.bigpictureloans.com) in late 2016, which is based on the reservation in Watersmeet. The loans are available only online and the maximum loan value is $3,500, according to the company website. In August 2015, the Lac Vieux Desert community opened a state-of-the-art medical complex, Lac Vieux Desert Health Center, which is available to the entire population of the Western Upper Peninsula. The medical complex offers care for the entire family, is open to the public, and accepts all insurance. In 2015 the tribe was awarded a historic preservation grant from the National Park Service to survey the ancient Lac Vieux Desert to L'Anse Trail, a more than 80-mile path long used by the Ojibwe before the 17th century between this area and L'Anse. The Ojibwe continued to use this trail into the 1940s. As part of management plan of the Ottawa National Forest, which occupies land near them, the tribe wants to identify and preserve the historically significant trail. It passes through Baraga, Houghton, Iron and Gogebic counties.

In his family and in church, the Day of Judgment was constantly considered a very real possibility. When Adams was 16, his father became extremely ill, and Adams left school to work on the Northern Pacific Railroad to help support the family. He did well there and rose in management but dropped from this job to attend the University of Minnesota. After he graduated in 1924, he went on to the Harvard Divinity School to become a Unitarian minister. In his education, he moved from \\"premillenarian fundamentalism\\" to \\"scientific humanism\\" and then to liberal Christianity. After graduation from Harvard, Adams served as minister of the Second Church, Unitarian in Salem, Massachusetts, from 1927 to 1934, and the First Unitarian Society in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, from 1934 to 1935. In the mid-1930s, Adams spent considerable time in Germany, where he befriended several notable religious figures (including Karl Barth and Albert Schweitzer) who were active in clandestine resistance to the rise of Nazism. In 1937, Adams began a long career in academia by joining the faculty of Meadville Theological School (now Meadville Lombard Theological School) in Chicago. While there, he became a member of the First Unitarian Church of Chicago and served on its board of trustees. In 1956, he became Professor of Christian Ethics at Harvard Divinity School, where he stayed until he retired in 1968. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. In 1962 he became part of the first board of directors for the Society for the Arts, Religion and Contemporary Culture. A number of his students later became influential figures in Christian ethics across the theological spectrum. Among them was Stephen Charles Mott, a pioneer in evangelical social ethics in the US who taught at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary for a quarter of a century and currently President of the James Luther Adams Foundation. Another one of Adams' students was Chris Hedges, author of War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning (2002). After his retirement from Harvard, Adams taught at Andover Newton Theological School and Meadville Lombard Theological School. In his later years, he lived in Harvard Square, Cambridge adjacent to the Harvard Divinity School near the Harvard University campus and was an active member of Arlington Street Church (UU) in Boston until his death on July 26, 1994. He is buried at Cambridge Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Sylvester first appeared in Star Spangled Comics #1 (October 1941) and was created by Jerry Siegel and Hal Sherman. Starting October 1941, the character headlined his own comic, Star Spangled Comics, which introduced his sidekick, Stripesy. Fall 1941 was a boom period for patriotic superheroes as the country prepared to enter World War II; during this period, comic book publishers also launched Miss Victory, Miss America, U.S. Jones, the Fighting Yank, the Flag, Captain Flag and Yank and Doodle, among others. The Star-Spangled Kid and his sidekick, Stripesy, appeared in Star Spangled Comics until issue #86 (Nov 1948). The comic continued after that, primarily as a vehicle for Robin the Boy Wonder. In issue #131 (Aug 1952), the book was renamed Star Spangled War Stories. The Star-Spangled Kid also appeared in World's Finest Comics from 1942 to 1945. A version of Sylvester Pemberton, now named Starman, appears on the DC Universe streaming service show Stargirl played by Joel McHale. The show also appears on The CW Network. Fictional character biography Star-Spangled Kid The original Star-Spangled Kid was Sylvester Pemberton, a Golden Age character. He became the Star-Spangled Kid in order to battle Nazi spies and fifth columnists during World War II. Sylvester was a spoiled, pampered rich kid who snuck out of the house to fight crime; his parents never suspected what their son was up to. He was unique in that he was a kid superhero who operated with an adult sidekick, Stripesy a.k.a. Pat Dugan, the family's chauffeur. Both he and Dugan were superb acrobats and had sufficient training in hand-to-hand combat. They devised a series of acrobatic maneuvers that allowed them to build upon one another's strengths: the Kid's agility and Dugan's prowess. They also built the Star Rocket Racer, a bubble-topped limousine with the functions of a rocket and helicopter. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, the Kid's enemies \\"range from ordinary criminals and Axis agents to the mad scientist Dr. Weerd, False Face, the Black Magician, the moon-mad Moonglow, Presto the criminal magician, and the rope-gimmick using Rope.\\" The Kid and Stripesy were members of the Seven Soldiers of Victory as well as the All-Star Squadron. In 1948, Pemberton and Dugan were joined by Merry, the Girl of 1000 Gimmicks, who supplanted The Kid and Stripsey from their own feature. The Seven Soldiers were lost in time in 1950 and rescued decades later by the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America. Aquaman, Wildcat and the Silver Age Green Lantern rescued the Star-Spangled Kid, who was 50,000 years in the past and hiding in a cave so his flu would not wipe out humanity.Justice League of America (vol. 1) #100‚Äì102 (August‚ÄìOctober 1972) Sylvester then joined the JSA, at which time a then-injured Starman loaned him his cosmic rod (it was later revealed that Starman wanted the young man to become his heir as neither of his sons expressed interest in carrying the mantle).All-Star Comics (1976 revival) #58 (January/February 1976) Soon afterward, the Kid refined the technology of the rod, devising a belt with similar powers such as energy projection, flight and matter transmutation. Eventually, Sylvester temporarily retired from superheroics to reclaim his inheritance and his father's business, plus movie studio Stellar Studios, from his corrupt nephew, who was using those funds to run his own evil organization, Strike Force. In addition, he patched up his long-neglected relationship with Dugan and later became the hero known as Skyman post-Crisis after founding the heroic group known as Infinity, Inc. Skyman Pemberton's debut as Skyman in Infinity, Inc. #31 (October 1986). Art by Todd McFarlane. Sylvester eventually changed his name to Skyman and took leadership of the team Infinity Inc. During this period he formed a partnership with the city of Los Angeles to commission the team as for-hire protectors. He also purchased property to revitalize related movie production facilities. He later confronted Solomon Grundy, who was under the control of the third Harlequin. She herself was under the employ of the Dummy's Injustice Unlimited. During the incident, Solomon Grundy used the fatal touch of Mr. Bones to kill Skyman.\\"Infinity Inc.\\" #51‚Äì53 (1988) Powers and abilities Star-Spangled Kid has no superpowers, but is a superb athlete and hand-to-hand combatant. For a time he used Starman's cosmic rod. Later, he wore a \\"cosmic converter belt\\" which enabled him to fly, increased his strength and agility, and gave him the ability to create solid light objects and project energy blasts. When he reconfigured the belt into his new costume as Skyman, he initially only had the power of flight, but as time went on, he modified the suit so it possessed all of the other powers that the converter belt had as well. The Second Star-Spangled Kid Pat Dugan's stepdaughter, Courtney Whitmore, finds Sylvester's Star-Spangled Kid suit and cosmic belt and Pat's old Stripesy costume while snooping through Dugan's belongings. She steals Sylvester's suit and belt and, after redesigning the suit, calls herself the second Star-Spangled Kid, but only in order to annoy Pat as revenge for him marrying her mother and moving her family to a new state.Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. #1 (August 1999) She later changes her name to Stargirl after an adventure confronting her convict father to resolve her issues with her personal life for a mission in JSA: Allstars (the graphic novel). Sylvester, as Star-Spangled Kid, later returned with the JSA due to an alternate timeline in post-Crisis continuity to assist the Justice Society against Extant, when multiple alternate timelines came together due to Extant's attempt to collapse reality into a timeline of his creation. During this adventure, he teams up with Courtney.JSA #11 (June 2000) 52 In the series 52, Lex Luthor bought the rights to Infinity Inc.'s name from the Pemberton Estate and gave the codename 'Skyman' to a new superhero, named Jacob Colby. Jacob had a relationship with Natasha Irons, and was portrayed as one of the more sincere heroes in Luthor's Infinity Inc. He was later killed and replaced by the shapeshifting Everyman. In other media * Sylvester appeared in the two- hour Smallville TV movie Absolute Justice portrayed by Jim Shield. He appears as Star-Spangled Kid, warning Chloe Sullivan about someone hunting down and killing superheroes. Sylvester was killed soon afterward by the villain, revealed to be Icicle, and his cosmic staff was taken into police custody and later stolen by Courtney Whitmore. His death, along with Wesley Dodds's, brought about the reunion of the Justice Society of America. He was later mentioned by Chloe in the episode \\"Checkmate\\" when her friends were investigating Checkmate. The depiction of Sylvester bore a strong visual resemblance to Jack Knight including the use of the cosmic staff, an overcoat, and facial hair. His car the Star Rocket Racer is also seen. * The animated short film DC Showcase: Green Arrow features a short vocal cameo in the form of a news radio reporter in Star City named Sylvester The Skyman. Skyman is voiced by an uncredited Steve Blum. * A version of Sylvester Pemberton appears in the DC Universe series Stargirl portrayed by Joel McHale. While this version did operate as the Star-Spangled Kid as a teenager and his costume is inspired by his time as Skyman, his powers and superhero persona take inspiration from Starman instead. Ten years prior to the series, as seen in the pilot episode, he and the Justice Society were attacked at their base by the Injustice Society. The villains' leader, Icicle, fatally wounded Sylvester, but his sidekick and friend, Pat Dugan, evacuated him. In his dying moments, he urged Pat to find someone worthy to wield his Cosmic Staff and ensure the Justice Society's legacy survived. His staff was later found by Courtney Whitmore, who became the show's titular character and his successor. In the two-part season one finale, \\"Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.\\", a man claiming to be Pemberton searches for Pat in California.

Nida was the second super typhoon of the 2004 season, reaching a peak intensity of . Forming southeast of the Philippines, the storm strengthened as it moved northwest. The typhoon brushed the eastern Philippines causing heavy rains across the island archipelago. Nida later accelerated northeast, missing Japan to the east while becoming an extratropical cyclone. A total of $1.3 million (2004 USD) in damage occurred, and Nida left 31 fatalities. Meteorological history On May 12, a persistent area of thunderstorms formed within a monsoon trough southwest of Palau. Satellite imagery revealed a weak low-level circulation. Initially, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) forecast the storm to not strengthen. The following day, forecasters saw that the storm was strengthening and upgraded the system to tropical depression status. Forecasters at the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration designated the storm as Tropical Depression Dindo. At the time of formation, the depression was located east of Palau as it moved west northwest at 3 mph (5 km/h). Quickscat satellite imagery showed the depression's winds were near 29 mph (46 km/h) and increasing. Satellite imagery later the showed deep convection organizing over the low-level circulation. The depression underwent rapid intensification as it became a tropical storm late in the morning on May 14 and was assigned the name Nida by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Still intensifying, the storm turned northwest where it reached typhoon status later that night. Curving west-northwest at 7 mph (11 km/h), Typhoon Nida attained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane. On May 16, Nida became a super typhoon as its winds reached 165 mph (266 km/h). At its peak, its highest winds extended 35 miles (56 km) from the center. Satellite imagery showed the storm developed a defined eye measuring 25 miles (40 km) wide. On May 17, the center of Nida passed over Catanduanes Island, Philippines. After making landfall, Nida weakened and then turned more northward and slowed down. Re-entering the warmer waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, Nida's winds restrengthened to 150 mph (250 km/h). During the night of May 18, the typhoon began to weaken. Infrared satellite imagery showed the eye being obscured by high cirrostratus clouds, indicative of the weakening typhoon. The eyewall became significantly disorganized as Nida continued to recurve to the northeast. Nida accelerated northeast and its maximum sustained winds weakened to 90 mph (148 km/h). Interacting with an upper level low pressure system over Japan, the typhoon became elongated. Nida weakened below typhoon strength as the center passed 290 miles (467 km) south of Tokyo, Japan. By May 21, Nida transitioned to an extratropical cyclone. The JMA continued to track the remnants of Nida as it weakened northeast of northern Japan. Preparations and impact TRMM satellite image of Typhoon Nida on May 17, 2004 In the Philippines, evacuation centers were opened to accommodate 2,986 people. The typhoon approach cancelled ferry operations stranding 15,057 passengers. In Taiwan, forecasters at the Central Weather Bureau issued a typhoon warning as forecast models predicted a high probability of the typhoon hitting Taiwan. The warnings interrupted the preparations for the inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian. In the Philippines, winds were clocked at at Virac. on Catanduanes Island at 6 a.m. local time on May 17. The pressure at that location fell to . Structural damage was severe as the typhoon damaged or destroyed over 700‚Äì4,000 homes displacing 11,000 people. In Guimba, Nueva Ecija, Nida spawned a tornado that caused moderate damage. After the storm, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo placed eight providences under a state of emergency. Nida produced heavy rainfall across the eastern Philippines. Rainfall up to 10.6 inches (270 mm) was reported in Ombao while Naga City received 5.9 inches (150 mm) of rain. The rest of the Philippines received to of rain. 31 fatalities (20 confirmed, 11 unaccounted for) were reported during Nida's landfall. In Camotes island, nine people drowned and five were declared missing when a ferry boat sank during the storm. Elsewhere offshore, 13 crewmen were rescued when their ship ran aground near Luzon.Sun Star (2004-05-19).

Nida's impact on the PhilippinesUnited Nations Retrieved on 2006-09-27. In Japan, heavy rains produced by the outer bands of Nida triggered flash flooding and landslides in Fukushima Prefecture. Several highways were shut down due to rising waters or debris and a few homes also were inundated. In Mito, Ibaraki, 360 homes were left without power after high winds knocked down electrical wires. A section of highway in the city also collapsed. In addition to the structural damage caused by Nida, the poor weather conditions created during its passage resulted in several canceled flights by Japan Air Commuter. In Minamidait≈ç, Okinawa, a weather station operated by the WMO reported winds gusting to 71 mph (115 km/h) and a barometric pressure of . Rainfall total at the station was 1.25 inches (32 mm) with the highest at 2.79 inches (71 mm). There were no reports of damage.

It served as the first superior capital of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty (1115-1234) from 1122 to 1153 (and was a secondary capital after 1173).\\"A-ch'eng\\". (2006). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved December 4, 2006, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Its location was in present-day Acheng District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province.  History  During the early years of building up their empire, Jurchen rulers often moved people from elsewhere in China to their capital, Shangjing. The first emperor of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, Aguda (Emperor Taizu) (r. 1115-1123) resettled captives to the Shangjing area during his war against the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. Aguda's successor, Wuqimai (Emperor Taizong) (r. 1123-1134) conquered most of northern China in the wars against the Han Chinese-led Northern Song dynasty. He continued the policy, resulting in numerous wealthy people, skilled craftsmen from Yanjing (present-day Beijing) and the former Song capital, Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng), being relocated to Shangjing. Historical accounts report that, after the fall of Bianjing in 1127, the Jurchen generals brought to Shangjing (and elsewhere in North China) several thousand of people, including: \\"about 470 imperial clansmen; erudites and students of the imperial academy; eunuchs; medical doctors; artisans; prostitutes; imperial gardeners; artisans of imperial constructions; actors and actresses; astronomers; musicians\\". A variety of valuable goods captured in Bianjing was brought to the Jin capital as well.Tao (1976). Pages 28-32. In Aguda's days, palaces were not much more than tents, but in 1123, the Jurchens built their first ancestral temples and tombs (where the captured Song emperors Huizong and Qinzong were to venerate the Jin emperors' ancestors in 1128), and in 1124 the Jin dynasty's Emperor Taizong ordered a Han Chinese architect, Lu Yanlun, build a new city on uniform plan. The city plan on Shangjing emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing, although the Jin capital was much smaller than its Northern Song prototype. The capital was moved to Yanjing (present-day Beijing) in 1153 by Wanyan Liang, the fourth emperor of the Jin dynasty. Yanjing was more centrally located within the Jin Empire, and it was easier to supply it with food. Wanyan Liang is said to have support of most of his officials in this move.Tao, p.44 In 1157, Wanyan Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital. While Yanjing and later Bianjing were the Jin dynasty's principal capitals thereafter, Shangjing continued to sometimes play an important role in the Jin Empire. Wanyan Liang's successor, Emperor Shizong, who strove to revive Jurchen language and culture, spent a year in Shangjing from 1184-85, greatly enjoying hunting, traditional dancing, and speaking in Jurchen.Tao (1976). Chapter 6. \\"The Jurchen Movement for Revival\\", Pages 78-79. Modern state Ruins of the city were discovered and excavated in present-day Acheng District, Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, about 2 km from Acheng District's central urban area.

Personal Marin is a graduate of Carleton University (BA 1985) and University of Ottawa (LL.L 1988, JD 1989). Career After graduating from law school, Marin became an assistant Crown Attorney in Ottawa, Ontario in 1991 and taught law part-time in Ottawa. From September 1996 until June 1998, he served as the Director of Ontario's Special Investigations Unit (SIU). During his tenure at the SIU, the office initiated over 300 investigations, laid 5 charges resulting from those investigations and obtained no convictions. In June 1998, Marin was appointed as Canada's first military ombudsman for complaints from members of the Canadian Armed Forces. A 2006 report for the Canadian Department of National Defence found Marin had created a dysfunctional workplace at his office during his tenure, with multiple complaints and staff departures.  Ombudsman of Ontario  On April 1, 2005 Marin was appointed as Ombudsman of Ontario by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. On June 1, 2010, he was reappointed to a second five-year term ending on May 31, 2015. Office complaints In 2010, the Toronto Star investigated human rights and labour complaints made by staff under Andre Marin's tenure. Current and former staff members complained of a culture of fear and harassment. A number of complaints were filed against the ombudsman, the office and his management team with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal and the union. Marin had called the allegations \\"absurd\\". Marin was quoted as saying he had \\"high expectations\\" for his employees. In January 2011, the Ontario Press Council dismissed a complaint launched by Marin in relation to the content of a Toronto Star article which relayed information provided by former employees about his office's management practices. Council initially accepted a complaint by Marin about references in the articles to his retention of then Ottawa lawyer David Paciocco, but the complaint was ruled on and ultimately dismissed. The decision itself was \\"...the first in its 38-year history to deal with the permissible limits of investigative journalism.\\"  Notable reports  In March 2007, Marin's office released a report on the province's conduct in regards to the Ontario lottery retailer fraud scandal. In December 2010, Marin's office released a report on the province's conduct in regards to the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit. Marin said that it was \\"illegal\\" for the government to pass secret regulations allowing for the detaining of protesters during the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests. In October 2013, he released a report criticizing London, Ontario mayor Joe Fontana and city councillors for a secret meeting at a restaurant where they discussed city business. The councillors and mayor denied the report. In November 2014, Marin released a report that was critical of the Liberal government, calling it 'systematic government ineptitude\\" that led to the deaths of four children in unlicensed home daycares. The investigation was prompted after a 2-year-old child died in an unlicensed daycare in Vaughan. Marin issued an \\"unprecedented\\" 113 recommendations, and called on the province to take urgent action. Controversy over expenses In 2010, The Globe and Mail publicized some of the expenses he billed to taxpayers, including his personal grooming products, a $38 toothbrush and a $2,000 for a flat screen TV for his Ottawa home. The Star also reported that Marin used the office's corporate services director to pick-up his dry cleaning and keep an eye on Marin's maid when she cleaned his Toronto condo. In April 2015, Marin's expenses came under scrutiny again when the National Post revealed Marin had billed Ontario taxpayers an average of $14,800 in three months for housing expenses so he could maintain residences in both Toronto and Ottawa, sometimes spending more than $2,000 a month in rent while in Toronto. It is estimated Marin billed taxpayers $592,000 in housing since being appointed in 2005.  Extending term  On May 28, 2015 the Ontario Legislature voted to extend Marin's term as ombudsman until September 14, 2015 to allow him to wrap-up investigations. Over 60 people applied to become Ontario's next ombudsman, including Marin and outgoing Toronto ombudsman Fiona Crean. Social media activities Marin developed a reputation for an aggressive use of social media, including sometimes issuing personal attacks and grandstanding. Some members of the press have criticized his judgment and impartiality. In 2013, after being harassed on Twitter by an individual identifying himself as \\"Joe Mayo,\\" Marin wrongly identified a 12-year respected veteran of the Durham Region police force, Dennis Scott. Marin used the official Ontario Ombudsman Twitter account to publicly release the wrongly accused officer's badge number, police force, and salary. The officer's personal information was widely reported in the media based on Marin's information. Dennis, described as an \\"outstanding officer\\" by his superiors, began to receiving insulting and harassing emails from the public as a result of Marin's mistake. Marin publicly boasted that his (Ontario Ombudsman) staff had identified the name and badge number behind the account \\"within minutes.\\" Marin refused to answer questions as to how his staff was able to track this information when the office has no jurisdiction over police forces. In early May 2015, with his term soon coming to an end and no decision made whether to rehire him for an unprecedented third term, Marin used the Ontario Ombudsman Twitter account to call for supporters to urge for his rehiring and to retweet attacks aimed at the Liberal government and Premier Wynne. A sarcastic comment was also sent about Globe & Mail columnist Adam Radwanski's late father after Radwanski commented that his Twitter feed was being clogged with tweets aimed at Marin. Marin also endorsed tweets calling Wynne's government a \\"banana republic\\" and another tweet calling Wynne's government as corrupt as FIFA. The Globe and Mail in an editorial said he exercised \\"extremely poor judgment.\\" Andrea Horwath, leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party, defended Marin's Twitter use, saying he had good reason to cause a fuss in support of his attempts to be rehired. In July 2015, Marin acknowledged his tweets from May were a mistake and said he had learned from the experience, but defended his right to be vocal about criticizing the government.  End of tenure as ombudsman  On September 14, 2015, a motion to grant Marin a second extension was defeated in the Legislature, bringing his tenure to an end. Barbara Finlay was appointed acting Ombudsman in September 2015 and Paul Dub√© was appointed Marin's permanent successor effective April 1, 2016. Since leaving office he has taught law at the University of Ottawa. On April 15, 2016, it was revealed that Marin filed a lawsuit against the Ontario government and the office of the Ontario Ombudsman for wrongful dismissal. He is claiming $3.5 million in damages. Marin argued that he had been fired without cause or notice when he was not rehired for a third term, and that he should have been given two years notice. Marin also claimed that because he had assumed he would be rehired, he had failed to find another job, had bought a new home, and had been publicly humiliated. Justice Peter Cavanagh of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled against Marin by agreeing to requests by the legislature to dismiss the case over jurisdiction issues and to strike Marin's statement of claim from the record because it lacked a reasonable cause of action. In May 2017, the court ordered Marin pay legal costs ‚Äì $18,552 to the ombudsman's office and $49,984 to the provincial legislature. In May 2015, while still ombudsman, Marin filed a complaint with The Law Society of Upper Canada against Warren Kinsella after Kinsella repeatedly criticized his behaviour in office. In August 2016, Marin's complaint was dismissed by the law society, and no hearing was held. Later career In 2016, the town of Brighton, Ontario recommended Jon Ewart, who serves as integrity commissioner for many local municipalities, for the position of Brighton integrity commissioner. Andre Marin had applied for the same position. Marin took to social media to accuse the process of being unfair and non-transparent and asked for a halt of the hiring process. The mayor defended the municipality's process stating that Mr. Marin is not one of the 28 legal professionals recognized as municipal law specialists by the Law Society of Upper Canada. After leaving office Marin began teaching part-time in the University of Ottawa's faculty of law and writing a column for the Ottawa Sun and Toronto Sun. On December 14, 2019, he announced that he was writing his last column. Politics On September 24, 2016, Marin was named the Progressive Conservative candidate for the November 2016 by-election in Ottawa‚ÄîVanier. He was defeated by Liberal candidate Nathalie Des Rosiers by a 19-point margin, the best performance by a Progressive Conservative candidate in the riding for fifty years. In remarks given after his defeat, Marin warned that party leader Patrick Brown had to put social conservatives \\"in their place\\" because they are \\"a threat to the party\\" that might cost them the 42nd Ontario general election.

The site is now occupied by the British Army, and is now known as Robertson Barracks. History Swanton Morley was a new station planned under the RAF expansion scheme but not completed to the same standard before the start of the Second World War. It was part of No. 2 Group RAF in RAF Bomber Command until December 1944 when it was given over to 100 Group - the RAF unit responsible for countering German defences against the British strategic bombing - as they needed another airfield close to their HQ at Bylaugh Hall. On 4 July 1942, American and British airmen took off from this station as part of the first combined bombing raid of World War II. No 226 Squadron had been tutoring the US 15 Bombardment Squadron. Both Winston Churchill and General Eisenhower were at RAF Swanton Morley for this mission, which saw six crews from 15th Bombardment Squadron fly a raid with six crews from the RAF, using Boston light bombers belonging to No. 226 Squadron RAF. The raid was made at low level against German airfields in the Netherlands.24 Hours Museum - WW2 EventsHyperWar: The Army Air Force in WW2 During the Second World War the station was home to the Bomber Support Development Unit (BSDU) of No. 100 Group RAF. After the Second World War the station was home to No. 1 Air Signaller's School, and the Radio Warfare Establishment RAF, which later moved to RAF Watton. At a later date Swanton Morley became home to the Central Servicing Development Establishment (CSDE) and the Maintenance Analysis and Computing Establishment (MACE), formerly known as the Maintenance Data Centre (MDC). From June 1953 to 1995 the station was also used by 611 Volunteer Gliding School, when the station was listed for closure under Options for Change.611 VGS History The station held popular airshows during the 1980s. The station closed on 6 September 1995. It was transferred to the British Army and the station was renamed Robertson Barracks.

In terms of algebraic geometry, the equivalent definition is as an invertible sheaf, which squares to the sheaf of differentials of the first kind. Theta characteristics were introduced by History and genus 1 The importance of this concept was realised first in the analytic theory of theta functions, and geometrically in the theory of bitangents. In the analytic theory, there are four fundamental theta functions in the theory of Jacobian elliptic functions. Their labels are in effect the theta characteristics of an elliptic curve. For that case, the canonical class is trivial (zero in the divisor class group) and so the theta characteristics of an elliptic curve E over the complex numbers are seen to be in 1-1 correspondence with the four points P on E with 2P = 0; this is counting of the solutions is clear from the group structure, a product of two circle groups, when E is treated as a complex torus. Higher genus For C of genus 0 there is one such divisor class, namely the class of -P, where P is any point on the curve. In case of higher genus g, assuming the field over which C is defined does not have characteristic 2, the theta characteristics can be counted as :22g in number if the base field is algebraically closed. This comes about because the solutions of the equation on the divisor class level will form a single coset of the solutions of :2D = 0. In other words, with K the canonical class and Œò any given solution of :2Œò = K, any other solution will be of form :Œò \\\\+ D. This reduces counting the theta characteristics to finding the 2-rank of the Jacobian variety J(C) of C. In the complex case, again, the result follows since J(C) is a complex torus of dimension 2g. Over a general field, see the theory explained at Hasse-Witt matrix for the counting of the p-rank of an abelian variety. The answer is the same, provided the characteristic of the field is not 2. A theta characteristic Œò will be called even or odd depending on the dimension of its space of global sections H^0(C, \\\\Theta). It turns out that on C there are 2^{g - 1} (2^g + 1) even and 2^{g-1}(2^g - 1) odd theta characteristics. Classical theory Classically the theta characteristics were divided into these two kinds, odd and even, according to the value of the Arf invariant of a certain quadratic form Q with values mod 2. Thus in case of g = 3 and a plane quartic curve, there were 28 of one type, and the remaining 36 of the other; this is basic in the question of counting bitangents, as it corresponds to the 28 bitangents of a quartic. The geometric construction of Q as an intersection form is with modern tools possible algebraically. In fact the Weil pairing applies, in its abelian variety form. Triples (Œ∏1, Œ∏2, Œ∏3) of theta characteristics are called syzygetic and asyzygetic depending on whether Arf(Œ∏1)+Arf(Œ∏2)+Arf(Œ∏3)+Arf(Œ∏1+Œ∏2+Œ∏3) is 0 or 1. Spin structures showed that, for a compact complex manifold, choices of theta characteristics correspond bijectively to spin structures.

Ectoplasm (from the Greek ektos, meaning \\"outside\\", and plasma, meaning \\"something formed or molded\\") is a term used in spiritualism to denote a substance or spiritual energy \\"exteriorized\\" by physical mediums. It was coined in 1894 by psychical researcher Charles Richet.Blom, Jan Dirk. (2010). A Dictionary of Hallucinations. Springer. p. 168. Although the term is widespread in popular culture, the physical existence of ectoplasm is not accepted by science\\"Ectoplasm\\" . Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology, Parapsychological Association (2006-01-24). and many purported examples were exposed as hoaxes fashioned from cheesecloth, gauze or other natural substances. Phenomenon In spiritualism, ectoplasm is said to be formed by physical mediums when in a trance state. This material is excreted as a gauze-like substance from orifices on the medium's body and spiritual entities are said to drape this substance over their nonphysical body, enabling them to interact in the physical and real universe. Some accounts claim that ectoplasm begins clear and almost invisible, but darkens and becomes visible, as the psychic energy becomes stronger. Still other accounts state that in extreme cases ectoplasm will develop a strong odor. According to some mediums, the ectoplasm cannot occur in light conditions as the ectoplasmic substance would disintegrate. The psychical researcher Gustav Geley defined ectoplasm as being \\"very variable in appearance, being sometimes vaporous, sometimes a plastic paste, sometimes a bundle of fine threads, or a membrane with swellings or fringes, or a fine fabric-like tissue\\". Arthur Conan Doyle described ectoplasm as \\"a viscous, gelatinous substance which appeared to differ from every known form of matter in that it could solidify and be used for material purposes\\". The physical existence of ectoplasm has not been scientifically demonstrated, and tested samples purported to be ectoplasm have been found to be various non-paranormal substances. Other researchers have duplicated, with non-supernatural materials, the photographic effects sometimes said to prove the existence of ectoplasm. Ectenic force Eva Carri√®re and supposed ectoplasm (1912) The idea of ectoplasm was merged into the notion of an \\"ectenic force\\" by some early psychical researchers who were seeking a physical explanation for reports of psychokinesis in s√©ances. Its existence was initially hypothesized by Count Agenor de Gasparin, to explain the phenomena of table turning and tapping during s√©ances. Ectenic force was named by de Gasparin's colleague M. Thury, a professor of natural history at the Academy of Geneva. Between them, de Gasparin and Thury conducted a number of experiments in ectenic force, and claimed some success. Their work was not independently verified.Blavatsky H. P. \\"ISIS UNVEILED: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology\\", Theosophical University Press Other psychical researchers who studied mediumship speculated that within the human body an unidentified fluid termed the \\"psychode\\", \\"psychic force\\" or \\"ecteneic force\\" existed and was capable of being released to influence matter.Hamlin Garland.

Prevost Battersby. (1988). Psychic Certainties. Kessinger Reprint Edition. pp. 125-126 and William Crookes, however a later psychical researcher Hereward Carrington pointed out that the fluid was hypothetical and has never been discovered.Hereward Carrington. (2003). Eusapia Palladino and Her Phenomena. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 267 The psychical investigator W. J. Crawford (1881‚Äì1920) had claimed that a fluid substance was responsible for levitation of objects after witnessing the medium Kathleen Goligher. Crawford, after witnessing a number of her s√©ances, claimed to have obtained flashlight photographs of the substance; he later described the substance as \\"plasma\\". He claimed the substance is not visible to the naked eye but can be felt by the body.Bernard M. L. Ernst, Hereward Carrington. (2003). Houdini and Conan Doyle: The Story of a Strange Friendship. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 67 The physicist and psychical researcher Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe later investigated the medium Kathleen Goligher at many sittings and arrived at the opposite conclusions to Crawford; according to D'Albe, no paranormal phenomena such as levitation had occurred with Goligher and stated he had found evidence of fraud. D'Albe claimed the substance in the photographs of Crawford was ordinary muslin.Julian Franklyn. (2005). A Survey of the Occult. p. 383Martyn Jolly. (2006).

In the early 20th century the psychical researcher Albert von Schrenck-Notzing investigated the medium Eva Carri√®re and claimed her ectoplasm \\"materializations\\" were not from spirits but the result of \\"ideoplasty\\" in which the medium could form images onto ectoplasm from her mind.M. Brady Brower. (2010). Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France. University of Illinois Press. p. 120. Schrenck- Notzing published the book Phenomena of Materialisation (1923) which included photographs of the ectoplasm.

Kenedy & Sons. pp. 186-198 Schrenck-Notzing admitted that on several occasions Carri√®re deceptively smuggled pins into the s√©ance room. The magician Carlos Mar√≠a de Heredia replicated the ectoplasm of Carri√®re using a comb, gauze and a handkerchief. Donald West wrote that the ectoplasm of Carri√®re was fake and was made of cut-out paper faces from newspapers and magazines on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carri√®re taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it to be made from a magazine cut out with the letters \\"Le Miro\\". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir.Donald West. (1954). Psychical Research Today. Chapter S√©ance-Room Phenomena.

Mediums would also cut pictures from magazines and stick them to the cheesecloth to pretend they were spirits of the dead.Richard Whittington-Egan. (1991). William Roughhead's Chronicles of Murder. Lochar. p. 89. Another researcher, C. D. Broad, wrote that ectoplasm in many cases has proven to be composed of home material such as butter-muslin and that there is no solid evidence that it has anything to do with spirits.C. D. Broad.

The famous photograph taken by Hamilton of the medium Mary Ann Marshall (1880‚Äì1963) depicts tissue paper with a cut out of Arthur Conan Doyle's head from a newspaper. Skeptics have suspected that Hamilton may have been behind the hoax. The mediums Rita Goold and Alec Harris dressed up in their s√©ances as ectoplasm spirits and were exposed as frauds.Tony Cornell.

Personal Life  He was born on 29 June 1904, the son of Evan Ungoed Thomas, minister of Tabernacle Welsh Baptist Church, Carmarthen, for more than forty years. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School (Carmarthen), Haileybury College and Magdalen College, Oxford. He married on 19 April 1933 to Dorothy, the daughter of Jasper Travers Wolfe of county Cork. They had two sons and one daughter Ungoed-Thomas played rugby union for Leicester Tigers in 1931, featuring in 8 games between January and March and socring two tries.  Career  Before his political career, he served in the army throughout World War II, where he became a major. He was elected at the 1945 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Welsh constituency of Llandaff and Barry. His seat was abolished for the 1950 general election, but shortly afterwards the Labour MP for the new Leicester North East constituency became a High Court judge, and Ungoed-Thomas was returned to Parliament in the resulting Leicester North East by-election. Between April 1951 and October 1951, he served as Solicitor General, and received the customary knighthood. He held the seat until resigned from the House of Commons in 1962, when he became a High Court judge, assigned to the Chancery Division. He remained on the High Court until his death in 1972.  The European Convention on Human Rights  He was a member of the British delegation to the Council of Europe, where he argued strongly for the creation of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, he opposed the creation of a Court to oversee the implementation of the Convention and to provide the protections within it. He, along with Rolin of France, proposed on 6 September 1949 that the Legal Committee's recommendation of a Court be rejected.Janis, M.W., Kay, R.S., Bradley, A.W., 2010, European Human Rights Law: Text and Materials, Oxford, pg. 16, They believed that both a European Commission of Human Rights and a European Court of Human Rights were unnecessary. One of several objections they had was the proposal that individuals, not just states, could seek redress for alleged violations through the Court. Ungoed-Thomas opposed the right to individual petition because he felt that individuals could 'bring one of the States to trial even after examination and with the authority of a \\"sorting organization\\"'.Ibid. After two days of debate on the issue, on 8 September 1949, Rolin and Ungoed- Thomas' amendment rejecting a European Court of Human Rights was itself rejected.Ibid. Ungoed-Thomas then proposed that individuals not be allowed to petition the Commission. \\"Personally I object to this right of individuals going to the Commission for this reason. I foresee shoals of applications being made by individuals who imagine that they have a complaint of one kind or another against the country ... In my opinion the objection to the Commission is as great as the objection to the Court.\\"Ibid. at 17 He was supported in this objection by the likes of Sundt of Norway who felt that the right of individual petition would open a flood of claims against signatory States.Ibid. Ultimately, the right to individual petition became an optional clause, in part due to these objections raised, under the original Article 25 of the Convention. The right of individual petition has been mandatory since the adoption of a revised European Convention on Human Rights in 1998.

World War I A DH.5 aeroplane of No. 2 Squadron, AFC (AKA \\"68 squadron RFC\\") No. 2 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps was formed at Heliopolis, Egypt in 1916. For a while it was known to the British military as \\"No. 68 Squadron RFC\\" - according to some accounts in order to avoid confusion with No. 2 Squadron, RFC. This designation was never accepted by the squadron or the Australian Imperial Force, and was in fact officially dropped by the British by early 1918, before the formation of the RAF. Initially equipped with Airco DH.5 aircraft, the unit's main role with these aircraft was the strafing of hostile trenches. In January 1918 the unit was re-equipped with S.E.5a fighters, which it retained for the rest of the war. The squadron claimed 77 enemy aircraft destroyed. It remained in Europe until 28 February 1919 when it was disbanded. World War II During World War II, a new No. 68 squadron (the first RAF squadron to actually bear the number) was formed at RAF Catterick on 7 January 1941 as a night fighter squadron equipped with Bristol Blenheims and became operational on 7 April before moving to High Ercall. In May 1941 No. 68 converted to Bristol Beaufighters and in March 1942 it moved to RAF Coltishall in Norfolk. In July 1944 the Squadron converted to de Havilland Mosquitoes. From July 1941 No. 68 Squadron always had a strong element of Czechoslovak airmen in exile, with up to eight flying crews consisting entirely of Czechoslovak personnel. One flight of the squadron was Czechoslovak. Notable pilots included flying ace Miloslav Mansfeld, who as a Beaufighter pilot shot down numerous Luftwaffe bombers and as a Mosquito pilot shot down two V-1 flying bombs. From October 1943 Mansfeld commanded the squadron's \\"A\\" flight. The poet James Farrar was a Pilot Officer of 68 Squadron. He was killed on the night of 25/26 July 1944 when, on patrol over the Thames (as navigator of a Mosquito piloted by Fred Kemp), he was ordered to intercept a V1 flying bomb. Both the Czechoslovak element and the squadron's night fighter service were honoured in 1944 when Air Chief Marshal Charles Steele presented a badge to the squadron that shows an owl's head and has the Czech motto V≈ædy p≈ôipraven ‚Äì \\"Always prepared\\" or \\"Always ready\\". No. 68 Squadron was deactivated on 20 April 1945 with the personnel joining various other units including No. 125 Squadron RAF. 1950s On 1 January 1952 the squadron was re-formed as a night-fighter unit at RAF Wahn in West Germany. It flew Gloster Meteors until renumbered as No. 5 Squadron RAF on 20 January 1959.

Overview In his own words, Bernays describes engineering consent as \\"use of an engineering approach‚Äîthat is, action based only on thorough knowledge of the situation and on the application of scientific principles and tried practices to the task of getting people to support ideas and programs.\\" Bernays explained, \\"Professionally, [public relations] activities are planned and executed by trained practitioners in accordance with scientific principles, based on the findings of social scientists. Their dispassionate approach and methods may be likened to those of the engineering professions which stem from the physical sciences.\\"Bernays 1955 page 4 The threat of engineered consent in democracy has been expressed in a textbook on American government:John C. Livingston & Robert G. Thompson (1966) The Consent of the Governed, 2nd edition, page 11, Collier Macmillan :Under modern conditions of political advertising and manipulation, it has become possible to talk of the engineering of consent by an elite of experts and professional politicians. Consent that is thus engineered is difficult to distinguish in any fundamental way from the consent that supports modern totalitarian governments. Were the manipulated voter to become the normal voter, the government he supports could hardly be said to rest on his consent in any traditional sense of that word. To some observers, consumer psychologists have already made the choice for people before they buy a certain product. Marketing is often based on themes and symbols that unconsciously influence consumer behavior.  Essay  The essay first appeared in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. The author's observations in the essay include the following: * The United States has become a small room where a single whisper is magnified thousands of times. * There are two divisions in media: commercial and organized group information systems. * Today‚Äôs leaders have become more remote physically from the public, yet, at the same time, the public has much greater familiarity with these leaders through the system of modern communications...Increased influence of mass media is due to widespread and enormously rapid diffusion of literacy. * With the aid of technicians in the field who have specialized in utilizing the channels of communications, [some leaders] have been able to achieve purposefully and scientifically what we have termed \\"the engineering of consent\\". * The freedoms of press, speech, petition and assembly, the freedoms which make the engineering of consent possible, are among the most cherished guarantees in the Constitution of the United States. * Under no circumstances should the engineering of consent supersede or displace the educational system, either formal or informal, in bringing about understanding by the people as the basis for their actions. The engineering of consent often does supplement the educational process. * The chief function [of the profession] is to analyze objectively and realistically the position of its client vis-a-vis a public, and to advise as to the necessary corrections in its client‚Äôs attitudes towards and approaches to that public. * It must be remembered of course that good will, the basis of lasting adjustment, can be preserved in the long run, only by those whose actions warrant it...The public relations counsel has the professional responsibility to push only those ideas that he can respect, and not to promote causes or accept assignments for clients he considers anti-social. * As in physical engineering, a feasibility study must be done and a budget drawn up. * The engineer of consent must be powerfully equipped with facts, with truths, with evidence before he shows himself before a public. * Bernays recommends World Almanac with lists of thousands of associations across the United States ‚Äì a cross-section of the country. * The public‚Äôs attitudes, ideas, presumptions or prejudices result from definite influences. One must try to find out what they are in any situation in which one is working. * Democratic society is actually only a loose aggregate of constituent groups...To influence the public, the engineer of consent works with and through group leaders and opinion moulders on every level. * Research furnishes the equivalent of the mariner's chart, the architect's blue print,the traveler's road map. * Themes must appeal to the motives of the public. Motives are the activation of both conscious and subconscious pressure created by the force of desires * Organization also correlates the activities of any specialists who may be called upon from time to time, such as opinion researchers, fund raisers, publicity men, radio and motion picture experts, specialists for women's clubs or foreign language groups, and the like. * Set in motion a broad activity, the success of which depends on interlocking all phases and elements of the proposed strategy, implemented by tactics that are timed to the moment of maximum effectiveness. * The developing of events and circumstances that are not routine is one of the basic functions of the engineer of consent. Book In 1955 University of Oklahoma Press published Bernays' book The Engineering of Consent. In fact Bernays contributed only the first chapter (22 pages) \\"The Theory and Practice of Public Relations: A Resum√©\\". The seven other chapters were by his associates: \\"Objectives\\" by Howard Walden Cutler, \\"Research\\" by Sherwood Dodge, \\"Strategy\\" by Nicholas Samstag, \\"Themes and Symbols\\" by Doris Fleischman and H.W. Cutler, \\"Organization for public relations\\" by John Price Jones, \\"Planning\\" by Benjamin Fine, and \\"The tactics of public relations\\" by A. Robert Ginsburgh. The longest chapter, the one on strategy, begins with sociological and psychological observations on human motivation drawn from Karl Menninger and Vilfredo Pareto. Samstag illustrates varieties of strategy with sample cases before the public. He details aspects of timing, forbearance, approach, surprise, participation, association, disassociation, crossroads, personalization, bland withdrawal, apparent withdrawal, apparent runner-up, omission, reversal, mosaic, and understatement. Reviews A. Edgar SchulerA. Edgar Schuler (1956) Review: The Engineering of Consent, Rural Sociology 21(1):80, link from Cornell University Core Historical Literature of Agriculture called the book a \\"convenient and compact introduction to the field of public relations.\\" He singles out Samstag‚Äôs chapter as \\"interesting, enlightening, provocative, and poignant.\\" M. Weisglas reviewed the book for International Communication Gazette,M. Weisglas (1956) \\"Review: Engineering of Consent\\", International Communication Gazette 2:59 writing that \\"Bernays and company have deluded their readers with false hopes about public relations.\\" Women‚Äôs smoking In a practical example of Edward Bernays‚Äô theory detailed in his essay, George Washington Hill, president of the American Tobacco Company, hired Edward Bernays in 1928 to lead a campaign to entice more women to smoke in public. The campaign is believed to have helped converting attitudes towards women's smoking from a social taboo to a more socially acceptable act. Bernays did this by associating women‚Äôs smoking with the ideas of \\"power\\" and \\"freedom\\" which he did by using the slogan Torches of Freedom during a famous parade in New York City. The idea of ‚ÄúEngineering of Consent‚Äù was motivated by Freud‚Äôs idea that humans are irrational beings, and are motivated primarily by inner desires hidden in their unconscious. If one understood what those unconscious desires were, then one could use this to one‚Äôs advantage to sell products and increase sales.Lynn T. Tanoue (2000) \\"Cigarette Smoking and Women's Respiratory Health\\", Clinics in Chest Medicine 21(1): 47‚Äì65 Influence The Engineering of Consent also applies to the pioneered application of Freudian psychoanalytic concepts and techniques to business‚Äîin particular to the study of consumer behavior in the marketplace. Ideas established strongly influenced the practices of the advertising industry in the twentieth century. The techniques applied developing the \\"consumer lifestyle\\" were also later applied to developing theories in cultural commodification; which has proven successful in the later 20th century (with diffusion of cultures throughout North America) to sell ethnic foods and style in popular mainstream culture by removing them from geography and ethnic histories and sanitizing them for a general public. Ernest Dichter applied what he dubbed \\"the strategy of desire\\" for building a \\"stable society,\\" by creating for the public a common identity through the products they consumed; again, much like with cultural commodification, where culture has no \\"identity,\\" \\"meaning,\\" or \\"history\\" inherited from previous generations, but rather, is created by the attitudes which are introduced by consumer behaviors and social patterns of the period. According to Dichter, \\"To understand a stable citizen, you have to know that modern man quite often tries to work off his frustrations by spending on self-sought gratification. Modern man is internally ready to fulfill his self-image, by purchasing products which compliment it.\\" See also * Subliminal message * The Century of the Self * Manufacturing Consent * Nudge theory Notes References * The Engineering of Consent, University of California at Los Angeles * \\"Torches of Freedom\\", The Museum of Public Relations.

It was directed by Charles Vidor, who died during the shooting of the picture and was replaced by George Cukor. It was produced by William Goetz from a screenplay by Oscar Millard, revised (uncredited) by Walter Bernstein and based on screenwriter Oscar Saul's original 1952 script (uncredited).Turner Classic Movies Website, accessed March 31, 2009 The music score was by Morris Stoloff and Harry Sukman with music by Franz Liszt, and the cinematography by James Wong Howe and Charles Lang (uncredited). The film also features music of those contemporaries of Liszt whom he unselfishly championed by featuring them in his numerous performances (e.g., Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, among others).Abram Chasins, \\"Song Without End\\", Colpix Records, 1960,(LP), Liner notes. The film stars Dirk Bogarde as Franz Liszt, Capucine (in her acting debut) as Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, and Genevi√®ve Page as Marie d'Agoult, with Patricia Morison as George Sand, Alexander Davion as Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Lyndon Brook as Richard Wagner, Albert Rueprecht as Prince Felix Lichnowsky, Erland Erlandsen as Sigismond Thalberg, Ivan Desny, Martita Hunt, Lou Jacobi, and Marcel Dalio. Background Columbia Pictures had plans to film The Franz Liszt Story back in 1952. Studio head Harry Cohn hired his friend, acclaimed screenwriter Oscar Saul (A Streetcar Named Desire), to produce his own original screenplay with William Dieterle set to direct. When the studio delayed going forward with the project due to production and casting issues for three years, Oscar Saul backed out, and Columbia announced in 1955 that Gottfried Reinhardt had been commissioned to write a new screenplay. In 1958, veteran producer William Goetz took over the project with Oscar Millard as his screenwriter. Charles Vidor, who previously directed A Song to Remember (1945), a biopic of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, was assigned to direct using elements of all three screenwriters' scripts. As nearly 40 musical selections were heard in the film, Morris Stoloff, head of Columbia's music department, began immediate work on the soundtrack. After selecting the pieces to be played, he engaged piano virtuoso Jorge Bolet, the Roger Wagner Chorale and the Los Angeles Philharmonic to perform the score. Harry Sukman was in charge of the music editing and adaptations that were required for the musical score. Musicologist Abram Chasins was a musical consultant on the film. The recording of the music (by Earl Mounce) was completed before the start of production so that Bogarde could learn the finger movements necessary to make him appear to be playing the piano realistically in the film. Musical adviser Victor Aller spent three weeks rehearsing Bogarde in proper piano technique. As for the image of the composer, the film makers made Dirk Bogarde look more like Elvis Presley, sticking not to historical accuracy, but to the popular trend of late 1950s. Soundtracks Two notable soundtracks were recorded in 1960, one by each of the composers of the Oscar-winning score. Colpix Records, a division of Columbia Pictures released Song Without End: Original Soundtrack Recording featuring the pianist Jorge Bolet playing seven of Franz Liszt's compositions. The Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra was conducted by Morris Stoloff. Orchestral selections included four selections from the film's repertoire, and two selections reminded listeners of Liszt's organ virtuosity (uncredited performer..accompanied by \\"The Song Without End\\" chorus).

Una nueva especie de Oxynotus de las costas de Venezuela. Estaci√≥n de Investigaciones Marinas de Margarita, Fundaci√≥n La Salle de Ciencias Naturales, Contribuci√≥n 3:1‚Äì10  Description  Oxynotus caribbaeus is a small shark found in the upper continental slope of Venezuela; it is easily distinguishable from other Oxynotus species. Adult males reach a maximum size of in length and the females are thought to grow even longer, although none has been examined. The Caribbean roughshark has a short, blunt snout and head. This chubby-looking shark looks nothing like the typical shark. It has two dorsal fins that help differentiate this shark from other Oxynotus species. Its first dorsal fin is inclined forward, is very long and thick, and triangular in shape. The second dorsal fin is similar to the first, although it is not as long. However, as some other Oxynotus species, the Caribbean roughshark does not have an anal fin. It has the typical shark coarse dermal denticles, but these are atypically large for the size of the shark. It contains small, circular spiracles at the dorsal base of its head. The supraorbital ridges are not expanded and do not form a knob in front of the spiracles. It has lanceolate upper teeth, containing 12 rows and lower bladelike teeth containing 12 rows. It has distinct color features that make it easily identifiable. On the head, body, and tail, it has light, greyish skin, patterned with dark bands and blotches, although it contains noticeably lighter color patterns on its pectoral fins and pelvic fins.Rogers, Mike. \\"Best Shark eBook Ever!.\\" Caribbean Roughshark.

N.p., n.d. Web. 30 November 2013. . However, sightings of the Caribbean roughshark have happened in the waters off of the Bahamas, Honduras, and Venezuela. It occupies water at a range of . At that range, the water temperature is at about 10 ¬∞C. This means it has a bathydemersal habitat or is a demersal fish.  Diet  Little is known about this shark, but due to its unusual dentition, the spear-shaped upper teeth and blade-like lower teeth, it feeds on invertebrates and fishes found near the bottom of their habitat.  Breeding  This species of shark is an ovoviviparous species, meaning the embryos develop inside eggs, which are retained inside the mother's body until the eggs are ready to hatch. The sizes of these shark pups are thought to be 20 to 21 cm long, for both male and females examined.  Threats and conservation  This species of shark lives in depths where deepwater fisheries operate, which can have a negative impact on a population of shark that is already uncommon and virtually unknown. Deepwater fisheries usually find O. caribbaeus as bycatch. As uncommon as it is found as a bycatch, it can still have a negative impact due to the small population observed in the inshore waters. This shark has little to no commercial uses. Though when caught, the most probably use of O. caribbaeus is fishmeal or bait. Sometimes, it can be processed for oil or human consumption, by smoking and salting.

The species lived in estuaries during the Givetian epoch of the Middle Devonian, 390 million years ago in what is now the Georgina Basin of Western Queensland, Australia. The paleontologist Gavin Young, named the fossil agnathan Pituriaspis doylei after the hallucinogenic drug pituri, as he thought he might be hallucinating upon viewing the fossil fish's bizarre form.Long, John A. The Rise of Fishes: 500 Million Years of Evolution. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996. The first specimens of P. doylei were empty sandstone casts of the head shields, with none of the original bone remaining. P. doylei vaguely resembled the Osteostraci, though neither are considered to be close relatives. The headshield extends posteriorly to form a long abdominal division which probably reached the anal region. The dorsal portion of its head armor differs from osteostracans in that the orbits of the eyes are set apart from each other, and that the shield has no pineal foramen (the \\"hole\\" between the eyes of Cephalaspis and its relatives), and that an opening at the base of the rostrum gives very little hints about the nature of the nasal openings. The exoskeleton is ornamented with tiny rounded tubercles. A unique characteristic of the Pituriaspida is a peculiar pit, which may have held some sort of sensory organ in life, located ventrally to the orbits, known as the adorbital depression. Almost nothing is known of the rest of the body, save that it had a pair of well-developed pectoral fins, similar to osteostracans and gnathostome fish. References Bibliography *Janvier, Philippe.

It was associated with Awa Province in modern-day Tokushima Prefecture on the island of Shikoku; and it was associated with Awaji Province in modern-day Hy≈çgo Prefecture. In the han system, Tokushima was a political and economic abstraction based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B. Hauser. (1987). The Bakufu in Japanese History, p. 150. In other words, the domain was defined in terms of kokudaka, not land area.Elison, George and Bardwell L. Smith (1987). Warlords, Artists, & Commoners: Japan in the Sixteenth Century, p. 18. This was different from the feudalism of the West. History Ruled by the Hachisuka family, it was rated at an income of 256,000 koku. Uncharacteristically for most domains of the Edo period, the Hachisuka were in control of Tokushima before the start of the period and remained in possession of it through the period's end. In the early Meiji era, there was a major source of conflict within the domain, as the retainers of Inada Kurobei, Lord Hachisuka's senior councilor and warden of Sumoto Castle, demanded independence for their lord and his establishment as a daimy≈ç. With Inada's income already over 10,000 koku, this was technically possible; however, it was refused, and met with violent opposition from Tokushima. After the \\"revolt\\" was put down, the entire Inada clan and its retainers were exiled to the far northern tip of Hokkaido. Their experiences are fictionalized in the recent film Kita no Zeronen (\\"Year One in the North\\").  List of daimy≈çs  The hereditary daimy≈çs were head of the clan and head of the domain.

It was created in 1906 at The Ohio State University. There are currently eight active chapters of Delta Theta Sigma. Purpose of Delta Theta Sigma As stated in its constitution: > We, the members of Delta Theta Sigma Fraternity, in order to promote > agriculture, to secure a higher degree of scholarship, to foster the spirit > of brotherhood in our vocation, and to ensure social and cultural unity, do > promote our organization to the fulfillment of these ideals. Common Interests The brotherhood of Delta Theta Sigma is composed of elite agriculture majors from all over the United States. The national Delta Theta Sigma network includes eight chapters through Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, University of Minnesota, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìRiver Falls, Purdue University, Wilmington College of Ohio, and University of Minnesota-Crookston. Brothers share common interests in agriculture and outdoor recreation. A majority of the members have agricultural and/or rural backgrounds, which provide common bonds through experiences. History of Delta Theta Sigma In the spring of 1906, several men gathered together in a rooming house at 175 West 9th Avenue in Columbus, Ohio. The idea, conceived primarily by three men, Maxwell Corotius, Samuel N. Kerr, and Stanley B. Stowe, was the actual beginning of Delta Theta Sigma Fraternity at The Ohio State University. The fraternity was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio on April 5, 1907 with 17 charter members. The name, Delta Theta Sigma, and the fourfold purposes of the fraternity were drafted with the advice of Professor Smith of the Greek Language Department at Ohio State University. The Delta Theta Sigma idea was contagious, not only at The Ohio State University but also on many other agricultural college campuses throughout the Midwest. Within a few years chapters had been organized on ten other campuses. At a national convention in 1912, all of the chapters except the original chapter at Ohio State University voted to make Delta Theta Sigma an agricultural honorary fraternity. The local chapter at The Ohio State University retained the original name, Delta Theta Sigma. The other ten chapters, therefore, assumed the name, Gamma Sigma Delta. On November 26, 1927, representatives from Delta Theta Sigma at The Ohio State University, local Alpha Gamma Phi at Pennsylvania State University, and a former FarmHouse chapter at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison met in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in Room 211 of the William Penn Hotel. This meeting resulted in the formation of a new national agriculture fraternity, Delta Theta Sigma. Within a two-year period from 1957-1958 all three chapters moved into new houses. Gamma chapter at Wisconsin expanded from one house into two houses located at 320 North Lathrop Street. Beta chapter at Pennsylvania was the victim of a costly fire during the winter of 1958. They were fortunate, however, and found an excellent house at 101 North Patterson Street, into which they moved during the spring of 1958. Alpha chapter at Ohio State outgrew the old house and moved into a new chapter home located at 80 East 13th Avenue in March 1958. This same year, 1958, found the fraternity growing nationally, also. A fourth chapter, Delta, at the University of Minnesota, was organized and approved for membership in National Delta Theta Sigma in May 1958. During the 1960-61 school year, Delta chapter rented their first and present chapter home located at 1485 North Cleveland Avenue. Then, in the fall of 1966 growth required they would rent the downstairs of the house next door at 1495 North Cleveland Avenue. In 1969, our fifth chapter, Epsilon, was chartered at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls. Albert Beaver, Gamma chapter alumnus, was instrumental in organizing Epsilon, and in 1970, helped them to purchase the house in which they are presently located. Our sixth chapter, Zeta, was organized and chartered at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, in the spring of 1982. With the help of four alumni Neils Neilson, Gamma; George Van Soyoc and Jim Vorst, Alpha; and Herb Olm, Delta, the thirteen charter members and one new member, were activated by National Delta Theta Sigma officers in May 1982. Zeta was very fortunate to be able to rent a house their first year and are presently located at 321 Vine Street. In January 1983 agricultural students at Wilmington College of Ohio had a desire to belong to a national fraternity. Through the leadership of senior J. Timothy McCarty, thirty-six students were recruited and expressed desire to become founding fathers of Eta chapter. With the direction of National Officer Rick Harr, the Eta chapter was organized and chartered in the Spring of 1983. With the help of the National Executive Council, the purchase of a large house near campus was made. The Chapter House at 780 Rombach Ave. in Wilmington was occupied in January 1984. In 1997 Delta Theta Sigma colonized the University of Minnesota-Crookston Chapter with much help from the Men of Delta chapter. Theta chapter was officially recognized as a chapter at the 1998 Conclave hosted by Delta chapter. Theta Chapter was renting a house located at 101 North Nelson. They now reside in a house located at 204 Gorgas Ave. The current president of Theta chapter is Drew Opdahl. .

The station is licensed to Azle, Texas, with a transmitter site located north of Decatur, Texas. It is currently owned by Educational Media Foundation after purchase from Liberman Broadcasting in early November 2012. Air1 is a Christian Worship music radio network in the United States. History Early beginnings KDSX-FM was licensed for Denison-Sherman in 1967. In late 1976, B.V. Hammond, Jr. and Lofton L. Hendrick sold the station to Grayson County Broadcasters, Inc., which sold the station the next year to Radiozark Broadcasters. As Radiozark did not buy KDSX AM radio (now KKLF in Richardson), it changed the callsign to KDSQ. In the 1990s, KDSQ made a series of technical improvements, changing from class A to C3 in 1991 and becoming a full class C station with 92 kW ERP from a transmitter northeast of Decatur in 1999. These improvements allowed the station to enter the Dallas-Fort Worth radio market. The station changed calls three times in five years, becoming KDVE in 1995, KIKM in 1997, and KZMP in 1999. Entravision Communications bought Z Spanish Media in 1999, resulting in its acquisition of KZMP. The callsign changed again in 2003, to KTCY. Liberman Broadcasting (now Estrella Media as of February 2020) bought some of Entravision's radio assets on August 4, 2006 and relaunched KTCY \\"Concierto 101.7\\" as XO 101.7, retaining the same Spanish-language pop music but with different DJs and programming. The station moved toward a more romantic sound beginning in 2009. In early 2012, KTCY briefly returned to Latin Pop as \\"Baila 101.7\\" [Baila is Spanish for \\"Dance\\"]. It competed for head-on with CBS Radio-owned KMVK Mega 107.5 and Univision Radio-owned KDXX M√°xima 99.1. \\"Baila 101.7\\" previously broadcast music Sunday through Friday for a full 24 hours. However, on Saturday, 7-10 AM was reserved for Infomercials. The station ran jockless throughout its short tenure. Previous Baila logo used until February 8, 2013. Acquisition by EMF It was announced on November 5, 2012, that Educational Media Foundation, owner of Christian Contemporary K-LOVE and then Christian Rock Air1, would expand to the Dallas/Fort Worth area by purchasing KTCY from Liberman for $6 million. As Entercom-owned classic hits station KLUV 98.7 owns the \\"K-Love\\" branding in the Dallas/Fort Worth market, it was assumed that the station would take Air1 to avoid confusion.EMF Expands To Dallas/Fort Worth - Radio Insight (released November 5, 2012) On February 8, the station went off the air to make way for EMF's takeover. EMF reserved the KYDA call letters for the current format that launched at 4 PM on February 12, 2013.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/79529/emf-expands-to-dallasfort- worth/ Signal Unlike most of the area's FM stations like competitor KLTY, which transmit their signals from Cedar Hill, KYDA transmits its signal from an unincorporated area within the county borders of Cooke, Montague, and Wise.

The Windsor and Hantsport Railway is a short line railway which operated a former Canadian Pacific Railway line in HRM from its interchange point with CN at Windsor Junction through to the agricultural heartland of Nova Scotia at New Minas in the Annapolis Valley. This rail line ceased operation in 2010, however the track and right of way remain intact for a possible future resumption of service. Ocean Limited at HalifaxVia Rail Canada also operates from the Halifax Railway Station where the Ocean, a passenger train equipped with sleeper cars operates three days a week to Truro, Moncton, and Montreal. The Halifax Railway Station also serves as the terminus for intercity buses (operated by Maritime Bus) which connect with destinations across the Maritimes. Two important branch rail lines operated by CN were abandoned in the Halifax Regional Municipality in recent decades. One line ran along the Eastern Shore from Dartmouth to Musquodoboit Harbour and up the Musquodoboit Valley, serving the agriculture and forestry and pelletized lime industries. The other line ran along the South Shore from Halifax to Bridgewater and on to Yarmouth. The rail corridors of both routes are still intact and used as recreational pathways, preserved by the provincial and municipal governments for possible reinstatement of rail service. Surface infrastructure ;Roads and bridges The A. Murray MacKay Bridge is one of two suspension bridges across Halifax Harbour. Together, they carry 100,000 vehicles per day.About Mackay Bridge About Macdonald Bridge The urban core is divided by Halifax Harbour and is linked by two suspension bridges: the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge, since 1955, and the A. Murray MacKay Bridge, since 1970. Traffic is problematic in older parts of the urban core area due to geographic constrictions and an aging road network designed for less vehicle capacity than is currently being handled. The Halifax Peninsula, similar to an island, has several bottleneck points through which any traffic leaving the area must pass: * the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge * the A. Murray MacKay Bridge * the Armdale traffic circle * the Bayers Road and Connaught Avenue interchange to the Highway 102 freeway * the Windsor Street exchange in Fairview with the Bedford Highway (Trunk 2) ;Traffic and congestion Traffic on Barrington Street, Halifax's main street.Vehicle traffic density is increasing somewhat on the peninsula, however, the population of workers living in suburban areas or commuting from more distant exurban/outskirts has increased at a much higher rate in recent decades. Roads in existing developed suburban areas and the historic districts on the Halifax Peninsula cannot be easily expanded. pedway\\" system featuring passages over and under streets and through shopping centres and office towers. Several controversial road widening projects are being debated, including one for Bayers Road, and for Robie Street, the major north-south artery on the peninsula. Chebucto Road was widened for a distance of between Mumford Road and the Armdale Roundabout, expanding the width from 2 lanes to 3 (centre reversible). It was controversial because the municipal government expropriated land from residential landowners. ; Provincial roads and expressways Some newer neighbourhoods in the municipality include a network of expressways (Nova Scotia 100-series highways) developed during the 1960s-1980s (Highways 101, 102, 103, 107, 111, and 118); however these roads serve mainly to dump high- speed traffic onto the low-speed urban street network. Many of the roads in the rural areas of the municipality are two lane provincial collector and trunk highways, the longest being Trunk 7 which runs from Bedford east to the boundary with Guysborough County at Ecum Secum. ;Proposed infrastructure In 1963, an urban expressway to be called Harbour Drive was proposed to run along the eastern side of the Peninsula.Halifax Municipal Archives, Feature Map: Harbour Drive Proposal, 1963, Accessed September 20, 2016 it met with fierce opposition, but not before construction of the Cogswell Interchange, what would turn out to be an overbuilt series of roads, ramps and roadway immediately north of the downtown, effectively curtailing its natural development. By 2014, the infrastructure had aged sufficiently to warrant its removal and in 2016 the municipal government voted to hire a company to develop a plan for its removal and replacement by a more appropriate road network. A proposed bridge across the Northwest Arm to relieve traffic congestion on the Armdale Rotary (it would connect at South Street near Dalhousie University) was rejected several times by residents of the peninsula's affluent South End and by environmentalists advocating improved rapid transit and better planning to densify residential development close to locations of employment. In 2008 the Halifax Dartmouth Bridge Commission released a report on a possible third harbour crossing which considered both a six-lane bridge, costing $1.1 Billion, and a four-lane tunnel, costing $1.4 Billion, extending from the southern terminus of Highway 111 to the southern end of the peninsula near the Halifax Ocean Terminals. Because of the insular nature of the central business area, the concept of congestion tolling has been floated in the city from time to time. In 2011, a scholarly report studied the feasibility of implementing such a scheme. Transit Urban core The HRM urban core is served by Halifax Transit which was formed on March 1, 1981 through the merger of the municipally owned Halifax Transit Corporation and its counterpart the Dartmouth Transit Corporation. The main forms of public transportation are standard transit buses and a new bus-rapid transit system, as well as the Halifax‚ÄìDartmouth Ferry Service in Halifax Harbour. The ferry system uses three vessels, with a fourth under construction, and connects peninsular Halifax with Dartmouth, offering daily services. It is the oldest continuously operating saltwater ferry service in North America. Controversial high-speed ferries are under consideration for connecting downtown Halifax with Shannon Park, Bedford, the South Mainland, and Eastern Passage. The proposed high speed ferry services are viewed with concern by other harbour users and are viewed as a compromise solution for connecting travellers from points along the harbour with downtown Halifax and Dartmouth. Transit surveys have indicated that many existing and potential future users of public transit require service to areas such as universities, hospitals and shopping centres, many of which are located near or adjacent to railway corridors in the region. Former mayor, Peter Kelly, and several regional councillors have favoured instituting a commuter rail or a light rail system on current and abandoned railway lines and several streets in the urban core, however such a proposal would require provincial and federal funding and agreement with railway companies. It has been shelved by HRM staff and politicians, pending the provincial government's creation of a regional transportation planning authority, similar to what eastern Massachusetts did in the 1960s when MBTA was created. Halifax Street Railway Co., ca. 1894 Historically, the Halifax Peninsula had an extensive streetcar transit system dating to the late 1800s. Operated by various private companies including the \\"Halifax Street Railway Co.\\", the \\"Nova Scotia Power Co.\\" (not the same company as the present electric utility), the \\"Halifax Electric Tramway Co.\\", the \\"Nova Scotia Tramways and Power Co.\\", and the \\" Nova Scotia Light and Power Company, Limited\\", the streetcar system was abandoned by NSL&P; on March 26, 1949. Streetcars were replaced by an electric trolley coach system, however, the last electric trolley coaches were replaced by conventional diesel buses on January 1, 1970 operated by the Halifax Transit Corporation. Rural areas Halifax Transit's new Bridge Terminal opened in 2012 and links urban and rural transit routes.A community transit bus service is also run by Halifax Transit, serving the exurban communities of Beaver Bank, Fall River, East Preston, Lake Echo, Porters Lake and Grand Desert. However, there is little to no public transit available for residents in more rural areas especially for the Eastern Shore, South Shore and Musquodoboit Valley area of the municipality; this has become a growing bone of contention driving the urban-rural tension within the region. The rural area are dependent upon privately operated bus and shuttle services, as well as individual car pooling. The municipality plans to extend its community bus program along the Eastern Shore and Musquodoboit Valley which will see buses operate from Dartmouth to Sheet Harbour to Upper Musquodoboit to Enfield and return to Dartmouth, however there is no timeline for its implementation and the proposal is currently being studied and surveyed . Halifax Regional Municipality is currently studying the possibility of implementing a series of expanded bus rapid transit services along expressways such as Highways 102, 103 and 107. A Rural Express Bus (MetroX) began servicing Upper Tantallon, Nova Scotia in August 2009. Walking and cycling  The Chain of Lakes Multipurpose Trail, was opened in 2011, adds 7.25 kilometres to the off-road trail network in HRM.Halifax Regional Municipality, Chain of Lakes TrailThere are many parks and some disconnected trails in the HRM urban core. There are proposals for a Halifax Urban Greenway, which is envisioned to ultimately connect or construct trails around the entire perimeter of Halifax Harbour and the Bedford Basin to link downtown Halifax and Dartmouth, however implementation is moving slowly. The most notable achievement to date was the completion in 2011 of the Beaufort Avenue Multi-use Trail in South End Halifax.Halifax Urban Greenway Most streets in the urban core have sidewalks and pedestrian crossings for major roads are signalized. The Chain of Lakes Multipurpose Trail uses a rail corridor purchased from CN in 2011. Formerly known as the Chester Spur, it was once part of the Halifax and Southwestern Railway, and was abandoned in 2009. Halifax Regional Council has a stated interest in improving bicycle transport in the urban core. After the 2000 municipal election a part-time coordinating position was created to oversee the planning and implementation of a bicycle transport plan which was published in 2002 as the Blueprint for a Bicycle-Friendly HRM.HRM Blueprint for a Bicycle-Friendly HRM Website The coordinating position was eliminated during budget cuts in 2003 but a new permanent position was later created, that of Active Transportation coordinator. A cycling map was published in 2005 and updated in 2009 and 2012.Halifax Regional Municipality, HRM website Meanwhile, an Active Transportation master plan was completed in 2006Halifax Regional Municipality, Master plan webpage and a plan review was initiated in 2013. The 3-kilometre Dartmouth Harbourfront WalkwayHalifax Regional Municipality, Dartmouth Harbourfront Walkway was built in 2003 and the 6-kilometre Bedford-Sackville Connector was completed in 2006 at a cost of nearly a million dollars.Halifax Regional Municipality, 2006 press release on its completion, it allowed pedestrians and cyclists to safely move between suburban Sackville and Bedford for the first time since the completion of Highway 102 in the 1960s.Halifax Regional Municipality, Bedford-Sackville ConnectorTrail map In 2009, the city obtained the Chester Spur of the Canadian National Railways, an abandoned rail line, at a cost of $2,700,000.Tim Bousquet, \\"Rail to trail project gets OK \\", The Coast, August 20, 2009 In 2011 the tracks were removed and the paved Chain of Lakes Multipurpose Trail was built in the rail corridor. Plans were advancing in 2012 for an peninsular bike route.\\"New bike route proposed for Halifax\\", CBC, November 3, 2010 Overall, HRM remains fairly difficult for bicycles, partially as a result of geography and climate, but also traffic congestion and significant gaps in the cycling network. Despite these weaknesses, there has been a gradual increase in the number of bicycle lanes and designated bike routes in the urban core. By 2013, HRM had of AT facilities (131 kilometres of greenway and 96 kilometres of bike lanes).HRM Key Infrastructure Definitions , Regional AT Plan Review, 2013 The first protected cycling lane in Halifax opened in November 2015 as a pilot project. The lanes are separated from automotive traffic by a painted median and plastic bollards.

Description and diet  At birth, they are less than and they mature at about . Most records are of individuals less than , but they can reach about . Their litter size is seven or eight pups off Angola to 23 in the Mediterranean. They have ridges over their eyes that expand into large, rounded knobs, which are covered with enlarged denticles ‚Äì these are absent in other species of rough sharks. They possess very large spiracles that are vertically elongated, being almost as high as the length of their eyes. Their first dorsal spine is oriented slightly forward. They feed on worms, crustaceans, and mollusks.Compagno, L., Dando, M. and Fowler, S. Sharks of the World. Princeton Field Guides Oxynotus centrina has a compressed body, triangular in cross section, with a broad and flattened head. The snout is flat and blunt. Just like all of the Oxynotus species, they have two relatively large dorsal fins that are sail-like, and no anal fin. Their color scheme is grey ogayr grey-brown dorsally with dark blotched on its head and sides. However, one identifying feature is the light horizontal line below the eyes on the cheek.Hurst, Richard. \\"Factsheet: Angular Roughshark.\\" Factsheet: Angular Roughshark. N.p., n.d. Web. 30 November 2013. . Since it shares the northeast Atlantic with another species of Oxynotus, other distinguishing features include the extremely large spiracles, their dorsal fins, and their large dermal denticles above their eyes. Like most of the Oxynotus species, O. centrina has lanceolate upper teeth and blade-like lower teeth, with 12 rows of teeth on either side. Oxynotus centrina usually moves by gliding on the bottom of the sea, sometimes hovering over the sandy or muddy surfaces of the seabed.\\"Angular rough shark (Oxynotus centrina).\\" Angular rough shark videos, photos and facts. N.p., n.d. Web. 1 December 2013. .  Range and habitat  They occur in the eastern Atlantic from Norway to South Africa, including the entire Mediterranean. They may also occur off Mozambique. They prefer coralline algal and muddy bottoms on continental shelves and upper slopes at depths of , but occur mostly below . Studies of these sharks in the Mediterranean indicate they prefer to spend their times at depths of .  Reproduction  Male and female angular roughsharks are reported to mature at about 50‚Äì70 cm. Although, some studies have shown that females mature at a slightly larger size than males. Being an ovoviviparous species, O. centrina produces 10-12 pups usually between 21 and 24 cm in length.  Population  Some data has been gathered on this species of Oxynotus in the period from 1994 to 1999 in the Mediterranean. O. centrina was only present in 0.6% of the tows during this period at a depth of 100 to 200 m. Regional indexes indicate this species is more common in the western central Mediterranean and lower index in the western and eastern Mediterranean. However, O. centrina was completely absent from the Eastern central Mediterranean. In 1948, trawl surveys indicated that O. centrina was once present, but uncommon, in the Adriatic. Although, the species has been absent in subsequent studies in the Adriatic, suggesting a possible extinction of that species in the area. However, recent studies, done by Lipej in 2004, show that some juveniles have been caught in the central Adriatic. Also, some data collected during the surveys in the Balearic Sea and the Ionian Sea found one specimen at 800 m in the western Ionian Sea, suggesting that the population of O. centrina, in the east-central Mediterranean, has an unknown population. However, this species was absent in the northeast Atlantic in a study of deepwater longline fishing for sharks near the Canary Islands. This is important because this species was abundant in this region until 1997.  Conservation status  Oxynotus centrina is a minor bycatch of offshore fisheries such as trawl fleets. Although this can have a negative impact on the species, as stated above, the species had been thought extinct in the Adriatic, decreased fishing has led to their rediscovery. This species, sometimes caught by fishermen in the Mediterranean, has little to no commercial value. Also, it is thought to bring bad luck to fisherman if caught and kept. Although when released, it has never been reported to survive. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species has deemed this species of Oxynotus as vulnerable due to consistent landings by fisherman and bycatch by deepsea fisheries.

It was produced for the Air Ministry to specification E.27/49 and differed from the P.111 in having a swept fin and rudder with horizontal tail surfaces high on the fin to improve longitudinal and directional stability. It had essentially the same wing as the P.111 in the latter's greatest span configuration, an unclipped delta; the wing tips of the P.120 were not removable or replaceable, but they could be rotated differentially or together for lateral or longitudinal trim.

It commemorates the participation of the forerunners of the regiments in the Battle of Minden during the Seven Years' War on that date in 1759. The celebration of the day involves the wearing of \\"Minden Roses\\" on the regimental head dress, and, in the case of the infantry regiments, the decoration of the regimental colours with garlands of roses. This recalls that the regiments wore wild roses at the battle that they had plucked from the hedgerows as they advanced to engage the enemy. Minden Day is celebrated by: *12 (Minden) Battery, 12 Regiment (Royal Artillery) *32 (Minden) Battery, 16 Regiment Royal Artillery *The Royal Scots Borderers, The Royal Regiment of Scotland, as successors to the 25th Regiment of Foot (King's Own Scottish Borderers) *1st Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment, successor to the 12th Regiment of Foot *HQ Company, 3rd Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment (Army Reserve) *The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, successor the 20th Regiment of Foot *The Royal Welsh, successors to the 23rd Regiment of Foot *The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, successors to the 37th Regiment of Foot *3rd and 5th Battalions The Rifles Regiment as successors of The Light Infantry, successors to the 51st Regiment of Foot * The North Saskatchewan Regiment [Reserve Canadian Army] successors to the Saskatoon Light Infantry in honour of a regimental twinning with a British Army Regiment. The N.Sask.R. wears the white rose. The colours of roses varies: red and yellow roses are worn by most of the units (including the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and the Royal Anglians - both of whom continue to mark Minden as one of their most important regimental days), whilst the PWRR wear a single red rose a white rose is favoured by the Light Infantry. In some cases this reflects parts of the regimental recruiting areas: the PWRR have strong links with Hampshire (whose badge is a red rose) and the Light Infantry is associated with part of Yorkshire (represented by a white rose). In 1975, August 1 was adopted as Yorkshire Day, partly to reflect the presence of Yorkshire soldiers at the battle. Minden Day is commemorated in the English folk song Lowlands of Holland, which dates to the time of the Seven Years' War. Like most English folk songs, the song has numerous variants. One version, which is prevalent in Suffolk, home of 12th Regiment of Foot (1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment), contains the verse: \\"My love across the ocean Wears a scarlet coat so fair, With a musket at his shoulder And roses in his hair\\".

Plot summary The main characters are two men, Jay and Ben. The novel consists of their dialogues in a hotel room in Washington, D.C., in May 2004. The story begins with Jay asking Ben to go to his hotel room. From that conversation it is inferred that Jay is depressed: the women in his life have abandoned him; he has lost his job as a high school teacher and now works as a day labourer; he has declared bankruptcy; and spends his days reading blogs. Jay explains to Ben that he has decided he must, \\"for the good of humankind\\", assassinate President George W. Bush, and then kill himself. Ben, who symbolises American modern liberalism, spends his time trying to persuade Jay to cancel his \\"mission\\". The novel ends inconclusively, the reader left unaware of whether or not Jay is going to go through with his plan. Major themes Jay spends most of his time denouncing the Iraq War. Ben's principal argument against Jay's decision to assassinate Bush, in order to stop the war, is that killing him would provoke more bloodshed. Book reviewers and critics have identified Jay The Extremities of Nicholson Baker - New York Times as the political extremist in the argument of Checkpoint.

Its length is up to . Its reproduction is ovoviviparous. Oxynotus paradoxus is thought to be a slow-moving predator of small benthic animal. The sailfin roughsharks is found near the Eastern Atlantic ocean at those depths. However, it has been reported to be found on the shores of Morocco, recently reported in the Mid- Atlantic Ridge, and in the Azores water. This species is an uncommon bycatch of bottom trawls, though there is insufficient information for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess its conservation status.\\"Oxynotus paradoxus.\\" (Sailfin Roughshark). N.p., n.d. Web. 30 November 2013. .  Taxonomy  French biologist F. Frade found this species of Oxynotus paradoxus. This name was later finalized and accepted by the scientific community as the official name for the species. Frade published his findings of this specimen in 1929 in the scientific journal Boletim da Sociedade Portuguesa de Ci√™ncias Naturais.FrAde F., 1929. ‚ÄúUne nouvelle esp√®ce ou une aberration individuelle de l‚ÄôOxynotus centrina‚Äù (Linn.). Bull. Soc. Port. Sci. Nat., 10(22): 263-267.  Description  Oxynotus paradoxus is a rare shark found in the deep waters of the ocean from about 265‚Äì750 m below ocean level. At birth, O. paradoxus is about 25 cm in length and can grow up to 118 cm in length. It has a compressed body form with a blunt snout and a wide, flattened head. O. paradoxus has two tall, narrow and pointed dorsal fins that contain concave trailing edges, but no anal fin. The first dorsal spine trails back, a unique feature of this species of Oxynotus. Both spiracles are relatively small compared to other sharks and are almost completely circular. The top teeth of O. paradoxus are lanceolate, but the lower teeth are blade-like. Each set of both upper and lower teeth contain 12 rows of teeth.Hurst, Richard. \\"Factsheet: Sailfin Roughshark.\\" Factsheet: Sailfin Roughshark. 30 November 2013. . The flank dermal denticles contain a central cusp next to two lateral cusps and a second middle cusp above the primary cusp.Azevedo, Jose, Fernando Sousa, and Joao Brium. \\"Dermal denticles and morphometrics of the sailfin roughshark Oxynotus paradoxus (elasmobranchii, oxynotidae), with comments on its geographic Distribution.\\" Cybium 27 (2003): 117-122. . Of all the Atlantic Oxynotus species, O. paradoxus is the only species to have an incline first dorsal fin spine. The color of the shark when living is uniform dark brown, but it turns black in preserved specimens.  Reproduction  This species of shark is an ovoviviparous species, meaning the embryos develop inside eggs, which are retained inside the mother's body until the eggs are ready to hatch. These shark pups are about 25 cm in length.  Geographical habitat and ecology  Oxynotus paradoxus lives in two separate places: the Northeast Atlantic and Easter Central Atlantic. In the Northeast Atlantic they are found along the Atlantic slope of Scotland and the Mid-Atlantic ridge. In the Eastern Central Atlantic they are found from Morocco southward to the Gulf of Guinea. Based on the distribution of O. paradoxus, occupying a bathybenthic habitat, the species can be classified as a benthos organism with reproductive migrations to the continental shelf in spring. O. paradoxus is found in the depths of 265‚Äì800 m below sea level. Due to their poor ability to swim, they use their relatively large and oil-filled livers to maintain their buoyancy.  Diet  The diet of O. paradoxus is largely unknown; however, from reported sightings of the shark, it has been identified that they feast on small benthic fish and invertebrates.  Threat and conservation  Since this species lives in the depths where deepwater fisheries operate, they can have a negative impact on the already uncommon species by being the bycatch of these offshore fisheries. Although their population is unknown, most of its population is in the deeper offshore waters and very few are in the inshore waters. Although this shark is a bycatch by offshore fisheries, it has little to no commercial uses. When caught, the most probable use of O. paradoxus is as fishmeal or bait.

Schilder was born into a national church (Nederlandse Hervormde Kerk) family in Kampen, the Netherlands; the family joined the Gereformeerde Kerken when he was a child. After graduating from a Reformed gymnasium (an academic high school), he took his theological studies at the Theological University of the Reformed Churches in Kampen and graduated cum laude in 1914. Schilder was a pastor at Ambt-Vollenhove, Vlaardingen, Gorinchem, Delft, Oegstgeest, and Rotterdam-Delfshaven. During his time as a minister Schilder published several books among which De Openbaring van Johannes en het Sociale Leven, Bij Dichters en Schriftgeleerden and the trilogy Christus in zijn Lijden. J.J.C. Dee, K. Schilder: zijn leven en werk (Goes: Oosterbaan & Le Cointre 1990) Schilder earned his doctorate from the Erlangen University in 1933, graduating summa cum laude, with a dissertation entitled Zur Begriffsgeschichte des Paradoxon. In 1934 he became Professor of Systematic Theology at Theological University of the Reformed Churches, a position he held until his death. Beginning in 1920, Schilder contributed to De Reformatie (The Reformation), a weekly Reformed journal. He became an editor for the publication in 1924 and its sole editor in 1935. As professor of theology Schilder published numerous books among which Heaven, what is it? (1935), Christ and Culture (1948) his uncompleted systematic theology, De Heidelbergse Catechismus (1947-1953). Schilder resisted the German invasion and opposed the Nazi conquest. He was arrested by the Germans in August 1940 and later released. Because he was so outspoken, Schilder spent much of the war in hiding. On 3 August 1944, Schilder was suspended for being schismatic, and the Reformed community was incensed that one of its leaders had been so condemned. The result was a schism within the GKN and the birth of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (liberated), then consisting 216 congregations, 152 ministers, and 77,000 members. Schilder died of a heart attack on 23 March 1952. Schilder was married to Johanna Walter. They had four children.R.H. Bremmer, \\"Klaas Schilder\\" in: Biografisch Lexicon voor de geschiedenis van het Nederlands Protestantisme (Kampen: Kok, 1978),p. 314-318  Christ in his Suffering  During this period Schilder published his three-part work, Christus in Zijn lijden, commonly known in English as The Schilder Trilogy (Christ in His Suffering, Christ on Trial, and Christ Crucified). This work was a massive expansion on a series of sermons Schilder had preached in Kampen. The publisher, J. H. Kok, heard those sermons and requested Schilder to write them out so that he could publish them. Schilder agreed to this upon the condition that Kok paid for a stenographer who would type out his dictation. For many days Schilder walked and talked. The first edition, on which the English translation is based, was published in the early 1930s. While in hiding during the war Schilder revised the text and after the war a new Dutch edition was published.

Top-hatted lawyer to workman falling off scaffolding: \\"Take this card, my man, and if you're not killed call on me and I'll recover big damages for you.\\" Tort reform refers to proposed changes in the civil justice system that aim to reduce the ability of victims to bring tort litigation or to reduce damages they can receive. Tort actions are civil common law claims first created in the English commonwealth system as a non- legislative means for compensating wrongs and harm done by one party to another person, property or other protected interests (e.g. physical injury or reputation, under libel and slander laws). Tort reform advocates focus on personal injury common law rules in particular. In the United States, tort reform is a contentious political issue. US tort reform advocates propose, among other things, procedural limits on the ability to file claims, and capping the awards of damages. Supporters of the existing tort system, including consumer advocates, argue that reformers have misstated the existence of any real factual issue and criticize tort reform as disguised corporate welfare.American Association for Justice report on Tort Reform In Commonwealth countries as well as U.S. states including Texas, Georgia, and California, the losing party must pay court costs of the opposing party. Some legal scholars propose to replace tort compensation with a social security framework that serves victims without respect to cause or fault. In 1972, New Zealand introduced the first universal no-fault insurance scheme for all accident victims, which provides benefit from the government-run Accident Compensation Corporation without respect to negligence. Its goal is to achieve equality of compensation, while reducing costs of litigation. In the 1970s, AustraliaFor a speech by High Court judge Michael Kirby, see Medical malpractice - an international perspective of tort system reforms (11.9.2000) and the United Kingdom drew up proposals for similar no-fault schemesin the UK, see the Pearson Report (1978) by the \\"Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensation for Injury\\" but they were later abandoned. The tort system Tort requires those responsible (or \\"at fault\\") for harming others to compensate the victims, usually in money.For instance, a supermarket may not have been safe enough for its customers to shop in by failing to mop up a spillage of yogurt on the floor. Ward v Tesco Stores Ltd [1976] 1 All ER 219, where the res ipsa loquitur doctrine was applied where someone slipped on yogurt in a supermarket. An employer may have failed to properly fence off some dangerous machinery, which exposes workers to risk of injury. Summers v Frost [1955] 1 All ER 870, on the application of the Factories Act 1961, s.14, saying \\"every dangerous part of any machinery... shall be securely fenced.\\" A manufacturer of ginger beer may have allowed a bottle it sells to have become contaminated, which has made a consumer ill. See Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 580, where a decomposed snail was found in a soft drink, see Lord Atkin's judgment in particular. Typical harms can include loss of income (while the person recovers); medical expenses; payment for pain, suffering, or even loss of a body part; or loss of future income (assuming that said loss can be proven to be reasonably likely to occur. See speculative damages).A typist who loses an arm suffers a loss to his future job prospects and in the case of fatal accidents, financially dependent relatives may be compensated for the loss of money that their loved one would have provided. Known as \\"bereavement damages\\" under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 in the United Kingdom. The classical purpose of tort is to provide full compensation for proved harm. This is known under the Latin phrase restitutio in integrum (restoration to original state). In other words, the idea underpinning the law of tort is that if someone harms someone else, they should make up for it. Compensation should be, in the words of Lord Blackburn in Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co, > \\"that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured in the same > position as he would have been if he had not sustained the wrong for which > he is now getting his compensation or reparation.\\"Livingstone v Rawyards > Coal Co (1880) 5 App Cas 25,39 Themes of the tort reform debates A number of recurrent issues can be identified in the debates about tort reform. Economic effects The primary criticism of the tort system is economic. Critics decry the cost of compensation payments themselves, especially when they are out of proportion to the damage. Even if it is held that extreme compensation is a worthy goal, litigation (it is argued) is an inefficient method of giving compensation. In Britain, for instance, it has been argued that 85p is spent on litigation for every ¬£1 of compensation paid. In contrast, the social security system costs 8p or 12p for every ¬£1 delivered. This figure is disputed, because there is no easy method for accounting for transaction costs, particularly when pre- litigation settlements are considered.Cane (2006) 466; Three particular charges are levelled at the tort system, for having distorting economic effects. First, the costs of litigation and compensation payouts raise the cost of insurance. Because most tort claims will be paid from the pockets of insurance, and because the public generally pays into insurance schemes of all kinds, tort reform proponents assert that reducing tort litigation and payouts will benefit everyone who pays for insurance. Secondly, and related to insurance in countries which do not have universal health care (i.e., national health insurance), the costs of the tort system, and in particular medical malpractice suits, raise the costs of health care. The difficulty in this area is to distinguish between public and private health care providers. In the UK, the cost was ¬£1.6B a year as for 2014, increasing at 10%+ yearly Rising from ¬£446m a year a decade earlier. The UK, however, has exceptionally low claims, as tort claims have been restricted, for instance in disallowing loss of chance cases. The Medical Defence Union actively combats, and attempts to settle all cases where potential negligence claims are at stake. While successful, the costs of litigation to the health system are steadily growing,.see Heil v Rankin [2000] 3 All ER 138 on the increase of damagessee, Sir Liam Donaldson, Making Amends (2003) In the United States, it is easier for victims of medical malpractice to seek compensation through the tort system. The American medical record in hospitals is poor, with around 195,000 deaths due to negligence per year, which itself leads to a higher number of claims.see 'In Hospital Deaths from Medical Errors at 195,000 per Year USA', Medical News Today (9.8.2004); by comparison, see A. Towse and P. Danson, Medical Negligence and the NHS (1999) 8 Health Economics 93 It is open to debate as to whether a change in the law of tort either way would lead to significant reductions in cost or changes in practice. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, \\"Study after study shows that costs associated with malpractice lawsuits make up 1% to 2% of the nation's $2.5 trillion annual health-care bill and that tort reform would barely make a dent in the total.\\" Third, there is an argument that tort liability could stunt innovation. This argument usually comes in connection with product liability, which in every developed country is strict liability, subject to a \\"state of science\\" defence. If a product is faulty, and injures somebody who has come across it (whether they are the buyer or not) then the manufacturer will be responsible for compensating the victim regardless of whether it can be shown that the manufacturer was at fault. The standard is lower in other injury cases, so that a victim would have to prove that a tortfeasor had been negligent. It can be argued that strict liability deters innovation, because manufacturers could be reluctant to test out new products for fear that they could be subjecting themselves to massive tort claims.Michael Porter, The Competitive Advantage of Nations, p. 649, This argument is characteristic of the law and economics movement. It may be somewhat confused about the relevant law because it misses the state of science defence. This defence means that a manufacturer can claim that there was no warning or evidence in the scientific literature that a new product could be dangerous and thus avoid liability. Equality in treatment Equality of treatment is the central issue for reforms in New Zealand and in the Commonwealth more generally. If someone has an accident then they have a statistical 8% chance of finding a tortfeasor responsible for their injury. If they are lucky enough to have been injured by someone else's fault, then they can get full compensation (if the tortfeaser is not judgment proof). For others‚Äîfor those injured by natural accidents, by themselves, by disease or by environmental factors; no compensation is available, and the most that can be gained for their losses will be meager state benefits for incapacity. This was the basis for much of Professor Patrick Atiyah's scholarship as articulated in Accidents, Compensation and the Law (1970). Originally his proposal was the gradual abolition of tort actions, and its replacement with schemes like those for industrial injuries to cover for all illness, disability and disease, whether caused by people or nature. Such a system was developed in New Zealand following recommendations from the Royal Commission in 1967 for 'no fault' compensation scheme (see The Woodhouse Report). Over the 1980s Atiyah's views shifted. He still argued that the tort system should be scrapped. But instead of relying on the state, he argued people should have to take out compulsory first party insurance, like that available for cars, and this model should be spread progressively.P.S. Atiyah (1997) The Damages Lottery, Ch.8 Limits on noneconomic damages Other tort reform proposals, some of which have been enacted in various states, include placing limits on noneconomic damages and collecting lawsuit claim data from malpractice insurance companies and courts in order to assess any connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates.Medical Malpractice Tort Reform , National Conference of State Legislatures, May 1, 2006, accessed Aug. 3, 2006.  Tort Caps  In the 20th century, tort reform began to receive serious attention. One potential solution to reducing frivolous lawsuits was putting caps, or a price ceiling, on damages. Even if the jury awards the plaintiff the amount they think is acceptable, if it is over the state or federal cap, the price is brought down to meet the price cap, sometimes with dramatic difference. These caps can only be placed on non- economic damages and are determined state by state. Meanwhile, the federal government has put a $250,000 cap on non-economic damages for medical malpractice claims. Although these price caps were created to ensure no one is awarded too much compensation money for superficial cases, not even serious, legitimate cases can receive special treatment with federal and state caps.  Faults to Damage and Compensation Caps  In tort and personal injury cases, the plaintiff can receive compensation in economic, non-economic, and punitive damages. Tort reform in part aims to place caps on punitive and non- economic damages to prevent frivolous cases from taking advantage of the system, thereby benefiting those who pay for insurance, as it is argued that excessive litigation encourages insurers to pass the impact of legal expenses on to the insured by raising average premiums. However, there are notable instances where these caps have disadvantaged plaintiffs by preventing them from acquiring compensation adequate to what their case deserves. Each case is different and some cases may be worthy of compensation well above the state cap. In 2003's GOURLEY GOURLEY v. OB GYN, the state cap on medical malpractice in Nebraska cut the plaintiff's compensation (as determined by a jury) by 80 percent. In said case, the parents of Colin Gourley sought compensation for what would later be deemed medical malpractice on the part of their doctor. At some point during her pregnancy, Lisa Gourley felt her unborn son (Colin) was kicking less than she expected and so visited her doctor. The doctor (whom the Gourleys later found had been sued twice before) failed to follow proper procedure. The Gourley's claim such negligence resulted in their son being born with cerebral palsy. After taking this case to court, the jury awarded the family 5.6 million dollars. Due to Nebraska's state cap, the Gourley's were to receive only 1.2 million (of the 5.6 million deemed appropriate by the jury). Projected costs for Colin's medical expenses were 12 million dollars. Some argue the Gourley's case provides an example of how tort reform can be harmful and that it may interfere with the people's right to a jury (seeing as how the jury's decision was superseded by Nebraska's state cap). The Gourleys returned to court, arguing the state cap's superseding of the jury's decision was unconstitutional. The Gourley's case was eventually taken to the Supreme Court, where the state cap was found constitutional. Reduction in the statute of limitations of action A different reform is not to limit the amount of legitimate recovery, but to reduce the time to sue‚Äîthe statute of limitations of actions. New York law now requires that: Punitive awards and juries A trial by jury is unusual in almost all countries for non-criminal cases Another head of damages that can be awarded is called \\"punitive damages\\", or sometimes \\"exemplary damages\\". The word \\"punitive\\" means punishment and the word \\"exemplary\\" implies that damages should \\"make an example\\" of the wrongdoer. The purpose of such damages are twofold: to deter wrongful conduct by other actors, and to serve a normative function of expressing social shock or outrage at the defendant's actions. In most jurisdictions, punitive damages are not available. They are considered contrary to public policy, because the civil justice system in many countries does not have the same procedural protections as the comparable criminal justice system. Therefore, allowing punitive damages would have the effect of punishing actors for wrongful conduct without allowing them the ordinary procedural protections that are present in a criminal trial. The fear is that punitive damages encourage a vindictive, revenge seeking state of mind in the claimant and society more generally. In the UK, Rookes v BarnardRookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129, [1964] 1 All ER 367 limited the situations in which punitive damages can be won in tort actions to where they are expressly authorised by a statute, where a defendant's action is calculated to make profit, or where an official of the state has acted arbitrarily, oppressively or unconstitutionally. In the United States, though rarely awarded in tort cases, punitive damages are available, and are sometimes quite staggering when awarded. For example, in 1999, a Los Angeles County jury awarded $4.8 billion in punitive damages against General Motors to a group of six burn victims whose 1979 Chevrolet Malibu was rear-ended by a drunk driver, causing it to catch fire. $4.8 billion was the largest non-class action judgment for punitive damages according to one study. See Joni Hersch and W. Kip Viscusi, \\"Punitive Damages: How Judges and Juries Perform,\\" 33 J. Legal Stud. 1 (January 2004), available on SSRN. That was later reduced to $1.2 billion by the judge. It is argued by some that extraordinary damage awards in the United States are a result of the jury system. In federal courts in the United States, the right to a jury trial in most civil cases is entrenched in the Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution. Many state constitutions have similar clauses to protect the right to a jury trial in state court proceedings. In many countries, particularly in continental Europe, juries are not used at all even in criminal cases due to the cost of protracted trials necessitated with a jury present and confidence in judicial impartiality. In the United Kingdom, juries are available in criminal cases and for tort cases involving defamation, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Even in these limited areas of tort there have been growing concerns about the juries' role. In particular, the disparity between awards in defamation cases (which invariably concern celebrities, politicians and the rich) and awards for personal injuries has been growing. Inevitably, the awards rose in a way that a fixed system of damages under judicial scrutiny does not allow. Juries are unseasoned with a daily exposure to tragic accidents in tort litigation. When confronted with their first case they may be shocked and outraged, which inspires a willingness to teach the wrongdoer by a big damages award that \\"tort does not pay\\".the words of Lord Devlin in Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129 Awards for pain and suffering Tort compensation easily applies to property damage, where the replacement value is a market price (plus interest), but it is difficult to quantify the injuries to a person's body and mind. There is no market for severed legs or sanity of mind, and so there is no price which a court can readily apply in compensation for the wrong. Some courts have developed scales of damages awards, benchmarks for compensation, which relate to the severity of the injury. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the loss of a thumb is compensated at ¬£18,000, for an arm ¬£72,000, for two arms ¬£150,000, and so on.see, Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases (2006), which lay out the standard figures, up to ¬£200,000 for severe brain damages Even more difficult to reckon are damages for the pain and suffering of an injury. But while a scale may be consistent, the award itself is arbitrary. Patrick Atiyah has written that one could halve, or double, or triple all the awards and it would still make just as much sense as it does now.see generally, Patrick Atiyah and Peter Cane, Atiyah's Accidents, Compensation and the Law (2006) 6th Ed., Cambridge University Press Another likely factor driving up punitive damages are quota litis agreements between lawyers and clients, in which a share of the awarded punitive damage is awarded to the lawyer recovering it, giving the trial lawyer a direct economic incentive in high damages. Such a quota would usually amount to 25% to 30%. Such agreements, while lawful in the US, are considered unethical in the European Union. Class action lawsuits in the United States Mass actions are lawsuits where a group of claimants band together to bring similar claims all at once. Class actions are lawsuits where counsel for one or more claimants bring claims on behalf of similarly situated claimants. These do not exist in most countries, and what will usually happen is that one case will be funded as a \\"test case\\", and if judgment falls in the claimants' favour the tortfeasor will settle remaining claims. Class actions are justified on the basis that they ensure equal treatment of similarly situated victims, avoid the risk of conflicting judgments on similar issues, and allow an efficient resolution of a large number of claims. In the US, class actions have been used (and by some views abused) in order to overcome the differences applicable in different jurisdictions, including the perceived predispositions of judges, juries, and differences in substantive or procedural law. So if one claimant lives in State X, where courts and laws are unfavourable to their claim, but another claimant lives in the more favorable jurisdiction of State Y, they may bring a class action together in State Y. Strictly speaking, State Y must not adjudicate the claim unless it is found that the applicable law is similar or identical in both states, but as a practical matter this rule is often disregarded in favor of efficient resolution of claims.see now, Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 Another measure particular to the U.S. is the introduction of \\"proportionate liability\\", in place of joint and several liability. Claimed inefficiency of legal system According to economist Reed Neil Olsen, \\"...tort law generally and medical malpractice specifically serve two legitimate purposes. First, the law serves to compensate victims for their losses. Second, the threat of liability serves to deter future accidents.\\" Tort reformers maintain that the present tort system is an expensive and inefficient way to compensate those injured. According to a 2004 study of medical malpractice costs, \\"program administration‚Äîdefense and underwriting costs‚Äîaccounts for approximately 60 percent of total malpractice costs, and only 50 percent of total malpractice costs are returned to patients. These costs are high even when compared with other tort-based systems, such as automobile litigation or airplane crashes, that determine fault and compensate victims. Moreover, most patients that receive negligent care never receive any compensation. The Harvard Medical Practice Study found that only one malpractice claim was filed for every eight negligent medical injuries.\\" Of the legal changes proposed by tort reformers, this study found that states capping payouts and restricting non-economic damages saw an average decrease of 17.1% in malpractice insurance premiums. However, more recent research provided by the insurance industry to the publication Medical Liability Monitor indicated that medical malpractice insurance rates had declined for four straight years. The decrease was seen in both states that had enacted tort reform and in states that had not, leading actuaries familiar with the data to suggest that patient safety and risk management campaigns had had a more significant effect.Rising Insurance Premiums? Yes and No. Medscape Medical News, October 5, 2011. Similarly, Klick/Stratman (2005) found that capping economic damages saw an increase in doctors per capita. There is no guarantee, however, that any savings from tort reform would be efficiently distributed. Tort reform in Texas during the 1990s created $600 million in savings for insurance companies while the fraction of policy dollars needed to cover losses fell from 70.1 cents in losses in 1993 to 58.2 cents in 1998. Opponents of these liability-limiting measures contend that insurance premiums are only nominally reduced, if at all, in comparison to savings for insurance companies. Further, opponents claim that parties are still being injured at similar or higher rates, due to malpractice not being deterred by tort claims and the attraction of lower quality physicians to \\"tort reformed\\" states. Special medical malpractice courts Tort reform advocate Common Good has proposed creating specialized medical courts (similar to distinct tax courts) where medically trained judges would evaluate cases and subsequently render precedent-setting decisions. Proponents believe that giving up jury trials and scheduling noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering would lead to more people being compensated, and to their receiving their money sooner. Critics of the health courts concept contend that it is ill-conceived, that it would be unfair to patients, that it would be unlikely to achieve its objectives, and that much of its goals as are reasonable can be achieved more fairly and with greater efficiency under the existing civil justice system.\\"The Case Against Health Courts\\", Mehlman, Maxwell and Nance, Dale A., April 1, 2007. In addition, experts have suggested that health courts would be inevitably biased towards physicians, and that the bureaucracy needed to introduce safeguards against such bias would negate any cost savings.\\"Health Courts?\\" Philip G. Peters, Jr., Boston University Law Review, 2008. Still, a number of groups and individuals have supported this proposal.National Law Journal, 'Health courts' offer cure USA Today, July 4, 2005, accessed Aug. 3, 2006; and Health Courts Endorsed in Wall Street Journal by Betsy McCaughey The Wall Street Journal, August 24, 2005, accessed Aug. 2, 2006. United States In general, tort reform advocates contend that too many of the over 15 million lawsuits filed in the United States each year are \\"frivolous\\" lawsuits. The term \\"frivolous lawsuit\\" has acquired a broader rhetorical definition in political debates about tort reform, where it is sometimes used by reform advocates to describe legally non-frivolous tort lawsuits that critics believe are without merit, or award high damage awards relative to actual damages. Tort reform advocates argue that the present tort system is too expensive, that meritless lawsuits clog up the courts, that per capita tort costs vary significantly from state to state, and that trial attorneys too often receive an overly large percentage of the punitive damages awarded to plaintiffs in tort cases. (The typical contingent fee arrangement provides for the lawyer to retain one-third of any recovery.)\\"Hayseeds, Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Cas.\\", 352 S.E.2d 73, 80 (W.Va. 1986) (\\"the standard contingent fee is 33 percent\\") A Towers Perrin report indicates that U. S. tort costs were up slightly in 2007, are expected to significantly increase in 2008, and shows trends dating back as far as 1950. More recent research from the same source has found that tort costs as a percentage of GDP dropped between 2001 and 2009, and are now at their lowest level since 1984.U.S. Tort Cost Trends 2010 Update Towers Watson, 2010. High-profile tort cases are often portrayed by the media as the legal system's version of a lottery, where trial lawyers actively seek the magic combination of plaintiff, defendant, judge, and jury. Advocates of tort reform complain of unconstitutional regulation caused by litigation, and that litigation is used to circumvent the legislative process by achieving regulation that Congress is unwilling or unable to pass. Tort reform is also proposed as one solution to rapidly increasing health care costs in the United States. In a study published in 2005 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, 93% of physicians surveyed reported practicing defensive medicine, or \\"[altering] clinical behavior because of the threat of malpractice liability.\\" Defensive Medicine Among High-Risk Specialist Physicians in a Volatile Malpractice Environment (abstract), Journal of the American Medical Association, 2005;293:2609-2617, \\"\\" Of physicians surveyed, 43% reported using digital imaging technology in clinically unnecessary circumstances, which includes costly MRIs and CAT scans. Forty-two percent of respondents reported that they had taken steps to restrict their practice in the previous 3 years, including eliminating procedures prone to complications, such as trauma surgery, and avoiding patients who had complex medical problems or were perceived as litigious. A few of the changes frequently advocated include limits on punitive damages, limits on non-economic damages, limiting the collateral source doctrine, use of court-appointed expert witnesses, elimination of elections for judges, reducing appeal bond requirements for defendants faced with bankruptcy, \\"venue reform\\", which limits the jurisdictions within which one can file a lawsuit, limits on contingency fees, the adoption of the English Rule of \\"loser pays\\" (the defeated party must pay both the plaintiff's and the defendant's expenses), and requiring that class action lawsuits with nationwide plaintiffs be tried in federal courts, eliminating awards for pre-judgment interest. Many of these measures tend to benefit defendants; others, such as the English rule, sanctions for delay, and early-offer settlement requirements, could have benefits to plaintiffs in some cases. Not all tort reform supporters support all proposed tort reforms. For example, there is a split over whether the collateral source doctrine should be abolished, and there is a healthy debate over whether it would be beneficial to further restrict the ability of attorneys to charge contingent fees. Disputed issues Critics of tort reform contend that the real purpose of the proposed changes is to shield businesses, especially large corporations, from having to pay just compensation to consumers, patients and clients for damages incurred from fraud, negligence, medical malpractice or other legitimate tort claims. They contend that limitations on punitive damages and other restrictions on plaintiff's traditional rights will reduce corporate accountability. Because corporations typically engage in a cost-benefit analysis before considering whether to stop a wrongful action (such as polluting or not enacting proper measures for safety), they contend that corporations will decide that the cost of changing a wrongful practice would be greater than the cost of continuing it, unless there is the chance that the cost of continuing will be made greater by a successful lawsuit. In this view, the prospect of paying a small damage award would have little or no effect in correcting the wrongdoing, and would essentially allow the corporation to continue an unsafe practice unless state or federal regulators interceded. Tort reform supporters argue that this precisely describes the problem: lawsuits over socially beneficial practices increase the costs of those practices, and thus improperly deter innovation and other economically desirable activity. They further suggest that small businesses are hurt worse by the threat of litigation than large corporations are, because the legal expenses from a single lawsuit can bankrupt a small businessperson. How would tort reform affect safety? Proponents of the existing tort system contend that tort reform advocates exaggerate the costs and ignore the benefits of the current tort system. For example, consumer advocates and legal scholars contend that lawsuits encourage corporations to produce safer products, discourage them from selling dangerous products such as asbestos, and encourage more safe and effective medical practices. Beginning in the early 1980s, Professor Stephen Teret and other faculty at The Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health argued that tort litigation was an important tool for the prevention of injuries. While Teret acknowledged that the primary purpose of tort lawsuits usually is to recover money damages for the injured persons, as compensation for their medical and other costs, he identified several ways that litigation can also enhance safety for everyone, including: In contrast, a 2006 study by Emory University professors Paul Rubin and Joanna Shepherd argued that tort reform actually saved tens of thousands of lives because \\"lower expected liability costs result in lower prices, enabling consumers to buy more risk-reducing products such as medicines, safety equipment, and medical services, and as consumers take additional precautions to avoid accidents.\\" They also concluded that \\"caps on noneconomic damages, a higher evidence standard for punitive damages, product liability reform, and prejudgment interest reform lead to fewer accidental deaths, while reforms to the collateral source rule lead to increased deaths.\\" \\"Tort Reform and Accidental Deaths\\" Rubin, Paul H. and Shepherd, Joanna, (February 20, 2006). Emory Law and Economics Research Paper No. 05-17 Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=781424 Tort reform advocates cite a 1990 study of auto safety improvements by Harvard University professor John D. Graham for a conference at the Brookings Institution found that Graham further notes that However, design improvements to increase safety cannot be used against manufacturers in court to show that the product was unsafe. Rule 407 of the Federal Rule of Evidence specifically states, \\"evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove: negligence; culpable conduct; a defect in a product or its design; or a need for a warning or instruction.\\" This means that evidence of changing the design of a product after an accident cannot be used in court against the manufacturer to prove it is liable for the damage. It is true, however, that the evidence could be introduced to prove \\"ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures.\\" But, a lawyer representing the manufacturer could concede ownership and control, and thus prevent the evidence from being introduced for that purpose. And a lawyer for the manufacturer could seek to prevent the introduction of the evidence to show feasibility of precautionary measures if he/she argued such evidence would violate Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of evidence. Rule 403 bars evidence that is relevant, but overly prejudicial. Another presenter at the same Brooking Institution conference, Murray Mackay of the University of Birmingham, claimed safety (and other) innovations were inhibited by fear of lawsuits: The effect of tort reform on medical outcomes has been studied with mixed results. A 2008 study found worse childbirth outcomes for mothers and infants in states with caps on non-economic damages. The Klick/Stratman paper cited above found several effects of specific tort reforms on infant mortality that lost statistical significance when looked at more closely‚Äîthat is, correlation with other state-specific factors wiped out apparent increases in mortality from joint and several liability reform but also wiped out apparent decreases in mortality from capping economic damages and restrictions on contingency fees. The only tort reform effect that proved robust was a negative effect of collateral source reform on black infant mortality. Proponents of tort reform counter by pointing to data from New Zealand, which has abolished its medical tort system but has medical error rates close to those in the United States.Medical Error Tort reform advocates, including Paul Offit, also argue that litigation has driven from the U.S. marketplace many useful and safe medical advances, including Bendectin (the withdrawal of which has led to a doubling of hospital admissions for morning sickness) and vaccines for Lyme disease and Group B Streptococcal disease, which kills one hundred infants per year. Frivolous lawsuits Under some interpretations of the law, a frivolous lawsuit is one that cannot reasonably be supported under existing legal precedent or under a good-faith argument for a change in the law. However, the term has a broader rhetorical definition; in political debates, \\"frivolous\\" is also used to describe tort lawsuits where there is only a remote link between the conduct of the defendant and the injuries alleged by the plaintiff or where the damages sought by the injured plaintiff are perceived to be too high for the injuries sustained. Tort reform advocates also complain about lawsuits that are brought based on purely hypothetical damages where the plaintiffs have suffered no tangible harm whatsoever, or where the harm caused could be traced to elements of excessive negligence or irresponsibility on the part of the claimant. Real or fictional frivolous lawsuits are a popular target of American humor. Proponents of tort reform claim that frivolous lawsuits are common, costly, and based on the contingent-fee system of paying lawyers, while critics point out that summary judgments address those issues. Existing rules, however, regulate the prosecution of \\"frivolous\\" lawsuits. Under already existing law in every U.S. jurisdiction, if a defendant or the judge believes that a plaintiff has misrepresented the facts or the law or has brought a \\"frivolous\\" pleading, the defendant, or the court on its own initiative, may ask for the action to be thrown out and for the attorney bringing the action to be penalized with a variety of sanctions. For example, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide in part: \\"By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper--whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it--an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances: . . . (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; [and] (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\\" If the court decides that the plaintiff has violated this rule, it has wide discretion to sanction the offending party, the party's attorney or both, including the discretion to dismiss the plaintiff's claim or claims, order the plaintiff, the plaintiff's attorney or both to pay money, reprimand the attorney and/or refer the offending attorney to the applicable disciplinary authorities, among other things. Ethical rules also forbid attorneys from filing \\"frivolous\\" lawsuits. State courts and bar associations typically publish sanctions imposed on attorneys for violations of these rules. A simple review of these published opinions demonstrates that courts take violations of their pleading and ethical rules seriously. Tort reform in Texas has imposed a requirement in medical malpractice cases that only a physician practicing or teaching in the same specialty as the defendant can serve as an expert witness in the matter. Additionally, a report from that witness showing evidence of negligence must be filed with the court within 120 days of the filing of the case. Failure to do so results in liability for the defendant's legal fees. Filing an action but failing to find a suitable expert or failure to file adequate reports within the time frame provided can result in hardship for a plaintiff who may already be crippled by physical injuries and bankrupted by medical fees. Regulation through litigation Advocates of tort reform also complain of regulation through litigation, the idea that litigation is being used to achieve regulatory ends that advocates would not be able to achieve through the democratic process. For example, Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA) argued in support of a 2005 federal tort reform that gave immunity to gun manufacturers in certain lawsuits because such lawsuits were \\"nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to circumvent the legislative process and achieve gun control through litigation\\"; reform supporters complained that (and the Pentagon supported the bill on the grounds that) the plaintiffs were trying to \\"sue [gun manufacturers] out of existence\\" by forcing them to incur $250 million in legal defense expenses, while gun control supporters argued that the legislation took \\"away the right of victims to be able to have their day in court,\\" that the bill gave unprecedented immunity to a single industry, and claimed that the law was unconstitutional. Healthcare industry Tort reform advocates argue that by limiting the threat of frivolous lawsuits, the medical industry would migrate away from practicing defensive medicine. This would reduce the number of unnecessary tests and procedures, typically performed under patient request, thereby reducing the costs of medical care in general. As an argument against the current system, tort reformers link the rising costs of premiums for physicians' medical malpractice insurance to the rising cost of personal and group policy health insurance coverage. California's Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act has been cited as a model for tort reform in health care. Others deny that medical malpractice suits play a significant role in the cost of health care. Including legal fees, insurance costs, and payouts, the cost of all US malpractice suits comes to less than one-half of 1 percent of health-care spending. Other recent research suggests that malpractice pressure makes hospitals more efficient, not less so: \\"The recent focus by the American Medical Association and physicians about the dramatic increases in medical malpractice insurance premiums, and their suggestion of a cap on non-economic damages, deserves a closer look. According to Baicker and Chandra (2004), increases in premiums are not affected by past or present malpractice payments, but may increase due to other unrelated factors. Chandra, Nundy, and Seabury (2005) find that the rising cost of medical services may explain the bulk of the growth of \\"compensatory awards\\". They also find that the greatest ten percent of the malpractice payments have grown at a smaller pace than the average payment for the years 1991 and 2003. This means that the \\"medical malpractice crisis\\" is not necessarily fueled by the growth in malpractice payments. Furthermore, malpractice pressure actually forces our hospitals to be technically more efficient. This implies that existence of the medical malpractice system is beneficial, and its strength should not be diluted by either putting caps on non-economic damages or by decreasing the statute of limitations.\\" There has been a noticeable drop in medical malpractice insurance premiums for physicians in states that have enacted Tort Reform. Particularly ones that capped non-economic damages such as Texas did in 2003. For example, The Doctors Company, a physician-owned medical liability insurer, was insuring OB/GYNs at a mature claims-made rate of $131,601, which was a 20% increase from the previous year. As of 2008, the most an OB/GYN was paying for a liability insurance policy with The Doctors Company was $64,714. States that have not enacted Tort Reform legislation tend to have a higher cost of professional medical liability insurance than states that do. Opponents of tort reform legislation often reference the story of Frank Cornelius, whose New York Times op-ed piece, \\"Crushed by My Own Reform,\\" told of allegedly negligent procedures performed by his physicians. In 1975, Cornelius had fought for damage caps, but he later came to repent of his role in that campaign. Some say that federal licensing is a better approach and a strong central regulatory body is the answer to deal with negligent physicians who cross state lines. Controversy over the impact on business Some supporters of tort reform posit that reforms can significantly reduce the costs of doing business, thus benefiting consumers and the public in the long run. Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter stated: \\"product liability is so extreme and uncertain as to retard innovation. The legal and regulatory climate places firms in constant jeopardy of costly and ... lengthy product suits. The existing approach goes beyond any reasonable need to protect consumers, as other nations have demonstrated through more pragmatic approaches.\\"Michael E. Porter, The Competitive Advantage of Nations, p. 649, A commission by the American Insurance Association and co-authored by Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz to look at the effects of bankruptcies from asbestos litigation on workers in the asbestos industry; the study estimated that 52,000 jobs were lost. Critics of the tort reform movement dispute the claim that the current tort system has a significant impact on national or global economies. The Economic Policy Institute wrote that the effect on the economy of job loss resulting from lawsuits is negligible:Lawrence Chimerine and Ross Eisenbrey, The frivolous case for tort law change: Opponents of the legal system exaggerate its costs, ignore its benefits, Economic Policy Institute, May 17, 2005 (EPI Briefing Paper #157), retrieved March 31, 2007 > In an April 2002 paper, the CEA (President Bush's Council of Economic > Advisors) examined the economic impacts of the tort system in somewhat > greater depth.

Critics of tort reform also contend that the real purpose of the proposed changes is to shield businesses, especially large corporations, from having to pay just compensation to consumers, patients and clients for the harm incurred from fraud, negligence, medical malpractice, product liability or other legitimate tort claims.\\"Tort Reform\\" Sourcewatch: Center for Justice and Democracy. Specific industry protections In response to lawsuits filed against gun manufacturers by several municipalities, a bill was proposed by the U.S. Congress in 2005 that would provide immunity to gun manufacturers for most negligence and product liability actions (and prohibit the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives from revoking a dealer's license, even in cases where a dealer has been identified as selling a relatively high number of guns subsequently used in violent crimes). Organizations such as the United States Conference of Mayors oppose gun manufacturer immunity legislation.Ed Somers, \\"Gun Immunity Considered by Congress,\\" U.S. Mayor Newspaper, The United States Conference of Mayors, May 9, 2005 Others have argued that the legislation took \\"away the right of victims to be able to have their day in court,\\" that the bill gave unprecedented immunity to a single industry, and that the law was unconstitutional to the extent that it conflicted with the Separation of powers.\\"Gun Industry Buys Bulletproof Political Protection\\" The Nation. 25 October 2006. Retrieved July 15, 2006. Dispute over \\"litigation explosion\\" claims The American Tort Reform Association (ATRA) claims that \\"The cost of the U.S. tort system for 2003 was $246 billion, or $845 per citizen or $3,380 for a family of four\\" and \\"The Growth of U.S. tort costs have exceeded the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2-3 percentage points in the past 50 years\\". This claim is based on a 2002 study by Tillinghast-Towers Perrin. Opponents of tort reform deny that there has been a \\"litigation explosion\\" or \\"liability crisis\\", and contend that the changes proposed by tort reform advocates are unjustified. Records maintained by the National Center for State Courts show that population-adjusted tort filings declined from 1992 to 2001. The average change in tort filings was a 15% decrease. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, a division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), found that the number of civil trials dropped by 47% between 1992 and 2001. The DOJ also found that the median inflation-adjusted award in all tort cases dropped 56.3% between 1992 and 2001 to $28,000. Tort reform advocates allege that these numbers are misleading. They claim that most liability costs come from pre-trial settlements, so the number of trials is irrelevant. Supporters further note that the number of \\"filings\\" is a misleading statistic, because modern filings are much more likely to be class actions with many more joined claims than the cases of decades ago. They also note that the choice of the 1992 start date is misleading, because the largest increase in the number of tort cases occurred between 1970 and 1992. They also argue that the use of the median, rather than the mean, is a misleading statistic for measuring the magnitude of the litigation problem. Supporters frequently base their claims of an \\"explosion\\" in the costs of tort litigation based on annual studies by Tillinghast/Towers Perrin,Tillinghast/Towers Perrin a major consultant to the insurance industry. In 2008, Towers Perrin reported that the cost of liability litigation has outpaced the growth of the GDP growth of 9% in estimated annual tort costs between 1951 and 2007 as opposed to a 7% average annual growth in GDP‚Äîrepresenting 2.2% of GDP in 2004 vs. just 0.6% in 1950 and 1.3% in 1970. More recent research from the same source has found that tort costs as a percentage of GDP dropped between 2001 and 2009, and are now at their lowest level since 1984. The Tillinghast/Towers Perrin study has been criticized by the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank: \\"Although TTP's estimate is widely cited by journalists, politicians, and business lobbyists, it is impossible to know what the company is actually measuring in its calculation of tort costs, and impossible to verify its figures, because TTP will not share its data or its methodology, which it claims are 'proprietary.'\\" Tort reform supporters claim that the Towers Perrin numbers are underestimates in many ways. Corporate lawsuit abuse Tort reform opponents argue that corporations and insurance companies are the worst abusers of the litigation system. In particular, they contend, corporations often use their enormous resources to unfairly delay trial, pursue frivolous appeals, and contest claims in which liability is clear. In response, a number of tort reform supporters argue that that criticism is not a reason to oppose tort reform; such abuse would be deterred by proposed tort reforms such as \\"loser pays,\\" which would prevent large corporations from using litigation as a cudgel against individuals and small businesses who cannot afford to defend themselves in court by providing an incentive for law firms to provide contingent defense. Opponents of tort reform contend that most private citizens would be afraid to sue wealthy corporations or insurers if they could be bankrupted by an award of the defendant's legal fees if they lost. This would limit legitimate claims, and effectively deny many citizens a forum to redress the harm caused them. Changing definitions of torts Tort reform in Texas changed the definition of negligence in the context of emergency room treatment to include only \\"willful and wanton\\" acts. This has been interpreted as including only acts intended to harm the patient.  Hailstorm litigation reform  In March and April 2012, the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas was hit with two severe hailstorms. Texas Monthly wrote, \\"Windows were shattered. Hail knocked holes in rooftops. Unfortunate animals were beaten to death.\\" Insurers paid out $556 million in claims to homeowners and $47 million to car owners. After the storms, thousands of lawsuits were filed against insurers and adjusters. The lawsuits were based on allegations of \\"low-ball payments on claims.\\" As a reaction, a state senator introduced legislation (Senate Bill 1628) to reform hailstorm litigation. The bill represented \\"an almost visceral fight between the insurance industry, Texans for Lawsuit Reform and trial lawyers whose symbolic leader in storm-damage claims in Steve Mostyn of Houston.\\" By 2014, there had been 2,000 lawsuits filed in Hidalgo County, Texas. \\"One local attorney had erected a billboard ‚Äòevoking fire and brimstone‚Äô to remind homeowners that they had to file a claim within two years.\\" According to Texas Monthly, \\"By May [of 2014], there had been 5,972 lawsuits filed, with Mostyn and members of his firm filing 1,612 of them.\\" Mostyn \\"had pioneered\\" lawsuits for storm damage after Hurricane Ike. He made over $86 million in legal fees. In February 2017, a bill was introduced in the Texas state Senate that would aim \\"at ending hailstorm lawsuit abuse.\\" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick supported the bill (Senate Bill 10) and said during his State of the State address, \\"Hailstorm litigation is the newest form of lawsuit abuse.\\" Patrick said that storm litigation rates had risen dramatically, causing insurance companies to increase premiums and reduce coverage. The bill would still allow hailstorm insurance claimants to sue their insurance company. It would allow plaintiffs to sue for either deceptive trade practices or unfair settlement, but not both. According to SE Texas Record, \\"The bill also seeks to end barratry in hail litigation, as reports of lawyers employing contractors and insurance adjusters to drum up clients have continued to surface the past several years.\\" The bill would also prevent plaintiffs from suing their individual insurance agent. An identical bill (HB 1774) was introduced in the Texas House of Representatives. Debates over individual reforms in the United States A number of proposals have been made by advocates of tort reform, although these proposals are not agreed on by all 'tort reformers' and are considered by many opponents a roll-back of the reforms of the twentieth century. The collateral source rule, for example, dates back to 1854.First promulgated in The Propeller Monticello v. Mollison, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 152 (1854) Non- economic damages caps Non-economic damages caps place limits on a jury's ability to award damages to victims for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life as well as punitive damages. The purpose of these reforms is to allow for fair compensation for victims while preventing excessive, emotionally driven jury awards from bankrupting entire organizations and leading to job losses and cost increases for consumers. Proposals to cap non- economic damages are one of the most frequently proposed tort reforms, and have generated controversy over their fairness, efficacy, and constitutionality. Critics complain that limitations on punitive damages and other restrictions on plaintiff's traditional rights will reduce corporate accountability. Because corporations engage in a cost-benefit analysis before considering whether to stop a wrongful action (such as polluting or not enacting proper measures for safety), caps on damages may well encourage corporate malfeasance. They contend that the prospect of paying a small damage award provides too little incentive to correct the wrongdoing, and would allow the corporation to profitably continue an unsafe practice. For example, tort reform critics point to the story surrounding the Ford Pinto, where accountants determined that the expected payout in wrongful death suits would be less than making a design change to prevent the gas tanks from blowing up on minimum impact. \\"This cost-benefit analysis\\" that Ford completed found \\"that Ford should not make an $11-per-car improvement that would prevent 180 fiery deaths a year,\\" because doing so would be a net cost. (This analysis valued human lives at $200,725 each.) In other words, it was cheaper for Ford to fend off wrongful death lawsuits than to implement the safety improvement. For tort reform critics, the prospect of unpredictably large damage awards would reduce the incentive that companies have to behave in this manner. Joint and several liability Tort reformers have had the most legislative success in limiting the common law rule of joint and several liability, often replacing it with a rule of proportionate liability. Of the forty-six states that had a joint and several liability rule, thirty-three states have abolished or limited the rule. Opponents of tort reform contend that the elimination of the rule would under-compensate people who had the misfortune to be hurt by more than one person, if at least one of the defendants does not have the financial means to pay his or her share of proportionate liability. Loser pays Nearly every Western democracy follows the \\"English rule,\\" which requires the loser of a civil suit to compensate the winner for his or her attorney's fees. For example, after authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh lost their plagiarism litigation over The Da Vinci Code in a British court, they were ordered to pay the defendants' $1.75 million in attorneys' fees. The \\"American rule\\" differs; in most cases, each party bears its own expense of litigation. Supporters of tort reform argue that loser-pays rules are fairer, would compensate winners of lawsuits against the costs of litigation, would deter marginal lawsuits and tactical litigation, and would create proper incentives for litigation, and argue for reforms that would require compensation of winning defendants some or all the time.http://www.pointoflaw.com/books/tle_chap15.pdf In federal courts, debate has focused on the scope of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 11, which sanctions attorneys in some situations for making frivolous filings. Opponents argue that such rules would have had a chilling effect on civil rights litigation. Proposals to limit frivolous lawsuits have been criticized on the grounds that the restrictions could be used to impede individuals attempting to enforce civil rights laws, according to The Federal Judicial Center's Study of Rule 11. Robert L. Carter, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee have both argued that Brown v. Board of Education would have been called frivolous. In response, reform supporters note that victorious civil rights litigation could hardly be deemed \\"frivolous\\"; that desegregation was accomplished through legislative, rather than judicial action; and that reform opponents overstate the importance of litigation in the civil rights movement.See on this subject, The Hollow Hope by Gerald N. Rosenberg. Tort reform in US politics Tort reform is controversial. George W. Bush made tort reform a centerpiece of his successful run for Texas governor and of his second-term domestic policy agenda. In the 2004 presidential election, Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards, a successful trial attorney, was criticized by tort reform advocates for lawsuits that he brought against obstetricians on behalf of children who suffered severe birth injuries; reformers criticized the suits as relying on \\"junk science\\", while Edwards denied the allegation. Republican lobbyist Grover Norquist points out possible political motivations for tort reform, writing in American Spectator that \\"Modest tort reform, much of which has been actively considered by committees in both houses, would defund the trial lawyers, now second only to the unions, and this is debatable, as the funding source of the Left in America.\\" But the debate over tort reform is not always a partisan affair. As a senator, Barack Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and for the FISA Amendments Act, which granted civil immunity to telecommunications companies that cooperated with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations. In the 2000 presidential election, the Democrats' vice presidential nominee, Senator Joe Lieberman, was a leading supporter of tort reform; former New Republic and Slate editor Michael Kinsley has often criticized products liability law. And the conservative pro-life group Center for a Just Society opposes many tort reform measures, arguing that litigation can be used to keep RU-486 off the market. The United States Supreme Court sometimes weighs in on tort reform debates, but here too, the justices do not always vote according to their predicted ideological stereotypes. In the seminal case of BMW v. Gore,BMW v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996) the court ruled that the Constitution placed limits on punitive damages, with liberal justices Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens in the majority and Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissenting. Under Chief Justice John Roberts, some expect the court to be more likely to take cases that could resolve tort reform debates. Commonwealth nations New Zealand In 1972, New Zealand introduced the first universal no-fault insurance scheme for all accident victims, which provides benefit from the government-run Accident Compensation Corporation without respect to negligence. Its goal is to achieve equality of compensation, while reducing costs of litigation. Australia and the United Kingdom drew up proposals for similar no-fault schemes, but they were never implemented.

It is situated across from the Istanbul L√ºtfi Kƒ±rdar Convention and Exhibition Center, and behind the Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus on the European side of the city. As the city's most popular summertime outdoor venue, the theatre primarily hosts music concerts in various genres of local and international performers. It also hosts cultural activities for several festivals held in Istanbul in the summer. History The construction of the open-air theatre was proposed by French urban planner Henri Prost (1874‚Äì1959), who developed a project for Istanbul in the 1930s. Designed by Turkish architects Nihad Y√ºcel and Nahid Uysal, the groundbreaking took place in July 1946, in the office time of L√ºtfi Kƒ±rdar (1887‚Äì1961), governor and mayor of Istanbul. The amphitheatre was opened on August 9, 1947 with a ceremony. However, it took its final form after German stage director Carl Ebert (1887‚Äì1980), then head of Ankara State Conservatory, made modifications in the architectural design of the stage area. Remedy of all the deficiencies completed in the 1950s only. The construction cost 900,000 at the end. The theatre was inaugurated with a play of Sophocles, the Athenian tragedy Oedipus the King, performed by actors of the Ankara State Theatre. In 1958, the venue was named after Cemil Topuzlu (1866‚Äì1958), mayor of Istanbul in the era of Ottoman Second Constitutional Monarchy. Architecture The facade is faced with limestone and Uzunk√∂pr√º stone interchangeably to achieve a tone of color. The tier seating is of Uzunk√∂pr√º stone also. The outdoor theatre is designed in the form of ancient amphitheatres with tiered seating for spectators, semicircular in shape, around a flat performance space. The theatre's seating capacity is 3,972, and there are additional 30 \\"loge\\" seats for VIP. The section for the orchestra can hold 80 musicians. A movie projector is situated in the middle of the auditorium for movie or slide show purposes. The stage is large enough to enable 200-300 background actors freely move. The passages and the gates are dimensioned for instantaneous evacuation of the stage.

Kodandarami Reddy, composer K. Chakravarthy and writers Paruchuri brothers was repeated in this movie as well. The movie was dubbed into Hindi as Farrar Qaidi. Plot Set in 1939, Pratap (Chiranjeevi) is a sailor working on a ship during the British rule of India. He is in love with a wealthy woman, played by Jaya Prada. Jaya Prada's cousin (‡∞¨‡∞æ‡∞µ) Jayaram, who works for the British army, also wants to marry her. When the captain of the ship (C. S. Rao) is poisoned and killed by two of the crew members, Jayaram uses his power to twist Benarjee (Ranganath) and deports Pratap away for good at the secluded Andaman Jail. Pratap is trapped in this nightmare that lasts for thirteen years. Then Pratap escapes from the jail & dives into Andaman sea & drowns. There he is saved by two sailors & immediately Pratap chokes & vomits & then starts to tell about his whereabouts to the sailors. Haunted by the baffling course his life has taken, over time everything he ever believed about right and wrong is abandoned and replaced by all-consuming thoughts of vengeance against those who betrayed him. He obtains the help of an equally innocent fellow inmate Mahendra Bhupathi (Jaggaiah), who was once a Jamindar, who opposed the British only to lose his wealth, wife and daughter Jyothirmaye (Sumalatha). Mahendra Bhupathi was also betrayed by Jayaram and this common enemy is the target of vengeance for both the inmates. During his last breath, Mahendra Bhupathi gives a secret map for his treasure, which he had hid in a Malabar Island. Pratap replaces the dead body with himself in the burial sack and succeeds in his mission to escape from prison. He then finds the treasure and transforms himself into the mysterious and wealthy Jamindar. He then finds the daughter of Jaggayya, Jyothirmaye who is trying to seek vengeance and shelters her with him.

With a career spanning two decades and eight albums, they are considered pioneers in the region, and are the first band from Central America to win a Latin Grammy in the Best Rock Album Category. Style The lyrical style of Los Rabanes is a mix between Panamanian Spanish and English. Even if some choruses are fully or partly in English, most of the lyrics in the songs are in Spanish, using English only to express sarcasm, satire or parody. History After the breakup of their bands \\"Rum & Coke\\" and \\"El D√©cimo Piso\\" in the early 1990s, childhood friends Emilio Regueira, Christian Torres and Javier Saavedra began playing in small pubs and bars during the weekends in Chitr√©, Herrera, in 1992. Those early shows made a big impact in the local scene, for their energy, and their extravagant stage appearance. In 1993, √Ålvaro Acevedo, former drummer and current manager of Los Rabanes, joined the team. This brought a reorganization that included demos and presentations in Panama City, which produced even a stronger impact than they had in the Central Provinces. In 1994, with only one demo and one song on the radio, they joined the first ever \\"Rock Nacional\\" tour, which included all the biggest rock bands in Panama. In 1995, their increasing popularity gave them the opportunity to tour Panama and even open for major acts like Man√°. By the end of the year, they released their debut album ‚Äú¬øPor Qu√© Te Fuiste Benito?‚Äù, with the video for the title track playing heavily on MTV Latino. In 1996, Los Rabanes toured Latin America sharing the stage with bands like Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Los Autenticos Decadentes, Todos Tus Muertos, Aterciopelados, Maldita Vecindad, and were chosen by the press of California as the Best New Rock Band in Spanish. In 1997, they released their second album, ‚ÄúLos Rabanes All Star ‚Äì Volumen 2‚Äù. The album, recorded in Panama and mixed in Argentina, had Flavio Cianciarulo from Los Fabulosos Cadillacs as producer, and Rub√©n Blades as a guest on vocals. The three singles from this album were ‚ÄúReggae Punk Panam√°‚Äù, ‚ÄúDe Colores‚Äù, featuring Rub√©n Blades on the video, and the song ‚ÄúT√∫ Me Disparas Balas‚Äù, for which the video received major airplay on MTV Latino. In 1998, they played at major festivals like Festimad, which featured Metallica, and played shows in Latin America and the US with Caf√© Tacvba, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, and Control Machete. During the first half of 2000, Los Rabanes recorded their third album with Roberto Blades on artistic production and Emilio Estefan Jr. in general production. The album, recorded in Crescent Moon studios in Miami Florida, combines Punk, Calypso, Reggae, ska, and hip hop, with a lot of spanglish and meringue house, adding some wind instruments and Latin percussion. The video for the first single ‚ÄúMy Commanding Wife‚Äù was shot in Miami and directed by Emilio Estefan Jr. The song, \\"My Commanding Wife,\\" was derived from the song, \\"My Commanding Wife,\\" written by the Panamanian calypso artist, Oscar Reid, and recorded by Leroy Gittens and Oscar Reid Y Su Combo in 1965. The song was later popularized by Jamaican recording artist, Boris Gardiner and his band, The Boris Gardiner Happening, in 1970. In 2002, the band releases their fourth album, ‚ÄúMoney Pa‚Äô Que‚Äù, their second album with Emilio Estefan Jr. as producer, for Crescent Moon Records. The album was also co-produced by Emilio Regueira and Sebasti√°n Krys. The first single, ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äù, is a mix between rap, hip-hop, meringue huse, reggae and samba, and it had two additional remixes. The song was also a part of a compilation of Latin artists released in Asia for the Korea-Japan World Cup in 2002. The album also earned Los Rabanes their first Latin Grammy Nomination in the Best Vocal Rock Duo or Group category. The award went to Man√°. In 2006, the band ends their contract with Crescent Moon and Emilio Estefan Jr. and released a greatest hits box set called ‚Äú10 a√±os sonando‚Äù, with two CDs and a DVD. In 2007, they signed to Universal Music and released their sixth studio album, ‚ÄúKamikaze‚Äù, produced by Sebastian Krys.

In 1782 he battled the Royal Navy to a stalemate at the Battle of Cape Spartel, but failed to prevent the British relieving the Great Siege of Gibraltar. Early life C√≥rdova was born in Seville to don Juan de C√≥rdova Lasso de la Vega y Puente, a mariner, navy captain, and knight of the Order of Calatrava, and do√±a Clemencia Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdova Lasso de la Vega Veintimiglia, daughter of the Marquis of Vado del Maestre and first-cousin of her husband. He was baptised at San Miguel parish on 12 February. His inclination toward the sea began at a young age ‚Äî at 11 he enlisted aboard his father's ship and by 13 he had made his first journey to America. In 1721 he joined the naval academy at C√°diz and by 1723 graduated with the rank of Alf√©rez de Fragata (ensign). The first lap of his career was marked by successful cruises and actions at sea that won the approval of his superiors and even the praise of the King. In 1730 C√≥rdova had the distinction of commanding the naval escort for the Duke of Parma, Infante Carlos de Borb√≥n (later Charles III of Spain), who journeyed across the Mediterranean en route to the campaigns in Italy. Carlos and his generals went on to reconquer the Kingdom of Naples for the Bourbons at the Battle of Bitonto, with naval assistance from a squadron commanded by C√≥rdova.

He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and was appointed brevet brigadier general of volunteers for his contributions in engineering and artillery. In 1866 he received additional brevet appointments as major general of volunteers and brigadier general in the Regular Army. He conducted several scientific studies of the Mississippi River with captain, later Major General Andrew A. Humphreys. After his retirement, Abbot served as a consultant for the locks on the Panama Canal. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1863. Early life Henry Larcom Abbot was born in Beverly, Massachusetts.Abbot, Charles Greeley 'Biographical Memoir of Henry Larcom Abbot, 1831‚Äì1927'. National Academy of Sciences, 1929. Retrieved 24 August 2017. He attended West Point and graduated second in his class (which included Jeb Stuart and G. W. Custis Lee) with a degree in military engineering in 1854. Initially he had wanted to join the Artillery, but shortly after graduation, a classmate convinced him to choose the Engineers. He was commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. Army on July 1, 1854, second lieutenant on October 2, 1855 and first lieutenant on July 1, 1857.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 97. In 1855, Abbot was assigned to work with Lieutenant Robert Williamson's Pacific Railroad Survey in California and Oregon. To honor his work on this survey, the California Geological Survey named Mount Abbot in the Sierra Nevada after him in 1873. While serving in the Army, Abbot and Captain Andrew Humphreys conducted several scientific studies of the Mississippi River. They most notably studied the Mississippi river's flow starting at the Ohio River and going southward down to its base level at the Gulf of Mexico. They attempted to use several European formulas for stream discharge they had learned at West Point, but came to discover that they were all flawed. They then developed their own formula which ultimately also proved to be faulty, most notably they forgot to account for the roughness of slopes in river canals. Although the formula was not without flaw it influenced the evolution of hydrology and was instrumental in the establishing of a United States Army Engineer School at Fort Totten in New York City.Humphreys and Abbot wrote: Report upon the physics and hydraulics of the Mississippi river : upon the protection of the alluvial region against overflow, and upon the deepening of the mouths : based upon surveys and investigations made under the acts of Congress directing the topographical and hydrographical survey of the delta of the Mississippi river, with such investigations as might lead to determine the most practicable plan for securing it from inundation, and the best mode of deepening the channels at the mouths of the river. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1867. . Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War, Abbot was assigned to Brigadier General Irvin McDowell's forces and was wounded at the First Battle of Bull Run. He later became a topographical engineer in the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign and aide-de- camp to Brig. Gen. Andrew Humphreys. During this campaign he was brevetted major for his service at the siege of Yorktown. On July 18, 1862, Abbot was promoted to captain in the Regular Army and was assigned to the staff of Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard until November 11, 1862. He was then briefly assigned as a Topographical Engineer in the Department of the Gulf. On January 19, 1863 he was appointed colonel of the 1st Connecticut Heavy Artillery but on March 3, 1863 was transferred to the Washington Defenses where he commanded a brigade. In May 1864 he was transferred to command the Artillery during the siege of Petersburg. On December 12, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Abbot for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from August 1, 1864 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 20, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 738. In December 1864 he was placed in command of all siege artillery in the Army of the Potomac and Army of the James that were besieging Petersburg. In January 1865 General Alfred H. Terry requested General Abbot accompany his expeditionary force to Fort Fisher. Abbot commanded a provisional brigade of siege artillery during the successful Second Battle of Fort Fisher. Abbot was mustered out of the volunteer service on September 25, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Abbot for appointment to the grade of brevet major general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 710. On July 17, 1866, President Johnson nominated Abbot for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general in the regular army to rank from March 13, 1865 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 731. Post-Civil War and later life In the post-war years, Abbot continued to serve in the U.S. Army Engineers. He was promoted to major on November 11, 1865. He was assigned to the command of the engineer battalion at Willet's Point, New York. He created the army's Engineer School of Application there, and served on numerous boards, including the Board on the Use of Iron in Permanent Defenses, the Board of Engineers for Fortifications, the Gun Foundry Board, the Board on Fortifications and Other Defenses, and the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications. Abbot's influence can be seen in many facets of the coast defense systems of the United States of that period‚Äîin particular, in the submarine mine system, and in the use of seacoast mortars. Abbot advocated the massing of 16 mortars in 4 sets of 4, which would fire simultaneously at the enemy warships. The plan became known as the \\"Abbot Quad\\". Panama Canal After his retirement from the army, Abbot continued to work as a civil engineer and was employed as a consultant for the locks on the Panama Canal. \\"Brig. Gen. Henry Larcom Abbot, coauthor of a classic work on the hydrology of the Mississippi River, began his involvement with the Panama Canal as a member of the new French canal company's Comit√© Technique and Comit√© Statutaire, from 1897 to 1900. While the United States was assuming responsibility for building the Canal, Abbot worked for the French company as a consulting engineer during the transitional period, dividing his time between Paris and the isthmus. After the Americans assumed control of the project Abbot served from 1905 to 1906 on the Board of Consulting Engineers, a body appointed by Theodore Roosevelt and charged with the preparation of a plan for canal construction. The majority of the board recommended a sea-level canal. The minority report, probably written largely by Abbot, helped to persuade Roosevelt and Secretary of War William Howard Taft to adopt a plan for a lock canal. Abbot's last service to the canal was as a member of the Panama Canal Slide Committee in 1915.\\"Brodhead, Michael J. 2012. \\"The Panama Canal: Writings of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Officers Who Conceived and Built It.\\" Page 3. \\"Abbot's numerous articles and one book account for over half of the entries in this bibliography. They range widely over several topics. In addition to arguing for a lock canal he insisted that the Americans abandon once and for all any thought of building a canal in Nicaragua. Other articles answered critics who asserted that Panama was too hot, wet, and unhealthy, and that the area was subject to earthquakes. Abbot successfully presented the case for creating two artificial lakes instead of one. He maintained that the wild and unpredictable Chagres could be tamed and made useful in the building and operation of the canal.\\"Brodhead, Michael J. 2012. \\"The Panama Canal: Writings of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Officers Who Conceived and Built It.\\" Pages 3-4. Retirement Abbot retired as a colonel on August 13, 1895. On April 23, 1904, he was appointed Brigadier General, U.S.A., retired. Henry Larcom Abbot died on October 1, 1927 at Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge. Honors He became a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society and received the degree LL.D. from Harvard University.

It was privately built in 1871 by the 3rd Duke of Buckingham as a horse tram line to help transport goods between his lands around Wotton House and the national rail network. Lobbying from the nearby village of Brill led to its extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872. Two locomotives were bought but trains still travelled at an average speed of . In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham planned to upgrade the route to main line standards and extend the line to Oxford, creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite the backing of the wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad. The existing line was upgraded in 1894, but the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's Metropolitan Railway and Brill became one of its two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster. The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in the area, providing more direct services to London and the north of England. The Brill Tramway went into financial decline. In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The Brill Tramway became part of the London Underground, despite Quainton Road being from London and not underground. London Transport aimed to concentrate on electrification and improvement of passenger services in London and saw little possibility that passenger routes in Buckinghamshire could become viable. In 1935 the Brill Tramway closed. The infrastructure was dismantled and sold. Little trace remains other than the former junction station at Quainton Road, now the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. alt=Map of a railway line running roughly south-west to north-east. Long sidings run off the railway line at various places. Two other north‚Äìsouth railway lines cross the line, but do not connect with it. At the northeastern terminus of the line, marked \\"Quainton Road\\", the line meets three other lines running to Rugby & Leicester, Verney Junction, and Aylesbury & London respectively. The southwestern terminus, marked \\"Brill\\", is some distance north of the town of Brill, which is the only town on the map. A station on one of the other lines, marked \\"Brill and Ludgersall\\", is even further from the town of Brill. Background Brill is a small village at the top of the high Brill Hill in the Aylesbury Vale in northern Buckinghamshire, northeast of Oxford, and north-west of London. It was the only population centre in Bernwood Forest, a forest owned by English monarchs as a hunting ground. Traditionally believed to have been the home of King Lud, Brill Palace was a seat of the Mercian kings, the home of Edward the Confessor, and an occasional residence of the monarchs of England until at least the reign of Henry III (1216‚Äì1272). Brill was a centre for manufacture of pottery and bricks, but it was a long way from major roads or rivers, and separated by hills from Oxford. It remained small and isolated. In the 1861 census it had a population of 1,300. Wotton House and the Dukes of Buckingham alt=balding man with a dark bushy beard Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, the only son of Richard Plantagenet Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, was born on 10 September 1823\\\\. By the mid-19th century the family was in financial difficulty. (subscription or UK public library membership required) The family's estates and their London home at Buckingham House (No. 91 Pall Mall) were sold and the family seat of Stowe House seized by bailiffs as security and its contents sold. Over of the family's estates were sold to meet debts. The only property in the control of the Grenville family was the small ancestral home of Wotton House and its associated lands around Wotton Underwood near Brill. The Grenvilles looked for ways to maximise profits from their remaining farmland around Wotton, and to seek opportunities in heavy industry and engineering. Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent- Brydges-Chandos-Grenville (titled Marquess of Chandos following the death of his grandfather Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos in 1839) was appointed chairman of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 27 May 1857\\\\. After the death of his father on 29 July 1861 he became 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and resigned from chairmanship of the LNWR, returning to Wotton House to manage the family's estates. His efforts to pay debts incurred by his father earned praise from Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, (subscription or UK public library membership required) and in 1875 he was appointed Governor of Madras, serving until 1880. Early railways in the Aylesbury Vale On 15 June 1839 entrepreneur and former Member of Parliament for Buckingham, Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, opened the Aylesbury Railway. Built under the direction of Robert Stephenson, it connected the London and Birmingham Railway's Cheddington railway station on the West Coast Main Line to Aylesbury High Street railway station in eastern Aylesbury, the first station in the Aylesbury Vale. On 1 October 1863 the Wycombe Railway opened a branch from Princes Risborough railway station to Aylesbury railway station on the western side of Aylesbury, leaving Aylesbury as the terminus of two small and unconnected branch lines. Meanwhile, north of Aylesbury the Buckinghamshire Railway was being built by Sir Harry Verney. The scheme consisted of a line running southwest to northeast from Oxford to Bletchley and a second southeast from Brackley via Buckingham to join the Oxford‚ÄìBletchley line halfway along its length. The first section opened on 1 May 1850, and the whole on 20 May 1851\\\\. The Buckinghamshire Railway intended to extend the line south to the station at Aylesbury but the extension was not built. On 6 August 1860 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, with the 3rd Duke (then still Marquess of Chandos) as chairman and Sir Harry Verney as deputy chairman, was incorporated by Act of Parliament to connect the Buckinghamshire Railway (now operated by the LNWR) to Aylesbury. The 2nd Duke ensured the new route ran via Quainton, near his estates around Wotton, instead of a more direct route via Pitchcott. Beset by financial difficulties, the line took over eight years to build, eventually opening on 23 September 1868\\\\. The new line was connected to the Wycombe Railway's Aylesbury station, and joined the Buckinghamshire Railway where the Oxford‚ÄìBletchley line and the line to Buckingham met. A junction station was built. With no nearby town after which to name the new station, it was named Verney Junction railway station after Sir Harry. Aylesbury now had railway lines to the east, north and southwest, but no line southeast towards London and the Channel ports. Construction and early operations alt= With a railway near the border of Wotton House estate, the 3rd Duke decided to build a small-scale agricultural railway to connect the estate to the railway. His intended route ran on his own land other than a small stretch west of the Aylesbury and Buckingham line. This land was owned by the Winwood Charity Trust, an operator of almshouses in Quainton of which the Duke was a trustee. The Duke agreed to pay an annual rent of ¬£12 (about ¬£ in ), in return for permission to run trains. With the consent of the Winwood Charity the route did not require Parliamentary approval, and construction could begin immediately. The Duke envisaged a tramway west from Quainton Road railway station across his Wotton estate. The line was intended for transport of construction materials and agricultural produce and not for passengers. It would not have a junction with the Aylesbury and Buckingham railway but would have its own station at Quainton Road at a right angle to the A&B;'s line. A turntable at the end of the tramway would link to a spur from the A&B;'s line. The line was to run roughly southwest from Quainton Road to Wotton near Wotton Underwood. Just west of the station at Wotton the line split. One section would run west to Wood Siding near Brill. A short stub called Church Siding would run northwest into Wotton Underwood itself, terminating near the parish church, and a siding would run north to a coal siding near Kingswood. The branch to Kingswood was routed to pass a pond, to allow the horses working the line to drink. Ralph Augustus Jones was appointed Manager of the project, and construction began on 8 September 1870\\\\. Twenty labourers from the Wotton estate who would otherwise have been unemployed following harvest were employed six days a week to build the line, each paid 11 s per week. They carried out all the construction except laying the track, which was done by the specialists, Lawford & Houghton. The line was built using the cheapest materials and winding around hills to avoid expensive earthworks. The ballast was a mix of burnt clay and ash. The stations were crude earth banks high, held in place by wooden planks. As the Duke intended that the line be worked only by horse-drawn carriages, the line was built with longitudinal sleepers to reduce the risk of horses tripping. A diameter turntable was installed at Quainton Road to link the tramway to the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. Opening alt=Large two-storey brick building, flanked by two smaller brick pavilions. In front of the larger building is a herd of cattle. On 1 April 1871 the section between Quainton Road and Wotton was formally opened by the Duke of Buckingham in a ceremony in which coal from the first goods wagon to arrive at Wotton was distributed to the poor. At its opening the line was unnamed, but it was referred to as \\"The Quainton Tramway\\" in internal correspondence. The extension from Wotton to Wood Siding was complete by 17 June 1871; the opening date of the northern branch to Kingswood is not recorded, but it was not fully open in February 1873\\\\. The London and North Western Railway began a dedicated service from Quainton Road, with three vans a week of milk collected from the Wotton estate shipped to the London terminus at Broad Street. The only passengers were estate employees and people accompanying livestock. The Duke and Jones intended to run no more than one train on each section of the line so the line was not built with passing loops or signalling. When more than one horse-drawn train or locomotive was in operation, the Tramway operated a token system using colour-coded staffs to ensure only one train could be on a section. Drivers between Quainton Road and Wotton carried a blue staff, those west of Wotton and the Kingswood siding a red staff. On 26 August 1871 an excursion ran from Wood Siding to London hauled by the Great Western Railway (GWR). It carried around 150 people, for a total of passenger fares (with each child counted as half an adult), and was drawn by horses between Wood Siding and Quainton Road and by locomotive from Quainton Road to Aylesbury where the carriages were attached to the 7.30 am GWR service via Princes Risborough to London, arriving at 10.00 am. The experiment was not a success. Sharp overhanging branches posed a danger to passengers and had to be cut back in the week before the excursion. The day was wet and ticket sales were lower than expected. The return from London to Quainton Road was delayed in Slough, and the excursion arrived back at Wood Siding at 2.00 am. The surveyors designing the line had worked on the assumption that the wagons would have a load on each wheel of and had designed the line accordingly. As it turned out, the four-wheeled wagons used had an average weight of and each carried of goods, meaning this limit was regularly exceeded. The coal wagons used on the line weighed each and carried of coal, meaning a load on each wheel of . As well as damaging the track the loads strained the horses, and soon the line began to suffer with derailments, particularly in wet weather. On 20 October 1871 Jones wrote to the Duke that \\"The traffic is now becoming so heavy that I would, most respectfully, venture to ask your Grace to consider the subject as to whether an Engine would not be the least expensive and most efficient power to work it.\\" Extension to Brill and conversion to steam In late 1871 residents of Brill petitioned the Duke to extend the route to Brill and open a passenger service. The Duke agreed; it is likely he had already planned passenger services to Brill, as correspondence from early 1871 mentions passenger facilities at \\"the Brill terminus\\". In January 1872 a scheduled passenger timetable was published and the line was named the \\"Wotton Tramway\\". (Officially called the \\"Wotton Tramway\\", it was commonly known as the \\"Brill Tramway\\" from the time of its conversion to passenger use.) The new terminus of Brill railway station, at the foot of Brill Hill approximately north of the town, opened in March 1872. It was now a passenger railway, but goods traffic continued to be the primary purpose of the line. The line was heavily used to ship bricks from the brickworks around Brill, and cattle and milk from farms on the Wotton estate. By 1875 the line was carrying around of milk each year. The inbound delivery of linseed cake to the dairy farms and of coal to the area's buildings were also important. The line began to carry manure from London to the area's farms, carrying in 1872. The tramway also opened a cartage business to handle the onward shipment of goods and parcels unloaded at Brill and Wotton stations. alt=Small green steam locomotive With horses unable to cope, Jones and the Duke decided to convert at least part of the railway for locomotives. The lightly laid track with longitudinal sleepers limited them to , and it was thus necessary to use the lightest locomotives possible. Two traction engines converted for railway use were bought from Aveling and Porter for ¬£398 (about ¬£ in ) each. They were chosen for weight and reliability, and had a top speed on the level of . They took 95‚Äì98 minutes between Brill and Quainton Road, an average of . With an unusual configuration in which a flywheel drove chains which in turn drove the wheels, the locomotives were noisy and were nicknamed \\"Old Chainey\\" by locals. The first of the new locomotives, given serial number 807 by Aveling and Porter and numbered 1 by the Tramway, was delivered to Wotton station on 27 January 1872\\\\. On the day of its delivery, the now- redundant horses had been sent away. Nobody at Wotton could operate the locomotive so a horse had to be hired from Aylesbury until the driver arrived. After the delivery of the second locomotive on 7 September 1872, all passenger services were drawn by locomotive except on Thursdays, when locomotives were replaced by horses to allow for maintenance. The line carried 104 passengers in January 1872, rising to 224 in April, and 456 in August 1872. With steam came the need for water. Plans to dig a well near Wotton came to nothing, and the Duke's expedient of drawing water from a pond near Quainton Road did not impress the pond's owner. By March 1872 Jones recorded that \\"The party to whom the pond near the Quainton Station belongs is making complaints about our having water and I expect he will be using force to prevent our getting any\\". A wooden water tower was built at Brill station, and a large water tower known as the Black Tank was built in the fork of the main line and Church Siding. The engines proved adequate but slow. On 6 February 1872, Jones timed one as taking 41 minutes to travel roughly from Quainton Road to Wotton hauling 42 tons (43 t). They were low-powered, and when pulling a heavy load their front wheels would lift off the track. The Duke's cost-cutting led to poor maintenance of track and equipment, and the service was often interrupted by derailments and accidents. In 1876 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway raised its prices for coal haulage. All coal hauled on the Tramway needed to pass along the A&BR; from Verney Junction or Aylesbury and Jones had to raise prices to cover the surcharge or keep prices stable despite the loss of profits. Road-hauled coal from Bicester was already undercutting the Tramway and the unreliable engines had given the Tramway a poor reputation. Jones kept prices fixed and absorbed the increased costs, wrecking the Tramway's already declining business. In 1873 the 3rd Duke attempted to have the Wotton Tramway recognised as a railway, and William Yolland inspected the line in April 1873. The Railway Regulation Act 1844 defined minimum standards of travel, one of which was that the trains travel at an average of , which the Aveling and Porter locomotives could not manage. None of the stopping places had adequate station buildings, and the line had no signals. Yolland permitted the line to continue as a tramway, but refused to recognise it as a railway. Improvement and diversification alt=Small locomotive hauls four coaches of various designs By the mid-1870s the slow locomotives and their unreliability and inability to handle heavy loads were major problems. In 1874 Ferdinand de Rothschild bought a site near Waddesdon station from John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, for his planned Waddesdon Manor. Jones and the Duke recognised that construction would increase the haulage of heavy goods and that the engines would not cope. Engineer William Gordon Bagnall had established the locomotive firm of W. G. Bagnall in 1875. Bagnall wrote to the Duke offering to hire his first locomotive for trials. On 18 December 1876 the locomotive, Buckingham, was delivered. It entered service on 1 January 1877, mainly on the steep section of the line between Wotton and Brill. Jones was unhappy with some aspects of Buckingham, but recognised the improvement and ordered a locomotive from Bagnall for ¬£640 (about ¬£ in ). Wotton was delivered on 28 December 1877 and Buckingham was returned to Bagnall in February 1878. Buckingham and Wotton were more reliable than the Aveling and Porter engines. With modern locomotives on the Brill‚ÄìQuainton Road route (the Kingswood branch generally remained worked by horses, and occasionally by the Aveling and Porter engines), traffic rose. The figure for milk traffic rose from 40,000 gallons carried in 1875 to 58,000 gallons (260,000 l; 70,000 US gal) in 1879, and in 1877 the Tramway carried 20,994 tons (21,331 t) of goods. In early 1877 it appeared on Bradshaw maps and from May 1882 Bradshaw listed the timetable. Despite frequent derailments, low speed meant Wotton Tramway had a good safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12 September 1888 sparks from one of the Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle wagons, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed., quoted The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis. Passenger services Jones increased scheduled passenger journeys from two to three each day in each direction. With locomotives generally occupied with goods, many passenger services were drawn by horse. The increased passenger journeys boosted revenues, but the Tramway no longer owned enough horses and had to hire them. By 1881 the passenger service was losing ¬£11 (about ¬£ in ) a month, although reduced use of locomotives lowered maintenance costs. Reliability had improved, but services were still slow. Horse-drawn passenger services took 60‚Äì70 minutes to travel between Quainton Road and Brill. The locomotive-hauled mixed trains, with frequent stops to load and unload, were timetabled at 1 to 2 hours to make the same journey, slower than walking. Jones hoped to increase passenger revenue by promoting Brill as a spa. The chalybeate springs of Dorton Spa outside Brill were known for supposed healing powers, and a resort had been built around the Spa in the 1830s, featuring a modern pump house and eight baths, set in of parkland. Despite the redevelopment and the building of modern hotels in Brill, Dorton Spa was unfashionable and by the late 19th century was little used. Jones and the Spa's owners hoped Queen Victoria would visit during her 1890 stay at Waddesdon Manor and thus boost Brill as a spa town. A visit was arranged, but Victoria changed her mind and visited the spa at Cheltenham instead. The spa traffic never materialised. Waddesdon Manor alt=large two-storey brick building with a number of large pointed turrets on the roof In 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild began work on Waddesdon Manor, a short distance south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road). The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill to provide access to the construction site. Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill. Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and Westcott stations and ran south to the foot of Lodge Hill. From there a cable tram ran on narrow gauge rails up the hill to a gully close to the building site. Materials were hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch. The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on materials were hauled along the branch by horses. The building of Waddesdon Manor generated huge business for the Tramway. Large numbers of bricks from Poore's Brickworks at Brill were shipped. By July 1877 the entire output of the brickworks was going to supply the Waddesdon Manor works, with 25,000 bricks a week being used. Additional bricks were also shipped via Quainton Road, along with 7,000 tons (7,100 t) of Bath Stone from Corsham. The manor also required power and in 1883 a gasworks was built to the west. A siding from Westcott station ran south to the gasworks, to carry coal. Waddesdon Manor chose not to use the Tramway for supplying coal to the gasworks and the siding was abandoned in 1886. Waddesdon Manor was complete in 1889, 13 years after construction began. The Winchendon Branch closed and the track was removed. The gasworks remained operational, supplied by road, until its closure during the coal shortage of 1916. It was demolished shortly afterwards. The track of the disused siding remained until at least 1916. Brill Brick and Tile Works Poore's Brickworks was well established, and Jones believed there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10 million bricks a year. It was decided that 5 million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority. Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, as it came to be called, but it was operational by 1895. Jones (1974) says the siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway. Brill Brick and Tile Works could not compete with the larger and better-connected brickworks at Calvert and declined. The brickworks finally closed in the early 20th century. The building was taken over by the W. E. Fenemore workshop, making hay loaders, before being converted into a timber yard in the 1920s. Relations with the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway The introduction of the Bagnall locomotives and the traffic generated by the works at Waddesdon Manor had boosted the route's fortunes, but it remained in serious financial difficulty. The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business. Relations deteriorated between Jones and J. G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A&B.; The A&B;'s trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road. Jones asked the Duke to intervene but relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence. Jones sought legal advice and was told that the Duke would probably win a legal action against the A&BR.; The A&BR; was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against them would likely have forced the line through Quainton Road to close, severing the Tramway's connection with the national network altogether. Local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport. From its peak of 20,994 tons carried in 1877, goods traffic fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139 tons (9,286 t) in 1881. Many of the passengers using the Tramway continued their journey by way of the A&BR; line; in 1885, 5,192 passengers changed trains between the A&BR; and the Tramway at Quainton Road. Jones suggested that the A&BR; subsidise the Tramway's service to the sum of ¬£25 (about ¬£ in ) per month to allow passenger services to continue, but the A&BR; agreed to pay only ¬£5 (about ¬£ in ) per month. By the mid-1880s the Tramway was finding it difficult to cover the operating expenses of either goods or passenger operations. Oxford extension schemes Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company Euston railway station opened in 1837, the first railway station connecting London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London itself and the station was built on the northern boundary. Other termini north of London followed at Paddington (1838), Bishopsgate (1840), Fenchurch Street (1841), King's Cross (1852) and St Pancras (1868). All were outside the built-up area, making them inconvenient. Charles Pearson (1793‚Äì1862) had proposed an underground railway connecting the City of London with the main line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 he commissioned the first traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes. Despite concerns about vibration causing subsidence of buildings, the problems of compensating the many thousands whose homes were destroyed during digging of the tunnel, and fears that the tunnelling might break into Hell, construction began in 1860. On 9 January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway. The MR grew steadily, extending its own services and acquiring other local railways north and west of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819‚Äì1901) was appointed Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he wanted to unify a string of companies to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin negotiated to take control of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury and extend the Tramway southwest to Oxford, creating a route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London were poor, and the scheme would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford-upon-Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic and authorisation was sought from Parliament, who rejected the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill in 1875. Watkin received consent in 1881 to extend the MR to Aylesbury. With extension to Aylesbury approved, the Duke of Buckingham in March 1883 announced his own scheme to extend the Brill Tramway to Oxford. The turntable at Quainton Road would be replaced with a junction to the south of the existing turntable to allow through running. The stretch from Quainton Road to Brill would be straightened and improved to main line standards, and Waddesdon Road and Wood Siding stations would close. From Brill, the line would pass in a tunnel through Muswell Hill to the south of Brill, and on via Boarstall before crossing from Buckinghamshire into Oxfordshire at Stanton St. John. From Stanton St. John the line would stop on the outskirts of Oxford at Headington, terminating at a station to be built in the back garden of 12 High Street, St Clement's, near Magdalen Bridge. The proposal included a separate set of rails to be provided where the old and new routes ran together, to allow the existing Wotton Tramway to continue to operate independently if it saw fit, but given the Duke's involvement in the new scheme it is unlikely he intended to use this option. At the line would have been the shortest route between Oxford and Aylesbury, compared with via the GWR (which had absorbed the Wycombe Railway), and via the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the LNWR. The Act authorising the scheme received Royal Assent on 20 August 1883, and the new Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company was created, including the Duke of Buckingham, Ferdinand de Rothschild and Harry Verney among its directors. The scheme caught the attention of the expansionist Metropolitan Railway, who paid for the survey. Despite these powerful backers, the expensive Muswell Hill tunnel deterred investors. De Rothschild promised to lend money in return for guarantees that the rebuilt line would include a passenger station at Westcott, and that the Duke would press the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway to open a station at the nearest point to Waddesdon Manor. Waddesdon Manor railway station opened on 1 January 1897. Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad alt= Despite cash from Rothschild, the company could not raise sufficient investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had only been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, less than two weeks before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O&AT;), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to the same light specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and the Oxford terminus was to be in George Street, nearer the edge of the city. Jones was sceptical and felt that it was unlikely to recoup its construction costs. On 26 March 1889 the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos died, aged 65. A special train brought his body from London to Quainton Road, and from Quainton it was taken to Stowe for the service, and on to the family vault at Wotton. Five carriages provided by the London and North Western Railway carried mourners to Church Siding, near Wotton Underwood's church. Another carried a company of the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry, associated with the Grenville family and the upkeep of which had helped bankrupt the second duke. (This second train was delayed on the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, arriving late to the burial.) The dukedom was inherited only in the male line. As the 3rd Duke had three daughters but no son, the title became extinct. The 1st Duke was also Earl Temple of Stowe, a title which descended through heirs of his relatives should the male line become extinct. Consequently, on the 3rd Duke's death this title, with most of the Wotton estate, passed to his nephew William Temple- Gore-Langton who became the 4th Earl Temple. By this time construction of the MR extension from London to Aylesbury was under way, and on 1 July 1891 the MR absorbed the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. Sir Harry Verney died on 12 February 1894, and on 31 March 1894 the MR took over services on the A&BR; from the GWR. On 1 July 1894 the MR extension to Aylesbury was completed, giving the MR a unified route from London to Verney Junction. The MR embarked on upgrading and rebuilding stations along the line. Construction of the route from Brill to Oxford had not begun. Further Acts of Parliament were granted in 1892 and 1894 varying the route slightly and allowing electrification, but no building was carried out other than surveying. On 1 April 1894, the proposed extension to Oxford still intended, the O&AT; exercised a clause of the 1888 Act and took over the Wotton Tramway. Jones was retained as general Manager and work began on upgrading the line for the extension. Rebuilding and re- equipping by the O&AT; The track from Quainton Road to Brill was relaid with improved rails on standard transverse sleepers. The former longitudinal sleepers were used as fence posts and guard rails. The stations, little more than earth banks, were replaced with wooden platforms. Waddesdon, Westcott, Wotton and Brill were fitted with buildings housing a booking office, waiting rooms and toilets, and Wood Siding station had a small waiting room \\"with shelf and drawer\\". Church Siding was not included and was removed from the timetable. The Kingswood branch was not included in the rebuilding, and retained its original 1871 track. Two Manning Wardle locomotives, Huddersfield and Earl Temple, came into use on the line at around this time. Huddersfield had been built in 1876 and originally named Prestwich; Earl Temple was identical to Huddersfield other than having a covered cab. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad could not afford the price when Earl Temple was delivered and the Earl bought it with his own money and rented it to the O&AT.; In 1895 two new passenger carriages, each accommodating 40 passengers, were bought from the Bristol Wagon and Carriage Company. In 1896 Huddersfield was withdrawn, and in 1899 replaced with a new Manning Wardle locomotive named Wotton No. 2, at which time Earl Temple was renamed Brill No. 1\\\\. alt=Curving concrete station platform. There is a small wooden hut on the platform. The rebuilding reduced journeys between Quainton Road and Brill to between 35 and 43 minutes. From 1895 the Tramway ran four passenger services in each direction on weekdays. The population of the area remained low, and in 1901 Brill had a population of only 1206. Passenger traffic remained insignificant and in 1898 passenger receipts were only ¬£24 per month (about ¬£ in ). Meanwhile, the MR were rebuilding and resiting Quainton Road station, freeing space for a direct link between the former Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the O&AT; to be built. A curve between the lines opened on 1 January 1897, allowing through running between the two lines. With through running between the lines in place, in June 1899 the MR inspected the O&AT;'s carriages and locomotives, and had serious concerns. The original passenger carriage began as a horse tram and was shabby internally, and unsafe as part of a longer train. The passenger carriage from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol passenger carriages were unfit because of their light construction. Eight of the O&AT;'s nine goods wagons did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O&AT; an eight-wheeled 70 seat passenger carriage. As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O&AT;'s low platforms, 80‚Äì100 ft (24‚Äì30 m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR carriage. Metropolitan Railway takeover The Metropolitan and the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company were cooperating closely by 1899. The line had been upgraded in preparation for the Oxford extension and had been authorised as a railway in 1894, but construction on the extension had yet to begin. On 27 November John Bell, Watkin's successor as Chairman of the MR, leased the line from the O&AT; for ¬£600 (about ¬£ in ) a year with an option to buy the line. From 1 December 1899, the MR took over all operations. Jones stayed as Manager. The O&AT;'s decrepit passenger coach, a relic of Wotton Tramway days, was removed from its wheels and used as a platelayer's hut at Brill station. An elderly Brown, Marshalls and Co passenger coach replaced it, and a section of each platform was raised to accommodate the higher doors of this coach using earth and old railway sleepers. On 28 March 1902 the 4th Earl Temple died aged 55, succeeded by Algernon William Stephen Temple-Gore-Langton, 5th Earl Temple of Stowe. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company, which by now did nothing except collect ¬£600 annual rent from the MR, pay the Winwood Charity Trust rent for their land near Quainton Road crossed by the rails, and pay Earl Temple an annual dividend of ¬£400, remained independent under the control of the 4th Earl's trustees. Rebuilding and re-equipping by the Metropolitan Railway The MR sold all but one of the dilapidated goods wagons to the Llanelly and Mynydd Mawr Railway, replacing them with five eight-wheeled carriages built in 1865‚Äì66. The MR considered the Manning Wardle locomotives unreliable and from early 1903 they were replaced by a pair of Metropolitan Railway D Class engines; they were sold in 1911. The heavy D Class locomotives damaged the track, and in 1910 the track between Quainton Road and Brill was relaid to MR standards, using track removed from the inner London MR route but considered adequate for a rural branch line. Following this upgrading, the speed limit was increased to . The Kingswood branch was again not upgraded, and still retained its 1871 track. It was abandoned at the end of 1915, and the track removed in 1920. In 1911 Brill Brick and Tile Works closed, and the siding to the brickworks was removed, with the exception of the rails on the level crossing which in 1984 were still in place, albeit tarmacked over. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Brill became a centre for training cadets, who were housed in Wotton House and ferried in trains of five passenger coaches. A Class locomotives that were used on the Brill branch until its closure|alt=Purple steam locomotive The Metropolitan Railway was unhappy with the performance and safety of the D Class locomotives and sold them between 1916 and 1922. With much of their route close to London now electrified the MR had surplus steam locomotives, and two Metropolitan Railway A Class locomotives, numbers 23 (built 1866) and 41 (built 1869), were transferred to the route. Built by Beyer, Peacock and Company from 1864, the A Class had been the first locomotives owned by the Metropolitan (in 1863, the first year of operation, the MR had used engines borrowed from the GWR). The A Class were the most advanced locomotives regularly to work the route, but they predated all other rolling stock on the Tramway. The two locomotives operated for a week at a time. Occasionally, the MR substituted other similar locomotives. Four services per day operated, taking around 40 minutes from one end to the other in 1900, falling to 32 minutes by 1931 after the upgrading of the route and the introduction of the A Class locomotives. On 1 February 1903 Jones retired and control was taken over directly by the Metropolitan Railway. Jones died on 14 April 1909, surviving to see the railway network in the Aylesbury Vale reach its greatest extent. New railways through the Aylesbury Vale, 1899‚Äì1910 alt= Great Central Railway In 1893 another of Edward Watkin's railways, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, had been authorised to build a new line, from its existing station at Annesley in Nottinghamshire, south to Quainton Road. Watkin had intended to run services from Manchester and Sheffield via Quainton Road and along the Metropolitan Railway to the MR's station at Baker Street. Following Watkin's retirement in 1894, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway obtained permission for a separate station near Baker Street at Marylebone, and the line was renamed the Great Central Railway (GCR). The new line joined the existing MR just north of Quainton Road on the Verney Junction branch, and opened to passengers on 15 March 1899. Many of the bricks used in the building of the Great Central Railway were supplied by the Brill Brick and Tile Works and shipped along the Tramway, providing a significant revenue boost to the O&AT.; Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway Following Watkin's retirement, relations between the Great Central Railway and the Metropolitan Railway deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over MR lines from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the shaky goodwill of the MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway to create a second route into London. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began construction of a new line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR's existing station at Princes Risborough to the new Great Central line. The line ran from Princes Risborough north to meet the Great Central at Grendon Underwood, about north of Quainton Road. The new line was to cross the Tramway on a bridge immediately east of Wotton station; no intersection was built between the lines. A temporary siding was built from the Tramway onto the embankment of the new line, and was used for the transport of construction materials and the removal of spoil from the works during the building of the new line. The line was formally an independent company, but in practice was operated as part of the Great Central Railway. The new line was planned as a through route and was not intended to have any stations of its own, but in 1904 it was decided to build two stations on it. A new station, also named Wotton, was built immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. On 2 April 1906 the new route opened to passengers. The two Wotton stations were very close together, and the same stationmaster was responsible for both. Chiltern Main Line Bicester cut-off In 1910 the new Bicester cut-off line of the GWR Chiltern Main Line opened, allowing trains from London to Birmingham to bypass a long curve through Oxford. The new line was routed directly through Wood Siding, but no interchange station was built. The GWR ran in a cutting beneath the existing station; Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908‚Äì1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the GWR's line. The new line included the station named Brill and Ludgershall, which was considerably further from Brill than the existing Brill station. With the opening of the new routes, the Tramway for the first time suffered serious competition. Although further from Brill than the Tramway's station, the GWR's station provided a fast and direct route to the GWR's London terminus at Paddington. The Great Central Railway's station at Wotton, and the other Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway station at Akeman Street, provided fast and direct routes to both Paddington and to the Great Central's new London terminus at Marylebone, without the need to change trains at Quainton Road. In addition, following the end of the First World War motorised road transport grew rapidly, drawing passenger and goods traffic away from the railways. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company repeatedly tried to persuade the Metropolitan Railway to buy the line outright, but the MR declined. In July 1923 the O&AT; tried to sell the line to the GWR and to the Electric and Railway Finance Corporation, but was rebuffed by both. London Transport On 1 July 1933, the Metropolitan Railway, along with London's other underground railways, aside from the short Waterloo & City Railway, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). Thus, despite Brill and Verney Junction being and over two hours' travel from the City of London, the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad and the former Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway became parts of the London Underground network. The locomotives and carriages were repainted with London Transport's Johnston Sans emblem. By this time, the route from Quainton Road to Brill was in severe decline. Competition from the newer lines and from improving road haulage had drawn away much of the tramway's custom, and the trains would often run without a single passenger. The A Class locomotives were now 70 years old, and the track itself was poorly maintained. Trains, once again, were regularly derailing on the line. Frank Pick, managing director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services, and to concentrate on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. He saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that at least ¬£2,000 (about ¬£ in ) per year would be saved by closing the Brill branch. On 1 June 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board gave the required six months notice to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company that it intended to terminate operations on the tramway. Closure To fulfil their obligations, London Transport formally inspected the line on 23 July 1935. The inspection was carried out with great speed, the special train taking just 15 minutes to travel the length of the line from Brill to Quainton Road. The inspection confirmed that the closure process was to proceed. The last scheduled passenger service left Quainton Road in the afternoon of 30 November 1935. Hundreds of people gathered, and a number of members of the Oxford University Railway Society travelled from Oxford in an effort to buy the last ticket. Accompanied by firecrackers and fog signals, the train ran the length of the line to Brill, where the passengers posed for a photograph. Late that evening, a two-coach staff train pulled out of Brill, accompanied by a band playing Auld Lang Syne and a white flag. The train stopped at each station along the route, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45 pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts. At the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the tramway to the Metropolitan Railway main line were ceremonially severed. Following the withdrawal of London Transport services the Metropolitan Railway's lease was voided and at midnight on 1 December 1935 the railway and stations reverted to the control of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company. The O&AT; Board by now had only three members: the 5th Earl Temple, the Earl's agent Robert White, and the former Brill hay-loader manufacturer W. E. Fenemore. alt=Small wooden railway station with a single rail track. The platform is considerably taller at one end than at the other. Aside from a small wooden building on the platform, the only other visible building is a single farmhouse. At the time of the closure there was some speculation that the O&AT; would continue to operate the tramway as a mineral railway, but with no funds and no rolling stock of its own, the O&AT; was unable to operate the line. On 2 April 1936, the entire infrastructure of the stations was sold piecemeal at auction. Excluding the houses at Westcott and Brill, which were sold separately, the auction raised ¬£72 7s (about ¬£ in ) in total. The Ward Scrap Metal Company paid ¬£7,000 (about ¬£ in ) for the rails, with the exception of those at Quainton Road which were retained as a siding. With the stations at Wood Siding and Brill closed, and the GWR's Brill and Ludgershall railway station inconveniently sited, the GWR opened a new station on the Chiltern Main Line near to Brill at Dorton Halt on 21 June 1937. On 5 January 1937, the board of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad met for the last time. On 5 February 1937 a winding up petition was presented to the High Court, and on 24 March 1937 Mr W. E. Fisher was appointed liquidator. On 11 November 1940 Fisher was formally discharged, and the O&AT; officially ceased to exist. After closure After closure, the line was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford extension schemes exist in official archives. At least some of the rails remained in place in 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of RAF Westcott. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway; much of the route can still be traced by a double line of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk. After the death of the 3rd Duke of Buckingham the family archives, including the records of the Brill Tramway, were sold to the Huntington Library in California. In 1968 the London Underground Railway Society launched a fundraising appeal to microfilm the relevant material, and in January 1971 the microfilms were opened to researchers at the University of London Library (now Senate House Library). In the 1973 documentary Metro-land, John Betjeman spoke of a 1929 visit to Quainton Road, and of watching a train depart for Brill: \\"The steam ready to take two or three passengers through oil-lit halts and over level crossings, a rather bumpy journey\\". alt=A straight muddy path leads through a small clearing filled with farming equipment. Wotton station on the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, which in 1923 had been taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway, remained open (albeit little used and served by only two trains per day in each direction) until 7 December 1953, when the station was abandoned. The bridge that had formerly carried the GW&GCJR; over the tramway at Wotton was demolished in 1970, and the former GW&GCJR; station was converted to a private house. Both Dorton Halt and Brill and Ludgersall stations were closed on 7 January 1963 and trains no longer stop; the line through them remains in use by trains between Princes Risborough and Bicester North. Quainton Road station was bought in 1969 by members of the London Railway Preservation Society to use as a permanent base, and now houses the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The station is still connected to the railway network and used by freight trains and occasional special passenger services, but no longer has a scheduled passenger service. There are no longer any open railway stations in the areas formerly served by the tramway. Plans have been proposed by the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre to rebuild and reopen a stretch of the tramway as a heritage railway.

Some journeys were then extended to Archway rather than terminating in Tufnell Park. These were then withdrawn, but were reinstated following the withdrawal of local route C12 in 1998. As part of a restructuring of services in the lead-up to the introduction of the London congestion charge, on 1 February 2003, route 10 was split in two: the route between Archway and Kings Cross, and as far as Marble Arch, was taken over by new route 390, and route 10 was shortened to serve only its original route between Hammersmith and King's Cross.

His sire was Native Dancer and his dam was Sweep In. In 1966, Kauai King won the first two legs of the U.S. Triple Crown. To date, Kauai King is one of only two horses born in Maryland to have crossed the Kentucky Derby finish line first, but 1968 winner Dancer's Image was later stripped of his title, leaving Kauai King as the only official Maryland-bred winner of the Derby. Racing career Ridden by jockey Don Brumfield, Kauai King won the 1966 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes but finished 4th in the Belmont Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack, 2 lengths behind the winner, Amberoid. On June 16, the colt was sold to a horse breeding syndicate for a then record price of $2,520,000. Other top 3-year-olds in 1966 included Graustark and 1965 Champion 2-Year-Old Colt Buckpasser. The undefeated Graustark's racing career ended with a broken coffin bone in the Blue Grass Stakes, and an injury kept Buckpasser out of the Triple Crown races. Even after Kauai King's wins in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, there was much speculation as to which was the better horse. On June 27, 1966, Kauai King (against the advice of his trainer, Henry Forrest) and Buckpasser met in the Arlington Classic. Kauai King's racing career came to an end when he pulled a ligament in his leg during the race. Following the announcement of his career-ending injury, he was retired to stand at stud at Alfred G. Vanderbilt II's Sagamore Farm in Glyndon, Maryland. Kauai King is still one of only two dual Classic winners ever bred in Maryland (the other is Cloverbrook in 1877) and one of only nine to win a Triple Crown race. Retirement Kauai King proved less than successful as a sire. Near the end of 1971, he was shipped to stand at stud in England. He remained there until 1973. He then was sent to a breeding farm in Japan where he died on January 24, 1989.

A \\"Quistclose trust\\" arises when an asset is given to somebody for a specific purpose and if, for whatever reason, the purpose for the transfer fails, the transferor may take back the asset. If a debtor undertakes to use the loan in a particular way and segregates the creditor's money from his general assets, and the debtor becomes insolvent, the creditor's money is refundable and is not available to pay the debtor's other creditors. If the trust fails (because the purpose is not or cannot be fulfilled), the sums become subject to a resulting trust in favour of the person who originally advanced the credit and the person to whom the sums were advanced holds them as trustee. Facts Rolls Razor Ltd owed ¬£484,000 to Barclays Bank Ltd. It still needed more money to pay a dividend, which it had declared to its shareholders on 2 July 1964. Quistclose Investments Ltd agreed to a loan of ¬£209,719 8s 6d on the conditions that the dividend would be paid with it and the money would be put in a separate account (also with Barclays Bank). The money was paid into the account, but before the dividend was distributed, Rolls Razor Ltd went into voluntary liquidation. Quistclose sought to recover the money, contending that its agreement meant Rolls Razor Ltd held the money on trust. Barclays contended that the account was part of the general assets of the company and that it was entitled to exercise a set- off of the money in the account against the debts that Rolls Razor owed with respect of Barclays.[1970] AC 567, 568 Judgment The House of Lords (with the leading judgment being given by Lord Wilberforce) unanimously held that the money was held by Rolls Razor on trust for the payment of the dividends; that purpose having failed, the money was held on trust for Quistclose. The fact that the transaction was a loan did not exclude the implication of a trust. The legal rights (to call for repayment) and equitable rights (to claim title) could co-exist. Barclays, having notice of the trust, could not retain the money as against Quistclose. Similarly, the liquidator of Rolls Razor could not claim title to the money, as the assets did not form part the beneficial estate of Rolls Razor. Lord Reid, Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest, Lord Guest and Lord Pearce all agreed with the judgment that Lord Wilberforce gave:[1970] AC 567, 580-582 Significance The conceptual analysis underpinning Quistclose trusts was the source of some debate. Shortly after the decision, an article appeared in the Law Quarterly Review,(1985) 101 LQR 269 written by Peter Millett QC, suggesting how the traditional trust need for certainty of objects (beneficiary) could be squared with the decision of the House of Lords and the refusal to accept new categories of purpose trust in equity. In Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley,[2002] UKHL 12 the House of Lords reviewed the law, and the leading judgment was given by Lord Millett, whose judicial analysis unsurprisingly closely mirrored what he had suggested twenty years previously. The key issue, according to Lord Millett, in upholding the trust concept is ascertaining where the beneficial interest in the money lies. Lord Millett suggests that there are four possible answers: (1) the lender, (2) the borrower, (3) the ultimate purpose and (4) no one in the sense that the beneficial interest remains \\"in suspense\\". Lord Millett then analysed all of the foregoing, and determined that the beneficial interest remains with the lender until the purpose for which the funds are lent is fulfilled. The only other reasoned decision was Lord Hoffmann, who agreed with Lord Millett but disagreed as to whether it was an express or resulting trust. Some have suggested that a Quistclose trust is indubitably a trust but would not be a resulting trust as the beneficial interest never 'results back' to the lender; it was with him all the time. However, others point out that there are many resulting trusts whose beneficial interest never leaves the donor, such as the classic example of a trust failing for uncertain objects. Requirements It is sometimes argued that Quistclose trusts are not a separate species of trust at all but merely a simple trust that has certain characteristics. However, Quistclose trusts are often regarded as somewhat special and distinct. The English Court of Appeal, in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [1999] Lloyd's Rep 438, suggested obiter dictum that it was in fact a 'quasi-trust', which is not required to satisfy \\"the usually strict requirements for a valid trust so far as 'certainty of object[s]' is concerned. However, the House of Lords, on appeal, declined to endorse those comments. Purpose However, what differentiates the Quistclose trust from other trusts is the existence of the specific purpose for which the sums on credit must be applied and the failure of which gives rise to the trust. It must also be clear that if that specific purpose fails, the sums will revert to the person who originally advanced them. The situations in which Quistclose trusts have been upheld are varied. They have been upheld in cases of: *sums advanced for the specific payment of a dividend;Barclays Bank v Quistclose Investments *sums advanced for the specific payment of a creditor;Carreras Rothmans v Freeman Mathews Treasure [1985] Ch 207 *sums advanced on the basis of an undertaking for a specific project;Twinsectra v Yardley and *advance payments made on credit for the purchase of specific goods.Re Kayford (in liquidation) [1975] 1 WLR 279 and Re EVTR Ltd. [1987] BCLC 647 One issue that has to date escaped notice in the judicial consideration of Quistclose trusts is how narrowly the purpose has to be defined. Suggestions have been made to the effect that the general law in relation to powers would apply (such that if the purpose is sufficiently well defined to be a power, a Quistclose trust may arise), but others have argued that to take tests from one branch of the law and apply it to another may not be appropriate. The lower courts in Twinsectra suggested that the purpose must be sufficiently well defined, but Lord Millett distanced himself from that position by claiming that \\"uncertainty works in favour of the lender, not the borrower\\".Implying that a lack of certainty over the purpose makes it more likely that a trust will be found in favour of the lender. Certainty of intention In Twinsectra v Yardley, Lord Millett spent some time considering the necessary intention. It has long been settled law that a person need not have a specific intention to create an express trust so long as the court can determine from the person's intention that a beneficial entitlement should be conferred which the law (or equity) will enforce.The most commonly cited example is Paul v Constance [1977] 1 WLR 527, where one party said \\"this money is as much yours as mine\\", that was held to amount to a trust at law. Thus, in Twinsectra, where there was a solicitor's undertaking that the money should be used for only one purpose, that was held to be sufficient intent. In Quistclose itself and in Carreras Rothmans v Freeman Mathews Treasure, where loans were made for a specific purpose, this may also amount to sufficient intention.Not by coincidence, shortly after Quistclose, bank loan documents in England began to include clauses covenanted to use the loan for a stated purpose. If a loan is advanced for the borrower to use as he will, no Quistclose trust can arise. Criticisms In the early stages of development of the Quistclose trust, it was suggested that the concept was unambiguously good. In Re Kayford, it was suggested that a segregated account for customers' money to be placed in to guard against the insolvency of the company was a proper and responsible thing to do. However, more recently, criticism has been mounted that giving a proprietary claim to a lender that enables the lender to reclaim the loan ahead of unsecured creditors has the effect of putting the lender in the position of a secured creditor, but without the need to register any security interest against the borrower (and thus meaning that other creditors would not be aware of the preferential status of the lender's claim). Quistclose trusts still remain relatively uncommon, and as yet, there has been no clamour for legislation or regulation (Quistclose trusts were not even addressed under English law when the insolvency law was last revised in the Enterprise Act 2002). However, should the courts start finding them with increasing frequency,For example, in the way that judicial findings of undue influence became prevalent in mortgage lending. it may be that regulation, or judicial revision, follows.

Background The fortress was finished in 1672 and formed a part of King Christian IV's plan for defense of Kristiansand when the city was founded in 1641. The architect of the fortress was quartermaster general Willem Coucheron. It was built on an islet, about 100 yards from shore. Today the fortress is connected to the mainland. The only time the fortress has been in battle was against a British fleet force, led by in 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars. One of the very few remaining larger warships under Danish-Norwegian command was the ship of the line HDMS Prinds Christian Frederik with 70 cannons that was in the eastern harbor of Kristiansand. Captain Stopford on board HMS Spencer ordered to sail toward the city and announced in a letter that he wanted to take over the HDMS Prinds Christian Fredrik, and threatened to open fire on the city if the ship were not disclosed. When the ships approached, they were met by fierce resistance from Christiansholm Fortress. The attack was repulsed by massive gunfire and the British sailed instead to the abandoned Fredriksholm Fortress, which was blown up and destroyed. The fortress was decommissioned by royal decree during June 1872 as part of a major redevelopment of fortifications across the nation. Today, Christiansholm is a tourist attraction by the Kristiansand Boardwalk and venue for a variety of cultural events and festivities. It is now owned by the municipality and is a site used principally for recreation and cultural events.

During the festival, the Piala Citra winners are announced and the best Indonesian films of the year are presented. The awards ceremony was first held in 1955 as the Pekan Apresiasi Film Nasional. It changed to Festival Film Indonesia in 1973. In 1986, the festival included awards for television movies with an award called Piala Vidia. This awards ceremony includes numerous similarities when compared to the Academy Awards in the United States. History In 1955, 1960 and 1967 Pekan Apresiasi Film Nasional (English: National Film Appreciation Week) was held in Jakarta. From 1973‚Äì1992 the ceremony was renamed Festival Film Indonesia and became an annual event. The trophy/award was named Piala Citra (Citra Award). The All-Indonesia Cinema Owners' Association (Gabungan Pengusaha Bioskop Seluruh Indonesia, or GPBSI) awarded the Antemas Prize, named for the producer Antemas. From 1993‚Äì2003 the festival did not take place, because the quantity of good Indonesian movies had dropped significantly. In the 1990s, most Indonesian movie producers created low budget, B movies. Producers suffered revenue losses because of growing piracy. Since 1992, American, Hong Kong and Taiwanese movies took over many theaters. Low budget Indonesian movies get the dregs, such as open theatre cinemas, portable cinemas, direct to video, or on TV. In 2004 the Indonesian Film Festival committee launched and returned the event to an annual affair. In 2014 the Indonesian Film Board was formed and FFI changed the award statuette. In 2017 the Indonesian Film Board added two more awards for unique and creative films, raising the total to 21. In 2018 awards were given in 23 categories. Citra Awards Citra Awards are accolades by the Committee to recognize excellence of professionals in the Indonesian film industry, including directors, actors and writers. In 2009, the Indonesian Film Festival Committee replaced the National Body of Motion Picture as the official event organizer of the Indonesian Film Festival. The Committee was authorized by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Indonesia to organize the operational process of Citra Awards' ceremony and the selection (voting) of nominations and winners. In 2014, the Indonesian Film Board replaced the Indonesian Film Festival Committee as the festival organizer. The festival is audited by Deloitte. The Ministry of Tourism of Indonesia oversees the organizer. The Citra Award, often mistakenly called the FFI Award (Indonesian Film Festival), is the title of the event where the Citra Award and Vidia Award winners are announced. Awards The categories of Citra Awards are: * Best Film (in Indonesian: Film Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Director (Sutradara Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Leading Actor (Pemeran Utama Pria Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Leading Actress (Pemeran Utama Wanita Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Supporting Actor (Pemeran Pendukung Pria Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Supporting Actress (Pemeran Pendukung Wanita Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Writing ‚Äì Original Screenplay (Skenario Asli Terbaik): 2009 to present * Best Writing ‚Äì Adapted Screenplay (Skenario Adaptasi Terbaik): 2009 to present * Best Cinematography (Penata Sinematografi Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Art Direction (Penata Artistik Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Film Editing (Penyunting Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Sound Editing & Mixing (Penata Suara Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Original Score (Penata Musik Terbaik): 1955 to present * Best Documentary Feature (Film Dokumenter Panjang Terbaik): 2004 to present * Best Short Film (Film Pendek Terbaik): 2004 to present Retired awards * Best Screenplay (Skenario Terbaik): 1955 to 2008 Special awards * Best Documentary Short Subject (Film Dokumenter Pendek Terbaik): 2009 * Best Director in Short Film (Penghargaan Khusus Sutradara Film Pendek Terbaik): 2009 * Best New Director (Penghargaan Khusus Sutradara Baru Terbaik): 2009 * Best Film for Children (Penghargaan Khusus Film Anak-anak Terbaik): 2009 * Best Animated Feature (Penghargaan Khusus Film Animasi Terbaik): 2008 * Lifetime Achievement Award (Penghargaan Pengabdian dan Dedikasi Seumur Hidup): 2006, 2009 & 2010 Vidia Awards Vidia Awards recognize excellence in the Indonesian television movie industry, including directors, actors and writers.

Formerly it was placed in its own family, Trichopodaceae, but is now included in the family Dioscoreaceae. The leaves are about long and grow from a rhizome. The shape of the leaves can be highly variable even within one location, but the most common shape is cordate. The herb grows on sandy soil near rivers and streams in shady places in lowland and intermediate altitude forests. It flowers year long and the fruits are thought to be dispersed by water. The unusual flowers are purplish black. Distribution T. zeylanicus grows in Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Southwestern Ghats mountains of South India. Traditional medicine It has been in use for centuries by the Kaani tribal community of the Agastya Koodam ranges in Kerala, India, for its medicinal properties. Modern Indian scientists learned the medical properties of Trichopus zeylanicus in December 1987 while on a scientific expedition to the Agasthia Hills in the Western Ghats. They noticed that their guides, belonging to the Kaani tribe, were very energetic in sharp contrast to themselves. They had walked for several hours with the scientists, but the difference was that they ate the fruits of a wild plant T. zeylanicus as they walked. It was found from the Kaani men that it was indeed the fruits they were eating that made them energetic, a fact about the plant well known to the tribe for ages. Historically, the members of the tribes called the plant 'chathan kalanji' literally meaning 'satan destroyer'. The more popular name of the plant, \\"Arogya pacha\\" (literally meaning \\"the green that gives strength\\") was given to it by the scientists. Detailed chemical and pharmacological investigations showed that the leaf of the plant contained flavonoid glycosides, glycolipids and some other non-steroidal compounds. In the article published in www.ijpcbs.com showed the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the leaf extract against 8 bacterial and 8 fungal strains (Manza and Saj, 2013) Legal issues The Indian commercial and scientific interest in the herb caused misguided suspicions of bio-piracy in Sri Lanka, where it is called Bimpol, and exports of the herb were forbidden in 1998.

Biography Born in Philadelphia, Beck moved to Manhattan in his teens, playing six nights a week in a trio setting, which gave him an opportunity to meet various people working in the thriving New York music scene. By the time he was 18, Stan Getz hired him to record jingles, and in 1967 he recorded with Miles Davis. By 1968, at age 22, he was a member of the Gil Evans Orchestra. Beck described his early success in an interview near the end of his life: > My career happened because I happened to be in the right place at the right > time in a very unique time of jazz music. ...when I would finish a gig > around two in the morning I would go around the corner to the Playboy Club > and sit in with Monty Alexander and let Les Spann take a breather and I > would finish the gig for him. Then we would go and listen to Kenny Burrell > play around the corner or we would go up to Mintons and listen to Wes > Montgomery and sit in with him ...Joe Beck Interview With Jazz Guitar Life > (08/14/07) Beck played in a variety of jazz styles, including jazz fusion, post bop, mainstream jazz, and soul jazz, but also respected rock stylists and cross- over players (he was good friends with Larry Coryell) and briefly flirted with rock music styles himself in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1970 Polydor released Rock Encounter. In 1975 he released an eponymous album (upon which he simply referred to himself as \\"Beck\\") while recording the Esther Phillips album, What a Diff'rence a Day Makes, both for Kudu.Sleeve notes to CD reissue of Beck & Sanborn Beck was subsequently reissued as Beck & Sanborn to cash in on the success of alto saxophonist David Sanborn. In 1971, Beck left music for three years to become a dairy farmer, citing frustration with his career. In 1978, he went for more of a rock sound by forming a band named \\"Leader\\". They performed in the Northeast and recorded demos at Sound Ideas Studios in New York City, but soon disbanded when the band's gear was stolen after a gig at Joyous Lake in Woodstock, New York. In the 1980s Beck recorded for DMP including with flautist Ali Ryerson. In 1988, Beck left music again for a return to farming, but was touring again by 1992. Beck toured and recorded with duos and small groups, releasing two more solo albums (1988, 1991). In 2000, he collaborated with guitarist Jimmy Bruno on Polarity, which extensively featured Beck's Alto guitar, and in 2008 on Coincidence with John Abercrombie. Beck worked as a sideman or session guitarist with a wide variety of well-known jazz, rock, and fusion musicians, including Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Buddy Rich, Woody Herman, Miles Davis, Maynard Ferguson, Howard Roberts, Tommy Tedesco, Larry Coryell, John Abercrombie, Tom Scott, Jeremy Steig, and Gabor Szabo. In mid-life Beck spent less time playing and worked more as a composer of commercial jingles and as an arranger, writing arrangements for Frank Sinatra and Gloria Gaynor. Joe also arranged and produced many records including projects for Frank Sinatra, Gloria Gaynor, and two albums for Esther Phillips including her hit single, \\"What A Difference A Day Makes\\". Over the years, Joe was signed to contracts with Columbia, Polydor, Verve, Gryphon, CTI, and MGM Records. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences honored Beck five times with its Most Valuable Player Award. Beck also recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London, the Milan Philharmonic in Italy, and The Paris String Ensemble in France. Beck's first wife, Sigi, was a model and later married an internationally renowned economist, Dr. Zoran Hodjera. At Beck's death, he was married to Marsi Beck and was survived by five children. Beck died in Woodbury, Connecticut, of complications from lung cancer. His album Get Me Joe Beck was posthumously released in 2014. Alto guitar In 1992 Beck began touring as a duo with flutist Ali Ryerson. To fill out the sound he wanted to present‚Äîbass lines, harmony, and melody‚Äîin a duo setting, he developed what he called the \\"alto guitar\\". This began as a standard, full-body, electric jazz guitar with a unique stringing pattern and reentrant tuning. As described by Beck: > It's pretty straight-ahead, really. Take your whole guitar and tune it down > a fifth to the key of A, and then tune the middle two strings up an octave. > What I've done is take the normal tuning of the guitar and changed it so > that I have bass strings for my thumb; sort of a banjo register for my first > two fingers, and then a low melody register for my other two fingers. [...] > So you don't have to change any of your fingerings; it's the same intervals > as in normal tuning, just in the key of A, so it's A-D-G-C-E-A.\\" With octave > designations: A1 D2 G3 C4 E3 A3. This makes the tuning reentrant (the > highest pitched strings are in the middle) and allows for unique chord > voicings. The range is roughly that of a baritone guitar. While devising the tuning Beck realized that some restringing was going to be needed to obtain optimal resonance from the strings, so he commissioned a custom-built instrument from luthier Rick McCurdy, of Cort Guitars: > I had someone build me a guitar, Rick McCurdy as it happens, and he made me > a beautiful guitar and so I started using it on the concert stage. > I'm actually playing through three channels. The reason the guitar is a > patented invention is that this pickup is split so that the bass strings > have their own output. And the top four melody strings are coming out of > another output, which in turn is split stereo by a chorus. The bass strings > are .080 and .060. Then a .022 wound and a .016 plain. Then a .026 wound and > a .018 plain. [...] I wanted to be more pianistic, to play clusters sort of > like those Bill Evans employs, that you couldn't possibly play otherwise.\\" Beck owned and played both Martin (CF-2) and Cort Alto guitars, and both Martin and Cort standard-tuning versions as well.  Signature guitars  Joe Beck worked with guitar manufacturer Cort Guitars in the 1990s to create two hollow-body jazz guitar models. The first was the BECK-6 model, which was an electric, hollow-bodied archtop jazz guitar, and the second was the BECK-ALTO model, a similar instrument but designed for heavier strings and alto tuning. In 2001, the retail price of the BECK-6 model was $895, and the BECK-ALTO model was $1195. Two finishes were available on both guitars, a blonde \\"natural\\" finish, and a black-and-orange \\"vintage burst\\" finish. The main differences between the models were the accommodations made for thicker strings on the BECK-ALTO model, and only one electronic pickup on the BECK- ALTO versus two on the BECK-6. The single pickup on the ALTO had split bass/treble controls for the lower two strings versus the upper four, and consequently, three knobs on the front of the guitar, versus four knobs on the BECK-6. Both Cort guitar models could be purchased directly from Joe Beck through his website and at guitar dealers. The BECK-6 is much more common, versus the BECK-ALTO, of which an estimated 200 were made.

He played in Major League Baseball for the Minnesota Twins and Toronto Blue Jays. His son, Craig Kusick, Jr. led Wisconsin‚ÄìLaCrosse to the 1995 Division III football championship as a quarterback, received the Melberger Award as the top Division III player, and later played in the Arena Football League. Biography Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Kusick grew up in the suburb of Greenfield. After attending the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLa Crosse, he was signed by the Twins in 1970. He broke in with the team in September 1973, and gradually took over first base duties from Harmon Killebrew, but was primarily used as a DH from 1976 to 1978 when Rod Carew was moved over from second base. On August 27, 1975 Kusick tied a major league record by being hit by pitches three times in an 11-inning game against the Milwaukee Brewers. His career peaked with a 1977 season in which he batted .254 with 12 home runs and 45 runs batted in. After hitting .173 in 1978, and posting a .241 mark through 24 games in 1979, his contract was sold to the Toronto Blue Jays in midseason. He hit .204 in 24 more games with the Blue Jays before being released after the season. Kusick subsequently signed with the San Diego Padres but never made it back to the major leagues. Kusick ended his career with a .235 batting average, 46 HRs, 171 RBI, 291 hits, 155 runs and 11 stolen bases in 497 games. In his brief stint with Toronto he also made one appearance as a relief pitcher in a 24‚Äì2 blowout loss against the California Angels, allowing three hits and two runs in 3-2/3 innings for a 4.91 earned run average. Kusick later was named baseball coach at Rosemount High School in Rosemount, Minnesota from 1982 to 2004. Seven of his teams played in the state tournament. Personal life A resident of Apple Valley, Minnesota, Kusick died of leukemia on September 27, 2006, three days before his 58th birthday, in St. Paul. He died nine months after his wife Sarabeth (October 27, 1949 ‚Äì December 22, 2005) succumbed to ovarian cancer; they were survived by their two children.

Harman is best known as the artist for the Red Ryder comic strip, which he created with Stephen Slesinger. Harman was on a Colorado ranch when he decided to do a comic strip. He headed for Hollywood in the early 1930s, borrowed some money and began Bronc Peeler, which he syndicated himself. The Bronc Peeler Sunday strip began October 7, 1934. \\"Peeler\\" is traditional cowboy slang for a specialist in breaking horses‚Äîtraining them to tolerate riders. \\"Bronc\\" or \\"bronco\\" is a wild or untrained horse. Characters and story The comics are set in the present time (the 1930s when this series was first published).https://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/harman_fred.htm Redheaded Bronc Peeler is a tough cowboy who fights bandits and rustlers with the help of his pal, Coyote Pete. Bronc Peeler introduced the Navaho youth, Little Beaver, who continued as an important supporting character in Red Ryder. Comics historian Don Markstein described the characters: :Bronc was a redheaded young man who was good in a fight, with either fists or a six-gun, and equally good on a horse. He put his skills to use against Injuns, cattle rustlers, rapacious city slickers, bandits and other villain types of the Western adventure pulps. He had a rugged Westerner's drawl, and a rugged Westerner's attraction to the ladies, to whom he was unfailingly polite. His first sidekick was an old desert rat named Coyote Pete, but Harman decided (at his wife's suggestion) to reach out to young readers by dropping Pete in favor of a kid. Bronc adopted a Navajo boy named Little Beaver following the death of the tyke's father, Chief Beaver. Little Beaver was destined to outlast Bronc.Markstein, Don.

Austin The recorded history of Austin, Texas, began in the 1830s when Anglo-American settlers arrived in Central Texas. In 1837 settlers founded the village of Waterloo on the banks of the Colorado River, the first permanent settlement in the area. By 1839, Waterloo would adopt the name Austin and become the capital of the Republic of Texas. Austin's history has also been largely tied to state politics and in the late 19th century, the establishment of the University of Texas made Austin a regional center for higher education, as well as a hub for state government. In the 20th century, Austin's music scene had earned the city the nickname \\"Live Music Capital of the World.\\" With a population of over 800,000 inhabitants in 2010, Austin is experiencing a population boom. During the 2000s (decade) Austin was the third fastest-growing large city in the nation. Beginning Evidence of habitation of the Balcones Escarpment region of Texas can be traced to at least 11,000 years ago. Two of the oldest Paleolithic archeological sites in Texas, the Levi Rock Shelter and Smith Rock Shelter, are located southwest and southeast of present-day Austin respectively. Several hundred years before the arrival of European settlers, the area was inhabited by a variety of nomadic Native American tribes. These indigenous peoples fished and hunted along the creeks, including present-day Barton Springs, which proved to be a reliable campsite.History of Barton Springs from Austin History Center At the time of the first permanent settlement of the area, the Tonkawa tribe was the most common, with the Comanches and Lipan Apaches also frequenting the area.Native Americans in Austin from Austin History Center The first European settlers in the present-day Austin were a group of Spanish friars who arrived from East Texas in July 1730. They established three temporary missions, La Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n, San Francisco de los Neches and San Jos√© de los Nazonis, on a site by the Colorado River, near Barton Springs. The friars found conditions undesirable and relocated to the San Antonio River within a year of their arrival. Following Mexico's Independence from Spain, Anglo-American settlers began to populate Texas and reached present-day Central Texas by the 1830s. The first documented permanent settlement in the area dates to 1837 when the village of Waterloo was founded near the confluence of the Colorado River and Shoal Creek. Capital City of A New Republic By 1836 the Texas Revolution was over and the Republic of Texas was independent. That year was also characterized by political disarray in Texas. In 1836, no fewer than five Texas sites served as temporary capitals of the new republic (Washington-on- the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco and Columbia), before President Sam Houston moved the capital to Houston in 1837. Shortly after the election of President Mirabeau B. Lamar, the Texas Congress appointed a site-selection commission to locate an optimal site for a new permanent capital. They chose a site on the western frontier, after viewing it at the instruction of President Lamar, who visited the sparsely settled area in 1838. Lamar was a proponent of westward expansion. Impressed by its beauty, abundant natural resources, promise as an economic hub, and central location in Texas territory, the commission purchased along the Colorado River comprising the hamlet of Waterloo and adjacent lands. Because the area's remoteness from population centers and its vulnerability to attacks by Mexican troops and Native Americans displeased many Texans, Sam Houston among them, political opposition made Austin's early years precarious ones. However, Lamar prevailed in his nomination, which he felt would be a prime location that intersected the roads to San Antonio and Santa Fe. Officially chartered in 1839, the Texas Congress designated the name of Austin for the new city. According to local folklore, Stephen F. Austin, the \\"father of Texas\\" for whom the new capital city was named, negotiated a boundary treaty with the local Native Americans at the site of the present-day Treaty Oak after a few settlers were killed in raids. After the republic purchased several hundred acres to establish the city, Lamar renamed it in honor of Stephen F. Austin in March 1839. The city's original name is honored by local businesses such as Waterloo Ice House and Waterloo Records, as well as Waterloo Park downtown.When was Austin founded? from Austin History Center An 1873 illustration of Austin Lamar tapped Judge Edwin Waller to direct the planning and construction of the new town. Waller chose a site on a bluff above the Colorado River, nestled between Shoal Creek to the west and Waller Creek (which was named for him) to the east. Waller surveyed a grid plan on a single square-mile plot with 14 blocks running in both directions. One grand avenue, which Lamar named \\"Congress\\", cut through the center of town from Capitol Square down to the Colorado River. The streets running north‚Äìsouth (paralleling Congress) were named for Texas rivers with their order of placement matching the order of rivers on the Texas state map. The east‚Äìwest streets were named after trees native to the region, despite the fact that Waller had recommended using numbers. (They were eventually changed to numbers in 1884.) The city's perimeters stretched north to south from the river at 1st Street to 15th Street, and from East Avenue (now Interstate 35) to West Avenue. Much of this original design is still intact in downtown Austin today. In October 1839, the entire government of the Republic of Texas arrived by oxcart from Houston. By the next January, the population of the town was 839. During the Republic of Texas era, France sent Alphonse Dubois de Saligny to Austin as its charg√© d'affaires. Dubois purchased of land in 1840 on a high hill just east of downtown to build a legation, or diplomatic outpost. The French Legation stands as the oldest documented frame structure in Austin. Also in 1839, the Texas Congress set aside of land north of the capitol and downtown for a \\"university of the first class.\\" This land became the central campus of the University of Texas at Austin in 1883. Political turmoil and the Texas Annexation Austin flourished initially but in 1842 entered the darkest period in its history. Lamar's successor as President of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston, ordered the national archives transferred to Houston for safekeeping after Mexican troops captured San Antonio on March 5, 1842. Convinced that removal of the republic's diplomatic, financial, land, and military-service records was tantamount to choosing a new capital, Austinites refused to relinquish the archives. Houston moved the government anyway, first to Houston and then to Washington-on-the-Brazos, which remained the seat of government until 1845. The archives stayed in Austin. When Houston sent a contingent of armed men to seize the General Land Office records in December 1842, they were foiled by the citizens of Austin and Travis County in an incident known as the Texas Archive War. Deprived of its political function, Austin languished. Between 1842 and 1845 its population dropped below 200 and its buildings deteriorated. During the summer of 1845, Anson Jones, Houston's successor as president, called a constitutional convention meeting in Austin, approved the annexation of Texas to the United States and named Austin the state capital until 1850, at which time the voters of Texas were to express their preference in a general election. After resuming its role as the seat of government in 1845, Austin officially became the state capital on February 19, 1846, the date of the formal transfer of authority from the republic to the state. Austin's status as capital city of the new U.S. state of Texas remained in doubt until 1872, when the city prevailed in a statewide election to choose once and for all the state capital, turning back challenges from Houston and Waco. Statehood and the U.S. Civil War Texas State Capitol Austin recovered gradually, population reaching 854 by 1850, 225 of whom were slaves and one a free black. Forty-eight percent of Austin's family heads owned slaves. The city entered a period of accelerated growth following its decisive triumph in the 1850 election to determine the site of the state capital for the next twenty years. For the first time the government constructed permanent buildings, among them a new capitol at the head of Congress Avenue, completed in 1853, and the Governor's Mansion, completed in 1856. State-run asylums for deaf, blind, and mentally ill Texans were erected on the fringes of town. Congregations of Baptists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Catholics erected permanent church buildings, and the town's elite built elegant Greek Revival mansions. By 1860 the population had climbed to 3,546, including 1,019 slaves and twelve free blacks. That year thirty-five percent of Austin's family heads owned slaves. While Texas voted overwhelmingly to secede from the Union and join the Confederacy in 1861, Travis County was one of a few counties in state to vote against the secession ordinance (704 to 450). However, Unionist sentiment waned once the war began. By April 1862 about 600 Austin and Travis County men had joined some twelve volunteer companies serving the Confederacy. Austinites followed with particular concern news of the successive Union thrusts toward Texas, but the town was never directly threatened. Like other communities, Austin experienced severe shortages of goods, spiraling inflation, and the decimation of its fighting men. The end of the Civil War brought Union occupation troops to the city and a period of explosive growth of the African-American population, which increased by 57 percent during the 1860s. During the late 1860s and early 1870s the city's newly emancipated blacks established the residential communities of Masontown, Wheatville, Pleasant Hill, and Clarksville. By 1870, Austin's 1,615 black residents comprised some 36 percent of the town's 4,428 inhabitants. Emergence of a political and educational center The university's Old Main Building in 1903 The Reconstruction boom of the 1870s brought dramatic changes to Austin. In the downtown area, the wooden wagon yards and saloons of the 1850s and 1860s began to be replaced by the more solid masonry structures still standing today. On December 25, 1871, a new era opened with the coming of the Houston and Texas Central Railway, Austin's first railroad connection. By becoming the westernmost railroad terminus in Texas and the only railroad town for scores of miles in most directions, Austin was transformed into a trading center for a vast area. Construction boomed and the population more than doubled in five years to 10,363. The many foreign-born newcomers gave Austin's citizenry a more heterogeneous character. By 1875 there were 757 inhabitants from Germany, 297 from Mexico, 215 from Ireland, and 138 from Sweden. For the first time a Mexican-American community took root in Austin, in a neighborhood near the mouth of Shoal Creek. Accompanying these dramatic changes were civic improvements, among them gas street lamps in 1874, the first streetcar line in 1875, and the first elevated bridge across the Colorado River about 1876. Although a second railroad, the International and Great Northern, reached Austin in 1876, the town's fortunes turned downward after 1875 as new railroads traversed Austin's trading region and diverted much of its trade to other towns. From 1875 to 1880 the city's population increased by only 650 inhabitants to 11,013. Austin's expectations of rivaling other Texas cities for economic leadership faded. However, Austin solidified its position as a political center during the 1870s, after the city prevailed in the 1872 statewide election to settle the state capital question once and for all. Three years later Texas took the first steps toward constructing a new Texas State Capitol that culminated in 1888 in the dedication of a magnificent granite building towering over the town. After a fire destroyed its predecessor in 1881, a nationwide design contest was held to determine who would build the current Capitol building. Architect Elijah E. Myers, who built the Capitols of Michigan and Colorado, won with a Renaissance Revival style. However, construction was held up for two years over a debate as to whether the exterior should be built from granite or limestone. It was eventually decided that it would be built of \\"sunset red\\" granite from Marble Falls. Funded by the famous XIT Ranch, the building remains part of the Austin skyline. The state capitol is smaller than the United States Capitol in total gross square footage, but is actually taller than its Washington, D.C., counterpart. Another statewide election in 1881 set the stage for Austin to become an educational and cultural hub as well, when it was chosen as the site for a new state university in a hotly contested election. A state constitution adopted in 1876 mandated that Texas establish a \\"university of the first class\\" to be located by vote of the people and styled the University of Texas. On September 6, 1881, Austin was chosen for the site of the main university and Galveston for the location of the medical department. In 1882 construction began on the Austin campus with the placement of the cornerstone of the Main Building. The university held classes for the first time in 1883. Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute, the forerunner of Huston-Tillotson University, founded by the American Missionary Association to provide educational opportunities for African-Americans, opened its doors in East Austin by 1881. The Austin Independent School District was established the same year. Before either UT or Huston-Tillotson opened their doors, however, St. Edward's Academy (the forerunner of today's St. Edward's University) was established by the Rev. Edward Sorin in 1878 on farmland in present-day south Austin. In 1885, the president, the Rev. P. J. Franciscus strengthened the prestige of the academy by securing a charter, changing its name to St. Edward's College, assembling a faculty, and increasing enrollment. Subsequently, St. Edward's began to grow, and the first school newspaper, the organization of baseball and football teams, and approval to erect an administration building all followed. Well-known architect Nicholas J. Clayton of Galveston was commissioned to design the college's Main Building, four stories tall and constructed with local white limestone in the Gothic Revival, that was finished in 1888. Of note during this period were serial murders committed in 1884 and 1885 by an unidentified perpetrator known as the \\"Servant Girl Annihilator\\". According to some sources there were eight murders, seven women and one man, attributed to the serial killer, in addition to eight serious injuries. These occurred in a town that had only about 23,000 citizens total. The murders made national headlines, but only three years later London was plagued by Jack the Ripper overshadowing Austin's tragedy in the history books. 20th century Learning to live with the Colorado River Austin's fortunes have been tied with the Colorado River for much of its history, no more so than in the 1890s. At the urging of local civic leader Alexander P. Wooldridge, the citizens of Austin voted overwhelmingly to put themselves deeply in debt to build a dam along the river to attract manufacturing. The hope was that cheap hydroelectricity would lure industrialists who would line the riverbanks with cotton mills. Austin would become \\"the Lowell of the South,\\" and the sleepy center of government and education would be transformed into a bustling industrial city. The town had reached its limits as a seat of politics and education, Wooldridge contended, yet its economy could not sustain its present size. Empowered by a new city charter in 1891 that more than tripled Austin's corporate area from 4 ¬Ω to 16 ¬Ω square miles, the city fathers implemented a plan to build a municipal water and electric system, construct a dam for power, and lease most of the hydroelectric power to manufacturers. By 1893 the sixty-foot-high Austin Dam was completed just northwest of town. In 1895 dam-generated electricity began powering the four-year-old electric streetcar line and the city's new water and light systems. The dammed river formed a lake that became known as \\"Lake McDonald,\\" for John McDonald, the mayor who had whipped up support for the project‚Äîattracted new residents and developers, while the waters of the lake itself drew those seeking respite from the Texas heat. Austin boomed in the mid-1890s, driven largely by land speculation. Monroe Shipe established Hyde Park, a classic streetcar suburb north of downtown, and smaller developments sprang up around the city. Thirty-one new 165-foot-high moonlight towers illuminated Austin at night. Civic pride ran strong during those years, which also saw the city blessed with the talents of sculptor Elisabet Ney and writer O. Henry. By today's standards, the dam was unremarkable ‚Äì a wall of granite and limestone, 65 feet high and 1,100 feet long, with no catwalk or floodgates. But Scientific American magazine was sufficiently impressed to feature the dam on its cover. However, structurally the dam was likely doomed from the start, as it was constructed on the spot where the Balcones Fault passes under the river. Silt had filled nearly half the lake by February 1900, and the dam's design failed to accommodate the force that could be created by a large volume of water. However, the flow of the Colorado proved to be far more variable than the project's promoters had claimed, and the dam was never able to produce the kind of steady power needed to drive a bank of mills. The manufacturers never came, periodic power shortfalls disrupted city services, Lake McDonald silted up, and, on April 7, 1900, the Austin Dam was dealt its final blow after a spring storm. At 11:20 am, floodwaters crested at 11 feet atop the dam before it disintegrated, with two 250-foot sections ‚Äì almost half the dam ‚Äì breaking away. In all, the flood drowned 18 people and destroyed 100 houses in Austin, at a total estimated loss of $1.4 million, in 1900 dollars. After 1900, the people of Austin did what they could to recover from the disaster. Having gotten a taste of city-owned electric power, they refused to go back; they bought out the local private power company, which used steam- driven generators, and today's Austin Energy municipal utility is in a sense a legacy of the old Austin Dam. The city also tried to rebuild the dam itself, but a dispute with the contractor left the repairs unfinished in 1912, and another flood in 1915 damaged it further. The wrecked dam sat derelict, \\"a tombstone on the river,\\" until the Lower Colorado River Authority stepped in and, with federal money, rebuilt it as Tom Miller Dam, completed in 1940. The remaining portions of the 1893 and 1912 dams were incorporated into the new structure, but are now hidden under new layers of concrete. By the time it was finished, however, Tom Miller Dam was already overshadowed by the much larger LCRA dams built upstream that formed the Texas Highland Lakes. For the last seventy years, Lake Travis (Mansfield Dam) and Lake Buchanan (Buchanan Dam), have provided water, hydroelectric power, and flood control for Central Texas. Between 1880 and 1920 Austin's population grew threefold to 34,876, but the city slipped from fourth largest in the state to tenth largest. The state's surging industrial development, propelled by the booming oil business, passed Austin by. The capital city began boosting itself as a residential city, but the heavy municipal indebtedness incurred in building the dam resulted in the neglect of city services. On December 20, 1886, the Driskill Hotel opened at 6th and Brazos, giving Austin its first premier hotel. The hotel would close and reopen many times in subsequent years. In 1905 Austin had few sanitary sewers, virtually no public parks or playgrounds, and only one paved street. Three years later Austin voters overturned the alderman form of government, by which the city had been governed since 1839, and replaced it with commission government. Wooldridge headed the reform group voted into office in 1909 and served a decade as mayor, during which the city made steady if modest progress toward improving residential life. The Littefield and Scarborough buildings at 6th and Congress downtown also opened that year, representing the city's first skyscrapers. In 1910, the city opened the concrete Congress Avenue Bridge across the Colorado River and, by the next year, had extended the streetcar line to South Austin along South Congress Avenue. The fostered development south of the river for the first time, allowing for development of Travis Heights in 1913. In 1918 the city acquired Barton Springs, a spring-fed pool that became the symbol of the residential city. Upon Wooldridge's retirement in 1919 the flaws of commission government, hidden by his leadership, became apparent as city services again deteriorated. At the urging of the Chamber of Commerce, Austinites voted in 1924 to adopt council-manager government, which went into effect in 1926 and remains in effect today. Progressive ideas like city planning and beautification became official city policy. A 1928 city plan, the first since 1839, called upon Austin to develop its strengths as a residential, cultural, and educational center. A $4,250,000 bond issue, Austin's largest to date, provided funds for streets, sewers, parks, the city hospital, the first permanent public library building, and the first municipal airport, which opened in 1930. A recreation department was established, and within a decade it offered Austinites a profusion of recreational programs, parks, and pools. Race and the 1928 City Plan Map of Austin 1920 By the early years of the 20th century, African-Americans occupied settlements in various parts of the city of Austin. By and large, these residential communities had churches at their core. Some had black-run businesses and schools for African-American youth. Though surrounded by Anglo neighborhoods, these island enclaves functioned as fairly autonomous residential neighborhoods often organized around family ties, common religious practices, and connection to pre-emancipation slave-status relationships with common slave holders/land owners. Though some date back to slavery, by the 1920s these communities were located across the city and include Kincheonville (1865), Wheatville (1867), Clarksville (1871), Masonville, St. Johns, Pleasant Hill, and other settlements. While residences of blacks had been widely scattered all across the city in 1880, by 1930 they were heavily concentrated in East Austin, a process encouraged by the 1928 City Plan, which recommended that East Austin be designated a \\"Negro district.\\" City officials implemented the plan successfully, and most blacks who had been living in the western half of the city were \\"relocated\\" back to the former plantation lands, on the other side of East Avenue (now Interstate 35). Municipal services like schools, sewers, and parks were made available to blacks in East Austin only. At mid- century Austin was still segregated in most respects‚Äîhousing, restaurants, hotels, parks, hospitals, schools, public transportation‚Äîbut African Americans had long fostered their own institutions, which included by the late 1940s some 150 small businesses, more than thirty churches, and two colleges, Tillotson College and Samuel Huston College. Between 1880 and 1940 the number of black residents grew from 3,587 to 14,861, but their proportion of the overall population declined from 33% to 17%. Austin's Hispanic residents, who in 1900 numbered about 335 and composed just 1.5% of the population, rose to 11% by 1940, when they numbered 9,693. By the 1940s most Mexican-Americans lived in the rapidly expanding East Austin barrio south of East Eleventh Street, where increasing numbers owned homes. Hispanic-owned business were dominated by a thriving food industry. Though Mexican Americans encountered widespread discrimination‚Äîin employment, housing, education, city services, and other areas‚Äîit was by no means practiced as rigidly as it was toward African-Americans. Between the 1950s and 1980s ethnic relations in Austin were transformed. First came a sustained attack on segregation. Local black leaders and political-action groups waged campaigns to desegregate city schools and services. In 1956 the University of Texas became the first major university in the South to admit blacks as undergraduates. In the early 1960s students staged demonstrations against segregated lunch counters, restaurants, and movie theaters. Gradually the barriers receded, a process accelerated when the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations. Nevertheless, discrimination persisted in areas like employment and housing. Shut out of the town's political leadership since the 1880s, when two blacks had served on the city council, African-Americans regained a foothold by winning a school-board seat in 1968 and a city-council seat in 1971. This political breakthrough was matched by Hispanics, whose numbers had reached 39,399 by 1970, or 16 percent of the population. Mexican- Americans won their first seats on the Austin school board in 1972 and the city council in 1975. Growth during the Great Depression During the early and mid-1930s, Austin experienced the harsh effects of the Great Depression. Nevertheless, the town fared comparatively well, sustained by its twin foundations of government and education and by the political skills of Mayor Tom Miller, who took office in 1933, and United States Congressman Lyndon Baines Johnson, who won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937. Its population grew at a faster pace during the 1930s than in any other decade during the 20th century, increasing 66 percent from 53,120 to 87,930. By 1936 the Public Works Administration had provided Austin with more funding for municipal construction projects than any other Texas city during the same period. UT nearly doubled its enrollment during the decade and undertook a massive construction program. In addition, the Robert Mueller Municipal Airport opened its doors for commercial air traffic in 1930. Over three decades after the original Austin Dam collapsed, Governor Miriam A. \\"Ma\\" Ferguson signed the bill that created the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA). Modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority, the LCRA is a nonprofit public utility involved in managing the resources along the Highland Lakes and Colorado River. The old Austin Dam, partially rebuilt under Mayor Wooldridge but never finished due to damage from flooding in 1915, was finally completed in 1940 and renamed Tom Miller Dam. Lake Austin stretched twenty-one miles behind it. Just upriver the much larger Mansfield Dam was completed in 1941 to impound Lake Travis. The two dams, in conjunction with other dams in the Lower Colorado River Authority system, brought great benefits to Austin: cheap hydroelectric power, the end of flooding that in 1935 and on earlier occasions had ravaged the town, and a plentiful supply of water without which the city's later growth would have been unlikely. In 1942 Austin gained the economic benefit of Del Valle Army Air Base, later Bergstrom Air Force Base, which remained in operation until 1993. Post-War growth and its consequences From 1940 to 1990 Austin's population grew at an average rate of 40 percent per decade, from 87,930 to 472,020. By 2000 the population was 656,562. The city's corporate area, which between 1891 and 1940 had about doubled to 30.85 square miles, grew more than sevenfold to 225.40 square miles by 1990. During the 1950s and 1960s much of Austin's growth reflected the rapid expansion of its traditional strengths‚Äîeducation and government. During the 1960s alone the number of students attending the University of Texas at Austin doubled, reaching 39,000 by 1970. Government employees in Travis County tripled between 1950 and 1970 to 47,300. University of Texas buildings multiplied, with the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library opening in 1971. A complex of state office buildings was constructed north of the Capitol. Propelling Austin's growth by the 1970s was its emergence as a center for high technology. This development, fostered by the Chamber of Commerce since the 1950s as a way to expand the city's narrow economic base and fueled by proliferating research programs at the University of Texas, accelerated when IBM located in Austin in 1967, followed by Texas Instruments in 1969 and Motorola in 1974. Two major research consortia of high-technology companies followed during the 1980s, Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation and Sematech. By the early 1990s, the Austin‚ÄìRound Rock‚ÄìSan Marcos Metropolitan Statistical Area had about 400 high-technology manufacturers. While high-technology industries located on Austin's periphery, its central area sprouted multi-storied office buildings and hotels during the 1970s and 1980s, venues for the burgeoning music industry, and, in 1992, a new convention center. On August 1, 1966, UT student and former Marine Charles Whitman killed both his wife and his mother before ascending the UT Tower and opening fire with a high-powered sniper rifle and several other firearms. Whitman killed or fatally wounded 14 more people over the next 90 minutes before being shot dead by police. 1970 to 1989 During the 1970s and 1980s, the city experienced a tremendous boom in development that temporarily halted with the Savings and Loan crisis in the late 1980s. The growth led to an ongoing series of fierce political battles that pitted preservationists against developers. In particular the preservation of Barton Springs, and by extension the Edwards Aquifer, became an issue that defined the themes of the larger battles. Austin's rapid growth generated strong resistance by the 1970s. Angered by proliferating apartment complexes and traffic flow, neighborhood groups mobilized to protect the integrity of their residential areas. By 1983 there were more than 150 such groups. Environmentalists organized a powerful movement to protect streams, lakes, watersheds, and wooded hills from environmental degradation, resulting in the passage of a series of environmental-protection ordinances during the 1970s and 1980s. A program was inaugurated in 1971 to beautify the shores of Town Lake (now named Lady Bird Lake), a downtown lake impounded in 1960 behind Longhorn Crossing Dam. Historic preservationists fought the destruction of Austin's architectural heritage by rescuing and restoring historic buildings. City election campaigns during the 1970s and 1980s frequently featured struggles over the management of growth, with neighborhood groups and environmentalists on one side and business and development interests on the other. As Austin became known as a location for creative individuals, corporate retail branches also moved into town and displaced many \\"home-grown\\" businesses. To many longtime Austinites, this loss of landmark retail establishments left a void in the city's culture. In the 1970s, Austin became a refuge for a group of country and western musicians and songwriters seeking to escape the music industry's corporate domination of Nashville. The best- known artist in this group was Willie Nelson, who became an icon for what became the city's \\"alternate music industry\\"; another was Stevie Ray Vaughan. In 1975, Austin City Limits premiered on PBS, showcasing Austin's burgeoning music scene to the country. The Armadillo World Headquarters in 1976 The Armadillo World Headquarters gained a national reputation during the 1970s as a venue for these anti-establishment musicians as well as mainstream acts. In the following years, Austin gained a reputation as a place where struggling musicians could launch their careers in informal live venues in front of receptive audiences. This ultimately led to the city's official motto, \\"The Live Music Capital of the World\\". 1990 to present Downtown high-rises viewed from the west In the 1990s, the boom resumed with the influx and growth of a large technology industry. Initially, the technology industry was centered around larger, established companies such as IBM, but in the late 1990s, Austin gained the additional reputation of being a center of the dot- com boom and subsequent dot-com bust. Austin is also known for game development, filmmaking, and popular music. On May 23, 1999, Austin-Bergstrom International Airport served its first passengers, replacing Robert Mueller Municipal Airport.Austin airport has 2nd record year, Austin American- Statesman, January 25, 2007. In 2000, Austin became the center of an intense media focus as the headquarters of presidential candidate and Texas Governor George W. Bush. The headquarters of his main opponent, Al Gore, were in Nashville, thus re-creating the old country music rivalry between the two cities. Also in the 2000 election, Austinites narrowly rejected a light rail proposal put forward by Capital Metro. In 2004, however, they approved a commuter rail service from Leander to downtown along existing rail lines. Capital MetroRail service finally began service in 2010.Capital Metro: Capital MetroRail In 2004, the Frost Bank Tower opened in the downtown business district along Congress Avenue. At , it was the tallest building in Austin by a wide margin, and was also the first high rise to be built after September 11, 2001. Several other high-rise downtown projects, most residential or mixed-use, were underway in the downtown area at the time, dramatically changing the appearance of downtown Austin, and placing a new emphasis on downtown living and development. In 2006, the first sections of Austin's first toll road network opened. The toll roads were extolled as a solution to underfunded highway projects, but also decried by opposition groups who felt the tolls amounted in some cases to a double tax. In March 2018, a series of four explosions centered in Austin, killed two civilians and injuring another five. Presently, Austin continues to rise in popularity and experience rapid growth. Young people in particular have flooded the city, drawn in part by its relatively strong economy, its reputation of liberal politics and alternative culture in Middle America, and its relatively low housing costs compared to the coastal regions of the country. The sudden growth has brought up several issues for the city, including urban sprawl, as well as balancing the need for new infrastructure with environmental protection. Most recently, the city has pushed for smart growth, mostly in downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods, spurring the development of new condominiums in the area and altering the city's skyline. While Smart Growth has been successful in revitalizing downtown and the surrounding central city neighborhoods housing development has not kept pace with demand driven by rapid and sustained employment growth which has resulted in higher housing costs.

These lead to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations, and formerly in complement with the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry examinations. Millennia Institute is now the only centralised institute in Singapore, established in 2004 through the merger of Outram and Jurong Institutes. Other former centralised institutes included Seletar Institute and Townsville Institute.  History  Establishment The centralised institutes education pathway was first introduced in Singapore in the late 1980s with an education reform involving the pre-university education system. The establishment of centralised institutes as specialised centres for Commerce pre-university streams was in line with the creation of commerce and technical streams at junior colleges. Technical streams are reformed as diplomas in polytechnics.  Establishment of Outram Institute  Outram Institute Chinese: Ê¨ßÂçóÈ´òÁ∫ß‰∏≠Â≠¶) was one of four original centralised institutes in Singapore, and one of the two that was merged to establish the current only centralised institute, Millennia Institute. Outram Institute was the first centre in Singapore specialising in commercial studies. Students in Outram Institute take the A Levels in three years, unlike other pre-university course students in Junior Colleges. In the 1980s, three-year pre-university courses were conducted in several secondary schools. In 1987 the Ministry of Education set up the first institute, Outram Institute, to offer three-year pre-university courses on a centralised basis. Outram Institute prepared students for the GCE 'A' Level Examinations. Initially, it concentrated on commerce subjects and had only the commerce stream. The arts stream was later introduced to the school. Outram Institute functioned on a full-day basis and teaching modes included lectures and classroom instruction. Admission is based on the aggregate point of first language and four relevant subjects. Mrs Lim Han Soon, Principal of Outram Secondary School, was appointed the first principal of Outram Institute. The institute was temporarily accommodated in premises at Bartley Road which were vacated by Chung Hwa High School when that school moved to new premises in December 1987. The Bartley Road premises were then renovated to provide the necessary facilities. In 1989, Outram Institute was the first pre-university centre in Singapore to offer the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry examination, on top of the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examination. The first batch of students achieved an 80 percent pass rate.  Establishment of Jurong Institute  Jurong Institute () was formed in 1989 as Singapore's third centralised institute. The inaugural campus was located at Jurong West Street 91. In 1994 it relocated to 2 Toh Tuck Terrace.  Establishment of Seletar Institute  Seletar Institute () was established in January 1988 as Singapore's second centralised institute. It began operations with 17 staff and 186 students in January 1989, at the former campus of Upper Thomson Secondary School at 14.5 km off Upper Thomson Road. In 1990 the campus was expanded, with a new two-storey block at the back of the original facility, consisting of 10 classrooms at Level 1 and two lecture theatres at Level 2. The pioneer batch students (10 classes or what was known as \\"Civics Tutorial Group\\") moved to the new block while the two junior batches remained at the old block. Its library, third lecture theatre and four additional classrooms were built in 1991, its fourth lecture theatre, gymnasium, weight room, fitness stations, art studio and students' locker room in 1992, and its conference room, printing room, counselling room, resource rooms and staff lounges in 1993. Air-conditioners were installed throughout. It underwent repainting, renovation and upgrades in 1994, with a new volleyball court and walkway to Block B from the canteen and Internet introduced in 1995. In 1996, a computer corner was created for the benefit of students without internet access or computer.  Establishment of Townsville Institute  Townsville Institute () was the fourth centralised institute established in Singapore to offer a three-year curriculum leading to the Singapore Cambridge General Certificate of Education Advanced Level examination. It was located at Margaret Drive in Queenstown. The former site of Townsville institute now houses the National Institute of Education Townsville campus.  Closure of Townsville and Seletar Institute  With a fall in demand in three-year pre-university courses in favour of two-year junior college courses, Seletar Institute witnessed a rapidly falling enrolment, to 130 students in 1995. In November 1995, the Ministry of Education announced the closure of Seletar Institute and Townsville Institute owing to the rapidly falling enrolment, from 3560 students in 1993 to 2328 students in 1995. Both institutes ceased the intake of first-year students in 1996, and ceased operation in 1998 with the graduation of its final batch of students.  Merger and establishment of Millennia Institute  On 26 July 2003, decision was made public by the Ministry of Education on the merger of Outram Institute and Jurong Institute to conglomerate the sparsely organised three-year pre-university institutions into a single entity. This move was to allow consolidation of expertise and teaching resources of the two institutes, and provide students with more customised programmes and facilities, thereby enhancing the delivery of the three-year pre-university education programme. As a result, Millennia Institute was established on 3 January 2004. A new campus was announced on 2 December 2003 to be ready in 2007. Millennia institute functioned in two campuses of the former Jurong Institute and Outram Institute, before relocating to its permanent campus at 60 Bukit Batok West Avenue 8.

A microdistillery is a small, often boutique-style distillery established to produce beverage grade spirit alcohol in relatively small quantities, usually done in single batches (as opposed to larger distillers' continuous distilling process). While the term is most commonly used in the United States, micro-distilleries have been established in Europe for many years, either as small cognac distilleries supplying the larger cognac houses, or as distilleries of single malt whisky originally produced for the blended Scotch whisky market, but whose products are now sold as niche single malt brands. The more recent development of micro-distilleries can now also be seen in locations as diverse as London, Switzerland and South Africa. Throughout much of the world, small distilleries operate throughout communities of various sizes, mostly without being given a special description. Due to the extended period of Prohibition in the United States, however, most small distillers were forced out of business, leaving only the corporate-dominated megadistilleries to resume operation when Prohibition was repealed to produce small batch brands. Most microdistilleries in South Africa ceased to exist when legislation was introduced in 1964 that made it almost impossible for small, private distilleries to operate viably. The legislation was relaxed again in 2003 and although most distilling expertise was lost, it was recovered by a new generation of microdistillers and has grown since. A recent trend in this segment of the distilling industry is for megadistillers to create their own micro-distillery within their current operation. The Makers Mark distillery owned by Suntory and the Buffalo Trace distillery owned by The Sazerac Company (which also owns the A. Smith Bowman microdistillery) are now producing specialty bourbon brands with small stills. Movement The modern microdistilling movement grew out of the beer microbrewing trend, which originated in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and quickly spread throughout the United States in the following decades. While still in its infancy, the popularity of microdistilling and microdistilled spirits is expanding consistently, with many microbreweries and small wineries establishing distilleries within the scope of their brewing or winemaking operations. Other microdistilleries are farm-based. Anchor Brewing Company, Ballast Point Brewing Company, and Dogfish Head are examples of American craft breweries that have begun expanding into microdistillation. Leopold Bros. is an example of a microdistiller that began as a microbrewery, and now operates as a distillery alone. Some of the newer microdistilleries produce only spirits. Plain and seasonally-flavored vodkas are popular products. As with the emergence of microbrewing, California and Oregon have experienced the highest number of microdistillery openings. Significant recent growth has also occurred in the Midwest. Microdistilleries for gin and vodka have also now started to re-emerge in London, England, after being restricted and effectively banned for over a hundred years due to UK government restrictions on still sizes, which have now been partially relaxed. There are now five licensed distilleries in London: Beefeater, and Thames Distillers, and four microdistilleries: the City of London Distillery, The London Distillery Company, Sacred Microdistillery and Sipsmith. At the same time, European micro-distilleries have been a key element in the absinthe renaissance in several countries, including Switzerland. South Africa has experienced a relative big growth in microdistilleries and produces mainly pot distilled brandies, fruit brandies, fruit based eau de vie (locally called mampoer), husk based spirits (like Italian Grappa) and a wide range of liqueurs and flavoured vodkas. Distillique is one of the few training academies worldwide which provides craft and microdistiller training courses on a regular monthly basis for microdistillers. South African microdistillers include the Jorgensen's Distillery, Dalla Cia Distillery, Nyati JJJ Distillery, Schoemanati Distillery, Tanagra Distillery and Wilderer Distillery. In the 1990s the liquor industry established the notion of super premium spirits offering a higher-quality (and usually more elaborately packaged) product at a higher price. The higher prices created an opportunity for small distilleries to profitably produce niche brands of exotic spirits. The early 21st Century saw the creation of hundreds of such distilleries producing products that were designed and marketed in a way that resembled celebrated restaurants more than alcoholic spirits marketing. The growth of craft distillieries and breweries were partly driven by a consumer interest in greater variety, perceived quality and support for locally owned businesses. According to the American Distilling Institute, there were 50 microdistilleries operating in the United States in 2005, but by 2012 this number had increased to 250. Numerous competitions and publications were formed to support the burgeoning sub- culture of spirits. By 2019, there were over 2,000 microdistilleries in the United States, and the marketshare of craft spirits was steadily growing. It is no longer the case that microdistilleries are producing at the premium end of the market only; the established brands are under threat from local microdistilleries at all price points (with the possible exception of the ultra discount supermarket brands such as Sainsbury's and Tesco's \\"value\\" brands, which are close to loss leaders). The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the microdistillery industry, as bars and pubs closed, and the economy shrank. This marked a sharp downturn in the previously steady growth of microdistilleries in the United States, in a phenomenon compared to the impact of Prohibition. Innovation Microdistillers often experiment with new techniques to produce new flavors. Tony Conigliaro uses a rotavap (i.e. glassware not copper pot) on a small scale to produce distilled spirits which change from day to day in his bar, and Ian Hart uses vacuum equipment to conduct distillation at much reduced temperatures, resulting in less cooked aromatics. A Double Diamond pot still used by Downslope Distilling of Centennial, Colorado. U.S. regulation The U.S. Government regulates distilleries to a high degree and currently does not distinguish its treatment of distilleries in terms of size. This stringent regulation has prevented microdistilling from developing as rapidly as microbrewing which enjoys relatively more relaxed government control. A number of states, such as California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin have passed legislation reducing the stringent regulations for small distilleries that were a holdover from prohibition. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) are responsible for enforcing Federal statutes as they apply to all manufacturers of beverage alcohol. South African regulations In South Africa, microdistilleries are legally defined as distilleries with an annual capacity of less than 2 million litres of spirits. These microdistilleries are regulated through provincial laws rather than the national liquor laws (as prescribed in the Liquor act of South Africa, Act 59 of 2003). Craft distillery  The American Craft Spirits Association defines a \\"craft distillery\\" as a distillery that produces fewer than 750,000 gallons per year; is independently owned and operated (with a greater than 75% equity stake, plus operational control), and is transparent regarding its ingredients, its distilling and bottling location; its distilling and bottling process, and its aging process.

It was built in 1276. Gaocheng Astronomical Observatory, also known as the Dengfeng Observatory, is a World Heritage Site in Duke of Zhou's shrine, Gaocheng Town, near Dengfeng in Henan province, China. This site has a long tradition of astronomical observations, from the time of the Western Zhou up to the early Yuan dynasty. There is also a gnomon used for the Da Yan calendar in 729 AD and the great observatory of the Yuan Dynasty. History Western Zhou It is believed that the Duke of Zhou (c. 1042 BC) had erected at this place a Ceyingtai (observatory measuring the shade or gnomon) to observe the Sun. His interest in mathematics, astronomy/astrology is reported in the Zhoubi Suanjing. Tang Dynasty The astronomer Yi Xing (683‚Äì727) of the Tang Dynasty built 20 standardized gnomons spread out over China to measure the equation of time dependent on the geographical location. Following a proposition of Liu Zhuo from 604 AD, 10 of these were aligned along the meridian 114¬∞ east of Greenwich from Central Asia down to Vietnam in order to determine the circumference of the Earth and deviations from a perfect sphere. One of these 10 observatories was situated at Gaocheng. The observations were used to establish the Da Yan calendar. South of the observatory, in the temple dedicated to Zhou Gong can be found a Shigui chart made by Yi Xing. According to the Zhou Li (Rites of Zhou) this place is the center of the Earth. Yuan Dynasty The great observatory was built in 1276 in the early Yuan dynasty on the order of Kublai Khan and was used by Guo Shoujing (1231‚Äìc.1215) and Wang Xun (1235‚Äì1281) to observe the movement of the sun, the stars and record time. It was built of stones and bricks. It has two parts: the body and shigui (also called the ruler to measure the sky). It is 9.46 meters high by itself, and 12.62 meters high if the 2 cabinets on the top are included. The somewhat unconventional gnomon is a bar mounted horizontally between the 2 cabinets. The shigui extending to the far north is 31.19 meters long and 0.53 meters wide. It is made up of 36 square stones with two parallel waterways on it to check its levelness. The location of shigui is in accordance with the direction we take today to measure the meridian. During measurement, a beam is put across the grooves. Jingfu (an instrument with many holes) on the waterways is used to measure the shade, whose precision is within 2 millimeters. At winter solstice, the length of the shadow at noon is nearly as long as the shigui. The very precise observations served for the new Shoushi calendar (Season-Granting Calendar) of 1281, which was in use for 364 years. The length of the tropical year was determined to 365 d 5 h 49 m 20 s, a value in accord with the value of the Gregorian Calendar, but obtained 300 years earlier. In 1787, Laplace applied these measurements to check his calculations on the secular changes of the obliquity of the ecliptic and the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. It is the first in a series of 27 observatories built in the early Yuan dynasty.  Heritage status  As part of the \\"Dengfeng Historic Monuments of Dengfeng 'in the Center of Heaven and Earth'\\" the observatory has been listed as UNESCO World heritage in 2010.

Gu Jiegang (8 May 189325 December 1980) was a Chinese historian best known for his seven- volume work Gushi Bian (, or Debates on Ancient History). He was a co-founder and the leading force of the Doubting Antiquity School, and was highly influential in the 20th century development of Chinese history. Biography Gu Jiegang was born two years before China's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. The country during his early years was wrought with turmoil. During high school, Gu briefly joined a revolutionary group during the 1911 Revolution. However, he soon realized that he had \\"no personal aptitude for politics, and no ability in promoting great social movements\\". He developed an interest in history while being a student at Peking University, and resolved to use a new historical narrative to calm his country's social and political turmoil. He evacuated to Chongqing in the Second Sino-Japanese War and started studying the ethnic minorities in China, Muslims in particular. When the Cultural Revolution started in 1966, Gu was labeled a Reactionary Scholarly Authority. He had to wear a dunce cap and was subjected to struggle sessions. He had to labor at the History Department every day until he was freed in the early 1970s. Historiography Gu has been viewed as something of an enigma by many scholars. His work has been characterized as scientific and anti-tradition, while at the same time showing pride in Chinese culture and believing that the Chinese identity would withstand modernization. The German scholar Ursula Richter characterized this discrepancy by labeling Gu \\"the traditional and yet modern scholar who was true to tradition also in that he 'obeyed yet resisted'\\".Hon (1996), pp. 315-316. According to Laurence Schneider, the \\"most persistent theme\\" in Gu's writings is \\"the central role of the intellectual in Chinese history, and the centrality of history to the Chinese intellectual\\". He attributed China's failure to modernize to opportunistic intellectuals who allied with the aristocracy, rather than pursuing truth. In order to restore China to greatness, Gu, along with his mentor Hu Shih, advocated a non- political role for Chinese intellectuals, against the emerging trend of Marxist histories.Schneider (1969), pp. 771-772 The modern Chinese nation must rethink its history in order to survive. To this end, Gu used textual criticism to challenge traditional Chinese historiography. One example is the myth of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, a supposed golden age in China's antiquity that had scarcely been doubted up to the early twentieth century. Gu questioned the historicity of this myth not only to rectify errors in understanding, but also to destroy the entire philosophy of history that revolved around looking back to this supposed golden age.Schneider (1969), p. 772 Gu debunked the spurious past, says Schneider, to redefine ‚Äúthe idea of ‚ÄòChinese‚Äô through a process of reordering the relation of past and present‚Äù. Yet he believed China‚Äôs true past yielded ‚Äúsources of radical inspiration both for destroying the old traditions and for creating and authorizing new ones.‚Äù Gu also sought to provide the basis for a new national history with his theory of Chinese diversity, as opposed to continuity and homogeneity, the main assumptions of nationalistSinocentrism. Gu took special delight in suggesting that there was barbarian blood under the skin of Sage King Yu of the Xia dynasty, whose existence he doubted in any case. Gu, observes Schneider, thought that ‚Äúif a periodically failing Chinese civilization was revived by infusions of barbarian blood or culture, then how could it be said that the subsequent product was Chinese? How could it be said that it was a continuous, coherent tradition?‚Äù Gu thus wanted to destroy at its root ‚Äúthe idea that from time immemorial there was a transcendent unchanging Chinese essence.‚Äù For Gu, Chinese history was not merely the history of Confucianism; the content of the Chinese identity was ‚Äúalways in a state of change‚Äù.

The pedestrian area stretches from 11th Street to 15th Street along Pearl Street and is home to a number of businesses and restaurants as well as the Boulder County Courthouse. About The Pearl Street Mall is a popular destination for tourists visiting Boulder and for students attending the nearby University of Colorado Boulder. The mall hosts a blend of locally-owned businesses and national chain stores and restaurants. It is also home to much of Boulder's nightlife. During the summer months, Pearl Street Mall is the stage for a number of street performers, including musicians. The Pearl Street Mall is filled with public art, including numerous fountains and sculptures as well as a sandbox for children, a stylized map of Boulder County and a number of small gardens which are planted with a variety of flowers and trees, most notably tulips in the spring. The Mall is at the heart of downtown Boulder, in the western part of present-day Boulder. The area is an historic district and many of the buildings are among the oldest in Boulder. The Boulder County Courthouse is located in the 1300 block on the north side of the mall. Although the courthouse no longer houses the actual courts for Boulder County, it remains the seat of county government. History As a Planning Board member, Carl A. Worthington began working on the project in 1966 in an attempt to revitalize Boulder's downtown. In 1973 he prepared a master plan which was approved by an 86% majority. The Pearl Street Mall was constructed between June 1976 and August 1977 and was officially dedicated on August 6, 1977. The design team consisted of three firms: CommArts, Inc. (Boulder), Everett Ziegel Associates (Boulder), and Watertown, Massachusetts-based Sasaki Associates. Scenes from the movie Catch and Release, which was set in Boulder, were filmed on the Pearl Street Mall in July 2005. In the TV series Mork & Mindy, the New York Deli operated by Remo and Jean DaVinci was located at 1117 Pearl Street. The actual deli of the same name and location closed in 1999.

He is from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India and is a genetics professor at the University of Madras who holds a PhD in parapsychology. He is attempting to find the truth behind the sudden death of his father, Chandra Suresh (portrayed by Erick Avari), and to continue his father's research finding the 'superhuman' beings on Earth. In character, Suresh also provides many episodes with opening and/or closing dialogue, generally philosophical musings regarding the events that take place during the episode. The role of Mohinder was originally written to be a 55-year-old geneticist looking for super powered humans. However, Sendhil Ramamurthy's audition was so convincing that the main character part was rewritten to be a younger geneticist following in his father's footsteps. The concept of the older geneticist was spun off into the minor, yet central, character of Chandra Suresh.  Character history   Genesis  After hearing news of his father's death in New York, Mohinder suspects that his father was murdered to silence the findings of his genetics research. He goes to his father's local apartment to look for clues and to finish his research. However, before Mohinder can thoroughly analyze his father's findings, he realizes Mr. Bennet is still in the apartment when the intruder's phone rings. As the mysterious stranger talks to the caller about Mohinder's father and the research, Mohinder narrowly escapes. Mohinder travels to Brooklyn, where he rents his father's other apartment. Although it is in disarray, much of the material is still there and Mohinder begins to reorganize it. To makes ends meet during his lengthy stay, Mohinder takes a job as a taxi driver and picks up a passenger named Peter Petrelli, who asks him about \\"being special.\\" Although Mohinder is slow to realize what Peter means, he eventually talks to him about genetics and evolution. Afterward, Mohinder gets another fare, Mr. Bennet. Bennet acts ordinary enough at first, talking about himself, and heading home after business. However, he begins to ask Mohinder personal questions, referencing such personal details as his teaching position in India. Being spooked (likely fearing he is about to be murdered in the same manner as his father), Mohinder abandons the cab and runs away. In the second episode, Mohinder discovers that his father had compiled a program to find the \\"special people.\\" Mohinder finds a man in his father's apartment. The man claims he is an exterminator, but Mohinder quickly realizes that the man was planting an eavesdropping device. The man pulls a gun, but after a struggle that leads out into the apartment hallway, a girl picks up the gun (\\"If you're the exterminator, why do you have a gun holster?\\"), prompting the man to quickly leave. The girl introduces herself as a friend of Mohinder's father and enthusiastic about his theories on genetics; her name is Eden McCain. Mohinder and Eden discover a portable hard drive in his father's pet's cage. The hard drive appears to have all the genetic research that his father had done on tracking those with special abilities. Mohinder also learns that his father seems to have had a falling out with a man named Sylar. Chandra thought Sylar was \\"Patient Zero\\", according to Eden, but on a recorded telephone message, Chandra seems to want nothing to do with the strange man. Mohinder, jumping at every noise, fears for his life and keeps a pistol cocked and ready. Fortunately, no bad people are breaking in; it's only Eden. She brings him macaroni and cheese, and they discuss his father's work. Mohinder recalls that his father never answered a question directly, but answered with another question. Frustrated, he throws his father's laptop. However, by throwing it, he accidentally reveals a small book hidden in a compartment. As they thumb through the leather notebook, they discover a list of names, apparently of people all across the globe that possess \\"abilities.\\" The name \\"Sylar\\" pops up and scrawled there is his New York address. They also find a key in the book. They make their way to his apartment. They knock, but there's no answer. Mohinder produces the key that they found, but it doesn't fit. Therefore, he pulls out a screwdriver and picks the lock. They enter a very neat kitchen, with a teacup resting on the table. Mohinder takes pictures. As they go further into the apartment, they find that the walls are covered with bookshelves packed with books‚Äîall impeccably ordered. Eden notices an anatomy book laying open to a page where the face is dissected. Mohinder bumps a closet door, and what he finds is astonishing: a room lit by a string of light bulbs and a map identical to his father's, but with more pins stuck in and yarn links. However, going further in, he finds a more astounding sight. Painted up in red letters are the words \\"Forgive Me.\\" In smaller letters, all over the rough cement wall are written, \\"I have sinned\\", over and over. When they return to the apartment with the police, however, the apartment has been cleaned out, with no evidence to support Mohinder's claims. Mohinder tracks down Nathan Petrelli to question him about whether he might be one of the \\"special people\\" his father was researching. Nathan, who is busy running in a congressional election, does not listen to Mohinder, but tells Peter about him. Peter then makes the connection to Mohinder and his father's book and visits Mohinder's apartment. Because Peter can not demonstrate any powers without another \\"special person\\" being there for him to mimic, they set out to visit Isaac, who Peter says can paint the future. Unfortunately, Isaac is strung out on heroin and refuses to open the door. On the subway ride back, time suddenly freezes for everyone but Peter, who meets a future version of Hiro. When time unfreezes in \\"Hiros\\", Peter tells Mohinder about the encounter, but Mohinder is now convinced that Peter is crazy. Mohinder makes a decision: he will return to Madras with his father's ashes. Peter tries to convince him otherwise but to no avail. After returning to his apartment in \\"Better Halves\\", Mohinder picks up and prepares to leave. Eden wants him to stay, flirting with and even kissing him before he goes. Though Mohinder feels certain of his choice, Eden says she's sure he'll be back. In \\"Seven Minutes to Midnight\\", Mohinder returns to India to scatter his father's ashes. He debates whether to return to his job as a college professor. His former girlfriend Mira invites him to interview for a job at a company doing genetics research where she has just been made a department head. However, she says he must not mention his father's research into the evolution of super powers or consider continuing it. Mohinder talks with his mother about her decision to let his father go to the United States to look for people with superhuman abilities. She tells him for the first time about his sister, Shanti, who died when she was five and Mohinder was two, which is also mentioned in The Hard Part, in which he tells Molly that he was born a few months too late to save his sister. Shanti was \\"special\\", according to her mother, and their father loved her so much that he was afraid Mohinder would find his love for his son wanting in comparison. Mohinder also has a series of prophetic dreams, depicting a young Indian boy who guides him to various scenes showing his parents arguing and showing his father's murder. Mohinder later finds a file with a photo of the boy, named Sanjog Iyer, in his father's office. In the episode \\"Homecoming\\", Mohinder locates Sanjog playing soccer, and questions him about his visions. The young boy tells Mohinder that troubled people seek him out in their dreams, not the other way around. Sanjog also tells Mohinder that he already has the answers he seeks. Mohinder then decides to continue his father's research and accesses his father's computer files, using the password \\"Shanti\\". The files contain the names of all of the people with super powers that Chandra Suresh had located. Mohinder tells his mother that he plans to return to New York, and that he wants to seek out people with special powers to tell them of their abilities. Upon returning to New York, Mohinder began preparations to warn the people on Chandra Suresh's list of Sylar, as a number of those on the list had already been killed by the telekinetic serial killer. Shortly after, he received a phone call from Eden. Without going into details, she explained to him that she wasn't who he thought she was. She said that she was going to explain further after she \\"made things right\\" by killing Sylar, who she knew killed Chandra Suresh. Eden then hung up on Mohinder. Two weeks later in \\"Godsend\\", Mohinder learns of Eden's suicide. An officer comes by to talk with Eden's former neighbors. He asks Mohinder if he knew a woman named Sarah Ellis, to which he replies that she was on the list, he had tried unsuccessfully to locate her in LA, and had never met her before. The officer then shows him a picture of Sarah Ellis and Mohinder tells him that he knew her by a different name: Eden McCain. The officer then tells him that she was found in Lake Ramsey, having suffered a single gunshot wound to the head. Later, Mr. Bennet appears at the apartment. When Mohinder confronts him about Eden and her death, he tells Mohinder that Eden was a good person. Bennet wants Mohinder's help in finding people with abilities and \\"making a difference.\\" When Mohinder refuses, Bennet asks if Mohinder is on the list, a question he sidesteps with no answer. Mohinder says he isn't interested in helping Bennet, but Bennet leaves his card anyway. Nathan Petrelli approaches Mohinder in \\"The Fix.\\" Mohinder quickly apologizes for coming off as \\"a raving lunatic\\" when they first met. Nathan has come to Mohinder in an attempt to help his brother, Peter Petrelli. They begin talking, and Nathan explains that Peter is afraid of causing an explosion. Mohinder, in turn, explains Peter's unique, \\"sponge\\"-like superpowers to Nathan. Mohinder also states that he may be able to help with Peter's condition if he is able to test Peter. However, Nathan is reluctant to let Mohinder come into contact with Peter, fearing that Mohinder will \\"feed into [Peter's] paranoia.\\" Still, Mohinder insists, and they leave to find Peter. When they find Peter at his apartment, he \\"has no time to be [Mohinder's] guinea pig.\\" Instead, Peter briefly pretends to agree with the two before Claude appears and helps Peter escape. Recently, Mohinder has called many of those found on his father's list. To his discouragement, no one believed him until he received a return call from Zane Taylor. He went to meet with Zane and get a DNA sample, but, unknown to him, encountered Sylar at Zane's residence. Sylar, posing as Zane, teamed up with Mohinder, claiming that he could help with Mohinder's work. Mohinder, who has known for some time that Sylar was posing as Zane, drugs him when they return to Mohinder's apartment. He straps Sylar to a chair and hooks him up to an I.V., filled with curare, a liquid that prevents Sylar from using his powers. Mohinder almost shoots Sylar, but Sylar persuades him not to do it. Mohinder realizes that he needs Sylar alive for a few more minutes so he can continue his research. After he is done, Mohinder tries to shoot Sylar in the head, but Sylar stops the bullet in mid-air using telekinesis. He breaks free and tells Mohinder that he had stopped the I.V. long ago, and that Mohinder did not notice because he was so involved in his research. At the end of the episode \\"Parasite\\", Peter finds a bloodied Mohinder pinned to the ceiling. Mohinder is just barely able to reveal that Sylar is standing behind Peter before Peter is attacked. As Peter and Sylar fight, Mohinder is released from the ceiling. He manages to ram the map into Sylar, knocking him out and taking out the body of Peter but not before taking the List as well. He later takes the body to the Petrelli's mansion. Later on, Thompson arrives at Mohinder's apartment to convince him to work with Primatech, offering him vast resources to do research but Mohinder is more concerned with stopping Sylar. Thompson says they both have the same interests and asks him to join forces. At first, Mohinder declines the offer, insisting that anything that happens should be under his ground, because he had the List. Then Thompson tells him of Molly Walker and her sickness and power. Mohinder goes immediately to see her. Mohinder learns that she can stop Sylar by tracking him, but needs to cure her sickness of nerve deterioration. Mohinder discovers that his sister, Shanti, had the same illness and died of it, and that his father had found a cure for it without telling anyone. Mohinder researches and discovers that by giving Molly his own functioning antibodies, it will restore her humoral immune response. Later, Noah Bennet and Matt Parkman come into the building. Molly tells Mohinder that Matt is there. Through the surveillance camera, they see Mr. Bennet and Parkman approaching the room. Bennet wants to kill Molly to protect Claire but Mohinder will not let him and holds a gun to Bennet, who is holding a gun to Molly. Matt Parkman ceases the potential gunfire and Mohinder escapes the building with Molly, Micah Sanders, Niki Sanders, and D.L. Hawkins.  Generations  Four months after the incident in New York, Mohinder has been giving speeches about superhumans and a fatal virus that affects only these special beings. At one of his speeches in Cairo, Egypt, he is approached by a mysterious man named Bob (who can turn objects into gold), who offers him a job at The Company. Mohinder accepts the offer; he and Noah Bennet are planning to take down The Company from the inside, and his speeches had just been bait. In Lizards, Mohinder is assigned to find the Haitian by the Company. He travels to Port-au-Prince in Haiti where he finds the Haitian and cures him of the Shanti virus. Mohinder later tells the Haitian to meet with Noah Bennet, to join the crusade to take down the Company. After his trip to Haiti, Mohinder returns to his apartments, where he and Matt Parkman have become adoptive fathers to Molly Walker. Mohinder informs Parkman that he will be working in New York for a while trying to take down the Company. Parkman doesn't agree with Mohinder's plans. Mohinder is then taken to Isaac Mendez loft, where the Company has transformed the loft into a laboratory for Mohinder. Mohinder searches through the loft and finds the eighth painting in Isaac Mendez series of 8, that foretells the apparent death of Noah Bennet. In \\"The Kindness of Strangers\\", Parkman finds a picture of the Original 12, one of which was his father. He asks Molly Walker to find him using her ability, but Molly is reluctant and afraid to find Parkman's father, because he is the nightmare man in Molly's dream. Mohinder doesn't support Matt, but Molly agrees with terrible results. Molly is able to find Parkmans father, Maury, but this leaves Molly in a dream induced coma. Mohinder, with apprehension from Noah Bennet, takes Molly to the Company for help, not knowing what else to do. While discussing Molly with Bob at the Company, Mohinder is issued a stun gun and new assignment. While addressing the details of the assignment, Niki Sanders enters the room and attacks Bob. Mohinder is able to stop her with the stun gun, which he initially did not want to use. Mohinder later is seen next to Niki, who has been strapped to a bed in the Company facility. Mohinder, once Bob leaves the room, attempts to free Niki, however, she doesn't want to leave, believing that the Company will help her. Mohinder makes his way to New Orleans and begins to do research on a new hero named Monica Dawson. Bob is initially impressed with Monica, as she has an ability that the Company has not seen before. Moral issues begin to arise with Mohinder as he is asked to inject a modified version of the Shanti virus to Monica, in the hopes that this modified version would strip Monica of her powers without killing her, as the normal Shanti Virus does. Mohinder doesn't want to use Monica as a lab rat, and tries to find comfort in calling Bennet, with no success. Mohinder's morality causes him not to inject the virus into Monica and go against Bob. Bob initially accepts Mohinder's stand on the issue and tells Mohinder he will be issued a partner to help keep everyone in line. The partner ends up being a more healthy-looking Niki. Bob reveals to Mohinder that they are experimenting with the virus in order to stop a man named Adam Monroe, who is killing original members of the Company. After Noah Bennet confronts Mohinder about the painting depicting him with a Company-issue gun and a broken nose, Mohinder explains that he hasn't been given one. His nose is also fine. When Maury Parkman attacks the Company and corrupts Niki Sanders, however, his nose is broken by her. After she injects herself with the modified virus, which Mohinder cannot cure, Bob suggests tracking down Claire Bennet, whose ability might be able to produce a viable cure. He is then given the gun seen in the photo by Bob. He betrays Noah to Bob, his priorities having changed with the introduction of the incurable virus. Another picture Bennet finds depicting the future reveals Bennet lying dead on the ground, with his daughter crying in the background. Mohinder distracted Bennet while Bob went to capture Claire and extract her blood (as a cure for the mutated Shanti virus). Bennet almost killed Mohinder when Elle ambushed them, but did not; however, Mohinder's trust in Bennet was broken completely, and he assumed that Bennet would go to any lengths to protect his daughter, no matter who would be harmed or killed. After kidnapping Bob's daughter, Elle, Bennet brokers a trade for his own captured daughter. However, as the two girls are switched, Elle breaks free and tries to kill Claire and her boyfriend, West. Bennet shoots Elle in the arm, then prepares to kill Bob. He says that Bob is the heart of the Company, and if Bob is dead, then the Company dies with him. As Bennet prepares to fire, Mohinder shoots him in the left eye - exactly as in the painting. In \\"Truth & Consequences\\", Mohinder revives Bennet using Claire's blood, explaining that such acts are what the Company does. He leaves Bennet locked in a holding cell. Using Claire's blood to reinforce the antibodies in his blood, he then derives a cure for the new strain of the virus and prepares to leave for New Orleans to deliver it to Niki Sanders. However, while making his way to the airport, Sylar calls and tells him that he has Molly Walker. In \\"Powerless\\" he returns to his loft in Brooklyn to find Sylar and Maya Herrera with a sleeping Molly Walker. Sylar forces Mohinder to help heal his strain of virus that is preventing him from using his powers. Mohinder takes Sylar and the others to Isaac Mendez's loft. After Maya is shot by Sylar, Mohinder proves to Sylar that he can cure the virus by bringing Maya back from the dead using the blood he took from Claire. However, as Mohinder is about to inject Sylar with a transfusion of blood, Elle Bishop intercedes. Elle shocks Sylar in the back, but he manages to escape, taking the last transfusion of blood with him. Mohinder thanks Elle for saving them, saying that Sylar \\"would have slaughtered us all had you not been here.\\"  Villains  In the third season, Mohinder is able to isolate the source of powers (located in the adrenal glands) from Maya and injects himself with a formula he creates based on that. The formula imbues him with increased strength, agility, balance, athletic ability, and heightened senses. However, because the formula is incomplete, as revealed in \\"I Am Become Death\\", his body begins to mutate, developing bug-like attributes which begin with lesions on his back and shoulders. His fingers also begin to secrete a sticky, web-like substance. These mutations were, according to writers/producers Joe Pokaski and Aron Coliete, inspired by The Fly, a film in which a scientist's DNA is spliced with that of a fly, resulting in his eventual transformation into a giant fly. Mohinder finds that he is unable to develop a cure for either his condition or Maya's power, though he lies about it to Maya. Unable to control his aggression, he breaks up a fight with a neighboring couple and brutally beats the man's head against the wall. When the man comes looking for payback later on, Mohinder overpowers him and pulls him into the lab, encasing him in a cocoon made from the substance his fingers secrete. He does the same to several others, going so far as to kidnap a drug dealer from a park and drag his body back to his loft. When Maya discovers this and calls him a monster, he cocoons her as well. When Mohinder learns that Nathan Petrelli and Tracy Strauss were artificially given abilities, he detains them in an effort to cure himself. While the couple is unconscious, he has an encounter with Daphne Millbrook, who invites him to join Pinehearst. She leaves abruptly after discovering all the victims hidden in the back of his lab. Once Tracy comes to her senses, she manages to free herself and Nathan. Mohinder decides against fighting them, instead grabbing Maya and fleeing to Pinehearst. Arthur removes her ability at his request, but her faith in him is already shattered. He admits to having genuine feelings for Maya. In order to cure himself, Mohinder begins working with the formula stolen by Daphne. Peter's description of Mohinder's future self only strengthens his resolve to perfect the formula. He also discovers that many of the abilities he has documented first manifested during the solar eclipse nearly a year ago, although he initially believes this to be a mere coincidence until the next solar eclipse removes his powers. Upon returning him to normal, Mohinder's tries to visit Maya, but the eclipse ends before he can speak with her, so he doesn't go through with it. His research hits a wall when it is revealed that the formula needs a special catalyst (which can't be artificially produced) to grant abilities without inducing violent mutation. Arthur obtains this catalyst and finishes the formula before his death. Mohinder tests it on a soldier named Scott, who is granted super-strength. In \\"Dual\\", Mohinder tries to take the formula to stop his progressing mutations. He is thwarted by a combination of Daphne stealing the vial in his hand and Peter, Flint, and Knox destroying his lab at Pinehearst. In the process, however, they knock over a large vat of the formula, which Mohinder is exposed to, causing the lesions from the first flawed formula to disappear. The highly-flammable formula is then ignited by Flint, blowing up the lab. Mohinder survives, apparently suffering only minor injuries, and is picked up on the road by Tracy Strauss. Fugitives In \\"A Clear and Present Danger\\" Mohinder is ambushed by Nathan's agents. While trying to escape capture, Mohinder is seemingly rescued by Noah Bennet. After Noah asks him a series of questions, Noah's true alliance is revealed when he surrenders Mohinder to Nathan's agents. Later, Mohinder is drugged and put on a plane with other people with abilities. He is awakened by Claire and holds on to Peter after he accidentally freezes a hole into the plane. In \\"Trust and Blood\\", after the plane crashes, he and Matt save Hiro from being recaptured by soldiers. The three of them run and stop at a trailer when Matt starts drawing pictures of the future. While Matt is drawing, Mohinder suggests to Hiro that he surrender himself and tells Nathan and his men that he is now powerless so that he can live a normal life. Mohinder and Hiro run after Matt, after he realizes that Daphne is in danger and heads back to the crash site. When Daphne is killed and Claire uses herself as a shield after being discovered by Nathan's soldiers, Mohinder, Hiro, Matt, and Ando escape and meet up with Peter. As is seen in the end of \\"Building 26\\" and continued in \\"Cold Wars\\", Mohinder, along with Peter and Matt, drug and kidnap Noah. It is then revealed, though Matt reading Noah's memories, that Noah warned Mohinder about the government program. Mohinder claims that he didn't believe Noah. A fight with Matt ensues. In order to allow Matt time to verify Noah's claim that Daphne is still alive, Mohinder goes out to fight the approaching government agents. He is then captured and Nathan tells him that if he doesn't help him find a \\"cure\\" for abilities, he'd let Daphne die. Later, in \\"Cold Snap\\" Tracy escapes with the help of 'Rebel' and \\"rescues\\" Mohinder, Matt, and Daphne. Mohinder and Matt take Daphne to the hospital for treatment. He is there to comfort Matt when Daphne passes away. In \\"Turn and Face the Strange\\", after Daphne's death, Mohinder tries to convince Matt not to take revenge on Danko, but ultimately fails. Mohinder then returns to his apartment to collect some of his possessions, but learns that everything has been confiscated by Danko and his men except some papers that belonged to his father. From these papers Mohinder learns about \\"Coyote Sands\\" and eventually goes there to learn what his father did there. In \\"1961\\" he is at \\"Coyote Sands\\" where he knocks down Noah during the sandstorm and takes him to a cabin fearing that HLS was on his tail; Noah then informs him about the fate of the relocation center. After searching through the debris, he learns that his father worked on evolved humans, including some of the founding members of the Company, there from Angela Petrelli. When Angela goes missing, he helps in the search for her. Later, Peter and Mohinder find Angela and protect her from her sister, Alice; she mistakes Mohinder with his father and sends a bolt of lightning at him. After Alice flees, Peter hands him a film labeled as Project Icarus, involving both Chandra Suresh and Zimmerman, which he expects will help Mohinder find the truth about his father. When everyone is about to leave, Mohinder tells Peter that he can't come because he still hasn't forgiven himself and stays alone in \\"Coyote Sands\\". At the end of \\"I Am Sylar\\" he is seen analyzing the film frame by frame, to later being cornered by Danko's agents; Mohinder is tranquilized and abducted by them. In \\"An Invisible Thread\\", Mohinder is rescued from Building 26 along with the rest of the evolved humans by Hiro and Ando and at their insistence examines Hiro to determine why his powers are causing him headaches and nosebleeds. Mohinder determines that Hiro's body is rejecting his powers and he can't risk stopping time anymore. After Hiro does to save Noah and passes out, Mohinder takes care of him and plans to take him to the hospital. Later, Mohinder witnesses the burning of what is supposed to be Sylar's body. Redemption Other than a few brief mentions by other characters (including Peter revealing he replicated Mohinder's power in order to be stronger so he could save more lives), Mohinder was absent until the episode \\"Once Upon a Time in Texas\\", where it was revealed that he was presumably killed during an event Samuel was involved in, eight weeks prior. Samuel enlists the help of Hiro to undo what he refers to as a mistake. In \\"Brother's Keeper\\", Mohinder is shown to be living with Mira in Madras and working as a professor, but his father's files and films about Project Icarus lure him once more into his research, driving Mira away. Mohinder builds a compass and follows it to the \\"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\\", where he meets Joseph, and discusses with him about Samuel's power, unknowing he was eavesdropping them. After understanding the danger Samuel would become, he decides to burn the film and return to India, but Samuel finds him and tries to make him speak, finally killing him in his motel room. Hiro fixes Samuel's mistake by saving the film, but also saves Mohinder's life, thus changing the timeline. Hiro then teleports Mohinder away and hides him under a false name in a mental hospital in Florida in order to keep him out of sight for eight weeks since Mohinder refused to disappear. As of now, Samuel still believes that Mohinder is dead. In \\"Close to You\\", a brain-addled Hiro and Ando launch a rescue mission for him. Ando switches his daily pills with aspirin (accidentally swallowing Mohinder's pills at the same time) and it allows him to break free of his straitjacket and cell easily with his powers. Mohinder is happy, confused and angry to see Hiro, as Hiro trapped him there in the first place, but joins him in wheeling the drugged Ando out of the hospital. The group gets cornered by orderlies, but a recovering Ando blasts open a door, creating enough of a distraction for Mohinder to overpower the orderlies and allow them to escape. Outside, the group is chased through a swamp by dogs and orderlies and Mohinder, knowing they'll never outrun them, wants Hiro to teleport them away. Hiro, in his addled state isn't able to and Mohinder suggests Ando use his power like electro-shock therapy in an attempt to restore Hiro's mind. Ando, though reluctant, tries and it works, restoring Hiro who immediately teleports them to safety, getting them away just before the orderlies and dogs find their hiding place. Hiro teleports them to Noah Bennet's apartment, interrupting Noah and Lauren Gilmore kissing and Hiro asks for Noah and Lauren to help the three. In \\"Pass/Fail\\", Mohinder helps Noah building a new compass to lead him to Samuel, stating only an evolved human can activate it, suggesting Noah to use Ando. He then leaves to India. In the graphic novel \\"Second Chances\\", Mohinder has returned to India back to Mira, but he found a messy apartment, understanding she is in trouble. He then asks the help of Molly, who found Mira being held hostage by a man interested in Mohinder's research. Mohinder rushes into the rescue, taking everyone down with his enhanced strength, and saving Mira. They then kiss. Heroes Reborn After gathering thousands of people for the Odessa Peace Summit on June 13, 2014, the Summit is bombed and Mohinder is branded a terrorist. In \\"June 13 - Part 1\\", Mohinder meets Angela Petrelli shortly before the Summit and it is revealed that he has been working in the Arctic and has uncovered proof of a coming extinction-level event, something they refer to as the Healing. Angela has had visions of it as well and informs Mohinder that Erica Kravid, who is funding Mohinder's research, is planning to only save those she cares about and has destroyed his research and killed his team. While Mohinder plans to reveal the truth at the Summit, Angela warns him that Erica will preempt his efforts and kill him. Mohinder refuses to believe Angela due to her past actions, but grows worried after he can't reach his team. To this end, he leaves a copy of his research with Molly Walker in case something happens to him. As Angela warned him, Erica does stop his speech and has Harris tranquilize and take him to the stadium garage to kill him. Harris blocks Mohinder's powers with a drug similar to the Building 26 drug, but Mohinder is rescued by a future Hiro Nakamura. Spotting three more Harris' with bomb vests, Mohinder chases one while Hiro takes on two. Mohinder catches up to Harris, but the cloud of darkness released by Phoebe Frady drains his power and Harris is able to break free. He then reveals he is near a load- bearing wall and he and his other clones will use the bombs to destroy the Summit and kill everyone there. Mohinder is horrified as Harris informs him that he will change the world, just not as he expected. A short time later, Harris' bombing destroys the Summit, leaving Mohinder's fate unclear. In \\"June 13 - Part 2\\", the real Mohinder is revealed to have apparently died in the bombing while Erica Kravid uses a shapeshifter to record a video by \\"Mohinder\\" stating that he did the bombing for evo supremacy. Erica also blames the murders of Mohinder's team on Mohinder himself. Molly later has Nathan teleport her to India so she can tell Mohinder's mother the truth about his death. In \\"Send in the Clones\\", Micah broadcasts a video to the world showing a shapeshifter being coached by Erica in making the video, exposing Erica's lies and clearing Mohinder's name.  Powers and abilities  Mohinder hits Emile Danko with the cab's door (\\"A Clear and Present Danger\\"). In the first two seasons, Mohinder is an ordinary human with no abilities. However, after he injects himself with a faulty formula derived from Maya's adrenaline, Mohinder gains Spider-Man-like powers. These include heightened senses, enhanced strength, wallcrawling, and the ability to jump extremely high. As a side effect of using an incorrect formula, he becomes increasingly aggressive and erratic in behavior, begins to biologically generate a substance that is similar to a spider's web, and develops scales on his skin. The infection eventually spreads throughout his body. After being exposed to the perfected formula, the side effects disappear, leaving him with only the increased strength, agility and reflexes. In \\"A Clear and Present Danger\\", with his increased strength Mohinder was shown to be strong enough to rip the door off a car. When Peter replicated his power to help him as a paramedic, he demonstrated that Mohinder's other abilities come with enhanced agility and reflexes as well (\\"Orientation\\"). In addition, Mohinder was born with unique antibodies that can counteract the Shanti Virus, curing the disease it causes to evolved humans, returning their abilities as well (\\"The Hard Part\\"). More evolved strains of this virus require the addition of Claire's regenerative blood to enhance the effect of Mohinder's antibodies (\\"Out of Time\\").  Alternate timelines * In the alternate future of \\"Five Years Gone\\", in which New York City is destroyed by a nuclear explosion, Mohinder is working as Chief Medical Advisor to Nathan Petrelli, who has been elected President of the United States and is actually Sylar impersonating Petrelli. The world has grown fearful of those with special abilities due to \\"Nathan\\" blaming the explosion on Sylar to protect his brother Peter, who was the true cause of the bomb. As President, Sylar devises a plan to gradually and systematically eliminate them. He has been using Mohinder's knowledge of their genetic makeup to create a serum which he declares will reverse these genetic anomalies, but in all actuality destroys them (a development which Mohinder staunchly opposes). Though \\"Nathan\\" orders Mohinder to kill present-Hiro, Mohinder instead assists Hiro and frees him from the Haitian (who, with Parkman, had captured Hiro) by stabbing the Haitian with the syringe containing the toxic serum, thus killing him. He then helps buy Hiro and Ando time to escape by holding the door of the room closed while Peter and Sylar fight it out in the corridor outside. * In the alternate future of \\"I Am Become Death\\", in which artificial superpowers are publicly available, present-day Peter visits Mohinder's lab in order to question him about Sylar (who has long since reassumed his identity of Gabriel Gray). Though Mohinder still occupies the lab, it is trashed and covered in spider webs. Mohinder has apparently mutated into something barely human and shows a strong aversion to light. He wears heavy clothing that obscures all but his hands and stays in the shadows so his face is not revealed. His hands are covered in sores/scales and his voice is distorted significantly. His stance and movement are also much less human. He tells Peter that when he injected himself with the power, he had the formula \\"terribly wrong\\". He refuses to tell Peter where Sylar is, but Peter reads his mind to find out. * In the original timeline of Redemption, Mohinder was murdered by Samuel Sullivan eight weeks before \\"Once Upon a Time in Texas\\" and \\"Brother's Keeper\\". He also burned a film from the Coyote Sands Relocation Center, which Samuel Sullivan desperately wanted. Hiro time traveled from the present and retrieved the film, switching it with a fake, but used a Kevlar vest to protect Mohinder from Samuel's attack, so he only seemed dead. He said that he knew as he accidentally time traveled ten minutes too far the first time and what he found \\"wasn't pretty.\\" Thanks to Hiro's actions, Samuel did believe that Mohinder was dead. Later, Hiro trapped Mohinder in a mental institution so that he won't go after Samuel. In the present time, Hiro and Ando eventually rescue him from there, though he isn't happy with what Hiro did to him.  Spiritual life  The Heroes graphic novel \\"Monsters\\" shows that throughout his life, Mohinder has identified both as Hindu like his mother and atheist like his father. When he heard that his father, Chandra Suresh, had died, he wondered if perhaps the goddess Kali had punished him for his lack of faith. During Chandra's ashes immersion at Kanyakumari, however, he was fluently chanting Sanskrit Upanishadic verses as prescribed by ritual. Prior to curing the Haitian, he says he has trouble believing in any God who would let the superhuman virus wreak havoc; however, it was unclear if he actually believed this view or not.

It is near Cathedral Cove, between the settlements of Cooks Beach and Hot Water Beach. It is approximately 11 km south east of Whitianga and 8 km north of Hot Water Beach. The driving route to Whitianga from Hahei is circuitous and takes approximately 30 minutes. A much more direct route is by road to Ferry Landing, which takes 15 minutes, and then a short passenger ferry trip to Whitianga. A ferry service to Whitianga has served the eastern Mercury Bay area since 1895. A prominent feature of the beach is Mahurangi Island (Goat Island), which lies on the edge of the Te Whanganui-A-Hei (Cathedral Cove) Marine Reserve. History The name of the settlement of Hahei is derived from the MƒÅori name for Mercury Bay, Te-Whanganui-A-Hei, or \\"The Great Bay of Hei\\". According to tradition, Hei was one of three brothers who arrived in New Zealand with Kupe. With his family he settled in the area of Oahei, which is now Hahei, and they became the ancestors of the Ngati Hei people. However, in 1818 the Ngati Hei people were attacked by the NgƒÅ Puhi tribe, and almost completely wiped out. The remnant of the Ngati Hei people fled, leaving the land vacant.Saltspray and Sawdust, by Janet Riddle, Gumtown Publishers, 1996. p. 46. The valley of Hahei was purchased in the 1870s by Robert Wigmore, who was the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages from 1876 to 1887. Robert Wigmore built the kauri homestead which is still standing today. The burial place of Robert Wigmore and his wife Fanny in Hahei is marked by a cairn in the Wigmore Historic Reserve, at the end of Hahei Beach Road by the beach.The Wigmores of Hahei, by Horace Harsant, Ohinemuri Regional History Journal 9, May 1968. p. 47. In 1915 the property was purchased by the brothers Horace and Walter Harsant. The farm primarily supported a dairy herd, but pigs, fruit and crayfish were also part of the produce sold at the nearby store of Coroglen.From Haveringland to Hahei: the Harsants of Hahei, by Walter Harsant, Hauraki Publishers, Thames, 1994. p. 19-22. Transport at that time was difficult. Heavy and large goods had to be transported by sea, and for an ordinary shopping trip the Harsants would ride on horseback to the river and \\"coo-ee\\" loudly for the boatman to ferry them across.They called me Te Maari, by Florence Harsant, Whitcoulls Publishers, 1979. p. 171. In the 1960s Vaughan Harsant lived in the homestead, and as Hahei began to gain popularity as a camping site, he developed the camping ground, and began to subdivide areas of the farm near the beach into residential sections. Tourism Hahei is a popular holiday destination, with a white sandy beach and sheltered aspect, resulting in safe sheltered swimming waters. Its resident population is around 300, but in peak holiday periods the population swells to more than 10 times this. On the southern end of the beach is Te Pare Historic Reserve, which was once the site of two MƒÅori pƒÅ, Hereheretaura PƒÅ and Hahei PƒÅ. Hahei is located close to the start of the Cathedral Cove walkway and in the peak has nearly 500,000 day trippers and visitors who come just to visit the Cove. This can lead to congestion and parking issues. The car park at the start of the walkway is closed from 1 Oct to 30 April and visitors are encouraged to park at the village entrance and use a park and ride shuttle bus. Off-peak 1 May to 30 Sept there is pay and display parking at the car park at the start of the walk. The town centre consists of a boutique brewery/pub, two caf√©s, a gift shop, a general store with a petrol station and a takeaways bar, a dive shop, a real estate agency and an ice cream and pizza parlour. Other holiday related businesses include kayaking, snorkelling and boat trips to Cathedral Cove and the Marine Reserve.

He joined the Sharecroppers' Union (SCU) in 1931, which was founded the same year. Biography Cobb was the fourth of more than twenty children of a father who had been enslaved. (The children had at least three mothers and some were illegitimate.) The father had been emotionally and physically scarred by his experiences, and responded to his emotional and financial frustrations by beating and berating his wives, children, and others he loved. Ned left his father's house to begin sharecropping on his own at the age of 19; he married and began a family about the same time. Realizing that the men needed help, he joined the Alabama Sharecroppers' Union in 1931 to fight for justice for black people and against exploitation. Cobb was a hard worker and was not going to let the white dominant race run his life; he continued to fight against unfair treatment of tenant farmers by starting a tenant farmers union. Cobb continued to climb the ladder of success from wage labor to sharecropper. He was finally able to own his own crops and land. He focused on growing cotton. In 1931 when the Communist Party arrived in Alabama, Cobb was profoundly impressed because he was aware that the party was defending the Scottsboro Boys, nine young black men accused of raping two white women. In December 1932, a sheriff tried to take the home and livestock of one of Cobb's friends. Cobb defended his friend and in turn was involved in a shootout in which he was wounded and arrested. Cobb was sentenced to thirteen years in jail. Cobb was offered parole if he would agree to give up his farm and relocate to Birmingham. Instead, he served his full sentence and after release in 1945 returned to his farm. The fluctuating cotton market before and after the Great Depression led to extremely hard times for southern sharecroppers and cotton farmers. Many were increasingly victimized by white landowners who sought to recoup their own monetary losses by seizing the property of their tenant farmers. Cobb gained great recognition and praise, for as a black man he was making a name for himself. He managed to maintain his farm even through the natural disasters such as the boll weevil epidemic and the collapse of cotton prices. Ned, by now a middle aged man and successful by the standards of the time (he was particularly proud of the fact he supplied his grown sons with mules and other means of making a living) saw many of his fellow sharecroppers dispossessed due to debt to landowners and then even saw others such as himself, who were not in debt, lose property on highly specious allegations. Cobb became one of the most successful sharecroppers (or black men in all occupations) in the rural Jim Crow-regulated county. Within a few years he owned his own mules, a truck, and a car (all of them paid for, he was very proud to note) and had electricity and plumbing in his house. All of those distinctions distanced him from most black men and many poor white farmers in his vicinity. Although uneducated and illiterate, he was innately intelligent, and avoided the sharecroppers' commonly hopeless cycle of debt and poverty by his abilities to innovate in agriculture and to avoid many of the mistakes of others. In 1969, Theodore Rosengarten came to Alabama to search for and interview surviving members of the Sharecroppers Union. When Rosengarten sat down to interview Cobb for this purpose, Cobb's memories began to pour out. The resulting book, All God's Dangers: The Life of Nate Shaw stands as a larger history of the life of a black tenant farmer raising cotton in Jim Crow Alabama. Legacy His autobiography was pseudonymously published in the book All God's Dangers: The Life of Nate Shaw, as told to Theodore Rosengarten.

Two years after opening, the collections were moved to Lancaster House in St James's, and the museum remained there until World War II. The first Keeper of the museum was Sir Guy Francis Laking, and from 1926 to 1944 the Keeper was the archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler. During World War II, much of the collection was evacuated for storage at nearby Dover Street tube station, and later at Piccadilly Circus tube station. Some of the galleries at Lancaster House reopened to the public in 1942, but in November 1943 the building was requisitioned by the Ministry of Works as a conference centre and base for the new European Advisory Commission, the museum retaining only the basement for storage of its collections.

Bartolomeo Ruspini (25 March/6 April 1728 ‚Äì 14 December 1813), also known as Bartholomew Ruspini, was an Italian-born British surgeon-dentist and philanthropist in the 18th century, remembered for founding the Royal Masonic School for Girls. Early history The chevalier Bartholomew Ruspini was born in 1728, in Zogno, near Bergamo, a place about 40 miles north-east of Milan. He was the son of Andreas Ruspini of Grumello, a minor member of a patrician family originated from Croglio, in the ancient Italian region of Como, now in the Canton Ticino (Switzerland). He was recognised as a surgeon on 18 June 1758 by the college of physical sciences in Bergamo. It seems possible that he completed his training at an earlier date and, having decided to specialise in dentistry, he then went to Paris, the accepted centre for training in this field. It should be remembered that dentistry was not perceived as a skilled profession, nor had it the status it has now. Dentistry was generally practised as a sideline by blacksmiths, hairdresser and frequently charlatans. Ruspini styled himself as a surgeon dentist to separate himself from the like of these. Move to England Although there is no certainty of his movements it seems possible that Ruspini moved on from his training in Paris to England, taking with him introductions from French and Italian noblemen. It is unclear exactly when he first came to England but an advertisement in the York Courant on 19 May 1752 identifies him as an Italian surgeon offering a remedy for scurvy of the mouth and gums. So confident was he of his technique that he made the first consultation free of charge and no payment was required until the patient had been cured. Quite when Ruspini came to England is further confused by the reference in the 1752 advertisement in which he claimed to have already cured several people in Manchester. Four years later there is a reference to a marriage to Elizabeth Stiles on 19 February 1757 Ruspini and the Masons In November 1759 he was put forward as a candidate for initiation into a Masonic lodge, the Bear lodge, but was rejected. On his second application for membership in 1762 he was accepted into the Burning Bush Lodge in Bristol. In 1766 he was also practising in London under the patronage of the mother of George III. That he was established in society is perhaps confirmed by his second marriage to Elizabeth Orde on 6 April 1767. Ruspini had recently renounced Roman Catholicism and become an Anglican. No mention is made of Ruspini's Italian ancestry in the marriage announcement whereas the Orde family and their connections with nobility and prominent citizens is expanded upon. In 1768 Ruspini became the author of a Treatise on Teeth. He wrote about many things that we now take for granted including the effect of too much sugar on the teeth, but he also wrote that sleeping with the head uncovered would result in dental disease. Also in 1768 Ruspini's first child was born. James Balden Ruspini who was soon followed by George Bartholomew Ruspini who both went on to become surgeon dentists. In all Ruspini had 9 children, four sons and five daughters. By 1777 Ruspini was established enough within society and within the Masonic movement to be a founder member of a Lodge, the Lodge of the Nine Muses. This gained many Italian members which would indicate that Ruspini was keen and able to help compatriots who had migrated from Italy. In April 1789, the \\"Honourable Order of Knighthood and Dignity of Count of the Sacred Palace of the Lateran\\" was conferred upon him by Francis, Duke of Sforza-Cesarini, bringing with it the title of Chevalier.P. J. DAWSON, La Loggia inglese delle Nove Muse, in \\"Rivista Massonica\\", 1973 Philanthropy Ruspini was anxious to ensure that the poorer people in London should not be disadvantaged and arranged that his tooth powder should be available free from a doctor's house in Fore Street. His willingness to help others who had suffered misfortune is noted further by his help to Mrs Cornelys, who was suffering financially and his desire to help the children of masons who had died or were unable to support their families. He did this by setting up the Royal Masonic School for Girls to provide education to the daughters of masons. He died at his home in Pall Mall, aged 85, and was buried in the churchyard of St. James's Church, Piccadilly on 19 December 1813. His grave was destroyed by enemy bombs during the Second World War. A memorial to him lies within the church. He did not leave a great fortune, even for his time. He left his wife an annuity of ¬£150 plus enough furniture for a bedroom and sitting room wherever she chose to live, as well as money for his sons. Today his statue stands at the Royal Masonic School where he is remembered and where his birthday, 25 March, is celebrated as \\"Ruspini Day\\".

Developed by the Main Aviation Institute (Warsaw), the only constructed GIL saw service until 1960 when it was irreparably damaged and subsequently decommissioned. The prototype aircraft currently resides at the Polish Aviation Museum. Design and development The helicopter was designed at the research institute G≈Ç√≥wny Instytut Lotnictwa - Main Aviation Institute in Warsaw, from an initiative of Zbigniew Brzoska. It was a difficult task, because Polish aviation industry was entirely destroyed during World War II. In addition, the institute principal W≈Çadys≈Çaw Fiszdon was the only person in a team, who had ever seen a helicopter (Sikorsky R-4 in England).Glass 2005, pp. 44‚Äì45. Despite severe material shortages, work on experimental design started in 1948, and the main designer became Bronis≈Çaw ≈ªurakowski (brother of test pilot Janusz ≈ªurakowski), who designed a rotor and control system. It used simpler Hiller rotor type, with two auxiliary blades. A fuselage structure, tail boom, auxiliary rotor and tricycle undercarriage were designed by Tadeusz Chyli≈Ñski. A power unit and final drive were designed by Zbigniew Brzoska. The design utilized some components left by the Germans, like a piston engine Hirth HM 504 (re-configured for vertical use), rear gear from a Z√ºndapp motorcycle and wheels from a DFS Kranich glider's jettisonable landing gear.≈ªurakowski 2005, pp.45‚Äì49. Initially, the helicopter had no name. It only received the registration letters SP-GIL, from the institute abbreviation, and hence it soon became known as GIL or Gil (gil means a bullfinch in Polish). Later it was also given the designation B≈ª-1, from ≈ªurakowski's initials. Operational history B≈ª-1 GIL The helicopter was completed by the end of 1949. During the first flight trial on 14 January 1950, it was overturned by a wind gust and had to be repaired. The test pilot was Bronis≈Çaw ≈ªurakowski, who taught himself to fly a helicopter. The helicopter first flew on 4 April 1950, restrained on tethers by two men (Fiszdon and Chyli≈Ñski) for a measure of safety. During 1950‚Äì1953, it underwent a test program and was often modified. At first it had elastic rotor blades. In 1950, it was fitted with rigid blades and an efficient simple custom-designed resonant vibration eliminator, similar to later Sikorsky designs.Witkowski 2005, pp. 49‚Äì51. During tests, it crashed or was damaged without casualties at least seven times, for different reasons, and was repaired each time. On 20 July 1952, the B≈ª-1 GIL was first displayed to the public, during an air show at Okƒôcie airfield (it was the first public presentation of a helicopter in Poland and one of first presentations in the Eastern Bloc). On 16 November 1953, the helicopter was damaged when the main rotor was bent by the wind and cut off the tail boom, thus ending the test program. By then, the prototype had completed 169 flights, in 20 hours 21 minutes in total. In 1956, the helicopter was repaired and used for training flights. On 28 June 1957 a tail rotor gear (originally from a motorcycle) broke and it could not be replaced, consequently, the helicopter never flew again, being written off on 28 October 1960. During 1956‚Äì1957 it had completed 185 flights, for a total of 12.5 hours. Currently, the sole B≈ª-1 GIL is preserved in the Polish Aviation Museum in Krak√≥w.backup: Specifications See also References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Glass, Andrzej. \\"≈ömig≈Çowiec B≈ª-1 GIL\\" .

She becomes the queen of the underworld through her abduction by Hades, the god of the underworld.Martin Nilsson (1967). Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion Vol I pp 462‚Äì463, 479‚Äì480 The myth of her abduction represents her dual function as the as chthonic (underworld) and vegetation goddess: a personification of vegetation, which shoots forth in Spring and withdraws into the earth after harvest. Proserpina is the Roman equivalent. In film and television *Walt Disney's 1934 Silly Symphony short The Goddess of Spring adapts the story of her abduction by Hades and how she returns to the earth for half a year. She is not called by her name. *In the 2009 film Wonder Woman, Persephone (voiced by Vicki Lewis) is the name of an Amazon from the island of Themyscira. After being charmed by Ares for a century while guarding him in his cell, she betrays her people by freeing him after killing another amazon. She briefly fights Princess Diana of the Amazons. Persephone is killed by Hippolyta for her treachery but tells Hippolyta that the Amazons were denied a life of families and children and that they are women too not just warriors. *In the 2013 film Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, Persephone (voiced by Candi Milo) is the name of an Amazon soldier in Wonder Woman's army. She is killed by Professor Zoom, when she attempts to kill Lois Lane. *The 2014 comic book series The Wicked + The Divine features Persephone as one of the gods who reincarnate every 90 years by taking over someone else's body. This modern interpretation of Persephone has powers that include summoning vines from the ground. *A character named Persephone appears in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, played by Monica Bellucci. She is the wife of the Merovingian, a powerful program that handles other programs exiled from the Matrix. In the Matrix Revolutions, they are seen together as being seated in a rave club named Club Hel, possibly a strong reference to Hel, the underworld of Norse Mythology, and Hell, the underworld in Christian Theology. *In the cult TV Show Firefly, Persephone is the name of one of the border planets where there is both high society and slums. The planet is the first one to be viewed in the series. *In the BBC Television series Spooks the title of Series 3 Episode 6 is \\"Persephone\\", referring to character Zoe Reynold's code name during an undercover operation.

He was born on 24 August 1935. de Joux was said to have been one of New Zealand's most talented automotive designers. He appeared regularly in motoring magazines such as Motorman and Sports Car World from the 1970s. Early cars De Joux's first car was a 1936 Austin Seven Ruby. He removed the body, designed and built a fibreglass body for it. Possibly New Zealand's first. Internationally de Joux is perhaps best known as the designer and manufacturer of a series of fibreglass bodies for Buckler sports cars. One of the first Buckler's to his design was Ivy Stephenson's. From there he created a Holden Special followed by a Ferrari Special. Jack Brabham commented that the Ferrari was the best non factory built car he had seen and offered him a job. De Joux declined. De Joux bought the Ferrari 375 that Jos√© Froil√°n Gonz√°lez drove and won the 1951 British Grand Prix at Silverstone from New Zealand racing driver Ron Roycroft. He converted it into a Gran Turismo that looked like a genuine factory built Ferrari road car. It was an exquisitely proportioned car used by de Joux daily for the next four and a half years until he sold it. The car was restored back to a single seater by a Christchurch classic car enthusiast and is now owned by Bernie Ecclestone. In 1962 de Joux and Auckland mechanic Kevin Lamb made two de Joux Gran Turismo cars. The GT's look like a cross between a Maserati A6G and an AC Bristol Zagato with 1950's and 1960s styling. Also around this time De Joux is thought to have designed the Orchid, a 1960s period racer, molded by The Australasian Motor Works. Among several sports racers de Joux built was a Ferrari-Jaguar combination - called the Ferraguar.Maximum Mini: The Definitive Book of Cars Based on the Original Mini, Jeroen Booij, Dorchester : Veloce, 2009, Mini GT de Joux 1970 Mini GT In New Zealand de Joux is best known for his Mini derivative, the de Joux Mini GT. In 1965 he began the design of his GT, a car he described as \\"a Mini in a Bermuda jacket\\". Due to other projects the prototype was not finished until 1971. The Mini GT was a fibreglass sports GT body bonded onto a Mini floorpan that had had extra box-sectioning added on top of both sills and across the back where the rear seat had previously been on the standard Mini. Whilst the standard Mini bulkhead was retained it was also braced to a new bulkhead off of which the doors were hung. This arrangement proved to be very stiff and did not require any stiffness to be added by the body. De Joux personally made the first six cars along with his team; after this his interest was on other things and he subsequently only sold bodies with plans for the chassis. The car was about nine inches lower than the standard Mini, two inches wider, and, thanks to the extended front radiator, three inches longer. Frontal area was reduced by 22%, giving better top end performance. Engines of course could be any A-series. The prototype was fitted with a 997cc Cooper engine, but the potential for a full-race spec 1380cc was enormous. The bonnet was fitted with a power bulge, which provided enough space for fitting twin carburettors. The original door windows were Perspex pull-up arrangement. The door locks from a Mini were mounted on an angle which caused some problems as the Mini locks were mounted vertical. Less than 30 bodies were made in total including a few illegitimate copies moulded from an existing car - these can normally be identified by not having the proper de Joux GT dashboard.http://www.minimarcos.org.uk/altpics/dejoux/index.html Issues with customers not building their cars properly were among the reasons that Ferris eventually decided to move away from the GT completely. Many owners took shortcuts when having their chassis made ‚Äì not understanding that they had been very carefully designed. Twenty-two of the original cars remained on the de Joux register in 2006, one of which was in Australia.Craig Watson, Mini Experience Magazine, Australia, 2006 Only a few Mini GTs are still on the road, including the original prototype, extensively restored by de Joux in the early 90s and subsequently sold to Japan. John Rush from New Zealand races his car, having had it from new. De Joux was 90% through finishing a new GT for his personal use when he died. That car is now in the possession of his long- time friend and driver Peter Benbrook who intends finishing and racing it to honour his friend. Later cars In 1985 de Joux bought the remains of a 1964 Formula One BRP chassis and damaged V8 BRM engine, and over the phone to England, a BRM transaxle. He obtained the missing parts on a journey to England. On completing the BRP he sold it to English collector Anthony Mayman. In 1999 de Joux made a one-off Maserati Special. Auckland Ferrari enthusiast Allan Cattle had a 3.5-litre, six-cylinder Maserati engine sitting under a bench in his workshop, after he found it in England beneath another car restorer's workshop bench and brought it home. Ferris saw the engine and decided to build a car in the style of a 1937-39 Maserati. The car was pieced together with assorted spare parts over a three years period and completed in 2002.Kiwi's home-built Maserati up for auction, Nick Churchouse, Stuff, Faifax NZ News, 5 December 2009 An intervening project involved an enthusiastic retired Whangarei farmer named Hamilton Walker who in 1969 appeared to be on the verge of producing an ambitious fibre-glass bodied twin-rotor two-door four-seater sedan. Because the car would contain 90% local content, it was argued that the car could be retailed in the (tariff protected) New Zealand market for approximately ¬£750 less than a BMC Mini imported fully assembled from England. De Joux was the designer of the car's body, working in collaboration with project engineer Dennis Smith. The project never made it to the production stage. During his later years de Joux made fibreglass kayaks and raced a Brabham powered by a SCAT 2.0l engine. He died on 30 May 2009 aged 73.

The film was Ozu's first after World War II. Synopsis Tashiro (Chish≈´ Ry≈´), Tamekichi (Reikichi Kawamura), and O-tane (Ch≈çko Iida) are among the residents of a poor district of Tokyo that has been severely damaged in the bombing raids of 1944-45. They live on the economic margins of a society devastated by years of war: Tashiro is a street fortune teller, Tamekichi mends pots and pans and also buys and sells whatever he can get hold of, and O-tane is a widow who sells what odds and ends she can obtain. Tashiro returns one evening to the house he shares with Tamekichi and brings with him a boy of about seven named K≈çhei (H≈çhi Aoki). K≈çhei's home is in Chigasaki, about forty miles away, but he has become separated from his father while in Tokyo and has followed Tashiro home from Kudan, where Tashiro has been telling fortunes in the grounds of the Yasukuni Shrine. Tashiro wants to give K≈çhei a bed for the night, but Tamekichi refuses, saying he ‚Äòhates brats‚Äô, and tells Tashiro to take the boy across the street to O-tane and get her to put him up. O-tane reluctantly does so. During the night, K≈çhei wets the futon he is sleeping on. O-tane tells Tamekichi that she has done her bit and he should now take responsibility for the boy. Tamekichi refuses and suggests that their neighbours, the Kawayoshis, might take him in. Kawayoshi (Takeshi Sakamoto), a dyer who has children of his own, says he can‚Äôt, and the three of them draw lots to decide who will take the boy back to Chigasaki. Tamekichi rigs the draw so that O-tane loses. O-tane takes the boy to Chigasaki, where she learns that K≈çhei and his father had been living in a rented room after their own house at Hachi≈çji was destroyed in the bombing. The landlady tells O-tane that the two had left for Tokyo a few days previously as K≈çhei's father, a carpenter, hoped to find work there. She does not expect him back and does not know how to contact him. O-tane and K≈çhei eat their lunch of rice balls on the sanddunes. O-tane tries to get rid of K≈çhei by sending him down to the shore to collect some seashells for her and then running off, but the boy runs after her. O-tane returns with the boy to Tashiro and Tamekichi's house and tells them that her journey was fruitless. Tamekichi reminds her that there is a meeting of the residents‚Äô association that evening at the Kawayoshis‚Äô house. She takes K≈çhei back to her house, tells him to go to bed early, and leaves for the meeting. At the meeting, the Kawayoshis provide a generous spread of food and drink bought with money that their son has won in the lottery. The company agree that children are lucky on the lottery because they are pure- minded, not scheming and grasping like adults. The next day, Kiku (Mitsuko Yoshikawa), an old friend of O-tane's who runs a geisha house, and is therefore prosperous, calls on O-tane. They discuss the current shortages of food and other essentials. K≈çhei comes in with a pocket full of cigarette ends and nails that he has picked up in the street to give to his father. O-tane and Kiku reflect on the contrast between their own carefree childhoods and the hardships facing children in the straitened postwar world. As she leaves, Kiku gives K≈çhei a ten-yen note. O-tane tells him to go and buy a lottery ticket ‚Äì he's ‚Äòmore or less pure-minded‚Äô so may be lucky. She then goes across the street to Tamekichi's house. While she is there, Tamekichi's daughter Yukiko turns up. She is a modern, Americanised young woman wearing trousers and a sweater, a headscarf, and dark glasses. O-tane comments that she has put on weight, and Tamekichi remarks that it's not easy to do these days. The daughter asks Tamekichi if he has had lunch. He asks her if she has brought anything good. She says she thought she‚Äôd share his. He replies ‚ÄòYou must be joking. You don‚Äôt bring anything and then you eat mine.‚Äô K≈çhei fails to win anything on the lottery. O-tane upbraids him, saying that it is because of his bad attitude. He starts to cry. O-tane gives him his ten yen back, but grumbles that he has made her lose money. Later, O-tane is berating K≈çhei for eating some of the persimmons she had hung outside the window to dry. He denies it, but she refuses to believe him. Tamekichi comes in and tells her that he ate them. O-tane apologises to K≈çhei and gives him some of the persimmons. The next day, K≈çhei's futon is wet again. After two o'clock, O-tane tells Tamekichi that the boy has been missing since before breakfast. Tamekichi expresses the opinion that he won‚Äôt come back and when O-tane says she's worried he‚Äôll go hungry he tells her that the boy will scavenge from dustbins. O-tane spends the rest of the day searching the streets. In the evening, Kiku visits again. She says that O-tane was always irascible and that when she glares it is enough to frighten any child. O-tane admits that she was too angry with the boy and says that he has a good heart. Kiku tells her that, in spite of herself, O-tane has grown fond of him. O-tane admits this is so. Tashiro arrives with K≈çhei. The boy had run away because he was afraid of the consequences of wetting his bed for the second time and had gone back to Kudan. When they are alone, O-tane asks K≈çhei if he‚Äôll be her son. He says ‚ÄòYes‚Äô. O-tane and Kiku are sitting on a bench at the zoo watching K≈çhei, dressed in new clothes, looking at the giraffe. O-tane says she's never felt so good before ‚Äì ‚Äòit‚Äôs what‚Äôs called maternal love‚Äô. They go to a photography studio and O-tane and K≈çhei have their portrait taken. Back at home, O-tane is talking about plans for K≈çhei to go to school when his father (Eitar≈ç Ozawa) turns up. He thanks O-tane for looking after the boy, for whom he has been searching. O-tane gives him the clothes and books she has bought for K≈çhei and, as father and son leave, says ‚ÄòBe sure to come and visit‚Äô. Tamekichi and Tashiro come from across the street. Tamekichi says he's glad the boy has been reunited with his father ‚Äì it's a happy ending. O-tane begins to cry. Tamekichi says ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs up? You didn‚Äôt like him to begin with.‚Äô O-tane says she's crying for happiness because the boy is back with his father. She had thought the father was uncaring, but realizes she was wrong. She wishes she‚Äôd treated the boy better. ‚ÄòChildren are wonderful. He was only here a week, but he really made me think.' She asks Tashiro to read her palm to see if it is possible that she might adopt a child. He advises her to look for one near the statue of Takamori Saig≈ç at the entrance to Ueno Park. The film ends with a montage of boys orphaned and made homeless by the war hanging about near the Saig≈ç statue, aimlessly smoking and playing games. Title The accepted English title of the film is based on a misreading of the Japanese title Nagaya shinshiroku ÔºàÈï∑Â±ãÁ¥≥Â£´Èå≤Ôºâ. A nagaya (Èï∑Â±ã) is a row of houses with shared dividing walls but separate entrances ‚Äì what would be called ‚Äòterraced houses‚Äô in the UK, 'row houses' in the US . Shinshiroku ( Á¥≥Â£´Èå≤: literally, ‚Äògentleman‚Äôs record‚Äô) means Who‚Äôs Who. A better translation of the title would be A Who‚Äôs Who of the Backstreets.The standard dictionary K≈çjien ÔºàÂ∫ÉËæûËãëÔºâdefines nagaya and shinshiroku as follows: Nagaya: A number of dwellings constructed in a continuous row as a single building.

Life Incipit Zimmermann was born in Vaihingen, W√ºrttemberg (now Germany) on November 25, 1642.\\"Who Do You Think You Are?\\", tracing lineage of Josh Groban back to his 8th grandfather, Johann Jacob Zimmermann He lived in N√ºrtingen, and studied theology at the University of T√ºbingen, where he was awarded the title Magister in 1664. An astronomer and astrologer, Zimmermann produced one of the first Equidistant Conic Projection star charts of the northern hemisphere in 1692. While at University, he also was a singing instructor. He took his first post as a Lutheran minister at Bietigheim (Baden) in 1671. In the early 1680s, he wrote treatises on two comets that caused widespread fears among the population; he charted their course astronomically and interpreted their meanings astrologically. Subsequently, he combined his astrological insights with the expectation of a millenarian realm of Christ on earth. Published under the pseudonym Ambrosius Sehmann von Caminiez (an anagram of his real name), his Muthmassliche Zeit-Bestimmung set out Zimmermann's belief that the dramatic upheavals ushering in Christ's kingdom on earth would occur in or around 1693. As his superiors in the Lutheran church viewed millenarianism as a dangerous heresy, Zimmermann was removed from his ministry in 1685. Another charge raised against him was that he adhered to the theosopher Jakob B√∂hme, whose complete works had been published in 1682. Since Zimmermann did not renounce his millenarian views, he and his family were exiled from W√ºrttemberg in February 1686. After spending time in Nuremberg, Frankfurt on Main, Amsterdam, and Heidelberg, the Zimmermanns settled in Hamburg, where Johann Jacob made a living as a writer and teacher. In this setting, he wrote his Scriptura Sacra Copernizans, which defended the astrological theories of Nicolaus Copernicus. As a testimony to his importance as a scientific writer, the work was reprinted in Hamburg in 1706 and 1736. While in Hamburg, Zimmermann also gradually attracted like-minded religious dissenters who were dissatisfied with the intolerance of the religious establishment. In 1693 a group of around 40 people left Hamburg to emigrate to the New World. Zimmermann died as the group of eleven families were preparing to travel from Rotterdam. His disciple Johannes Kelpius was elected to take Zimmermann's title of magister, leading \\"the Hamburg Group\\" (including Zimmermann's widow) to an area near Wissahickon Creek, Pennsylvania. Here they established a religious community which, while still famed in local legend, dissolved shortly after Kelpius' death in the early eighteenth century. Zimmermann is mentioned (as \\"Mr. Zimmerman\\") in Book 3 of Isaac Newton's Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687 (on p. 505) as having observed the Great Comet of 1680. Johann Jacob Zimmermann believed a person's close relationship with God was more important than having a close relationship with the church, believing most, if not all, of the churches in Europe were corrupt. He believed the wonders in the sky were signs of the end times, and felt a change would occur in 1693. Instead, Zimmermann died in 1693 at the age of 50. An old German letter stated that Zimmermann died en route to America and was buried in Rotterdam. It also stated that the writer of the letter had begged Zimmermann not to go. Legacy Josh Groban, singer, is the 8 times great grandson of Johan Zimmerman.

Currently, this occurs only in some Muslim-majority countries and Muslim-majority states in Northern Nigeria. Discrimination against atheists, both at present and historically, includes persecution of and discrimination against people identified as atheists. Discrimination against atheists may also comprise negative attitudes, prejudice, hostility, hatred, fear, or intolerance towards atheists and atheism. Because atheism can be defined in various ways, those discriminated against or persecuted on the grounds of being atheists might not have been considered atheists in a different time or place. 13 Muslim countries officially punish atheism or apostasy by death, while \\"the overwhelming majority\\" of the 193 member states of the United Nations \\"at best discriminate against citizens who have no belief in a god and at worst can jail them for offences dubbed blasphemy\\". In some Muslim-majority countries, atheists face persecution and severe penalties such as the withdrawal of legal status or, in the case of apostasy, capital punishment. Other names Sometimes such discrimination is called atheophobia, atheistophobia, anti- atheist discrimination. Ancient times Tim Whitmarsh argues atheism existed in the ancient world, though it remains difficult to assess its extent given that atheists are referenced (usually disparagingly) rather than having surviving writings. Given monotheism at the time was a minority view, atheism generally attacked polytheistic beliefs and associated practices in references found. The word \\"atheos\\" (godless) also was used for religious dissent generally (including the monotheists) which complicates study further. Despite these difficulties, Whitmarsh believes that otherwise atheism then was much the same. While atheists (or people perceived as such) were occasionally persecuted, this was rare (perhaps due to being a small group, plus a relative tolerance toward different religious views). Other scholars believe it arose along in the modern era. Lucien Febvre has referred to the \\"unthinkability\\" of atheism in its strongest sense before the sixteenth century, because of the \\"deep religiosity\\" of that era. Karen Armstrong has concurred, writing \\"from birth and baptism to death and burial in the churchyard, religion dominated the life of every single man and woman. Every activity of the day, which was punctuated by church bells summoning the faithful to prayer, was saturated with religious beliefs and institutions: they dominated professional and public life‚Äîeven the guilds and the universities were religious organizations. ... Even if an exceptional man could have achieved the objectivity necessary to question the nature of religion and the existence of God, he would have found no support in either the philosophy or the science of his time.\\" As governmental authority rested on the notion of divine right, it was threatened by those who denied the existence of the local god. Those labeled as atheist, including early Christians and Muslims, were as a result targeted for legal persecution. Early modern period and Reformation During the early modern period, the term \\"atheist\\" was used as an insult and applied to a broad range of people, including those who held opposing theological beliefs, as well as those who had committed suicide, immoral or self-indulgent people, and even opponents of the belief in witchcraft. Atheistic beliefs were seen as threatening to order and society by philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas. Lawyer and scholar Thomas More said that religious tolerance should be extended to all except those who did not believe in a deity or the immortality of the soul. John Locke, a founder of modern notions of religious liberty, argued that atheists (as well as Catholics and Muslims) should not be granted full citizenship rights. During the Inquisition, several of those who were accused of atheism or blasphemy, or both, were tortured or executed. These included the priest Giulio Cesare Vanini who was strangled and burned in 1619 and the Polish nobleman Kazimierz ≈Åyszczy≈Ñski who was executed in Warsaw, as well as Etienne Dolet, a Frenchman executed in 1546. Though heralded as atheist martyrs during the nineteenth century, recent scholars hold that the beliefs espoused by Dolet and Vanini are not atheistic in modern terms.  Modern era   Victorian Britain  During the nineteenth century, British atheists, though few in number, were subject to discriminatory practices. The poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was expelled from the University of Oxford and denied custody of his two children after publishing a pamphlet titled The Necessity of Atheism. Those not willing to swear Christian oaths during judicial proceedings were unable to give evidence in court to obtain justice until this requirement was repealed by Acts passed in 1869 and 1870. Atheist Charles Bradlaugh was elected as a Member of the British Parliament in 1880. He was denied the right to affirm rather than swear his oath of office, and was then denied the ability to swear the oath as other Members objected that he had himself said it would be meaningless. Bradlaugh was re-elected three times before he was finally able to take his seat in 1886 when the Speaker of the House permitted him to take the oath.  Nazi Germany  In Germany during the Nazi era, a 1933 decree stated that \\"No National Socialist may suffer detriment... on the ground that he does not make any religious profession at all\\". However, the regime strongly opposed \\"godless communism\\", and all of Germany's atheist and largely left-wing freethought organizations such as the German Freethinkers League (500,000 members) were banned the same year; some right-wing groups were tolerated by the Nazis until the mid-1930s. In a speech made later in 1933, Hitler claimed to have \\"stamped out\\" the atheistic movement. During the negotiations which lead up to the Nazi-Vatican Concordat of 26 April 1933 Hitler stated that \\"Secular schools can never be tolerated\\" because of their irreligious tendencies.Ernst Helmreich, The German Churches Under Hitler. Detroit: Wayne State Univ. Press, 1979, p. 241. Hitler routinely disregarded this undertaking, and the Reich concordat as a whole, and by 1939, all Catholic denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.Evans, Richard J. (2005). The Third Reich in Power. New York: Penguin. ; pp. 245‚Äì246 By 1939, 94.5% of Germans still called themselves Protestant or Catholic, while 3.5% were so-called \\"Gottgl√§ubige\\" (lit. \\"believers in God\\") and 1.5% were without faith. According to historian Richard J. Evans, those members of the affiliation gottgl√§ubig \\"were convinced Nazis who had left their Church at the behest of the Party, which had been trying since the mid-1930s to reduce the influence of Christianity in society\\".Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 546 Heinrich Himmler was a strong promoter of the gottgl√§ubig movement and didn't allow atheists into the SS, arguing that their \\"refusal to acknowledge higher powers\\" would be a \\"potential source of indiscipline\\". Himmler announced to the SS: \\"We believe in a God Almighty who stands above us; he has created the earth, the Fatherland, and the Volk, and he has sent us the F√ºhrer. Any human being who does not believe in God should be considered arrogant, megalomaniacal, and stupid and thus not suited for the SS.\\" The SS oath (Eidformel der Schutzstaffel), written by Himmler, also specifically denounced atheists, repeating the sentiments above. Present day Human rights Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is designed to protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \\"protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief\\". The committee further stated that \\"the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views\\". Signatories to the convention are barred from \\"the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers\\" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, atheists still are persecuted in some parts of the world. Western countries Modern theories of constitutional democracy assume that citizens are intellectually and spiritually autonomous and that governments should leave matters of religious belief to individuals and not coerce religious beliefs using sanctions or benefits. The constitutions, human rights conventions and the religious liberty jurisprudence of most constitutional democracies provide legal protection of atheists and agnostics. In addition, freedom of expression provisions and legislation separating church from state also serve to protect the rights of atheists. As a result, open legal discrimination against atheists is not common in most Western countries. However, prejudice against atheists does exist in Western countries. A University of British Columbia study conducted in the United States found that believers distrusted atheists as much they did rapists. The study also showed that atheists had lower employment prospects. Europe In most of Europe, atheists are elected to office at high levels in many governments without controversy. Some atheist organizations in Europe have expressed concerns regarding issues of separation of church and state, such as administrative fees for leaving the Church charged in Germany, and sermons being organized by the Swedish parliament. Ireland requires religious training from Christian colleges in order to work as a teacher in government-funded schools. In the UK one-third of state-funded schools are faith-based. However, there are no restrictions on atheists holding public office ‚Äì the former Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Nick Clegg, is an atheist. According to a 2012 poll, 25% of the Turks in Germany believe atheists are inferior human beings.Liljeberg Research International: Deutsch-T√ºrkische Lebens und Wertewelten 2012 , July/August 2012, p. 68Die Welt: T√ºrkische Migranten hoffen auf muslimische Mehrheit, 17 August 2012, retrieved 23 August 2012 Portugal has elected two presidents, M√°rio Soares, who was also elected Prime-Minister, and Jorge Sampaio, who have openly expressed their irreligion, as well as two agnostic Prime-Ministers, Jos√© S√≥crates and Ant√≥nio Costa. On the contrary, in Greece, the right-wing New Democracy government stated that \\"the Greek people have a right to know whether Mr. Tsipras is an atheist\\", citing their political opponent's irreligiosity as a reason he should not be elected, even though they granted that \\"it is his right\\". In the Elder Pastitsios case, a 27-year-old was sentenced to imprisonment for satirizing a popular apocalyptically-minded Greek Orthodox monk, while several metropolitans of the Greek Orthodox Church (which is not separated from the state) have also urged their flock \\"not to vote unbelievers into office\\", even going so far as to warn Greek Orthodox laymen that they would be \\"sinning if they voted atheists into public office\\". Brazil A 2009 survey showed that atheists were the most hated demographic group in Brazil, among several other minorities polled, being almost on par with drug addicts. According to the research, 17% of the interviewees stated they felt either hatred or repulsion for atheists, while 25% felt antipathy and 29% were indifferent. Canada Canadian secular humanist groups have worked to end the recitation of prayers during government proceedings, viewing them as discriminatory. Scouts Canada states that while a belief in God or affiliation with organized religion is not a requirement to join, members must have \\"a basic spiritual belief\\" and one of the core values is \\"Duty to God: Defined as, The responsibility to adhere to spiritual principles, and thus to the religion that expresses them, and to accept the duties therefrom.\\" United States Discrimination against atheists in the United States occurs in legal, personal, social, and professional contexts. Many American atheists compare their situation to the discrimination faced by ethnic minorities, LGBT communities, and women. \\"Americans still feel it's acceptable to discriminate against atheists in ways considered beyond the pale for other groups,\\" asserted Fred Edwords of the American Humanist Association. The degree of discrimination, persecution, and social stigma atheists face in the United States, compared to other persecuted groups in the United States has been the subject of study and a matter of debate. In the United States, seven state constitutions include religious tests that would effectively prevent atheists from holding public office, and in some cases being a juror/witness, though these have not generally been enforced since the early twentieth century. The U.S. Constitution permits an affirmation in place of an oath to allow atheists to give testimony in court or to hold public office. However, a United States Supreme Court case reaffirmed that the United States Constitution prohibits States and the Federal Government from requiring any kind of religious test for public office, in the specific case, as a notary public. This decision is generally understood to also apply to witness oaths. Several American atheists have used court challenges to address discrimination against atheists. Michael Newdow challenged inclusion of the phrase \\"under God\\" in the United States Pledge of Allegiance on behalf of his daughter, claiming that the phrase amounted to government endorsement of discrimination against atheists. He won the case at an initial stage, but the Supreme Court dismissed his claim, ruling that Newdow did not have standing to bring his case, thus disposing of the case without ruling on the constitutionality of the pledge. Respondents to a survey were less likely to support a kidney transplant for hypothetical atheists and agnostics needing it, than for Christian patients with similar medical needs.Atheism, Secularity, and Well-Being: How the Findings of Social Science Counter Negative Stereotypes and Assumptions, Phil Zuckerman* As the Boy Scouts of America does not allow atheists as members, atheist families and the ACLU from the 1990s onwards have launched a series of court cases arguing discrimination against atheists. In response to ACLU lawsuits, the Pentagon in 2004 ended sponsorship of Scouting units, and in 2005 the BSA agreed to transfer all Scouting units out of government entities such as public schools. Despite polling showing that nonbelievers make up an increasingly large part of the population there is only one public atheist in all of the state legislatures across the nation. Few politicians have been willing to acknowledge their lack of belief in supreme beings, since such revelations have been considered \\"political suicide\\". On 20 September 2007, Pete Stark became the first nontheist United States congressman to openly acknowledge a lack of belief, joining the millions of Americans who have long kept their views secret for fear of discrimination in their communities. There is one state legislator, Ernie Chambers, currently holding a seat in the Nebraska State Legislature. Cecil Bothwell, who has publicly stated he doesn't believe in gods and that it's \\"certainly not relevant to public office\\", was elected on 3 November 2009, to the Asheville, North Carolina city council after he won the third highest number of votes in the city election. Following the election, political opponents of Bothwell threatened to challenge his election on the grounds that the North Carolina Constitution does not allow for atheists to hold public office in the state. However, that provision, dating back to 1868, is unenforceable and invalid because the United States Constitution prevents religious tests for public office. A 2015 Gallup survey found that 40% of Americans would not vote an atheist for president, and in polls prior to 2015, that number had reached about 50%. A 2014 study by the University of Minnesota found that 42% of respondents characterized atheists as a group that did \\"not at all agree with my vision of American society\\", and that 44% would not want their child to marry an atheist. The negative attitudes towards atheists were higher than negative attitudes towards African-Americans and homosexuals but lower than the negative attitudes towards Muslims. Many in the U.S. associate atheism with immorality, including criminal behaviour, extreme materialism, communism and elitism. The studies also showed that rejection of atheists was related to the respondent's lack of exposure to diversity, education and political orientations. Atheists and atheist organizations have alleged discrimination against atheists in the military,. Retrieved on 28 November 2010 and recently, with the development of the Army's Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program, atheists have alleged institutionalized discrimination. In several child custody court rulings, atheist parents have been discriminated against, either directly or indirectly. As child custody laws in the United States are often based on the subjective opinion of family court judges, atheism has frequently been used to deny custody to non-religious parents on the basis that a parent's lack of faith displays a lack of morality required to raise a child. Prominent atheists and atheist groups have said that discrimination against atheists is illustrated by a statement reportedly made by George H. W. Bush during a public press conference just after announcing his candidacy for the presidency in 1987. When asked by journalist Robert Sherman about the equal citizenship and patriotism of American atheists, Sherman reported that Bush answered, \\"No, I don't know that atheists should be regarded as citizens, nor should they be regarded as patriotic. This is one nation under God.\\"Frequently misquoted as \\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.\\", starting with . Sherman did not tape the exchange and no other newspaper ran a story on it at the time. George H. W. Bush's son, George W. Bush, responded to a question about the role of faith in his presidency during a 3 November 2004 press conference, \\"I will be your president regardless of your faith. And I don't expect you to agree with me, necessarily, on religion. As a matter of fact, no president should ever try to impose religion on our society. The great ‚Äì the great tradition of America is one where people can worship the ‚Äì the way they want to worship. And if they choose not to worship, they're just as patriotic as your neighbor.\\" On 16 December 2016, President Barack Obama signed H.R. 1150, an amendment to the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act. It includes protections for \\"non-theistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess or practice any religion at all.\\" =Atheists eligible to hold office= Torcaso v. Watkins, was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court reaffirmed that the United States Constitution prohibits States and the Federal Government from requiring any kind of religious test for public office; the specific case with Torcaso was regarding his being an atheist and his work as a notary public. The constitutions of eight U.S. states ban atheists from holding public office. However, these laws are unenforceable due to conflicting with the First Amendment and Article VI of the United States Constitution: ;Arkansas :Article 19, Section 1 \\"No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State, nor be competent to testify as a witness in any Court.\\" ;Maryland :Article 37 \\"That no religious test ought ever to be required as a qualification for any office of profit or trust in this State, other than a declaration of belief in the existence of God; nor shall the Legislature prescribe any other oath of office than the oath prescribed by this Constitution.\\" ;Mississippi :Article 14, Section 265 \\"No person who denies the existence of a Supreme Being shall hold any office in this state.\\" ;North Carolina :Article 6, Section 8 \\"The following persons shall be disqualified for office: First, any person who shall deny the being of Almighty God.\\" ;South Carolina :Article 17, Section 4 \\"No person who denies the existence of a Supreme Being shall hold any office under this Constitution.\\" ;Tennessee :Article 9, Section 2 \\"No person who denies the being of God, or a future state of rewards and punishments, shall hold any office in the civil department of this state.\\" ;Texas :Article 1, Section 4 \\"No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office, or public trust, in this State; nor shall any one be excluded from holding office on account of his religious sentiments, provided he acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being.\\" An eighth state constitution affords special protection to theists. ;Pennsylvania :Article 1, Section 4 \\"No person who acknowledges the being of a God and a future state of rewards and punishments shall, on account of his religious sentiments, be disqualified to hold any office or place of trust or profit under this Commonwealth.\\" Muslim-majority countries Atheists, and those accused of defection from the official religion, may be subject to discrimination and persecution in many Muslim-majority countries. According to the International Humanist and Ethical Union, compared to other nations, \\"unbelievers... in Islamic countries face the most severe ‚Äì sometimes brutal ‚Äì treatment\\". Atheists and religious skeptics can be executed in at least fourteen nations: Afghanistan, Iran, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. According to popular interpretations of Islam, Muslims are not free to change religion or become an atheist: denying Islam and thus becoming an apostate is traditionally punished by death for men and by life imprisonment for women. The death penalty for apostasy is apparent in a range of Islamic states including: Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Somalia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Although there have been no recently reported executions in Saudi Arabia,CTV news, \\"'Apostasy' laws widespread in Muslim world\\" , quote: \\"Islamic Shariah law considers conversion to any religion apostasy and most Muslim scholars agree the punishment is death. Saudi Arabia considers Shariah the law of the land, though there have been no reported cases of executions of converts from Islam in recent memory.\\" a judge in Saudi Arabia has recently recommended that imprisoned blogger Raif Badawi go before a high court on a charge of apostasy, which would carry the death penalty upon conviction. While a death sentence is rare, it is common for atheists to be charged with blasphemy or inciting hatred. New \\"Arab Spring\\" regimes in Tunisia and Egypt have jailed several outspoken atheists. Since an apostate can be considered a Muslim whose beliefs cast doubt on the Divine, and/or Qur'an, claims of atheism and apostasy have been made against Muslim scholars and political opponents throughout history. Both fundamentalists and moderates agree that \\"blasphemers will not be forgiven\\" although they disagree on the severity of an appropriate punishment. In northwestern Syria in 2013 during the Syrian Civil War, jihadists beheaded and defaced a sculpture of Al-Ma øarri (973‚Äì1058 CE), one of several outspoken Arab and Persian anti-religious intellectuals who lived and taught during the Islamic Golden Age.Syria Violence Claims Head of Ancient Arab Poet.

Jordan requires atheists to associate themselves with a recognized religion for official identification purposes. In Egypt, intellectuals suspected of holding atheistic beliefs have been prosecuted by judicial and religious authorities. Novelist Alaa Hamad was convicted of publishing a book that contained atheistic ideas and apostasy that were considered to threaten national unity and social peace. Algeria The study of Islam is a requirement in public and private schools for every Algerian child, irrespective of their religion. Atheist or agnostic men are prohibited from marrying Muslim women (Algerian Family Code I.II.31). A marriage is legally nullified by the apostasy of the husband (presumably from Islam, although this is not specified; Family Code I.III.33). Atheists and agnostics cannot inherit (Family Code III.I.138). Bangladesh Constitution of Bangladesh ensures secularism and right to religious freedom. Yet, Religious Education is a mandatory subject in Bangladeshi public curricula from Grade-3(Ages 8 to 9 usually), and even though Religious Education is required from Grade-3 onwards, most public and private schools have Religious Education since Grade-1 (Ages 6 to 7 usually), and most children are given Religious Education from a young age, and most children from Muslim households in Bangladesh complete the Qur'an for the first time by the time they are 8 or 9. Religion is also a mandatory elective needed in order for a student to sit for their HSCs. Although Atheism is frowned upon, no atheists have ever been given death sentence for apostasy since the birth of the country. Some Bangladeshi atheists have been assassinated by the Bangladeshi Islamic extremist organization, the Ansarullah Bangla Team., but the Government took strict measure and banned Islamist groups from politics Indonesia Atheists in Indonesia experience official discrimination in the context of registration of births and marriages, and the issuance of identity cards. In 2012, Indonesian atheist Alexander Aan was beaten by a mob, lost his job as a civil servant and was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for expressing his views online. =Indonesian genocide= Jess Melvin argues that atheists were victims of genocide under the legal definition of the term during the 1965‚Äì66 Anti-PKI extermination campaign (PKI were the Communist Party of Indonesia) as the Indonesian army proscribed the destruction of \\"atheist\\" and \\"unbelievers\\" collectively for their association with communism, and according to Matthew Lippmann and David Nersessian atheists are covered as a protected group in the genocide convention under \\"religious group.\\"Melvin, Jess (2017). \\"Mechanics of Mass Murder: A case for Understanding the Indonesian Killings as Genocide\\". Journal of Genocide Research 19 (4): 487‚Äì511. doi:10. 1080/14623528.2017.1393942. Iran Since atheism is not a belief nor a religion, non-believers are not given legal status in Iran. Declaration of faith in Islam, Christianity, Judaism or Zoroastrianism is required to avail of certain rights such as applying for entrance to university, or becoming a lawyer, with the position of judge reserved for Muslims only. The Penal Code is also based upon the religious affiliation of the victim and perpetrator, with the punishment oftentimes more severe on non-Muslims. Numerous writers, thinkers and philanthropists have been accused of apostasy and sentenced to death for questioning the prevailing interpretation of Islam in Iran. The Iranian Atheists Association was established in 2013 to form a platform for Iranian atheists to start debates and to question the current Islamic regime's attitude towards atheists, apostasy, and human rights.  Iraq  In October 2018, bookstore owner Ihsan Mousa was arrested. He was released after promising not to sell books that promote rejection of Islam. Libya Atheism is prohibited in Libya and can come with a death penalty, if one is charged as an atheist. Saudi Arabia Atheism is prohibited in Saudi Arabia and can come with a death penalty, if one is charged as an atheist. In March 2014, the Saudi interior ministry issued a royal decree branding all atheists as terrorists, which defines terrorism as \\"calling for atheist thought in any form, or calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based\\". Turkey Although officially a secular state, the vast majority of Turks are Muslim, and the state grants some special privileges to Muslims and to Islam in the media and private religious institutions. Compulsory religious instruction in Turkish schools is also considered discriminatory towards atheists, who may not want their children to receive any religious education. India Sanal Edamaruku, atheist and founder-president of Rationalist International, had to flee India in 2012, when the Catholic Secular Forum pressed charges against him under Section 295(A) of the Indian Penal Code, which penalises outraging the religious sentiments of any citizen.Shaffer, R (March‚ÄìApril 2013). \\"Blasphemy, Free Speech, and Rationalism: An Interview with Sanal Edamaruku\\".

In Indian society, rationalists have been generally considered undeclared atheists because they tend to label all sorts of religious activities as superstition. So they have been stigmatized and avoided by most Indians. Indian Muslims and Christians are traditionally opposed to atheism, and Hindus also tend to distance themselves from atheists since the dharmashastras ban interaction with atheists. However in ancient India, atheistic schools of thought, such as Charvaka and Ajivika existed alongside Buddhism during the latter's early days. Orthodox Hindus consider Jainism and Buddhism to be atheistic faiths, since they deny the existence of a supreme God and the individual soul. Other Regular Freemasonry insists among other things that a volume of scripture is open in a working lodge, that every member profess belief in a Supreme Being, and that the discussion of religion is banned. Continental Freemasonry is now the general term for the \\"liberal\\" jurisdictions which have removed some, or all, of these restrictions. \\"Duty to God\\" is a principle of Scouting worldwide, though it is applied differently among countries. The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) takes a strong position, excluding atheists and agnostics, while Girl Scouts of the USA takes a more neutral position. The United Kingdom Scout Association has recently published alternative promises for people of different or no religion, specifying \\"Atheists, Humanists and people of no specific religion\\", who make a promise to uphold Scouting values rather than a duty to God. Scouts Canada defines Duty to God broadly in terms of \\"adherence to spiritual principles\\" and does not require members to be part of an organized religion, but does require that they have some form of \\"personal spirituality\\". In other countries, especially in Europe, some Scouting organizations may be secularist or religiously neutral (such as Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs de France, Corpo Nazionale Giovani Esploratori ed Esploratrici Italiani and the Baden-Powell Service Association in the United States).

He was Speaker of the Irish House of Commons and Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Although he was a man of great gifts, he was so hot-tempered that even Jonathan Swift is said to have been afraid of him. Background Brodrick was the second son of Sir St John Brodrick of Ballyannan, near Midleton in County Cork, by his wife Alice (died 1696), daughter of Laurence Clayton of Mallow, County Cork, and sister of Colonel Randall Clayton MP, of Mallow. Brodick's father had received large land grants during the Protectorate, and thus the family had much to lose if the land issue in Ireland was settled to the satisfaction of dispossessed Roman Catholics. He was educated at Magdalen College and the Middle Temple, being called to the English bar in 1678. Brodrick and his relatives fled Ireland during the Glorious Revolution. They were attainted under the rule of King James II in Ireland. In exile in England, Brodrick argued for a speedy reconquest. Career In 1690 Brodrick returned to Dublin and was given the legal office of Third Serjeant. He also became Recorder of Cork. He was dismissed as Serjeant in 1692, on the ground that there was no work for him to do. Brodrick, while complaining bitterly about his dismissal, admitted privately that his post had been a superfluous one.Hart, A.R. History of the King's Serjeant-at-law in Ireland Dublin Four Courts Press 2000 As a prominent Whig supporter of the outcome of the Glorious Revolution he was not always in agreement with court policies in Ireland, which he considered too lenient on the Jacobites. The dismissal of the First Serjeant, John Osborne at the same time as Brodrick was due to his even stronger opposition to Court policy.Hart History of the King's Serjeant-at-law Despite this Brodrick often held Irish government offices and aspired to manage the Irish Parliament for English ministers. He represented Cork City in the Irish Parliament, which met in 1692 and held this seat until 1710. He was a vocal opponent of court policies, until the new Whig Lord Deputy of Ireland, Lord Capell decided to appoint him Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1695. He promoted the penal laws against Catholics, whilst also supporting greater powers for the Irish Parliament. Speaker Brodrick was Speaker of the Irish House of Commons from 21 September 1703. After promoting resolutions critical of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland he lost his post as Solicitor-General in 1704. He was Attorney-General for Ireland 1707‚Äì1709. He became Chief Justice of Ireland 1710‚Äì1711 Dictionary of National Biography - but Haydn's Book of Dignities says that he was appointed in 1709 and was replaced as Speaker on 19 May 1710, but again held the office in the next Parliament 25 November 1713 ‚Äì 1 August 1714, where he also represented Cork County. In 1713 he purchased a substantial estate at Peper Harrow, in Surrey, from Philip Frowde.Victoria County History, A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3 (1911), pp. 49‚Äì52, Parishes: Peper Harrow Date accessed: 16 May 2010. He was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1714 and was ennobled in the Peerage of Ireland in 1715, as the 1st Baron Brodrick. He vacated his seat in the Irish Commons and continued in the Irish Parliament as a peer. He was advanced to the rank of 1st Viscount Midleton in 1717. Sherlock v Annesley and its aftermath The most celebrated lawsuit heard in Midleton's time as Lord Chancellor was Sherlock v Annesley; although on the face of it this was an unremarkable dispute between cousins over possession of lands in Kildare, it raised the sensitive question as to whether the Irish or British House of Lords was the final court of appeal from Ireland, and ultimately put an effective end to the independence of the Irish Parliament until 1782. The parties ended up with conflicting orders from the two Houses entitling each of them to be put in possession; when the Barons of the Court of Exchequer enforced the decree of the British House, the Irish House committed them to prison for contempt. This was against the advice of Midleton, who though himself a very hot-tempered man did his best on this occasion to calm matters down. The imprisonment of the judges proved to be a disastrous mistake: the British Parliament retaliated with a statute, the Dependency of Ireland on Great Britain Act 1719, the notorious \\"Sixth of George I\\", which not only removed the right of appeal to the Irish House of Lords but asserted the right of the British Parliament to pass laws concerning Ireland.O'Flanagan, J. Roderick The Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland 2 Volumes 1870 British Parliament Midleton feuded with his successor as Speaker, William Conolly, as they were rivals to be the leading figure in Irish politics. To bolster his position he resolved to enter the British House of Commons. He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Midhurst by the patronage of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset at a by-election on 27 February 1717. He supported Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland until they fell out 1719 over the Peerage Bill, which Sunderland had promoted but which Midleton opposed, and he was ignored until Sunderland's death in 1722. He was returned unopposed at Midhurst at the 1722 general election, became a leading ministerial supporter in the House of Commons, and was invited to private dinners with Sir Robert Walpole. He spoke for the Government on the army on 26 October 1722 and recovered his position as one of the Lord Justices (Ireland) who governed Ireland when the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was absent. Wood's Halfpence In 1723 he returned to Ireland, where he became involved in a lengthy wrangle over a patent for manufacturing ¬£108,000 of copper coinage for Ireland, which had been sold by the Duchess of Kendal, the principal Royal mistress of King George I, to William Wood, a Wolverhampton manufacturer, and which Midleton opposed. The coinage, known as \\"Wood's Halfpence\\" became bitterly unpopular in Ireland: it was opposed by the Church of Ireland hierarchy, and was the subject of a celebrated attack by Jonathan Swift in the Drapier Letters. Although the patent was dropped, Midleton was so upset by the situation that he resigned as Lord Chancellor in 1725, and went into opposition in the Irish Parliament. He left behind him a legacy of bitterness and ill-will for which he was not really responsible ‚àí the Irish peers chose to blame him for the loss of their powers under the Sixth of George I, rather than their own misjudgment in imprisoning the Barons of the Exchequer.O'Flanagan Lives of the Lord Chancellors, above He was returned again as MP for Midhurst at the 1727 general election. Later years Midleton led the opposition in the next session of the Irish Parliament, but then let others take the lead. In his memoirs, he famously expressed a great sense of disappointment at having lost to another of his lifelong rivals, Adam Montgomery of Cambridge. Midleton died on 29 August 1728. Family Lord Midleton married three times. His first wife was Catherine Barry, daughter of Redmond Barry of County Cork, by whom he had a son, St John Brodick, who predeceased him. His second wife was Lucy Courthorpe, daughter of Sir Peter Courthorpe of County Cork, by whom he had his second son and heir Alan, 2nd Viscount Midleton. He married thirdly Anne Hill, daughter of Sir John Trevor, Master of the Rolls, and Jane Mostyn, and widow of Michael Hill.Wilson, Rachel, Elite Women in Ascendancy Ireland, 1690-1745: Imitation and Innovation (Boydell and Brewer, Woodbridge, 2015).  Personality  Midleton was acknowledged by all who knew him to be a man of great talent and intelligence, but he was also arrogant, hot-tempered and violent in speech. Even his closest friends admitted that he was \\"too passionate\\". Jonathan Swift, not always the mildest of men himself, called him \\"as violent as a tiger\\".Ball, F.

From the 2013 general elections onwards Kenya will have three classes of local authorities: City'forms, Municipality, and Town authorities. Subject to the Urban Areas and Cities Act of 2011, there are three authorities with city status: Nairobi, the national capital, Mombasa and Kisumu. Municipalities and towns are other forms of urban authorities and are generally named after their central town. Local authorities usually differ from divisional and constituency boundaries used by the state administration. Under the former act of parliament local authority administration consisted of a mayor, town clerk and councillors. The number of councillors depended on population and area of each authority and they were elected by the public during the Kenya general elections held every five years or by-elections held in between. Authorities were divided into wards and each ward elects only one councillor. Wards have often common boundaries with administrative locations. Compared to many other countries, local authorities in Kenya were weak and are shadowed by state run administration.Samuel O. Owuor, B. Charlery, M. Chretin and B.

Baron Cope, (18 August 1870 ‚Äì 15 July 1946William Cope player profile Scrum.com), known as Sir William Cope, Bt, between 1928 and 1945, was a Welsh Conservative Party politician, who was also notable as an international rugby union player for Wales. He was Member of Parliament for Llandaff and Barry from 1918‚Äì29, was made a baronet in 1928 and elevated to the peerage as Baron Cope in July 1945. Background and education Cope was born in Roath, Cardiff in 1870, the son of Matthew Cope from St Mellons and Margaret Harrison.Profile, ThePeerage.com; accessed 14 April 2016. He was educated at Repton School before matriculating to Clare College, Cambridge in 1888. He was awarded his BA in 1891 and in 1895 collected his MA. After leaving Cambridge Cope began his legal profession and was admitted to the Inner Temple, and in 1894 he was called to The Bar. Political career With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Cope joined the Glamorgan Yeomanry, rising to the rank of major. On returning to Britain in 1918, he ran for Parliament, standing for the seat of Llandaff and Barry. In 1923 he became a Junior Lord of the Treasury, a post he held until 1928, with a break during the brief Labour Government of 1924. In 1928 he was created a baronet, of St Mellons in the County of Monmouth. On leaving The Treasury he was given the role of Comptroller of the Royal Household, a role he undertook for just a year when he left government in 1929. He held several offices in his home county of Glamorgan. He was a Justice of the Peace, and a Deputy Lieutenant and in 1932 was made High Sheriff of Glamorgan. In 1933 he was invested as a King's Council. In July 1945 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Cope, of St Mellons in the County of Monmouth. Rugby career Cope first came to note as a rugby player when he played for Cambridge University while a student. In 1891 he played in The Varsity Match against Oxford, gaining a sporting Blue. From 1891 through to 1895 Cope turned out for his home club of Cardiff,Davies (1975), p. 238. and after leaving university he also represented first class English team Blackheath. During the 1891‚Äì1892 season Cope became a member of invitational team the Barbarians in only their second year.Starmer-Smith, Nigel, The Barbarians; Macdonald & Jane's Publishers (1977) pg. 219; Four years later, Cope was selected to represent Wales as part of the 1896 Home Nations Championship in a match against Scotland. Cope was brought in to a much changed team after a disastrous opening match of the tournament against England; the selectors reacting to a 25‚Äì0 scoreline by selecting five new caps in the pack. Cope was one of the new members, who under the leadership of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, managed to beat Scotland 6‚Äì0. Despite the victory, this was Cope's only international game, being replaced by a returning Arthur Boucher in the next match of the Championship. Family Lord Cope married Helen (n√©e Shuldham) on 5 September 1900. They had two children. He died in July 1945, aged 75, when the baronetcy and barony became extinct.

The show premiered on January 18, 2003, and aired on TLC in the United States. What Not to Wear was hosted by Stacy London and Clinton Kelly, though Stacy London‚Äôs Season 1 co-host was Wayne Scot Lukas. Lukas left after season 1 and was replaced by Clinton Kelly. Also part of the show was head makeover artist Carmindy and hairstylist Nick Arrojo from season 1 through season 6. Celebrity hairstylist Ted Gibson replaced Arrojo beginning in season 7, through season 10. On March 6, 2013, TLC announced that the tenth season of What Not to Wear would be its last. On April 10, 2019, it was announced that the series will be revived and premiere in 2020 on TLC. Format Participants were nominated by friends, co-workers, or relatives. Some episodes involved self-nominations, such as the class reunion specials or mall nominations. In the latter, What Not to Wear set up a 360-degree mirror in various malls across the United States, which allowed women to explain why they needed fashion help. Early episodes featured both men and women; however, as the men's transformations did not prove to be as remarkable, all later episodes featured women exclusively. Some episodes featured both the nominee and the nominator being selected for a makeover. When a woman was selected, the show secretly followed and videotaped her for two weeks. Sometimes the nominee would be asked to participate in \\"market research\\" by a camera crew which was actually the What Not to Wear crew filming her pre-makeover look for the show. Also, the nominators sometimes gained access to the nominee's closet to point out specific items of clothing that they considered particularly bad. While reviewing the secret footage, Stacy and Clinton would comment, in sometimes caustic style, on why the nominee's wardrobe was unflattering (\\"mom jeans\\") or out-dated (purchased in the 1980s) and they would usually meet with the nominators before meeting the nominee. Afterward, the entire group would go to meet the soon-to-be-surprised nominee. During the surprise visit, the nominee was offered a $5,000 Visa debit card (in later seasons, the card was an unbranded $5,000 gift card) for the purpose of buying a new wardrobe if she would turn over her entire existing wardrobe to Stacy and Clinton and shop by their \\"rules\\" (shopping guidelines tailored for her age, body shape, and profession). If the nominee accepted the terms of the offer then Stacy and Clinton would give them the gift card and review the secret footage with them. If she declined, nothing further is filmed and there is no show. Nominees were sometimes very reluctant to agree and had to be persuaded by Stacy and Clinton and the nominators. After reviewing the secret footage, the nominee was brought to New York City for a week of evaluation, shopping, and hair and make-up styling.Odenwald, Dan (August 21, 2003). \\"Watch and Wear\\". Metro Weekly. Accessed April 30, 2009 Throughout the week, the nominee frequently declared she was unable to find properly fitting clothes, she disliked her body, or she didn't care what other people thought. On the first day, Stacy and Clinton would sort through the nominee's current wardrobe, and she would step inside a 360-degree mirror to explain what she liked about her regular outfits and why she thought they looked good on her. After critiquing each outfit, Stacy and Clinton presented a more \\"appropriate\\" outfit to the participant to help illustrate the \\"rules\\" for the participant to follow when shopping for new clothes. Throughout the sorting process, most of the clothes were symbolically tossed in a large garbage can; however, they were actually donated to charity as long as they were not torn or damaged.Vowell, Roberta (January 25, 2008). \\"VA Beach fitness trainer get makeover from TLC's 'What Not To Wear'\\". The Virginian-Pilot. Accessed April 30, 2009 On the second day, the participant was filmed shopping on her own in various New York stores including Mexx, New York & Company, Ann Taylor, Filene's Basement, Searle, H&M;, Bloomingdales, Macy's, and Montmartre. Stacy and Clinton watched the videotaped footage and commented, for the benefit of the viewers/audience, on whether or not the participant was following the \\"rules\\". On the third day, Stacy and Clinton would surprise the participant, comment on whether the previous day's purchases followed the \\"rules\\", and help her with the remainder of the shopping. If the participant had not followed the rules, the clothes may have to be returned. On the fourth day, hair stylist Nick Arojjo, and later hair stylist Ted Gibson, and make-up artist Carmindy transformed the participant's appearance. At this stage, Stacy and Clinton were not present. On the fifth and last day in New York, the participant showed off her new look to Stacy and Clinton‚Äîin three of her new outfits. Stacy and Clinton then commented on how her new look flatters her body and generally improves her appearance. The last segment featured a party in the participants' hometown, where she would show off her new look to friends and family, who would comment on how impressed they were and how happy she looked. With the credits rolling, the participant was shown in additional wardrobe items and commented on what the experience did for her emotionally and how it improved her confidence.

Ending TLC aired the last episodes of What Not to Wear in Fall 2013. TLC general manager Amy Winter stated, \\"After 10 incredible seasons, we felt that it was the right time to end the series.\\" Stacy London said, \\"This show changed me and the trajectory of my life... I've learned so much from all of our contributors [participants] over the years. I hope we touched them as much as they touched me. I hope we touched our viewers... I will always cherish the time I spent on 'WNTW' and be eternally grateful to TLC for a great co-host, amazing crew and an awesome program.\\" Clinton Kelly said, \\"When I got the job, I told everyone I knew that we‚Äôd probably do 10 episodes, get canceled and I‚Äôd go crawling back to my old job in magazine publishing. So, I‚Äôm more surprised than anyone that we‚Äôve lasted this long. At first I thought the essence of the show was making snarky remarks about people‚Äôs outfits, but as it turns out, 'WNTW' is about taking stock of who you are and communicating that non-verbally to the rest of the world. That‚Äôs incredibly empowering.\\" In a two-hour series finale, the hosts take a road trip to The Venetian Las Vegas to attend an end-of-the-show party. Along the way from New York to Las Vegas, they visit past contributors and reminisce on the road. The song played on the road entitled \\"World Out There\\" was written and performed by Andy Gruhin. Once they hit Vegas, Stacy and Clinton find one last makeover candidate wandering the hotel which results in their final makeover ever. It all leads up to a finale party, where more than 100 past contributors from the past 10 seasons bid farewell to Stacy, Clinton, Ted, and Carmindy. Revival On April 10, 2019, it was announced that the series will be revived and premiere in 2020 on TLC.

About  In order to improve the optimisation of the valve timing for differing engine speeds and loads, the system is able to vary the timing and duration of the inlet valve opening. It achieves this by using a complex and finely machined mechanism to drive the inlet camshafts. This mechanism can accelerate and decelerate the rotational speed of the camshaft during different parts of its cycle. e.g. to produce longer opening duration, it slows the rotation during the valve open part of the cycle and speeds it up during the valve closed period. The system has the advantage that it is continuously variable rather than switching in at a set speed. Its disadvantage is the complexity of the system and corresponding price. Other systems will achieve similar results with less cost and simpler design (electronic control). For a more detailed description, see the sandsmuseum link below.

A joust. *Ace : A serve which lands in the opponent's court without being touched, or is touched, but unable to be kept in play by one or more receiving team players. *Assist : Usually the second of a team's three contacts, an assist is awarded for any set ball that results in a kill on the ensuing attack. *Attack : Usually the third of a team's three contacts, an attack is any attempt by the offense to score a point against the defense (this does not include free balls or over-passes). *Stack Blocking : A blocking strategy where the front row players start close to each other at the center of the net, leaving space for swing blocking out to the pins. *Breakpoint : A point scored on the team's own serve. In the scoring system prior to 1999, these were the only scored points (except for sanction points). Even in the present scoring system, these are the points that really count, as the side outs cancel each other. *Cut / Cum shot : attack with an extreme angle (nearly parallel to the net). *Dig : A defensive contact following an opponent's attack resulting in a playable ball. *Double contact / Double : A fault in which a player contacts the ball with two body parts consecutively. *D.S. : The abbreviation for \\"defensive specialist\\", a position player similar to the libero who is skilled at back row defense. *Dump : A surprise attack usually executed by a front row setter to catch the defense off guard; many times executed with the left hand, sometimes with the right, aimed at the donut or area 4 on the court. *Five-One : Six-player offensive system where a single designated setter sets regardless of court position. The player is responsible for the second touch on every reception of serve, and ideally every defensive play. *Four Step Approach : The sequence of steps a hitter takes to meet a ball. Consisting of four steps. For right-handed hitters the sequence is: right, left, right, left. For Left-handed hitters: left, right, left, right. *Free ball / Chance ball : A ball that is passed over the net because an attack wasn't possible. *Free ball kill : A celebratory term when an easy pass is sent over the net and scores a point. *Four-Two : Six player offense where there are two designated setters and the front row setter sets. *Goofy : When a player jumps with wrong foot first (while attacking) (commonly known as goofy footed) *Illegal Block(er): When a back row player attempts to block an opponents offensive action by making contact with the ball above the plane of the net. *Joust : when the ball is falling directly on top of the net, two opposing players jump and push against the ball, trying to push it onto the other's side. *Let : a serve in which the ball hits the net on the side of the court served on, but still makes it over the net and onto the opposing side's floor, resulting in a point. This used to be a service error prior to 2001 *Kill : successful, legal, point-scoring play. It can be from a spike attack, tip or dump. *Mis-hit : A hit in which a player swings but does not contact the ball as intended, giving it a different speed, direction, and spin than the player intended. *On-Two : When the player making the second contact on the ball decides to play the ball over the net instead of setting up their teammate. Most often used in court volleyball by the setter, it is often called a \\"setter dump\\" or a \\"turn and burn\\", but on the beach it is colloquially referred to as an \\"on-two\\". *One-Two-Two Coverage : Attack coverage system where one player covers directly under the block, two players cover 1‚Äì3 meters away, and two players cover 4‚Äì5 meters away. *Opposite : The player which plays in the rotation opposite the setter and usually attacks from the right side. *Over pass : A mistake when the passers in serve receive accidentally send the ball over after the first contact. *Pancake : When a player digs the ball by extending a hand flat on the floor, palm facing down, letting the ball bounce off the back of the hand. *Pepper : A drill in which players hit a ball back and forth in a pass, set, spike, pass, set, spike, etc. pattern, without a net. *Perimeter defense : A defensive formation of back row players where players set up along the edges of the court to dig. Middle back is deep in the center and right while left-back shift back and towards the sidelines. This formation leaves a hole in the center of the court for the opposing team to score in. *Roll Shot : An offensive play that is slightly similar to a hit/spike. Unlike a hit/spike, rolls shots are performed by making contact underneath the ball and moving your arm in an upwards motion rather than making contact on top of the ball and swinging your arm downwards in a fast motion. A roll shot is not a fast offensive hit aimed away from the net, nor a tip aimed near the net, but it is meant to go high enough to avoid a block, but not too far back. Roll shots are generally aimed around 10‚Äì15 feet away from the net or into deep corners. *Rotation Defense : A defensive formation of back row players where players \\"rotate\\" to cover a deep line shot. This formation closes the hole in the center of the court, but leaves space over the block in middle back for opposing attackers. *Seam : When serving, the area between passers on serve receive; when attacking, the area between blockers or back row defenders. *Set : The setter, located in the center or right front, hits the ball high above the net so that a spiker can spike it across. The setter always takes the second hit, if possible. *Shank : When a player unintentionally passes a ball in a wild manner, rendering it unplayable to their teammates. *Shot : An offensive play in which a set ball, rather than being spiked hard, is directed to an open area of the court. *Side out : When the team that served the ball loses the rally, causing the other team to serve the next point. In the scoring system prior to 1999, the side out scored zero points. *Six-Two : Six player offense where there are two designated setters and the back row setter sets. Called six-two because there are two setters and six other players (two outsides, two middle hitters, and two right-side hitters) *Six-back : Defensive system where the player in \\"six\\" (the middle position in the back-court) plays deep in the court covering attacks through the seam in the block, attacks over top of the block, and attacks that go high off the block. With certain blocking schemes, the player in \\"six\\" might also be responsible for deep line roll shots. *Six-up : Defensive system where the player in \\"six\\" (the middle position in the back- court) plays up behind the block with the responsibility of defending against a tip attack. *Six-zero : Six player offense where there are no designated positions. Instead, the designated setter is just the player in position 3 (or sometimes 2). *Spike (a.k.a. Hit) : When an offensive player attacks the ball with a one-arm motion done over the head, attempting to get a kill. *Spatch : When a player contacts the ball incorrectly during a hit causing the ball to propel unlike how the hitter intended. *Spread Block : A blocking strategy where front row players set up \\"spread\\" across the net, both the right-side and the outside start near the pins. *Strong side : The left side of the court, so called because it is usually the easier side for right-handed players to attack from. Also referred to as the \\"on-hand\\" side. *\\"The Gap\\" : A spike between area two and area three that the middle hits. It‚Äôs always the same distance from the setter no matter where the setter is positioned on the set. *The \\"W\\" : A common serve receive formation at lower levels where 5 players prepare to pass with 1 designated setter. So named because from above, the 5 passers are assembled on the five points of a \\"W\\". Alternatively, possibly a Serve Screening formation by the serving team, also named for resembling a W. *Three across : A common passing formation in higher level play where three passers start in a line across the back row to receive a serve *Three Step Approach : The sequence of steps a hitter takes to meet a ball. Consisting of three steps. For right-handed hitters the sequence is: right, left, right. For Left-handed hitters: left, right, left. *Whiff - When a hitter swings for the ball and slightly grazes it with their middle and ring fingers. *Two-Three Coverage : Attack coverage system where two players cover 1‚Äì2 meters away from the block, and three players cover 2‚Äì4 meters away. *Weak Side : The right side of the court, so called because it is generally easier for right-handed players to attack from the left (\\"strong\\") side. Also known as the \\"off-hand\\" side. Types of sets There is no absolute standard for naming sets, so there can be several different names for any one type of set. *A : A back row set aimed at the left side quarter of the court [A|B||C|D]. Also could be a quick set to the middle. *B : A back row set aimed to the left side middle quarter of the court [A|B||C|D]. *Back-Two: A ball set relatively high and to the middle or to the right side hitter, directly behind the setter. *Back-One: A ball set relatively low (or quick) to the middle hitter or to the right side hitter, directly behind the setter. *Bick : Similar to the \\"Pipe\\", but set very low (the name comes from Back quick) *C : A back row set aimed to the right side middle quarter of the court [A|B||C|D]. *Chaos: An outside in which the middle runs a one, the outside comes for a two off the middle's shoulder, and the weak side runs around the back to hit an outside 3. *D : A back row set aimed at the right side quarter of the court [A|B||C|D]. *Five : Same as a four set, but to the weak side/opposite hitter. Also, a middle set higher than a two. *Four / Back : A high set to the strong side/outside hitter. *Go : A set to the outside hitter, higher than a shoot but lower and faster than a hut. *Hut / Loop : A lower set to the outsider hitter. Higher than a shoot. *Jones : A variation of \\"Chaos\\" where the middle runs a one, the outside comes for a \\"back 2,\\" and the weakside comes around to hit an \\"outside 3.\\" The setter may choose to set the ball to any of the three hitting options. This play is designed so that the setter is able to accommodate the set according to where the block is positioned. *One / Quick / Fifty-One : A type of middle hit when the middle jumps before the setter sets, with the ball being set directly to the middle hitter's hand. *Pipe : A back row set aimed at the middle of the court between a B and a C-ball [A|B|^|C|D]. *Shocker: An attack in which the middle runs a one, the opposite comes for a two off the middle's shoulder, and the outside runs/slides around to hit a back-two. *Shoot : A variation on the quick set except instead of setting the ball to the middle the ball is set to the outside hitter. *Step / Slide : An attack where the hitter fakes a quick-set (one) approach with their first step and subsequently chases the ball behind the setter and parallel to the net, jumps off one foot, and hits the ball close to the antenna on the weak side. *Ten : A ball set for a back row attack. *Three / Thirty-Three : A quick lower set to the outside. *Thirty-Two: An attack where the hitter fakes a quick-set (one) approach with their first step and subsequently chases the ball in front of the setter and parallel to the net, jumps off one foot, and hits the ball in the outside 3 position. Generally used as adapted version of the Slide for left-handed hitters. *Tool : An offensive attack when a hitter hits off the blocker's hands and the ball goes down on the opposing team's side to earn a point. *Two : A ball set to the middle hitter at approximately two feet above the top of the net. Also, a \\"back two\\" is the same set set behind the setter. *Cross (X) : A play in which the middle hitter jumps for a one, and the weak- side hitter, having moved to the middle of the court, takes an approach for a two at the same location. *Thirty-One / Inside Shoot : A play in which the middle hitter runs a one ball about half way in between the middle and outside. *Stack / Tandem : Similar to the \\"cross\\" but the outside hitter hits the two ball. *Thirty Stack : A play in which the middle hitter runs a thirty- one and the outside hitter runs a thirty-two. *Shaft : A deep pipe set, generally set high. *Middle-finger Ball : When the libero takes an approach and jumps as if to hit a one ball, making as much noise as possible to distract the other team. This will hopefully cause blockers to jump with the libero, despite there being no threat of attack. Usually used by a team winning by a significant margin. While there is no absolute standard, the most common set naming system is a two number system where the first number corresponds to a zone on the net, and the second number corresponds to the height of the set at its apex above the top of the net in feet. Zones are named 1 through 9 from left to right along the net with the setter occupying Zone 6; and the most common set heights are 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 (represented by a 0 in the notation). For example, a 10 set is a high ball to the left side, a 53 is a 3 foot high set to the middle of the court (in front of the setter), and a 61 is a 1 foot high set right behind the setter. Methods of contacting the ball A player \\"tips\\" the ball over. *Beach dig : A dig made using both hands and fingers to surround the ball, squeeze and actually slightly lift the ball.

Their current line-up consists of vocalist Veronica Freeman, guitarist Pete Wells, bassist Aric Avina, and drummer Rikard Stjernquist. Since their formation the band released three studio albums, debuting with Uncreation in 2006, followed by Seasons of Tragedy in 2008, both through Madrid, Spain-based label Locomotive Music, before signing with Italian label Frontiers Records for their third album, Dominion, issued in 2011. Their fourth album Obey was released on Frontiers Records in Europe on November 29, 2013 and in the U.S. on December 3, 2013. History Band formation Benedictum was formed originally as Bound by vocalist Veronica Freeman and guitarist Pete Wells in San Diego, California in 2005. The two founding members had been in the band known as Malady for over ten years. Freeman and Wells recruited drummer Blackie Sanchez and keyboardist Chris Morgan, whom Freeman had played with in the Dio tribute band Evilution. Freeman's acquaintance with Dio's guitarist Craig Goldy, brought the band to meet the former Dio and Dokken bass player Jeff Pilson, who produced their first three-track demo and contributed playing bass guitar. In late 2005, they signed a record deal with the Spanish label Locomotive Records. History After signing with Locomotive Records, Benedictum entered in the studio to record their debut album with production by Jeff Pilson and mixing by Pilson and former Warlock member Tommy Henriksen. The band recorded eleven songs including the covers of Black Sabbath‚Ä≤s songs \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"The Mob Rules\\", songs the group members had played for years in tribute bands. Both the former Rainbow and Dio member Jimmy Bain and Craig Goldy played as guests on the album. Uncreation was initially due to be released on October 17, 2005, but was delayed to January 20, 2006, according with statement of vocalist Veronica Freeman: Garnering strong reviews for Uncreation, including a \\"bands to watch in 2006\\" pick by the British magazine Classic Rock, the band toured Europe for the first time in the summer of that same year, kicking things off at Italy's massive Gods of Metal festival near Milan. Benedictum also landed a slot on the Winter 2006 Doro European tour. Their 2008 sophomore release, Seasons of Tragedy, saw the group continue their close working relationship with mentor/producer Jeff Pilson who brought in former Dokken bandmate George Lynch to contribute guest guitar solos on \\"Bare Bones\\" and a cover of the Accept classic \\"Balls to the Wall\\". Long-time friend, guitarist Craig Goldy, also made an appearance on the album. The band supported the album in Europe with several festival shows and completed a fall tour with NWOBHM veterans Girlschool. With regard to Seasons of Tragedy, Allmusic reviewer Stewart Mason stated that \\"Singer Veronica Freeman has a powerful, hectoring voice, similar at times to Grace Slick's potent bellow from the Jefferson Starship days, and keyboardist Chris Morgan prefers to add subtle coloration and powerful drone parts rather than lame Keith Emerson-style twiddling.\\" Prior to commencing work on their third album, Dominion, the band underwent significant line-up changes with only core members Veronica Freeman and Pete Wells remaining. Benedictum would also leave their original record company, Locomotive Music, and sign a new deal with Frontiers Records. Due to Jeff Pilson's commitments with Foreigner, main producing duties for the new album were handled by Grammy Award winning engineer/producer, Ryan Greene, whose credits include Megadeth and NOFX. Pilson and Craig Goldy would make guest appearances on the album as did legendary bassist Rudy Sarzo on the song \\"Bang\\". Continuing the tradition of covering at least one classic track on each album, the band cut \\"Overture\\" / \\"The Temples of Syrinx\\" / \\"Grand Finale\\" off of 2112 by Rush, which is featured as a bonus track. New members Rikard Stjernquist (ex-Jag Panzer) on drums and Aric Avina on bass were recruited in 2012 to record their latest album Obey, released in November 2013.

He died heroically during the unsuccessful first attack on the Confederate fortifications during the Siege of Port Hudson, Louisiana. Accounts of his heroism were widely reported in the press, and became a rallying cry for the recruitment of African Americans into the Union Army. His reputation as a patriot and martyr long outlived him. In an 1890 collection of interviews, Civil War veteran Colonel Douglass Wilson said, \\"If ever patriotic heroism deserved to be honored in stately marble or in brass that of Captain Caillioux deserves to be, and the American people will have never redeemed their gratitude to genuine patriotism until that debt is paid.\\" Early life Born a mixed-race slave in Louisiana in 1825, Cailloux lived his entire life in and around New Orleans. As a young man, Cailloux had been apprenticed in the cigar-making trade. He was owned by members of the Duvernay family until 1846. His petition at age 21 for manumission was supported by his master and was granted by an all-white police jury in the city of New Orleans. There was an established community of free people of color in New Orleans, who were descended from both European and African Creoles (born in North America). This group became established during the French colonial years and enjoyed some rights as a third class between the white colonists and the majority of enslaved Africans. In New Orleans culture under the pla√ßage system, white men took women of color as common-law wives. Sometimes they acknowledged their mixed-race children and paid for their education, especially of sons, or arranged apprenticeships for adult skills. Sometimes they settled property on them. In 1847, Cailloux married F√©licie Coulon, a free Creole of color. Although born into slavery, she had been freed by her mother paying her purchase price to her master. Cailloux and Coulon had four children born free, three of whom survived to adulthood. F√©licie's mother Feliciana had been an enslaved mulatto woman. for several years, after she had already borne F√©licie, she was held by and served as the common-law wife of her master Valentin Encalada, a white planter. F√©licie was Encalada's \\"property\\" as the child of her mother. (This was according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem in slave law.) Feliciana bought her daughter's freedom from Encalada in 1842. Life in freedom Upon gaining his freedom, Cailloux earned his living as a cigar maker. Prior to the beginning of the Civil War, he established his own cigar-making business. Though his financial circumstances were modest, Cailloux became recognized as a leader within the community of free people of color in New Orleans. An avid sportsman, Cailloux was admired as one of the best boxers in the city. He was also an active supporter of the Institute Catholique, a school for orphaned black children. It also taught the children of free people of color. After his manumission, Cailloux learned to read, probably with the assistance of the teachers at the Institute Catholique. He became fluent in both English and French. By 1860, Cailloux was a well-respected member of the 10,000 \\"free men of color\\" community in New Orleans. At the time, New Orleans was the largest city in the South, and the sixth-largest city in the United States, with a population of about 100,000. American Civil War  Confederate States Army  At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Cailloux was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Native Guard, a Confederate regiment organized to defend the city of New Orleans. Free men of color had participated in the local militia since the time of French colonial rule. He was one of the first black officers of any North American unit.Louisiana Fast Facts and Trivia The Native Guard was made up entirely of free men of color who resided in and around New Orleans. Through articles in local New Orleans' newspapers, approximately 1,500 free men of color volunteered for the regiment and petitioned the governor for inclusion in Louisiana's regular militia, which was approved. Under the command of a white officer, all the companies of the Confederate Native Guard were led by free men of color and all officers were elected by the all-volunteer force. The Confederate government of the state of Louisiana provided no allowance for uniforms or equipment. Cailloux took his responsibilities seriously. His unit was observed to be well drilled and well trained. The Confederate Native Guard were never called to active duty. When Union Admiral David Farragut captured the city of New Orleans in April 1862, the Confederate forces in and around New Orleans abandoned the city and moved north to Camp Moore. The 1st Native Guard disbanded at this time, formally, on the grounds of the U.S. Mint at the edge of the French Quarter.  Union Army  Union General Benjamin F. Butler, military commander of the Department of the Gulf, made his headquarters in New Orleans. In September 1862 he ordered the organizing of an all-black Union Army 1st Louisiana Native Guard regiment. Unlike the Confederate unit, this regiment had a mixture of free-men and former slaves and was formed as the direct result of General Butler's requests for reinforcements for The Army of the Gulf falling on deaf ears. In Butler's memoirs, and in the Record of the War of the Rebellion, he wrote to Secretary of War Stanton, \\"If you will not send me reinforcements, then I will call upon Africa to do so.\\" \\"The Free Men of Color Go to War\\", The New York Times, Opinionator blog; Retrieved on 2012-12-18. Andre Cailloux joined the 1st regiment, which was necessary as many of those serving only spoke French, and was commissioned as captain of Company E. His company was considered one of the best drilled in the Native Guard. Cailloux gradually earned the respect of Colonel Spencer Stafford, the white officer who commanded the regiment. When General Nathaniel P. Banks replaced Butler as Commander of the Department of the Gulf in December 1862, he brought with him an additional 30,000 troops, bringing the total troop strength under his command to 42,000. By this time, the all-black Native Guard had grown to three regiments, a mixture of free-men and former slaves. Although the line officers (lieutenants and captains) were black, including future Governor P. B. S. Pinchback, a Company Commander of the 2nd Regiment, the commanding officers (colonels, lieutenant colonels, and majors) were white. Banks despised the black officers and considered them an insult to the U.S. Army. He set out to replace all black officers with white ones, and generally accomplished this with the 2nd and 3rd Regiments, but not with the 1st Regiment, in which Andre Cailloux served. Many members of the 1st Regiment had also been members of the Confederate 1st Native Guard, and Cailloux and the other officers were not willing to resign and leave them to the fate of the New England officers who were widely mistreating black soldiers under their command in the other two regiments. The 1st Regiment of the Native Guard was assigned primarily to fatigue duty (chopping wood, digging trenches) until May 1863, when Banks moved most of his army (35,000 men) into a position to surround the Confederate fortifications at Port Hudson, Louisiana. Port Hudson was a strategically located fort on a bend in the Mississippi River just north of Baton Rouge. At the time, the Confederacy still controlled the 200-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between Vicksburg, Mississippi, in the north and Port Hudson in the south. The Union wanted to gain control of Vicksburg, which had a strategic position on a bluff, in order to control the Mississippi. While General Ulysses Grant laid siege to Vicksburg, Banks conducted the siege of Port Hudson. Siege of Port Hudson A depiction of the last minutes of Andre Cailloux in battle. He is shown at the top of the image, looking back at his troops and with his sword raised. This portrayal places Cailloux and his men much closer to the Confederates than they were. From Frank Leslie's Journal, June 27, 1863. On May 27, 1863, Banks launched a poorly coordinated attack on the well-defended, well-fortified Confederate positions at Port Hudson. As part of the attack the first day, Cailloux was ordered to lead his company of 100 men in an almost suicidal assault against a high redoubt manned by two regiments of Confederate troops with heavy artillery support. Despite his company suffering heavy casualties, Cailloux, shouting encouragement to his men in French and English, led the charge of his entire regiment, a Mini√© ball tore through his arm, leaving it hanging useless at his side. Severely wounded, Cailloux continued to lead the charge until a Confederate artillery shell struck him, nearly tearing him in two and killing him. Despite stories to the contrary, there was only one charge made by the Native Guard on this most Northern set of works at Port Hudson. His actions were described in a rather fanciful fashion by Rodolphe Desdunes, whose brother, Aristide, served under Cailloux: > The eyes of the world were indeed on this American Spartacus [Cailloux]. The > hero of ancient Rome displayed no braver heroism than did this officer who > ran forward to his death with a smile on his lips and crying, \\"Let us go > forward, O comrades!\\" Six times he threw himself against the murderous > batteries of Port Hudson, and in each assault he repeated his urgent call, > \\"Let us go forward, for one more time!\\" Finally, falling under the mortal > blow, he gave his last order to his attending officer, \\"Bacchus, take > charge!\\" If anyone should say the knightly Bayard did better or more, > according to history, he lies.Desdunes, Rodolphe Lucien. Nos Hommes et Notre > Histoire. Montreal: Arbour & Dupont, 1911. as translated in Bell, Caryn > Coss√©, \\"Rappelez-vous concitoyens\\": The Poetry of Pierre-Aristide Desdunes, > Civil War Soldier, Romantic Literary Artist, and Civil Rights Activist, > University of Massachusetts Lowell Confederate General Gardner later asked for a truce along the northern front of the Port Hudson works so that the bodies of the slain members of the Native Guard could be recovered. General Banks responded that \\"I have no casualties in that area\\" and denied the request for a truce. As a result of this, Cailloux's decomposing body lay on the ground for 47 days until Port Hudson finally surrendered to Banks on July 9, 1863. Few of the dead were identified, but Andre Cailloux's body was identified by a ring he wore which was recognized by surviving members of his regiment. Most of the Union dead were buried in the area. This was later established as Port Hudson National Cemetery. In 1974 the cemetery was designated as a National Historic Landmark. Funeral Cailloux's remains were recovered and returned to New Orleans. The story of the captain's heroism had preceded this. When his funeral was held in the city on July 29, 1863, Cailloux was honored by a long procession and thousands of attendees. His widow Felicie had asked Father Claude Paschal Maistre to officiate. Born in France, he was the only Catholic priest in the diocese to support the abolition of slavery. Cailloux was buried in Saint Louis Cemetery. After Cailloux's death, his widow, F√©licie, struggled to receive the financial benefits promised to veterans by the United States Government. After several years of effort, she received a small pension, but she died in poverty in 1874. She was working at the time as a domestic servant for the Catholic priest who had preached the eulogy at her husband's funeral.

The mechanisms through which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those through which temperate cyclogenesis occurs. Tropical cyclogenesis involves the development of a warm-core cyclone, due to significant convection in a favorable atmospheric environment. Tropical cyclogenesis requires six main factors: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures (at least ), atmospheric instability, high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, enough Coriolis force to develop a low-pressure center, a pre- existing low-level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. Tropical cyclones tend to develop during the summer, but have been noted in nearly every month in most basins. Climate cycles such as ENSO and the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation modulate the timing and frequency of tropical cyclone development. There is a limit on tropical cyclone intensity which is strongly related to the water temperatures along its path. An average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide. Of those, 47 reach strength higher than 74 mph (119 km/h), and 20 become intense tropical cyclones (at least Category 3 intensity on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale). Requirements for tropical cyclone formation isotherm on October 1, 2006 There are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, enough Coriolis force to sustain a low pressure center, a preexisting low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. While these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation, they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form. Warm waters, instability, and mid-level moisture Waves in the trade winds in the Atlantic Ocean‚Äîareas of converging winds that move slowly along the same track as the prevailing wind‚Äîcreate instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes. Normally, an ocean temperature of 26.5 ¬∞C (79.7 ¬∞F) spanning through at least a 50-metre depth is considered the minimum to maintain a tropical cyclone. These warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems. This value is well above 16.1 ¬∞C (60.9 ¬∞F), the global average surface temperature of the oceans. Tropical cyclones are known to form even when normal conditions are not met. For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500 hPa level, or 5.9 km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures, as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection. In a moist atmosphere, this lapse rate is 6.5 ¬∞C/km, while in an atmosphere with less than 100% relative humidity, the required lapse rate is 9.8 ¬∞C/km. At the 500 hPa level, the air temperature averages ‚àí7 ¬∞C (18 ¬∞F) within the tropics, but air in the tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500 hPa in a tropical atmosphere of ‚àí13.2 ¬∞C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5 ¬∞C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1 ¬∞C in the sea surface temperature for each 1 ¬∞C change at 500 hpa. Under a cold cyclone, 500 hPa temperatures can fall as low as ‚àí30 ¬∞C, which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500 hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500 hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was ‚àí77 ¬∞C (‚àí105 ¬∞F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Role of Maximum Potential Intensity (MPI) Kerry Emanuel created a mathematical model around 1988 to compute the upper limit of tropical cyclone intensity based on sea surface temperature and atmospheric profiles from the latest global model runs. Emanuel's model is called the maximum potential intensity, or MPI. Maps created from this equation show regions where tropical storm and hurricane formation is possible, based upon the thermodynamics of the atmosphere at the time of the last model run. This does not take into account vertical wind shear. Schematic representation of flow around a low-pressure area (in this case, Hurricane Isabel) in the Northern hemisphere. The pressure gradient force is represented by blue arrows, the Coriolis acceleration (always perpendicular to the velocity) by red arrows Coriolis force A minimum distance of from the equator (about 4.5 degrees from the equator) is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis. The Coriolis force imparts rotation on the flow and arises as winds begin to flow in toward the lower pressure created by the pre-existing disturbance. In areas with a very small or non- existent Coriolis force (e.g. near the Equator), the only significant atmospheric forces in play are the pressure gradient force (the pressure difference that causes winds to blow from high to low pressure) and a smaller friction force; these two alone would not cause the large-scale rotation required for tropical cyclogenesis. The existence of a significant Coriolis force allows the developing vortex to achieve gradient wind balance. This is a balance condition found in mature tropical cyclones that allows latent heat to concentrate near the storm core; this results in the maintenance or intensification of the vortex if other development factors are neutral. Low level disturbance Whether it be a depression in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a tropical wave, a broad surface front, or an outflow boundary, a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis. Even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability, the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low. Tropical cyclones can form when smaller circulations within the Intertropical Convergence Zone merge. Weak vertical wind shear Vertical wind shear of less than 10 m/s (20 kt, 22 mph) between the surface and the tropopause is favored for tropical cyclone development. A weaker vertical shear makes the storm grow faster vertically into the air, which helps the storm develop and become stronger. If the vertical shear is too strong, the storm cannot rise to its full potential and its energy becomes spread out over too large of an area for the storm to strengthen. Strong wind shear can \\"blow\\" the tropical cyclone apart, as it displaces the mid-level warm core from the surface circulation and dries out the mid-levels of the troposphere, halting development. In smaller systems, the development of a significant mesoscale convective complex in a sheared environment can send out a large enough outflow boundary to destroy the surface cyclone. Moderate wind shear can lead to the initial development of the convective complex and surface low similar to the mid- latitudes, but it must relax to allow tropical cyclogenesis to continue.University of Illinois (October 4, 1999). Hurricanes. Retrieved 2008-08-17. Favorable trough interactions Limited vertical wind shear can be positive for tropical cyclone formation. When an upper-level trough or upper-level low is roughly the same scale as the tropical disturbance, the system can be steered by the upper level system into an area with better diffluence aloft, which can cause further development. Weaker upper cyclones are better candidates for a favorable interaction. There is evidence that weakly sheared tropical cyclones initially develop more rapidly than non- sheared tropical cyclones, although this comes at the cost of a peak in intensity with much weaker wind speeds and higher minimum pressure. This process is also known as baroclinic initiation of a tropical cyclone. Trailing upper cyclones and upper troughs can cause additional outflow channels and aid in the intensification process. Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone. There are cases where large, mid-latitude troughs can help with tropical cyclogenesis when an upper-level jet stream passes to the northwest of the developing system, which will aid divergence aloft and inflow at the surface, spinning up the cyclone. This type of interaction is more often associated with disturbances already in the process of recurvature. Times of formation Peaks of activity worldwide Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer when water temperatures are warmest. Each basin, however, has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active. In the North Atlantic, a distinct hurricane season occurs from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through October. The statistical peak of the North Atlantic hurricane season is September 10. The Northeast Pacific has a broader period of activity, but in a similar time frame to the Atlantic. The Northwest Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round, with a minimum in February and a peak in early September. In the North Indian basin, storms are most common from April to December, with peaks in May and November. In the Southern Hemisphere, tropical cyclone activity generally begins in early November and generally ends on April 30. Southern Hemisphere activity peaks in mid-February to early March. Virtually all the Southern Hemisphere activity is seen from the southern African coast eastward, toward South America. Tropical cyclones are rare events across the south Atlantic Ocean and the far southeastern Pacific Ocean. Unusual areas of formation Hurricane Pablo formed in the extreme northeastern Atlantic during the 2019 season. Middle latitudes Areas farther than 30 degrees from the equator (except in the vicinity of a warm current) are not normally conducive to tropical cyclone formation or strengthening, and areas more than 40 degrees from the equator are often very hostile to such development. The primary limiting factor is water temperatures, although higher shear at increasing latitudes is also a factor. These areas are sometimes frequented by cyclones moving poleward from tropical latitudes. On rare occasions, such as Pablo in 2019, Alex in 2004, Alberto in 1988, and the 1975 Pacific Northwest hurricane, storms may form or strengthen in this region. Typically, tropical cyclones will undergo extratropical transition after recurving polewards, and typically become fully extratropical after reaching 45‚Äì50Àö of latitude. The majority of extratropical cyclones tend to restrengthen after completing the transition period. Near the Equator Areas within approximately ten degrees latitude of the equator do not experience a significant Coriolis Force, a vital ingredient in tropical cyclone formation. However, a few tropical cyclones have been observed forming within five degrees of the equator. South Atlantic A combination of wind shear and a lack of tropical disturbances from the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) makes it very difficult for the South Atlantic to support tropical activity. At least 5 tropical cyclones have been observed here such as‚Äî a weak tropical storm in 1991 off the coast of Africa near Angola, Hurricane Catarina, which made landfall in Brazil in 2004 at Category 2 strength, a smaller storm in January 2004 located east of Salvador, Brazil, and Tropical Storm Iba in March 2019. The January storm is thought to have reached tropical storm intensity based on scatterometer wind measurements. Mediterranean and Black Seas Storms that appear similar to tropical cyclones in structure sometimes occur in the Mediterranean basin. Examples of these \\"Mediterranean tropical cyclones\\" formed in September 1947, September 1969, September 1973, August 1976, January 1982, September 1983, December 1984, December 1985, October 1994, January 1995, October 1996, September 1997, December 2005, September 2006, November 2011, November 2014, November 2017, September 2018 and September 2020. However, there is debate on whether these storms were tropical in nature. The Black Sea has, on occasion, produced or fueled storms that begin cyclonic rotation, and that appear to be similar to tropical-like cyclones observed in the Mediterranean. Two of these storms reached tropical storm and subtropical storm intensity in August 2002 and September 2005 respectively.https://www.essl.org/ECSS/2013/programme/presentations/166.pdf Elsewhere Tropical cyclogenesis is extremely rare in the far southeastern Pacific Ocean, due to the cold sea-surface temperatures generated by the Humboldt Current, and also due to unfavorable wind shear; as such, there are no records of a tropical cyclone impacting western South America. But in mid-2015, a rare subtropical cyclone was identified in early May relatively close to Chile. This system was unofficially dubbed Katie by researchers. Another subtropical cyclone was identified at 77.8 degrees longitude in May 2018, just off the coast of Chile. Vortices have been reported off the coast of Morocco in the past. However, it is debatable if they are truly tropical in character. Tropical activity is also extremely rare in the Great Lakes. However, a storm system that appeared similar to a subtropical or tropical cyclone formed in 1996 on Lake Huron. The system developed an eye-like structure in its center, and it may have briefly been a subtropical or tropical cyclone. Inland intensification Tropical cyclones typically began to weaken immediately following and sometimes even prior to landfall as they lose the sea fueled heat engine and friction slows the winds. However, under some circumstances, tropical or subtropical cyclones may maintain or even increase their intensity for several hours in what is known as the brown ocean effect. This is most likely to occur with warm moist soils or marshy areas, with warm ground temperatures and flat terrain, and when upper level support remains conducive. Influence of large-scale climate cycles Influence of ENSO Loop of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Tropical Pacific ENSO effects on hurricanes distribution. El Ni√±o (ENSO) shifts the region (warmer water, up and down welling at different locations, due to winds) in the Pacific and Atlantic where more storms form, resulting in nearly constant Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) values in any one basin. The El Ni√±o event typically decreases hurricane formation in the Atlantic, and far western Pacific and Australian regions, but instead increases the odds in the central North and South Pacific and particular in the western North Pacific typhoon region. Tropical cyclones in the northeastern Pacific and north Atlantic basins are both generated in large part by tropical waves from the same wave train. In the Northwestern Pacific, El Ni√±o shifts the formation of tropical cyclones eastward. During El Ni√±o episodes, tropical cyclones tend to form in the eastern part of the basin, between 150¬∞E and the International Date Line (IDL). Coupled with an increase in activity in the North-Central Pacific (IDL to 140¬∞W) and the South-Central Pacific (east of 160¬∞E), there is a net increase in tropical cyclone development near the International Date Line on both sides of the equator. While there is no linear relationship between the strength of an El Ni√±o and tropical cyclone formation in the Northwestern Pacific, typhoons forming during El Ni√±o years tend to have a longer duration and higher intensities. Tropical cyclogenesis in the Northwestern Pacific is suppressed west of 150¬∞E in the year following an El Ni√±o event. Influence of the MJO 5-day running mean of MJO. Note how it moves eastward with time. In general, westerly wind increases associated with the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all basins. As the oscillation propagates from west to east, it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere's summer season. There is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific basin and the north Atlantic basin, however. When one basin is active, the other is normally quiet, and vice versa. The main cause appears to be the phase of the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation, or MJO, which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time. Influence of equatorial Rossby waves Research has shown that trapped equatorial Rossby wave packets can increase the likelihood of tropical cyclogenesis in the Pacific Ocean, as they increase the low-level westerly winds within that region, which then leads to greater low-level vorticity. The individual waves can move at approximately 1.8 m/s (4 mph) each, though the group tends to remain stationary. Seasonal forecasts Since 1984, Colorado State University has been issuing seasonal tropical cyclone forecasts for the north Atlantic basin, with results that are better than climatology. The university has found several statistical relationships for this basin that appear to allow long range prediction of the number of tropical cyclones. Since then, numerous others have followed in the university's steps, with some organizations issuing seasonal forecasts for the northwest Pacific and the Australian region. The predictors are related to regional oscillations in the global climate system: the Walker circulation which is related to the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation; the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO); the Arctic oscillation (AO); and the Pacific North American pattern (PNA).

It runs for , beginning north of Blair in Greer County, and proceeding north to Butler in Custer County. It is not to be confused with Interstate 44. The highway has one lettered spur route, SH-44A. SH-44 was established on April 14, 1932. Initially, the route consisted of three disconnected segments of highway; the southern segment corresponded with present-day SH-6 southwest of Altus, the central segment extended from the current southern terminus of the route to what is now known as Dill City, and the northern segment began west of Custer City and extended north to Medford. The northernmost section was redesignated as several other highways, primarily SH-58. The other two segments of highway were connected in 1962, and the current termini were established in 1987. Route description SH-44 begins in the Quartz Mountains of southwest Oklahoma. State Highway 44 begins at an intersection with the Great Plains Trail of Oklahoma in the Quartz Mountains, just northwest of Byrd Mountain in Greer County. From the terminus, SH-44 heads northeast, crossing the North Fork of the Red River into Kiowa County. Just after crossing the river, the highway spawns its only spur route, SH-44A. The road continues through the Quartz Mountains, passing in between Williams Peak and King Mountain. The route then follows the south shore of Lake Altus- Lugert, passing between the lakeshore and Mount Lugert. As SH-44 leaves the mountains, it passes through the unincorporated place of Lugert, from which both the lake and the mountain get their name. The highway then heads north- northwest until it reaches SH-9 on the east side of Lone Wolf. It follows SH-9 to the east before splitting off along a due north course. The highway curves northeast to cross Elm Creek, the turns back to the north just after crossing into Washita County. The first town that SH-44 encounters in Washita County is Sentinel, where it meets SH-55. The highway continues north, paralleling a railroad track, before crossing over it about north of Sentinel and resuming its due north course. West-northwest of Dill City, Oklahoma, SH-44 intersects SH-152. About north of this junction, SH-44 passes along the east side of Burns Flat. The next highway junction is an interchange with Interstate 40, at exit 53. After the interchange, SH-44 crosses Turkey Creek and runs through the small town of Foss. Just north of town, the highway passes into Custer County. In Custer County, Highway 44 meets up with SH-73. The two routes form a brief concurrency, splitting up when they reach Foss State Park. SH-44 hugs the east side of Foss Lake, then runs across its dam. Four miles (6.4 km) north of where it exits the park, SH-44 ends in Butler at State Highway 33. History The current iteration of State Highway 44 was first added to the Oklahoma State Highway system on April 14, 1932. The highway as originally designated was a split route; its southern section began at SH-34 in Eldorado, and proceeded northeast to end at US-62 west of Altus. Another section of SH-44 began at the route's current southern terminus and ended at SH-41 in Dill (present-day SH-152 in Dill City). A third section of highway began concurrent with SH-33 west of Custer City, and proceeded east through that town through Thomas. It then turned north on what is now SH-58 and followed what is now that highway's route to Cleo Springs. Thereafter, SH-44 began following SH-8. At Driftwood, SH-44 turned east on an independent alignment roughly corresponding to today's SH-11. The highway's northern terminus was US-81 in Medford, where SH-11 took over the alignment. In 1934, the section of highway between SH-33 and Canton was made part of US-270, and SH-44's northernmost section was truncated to Canton. At the same time, the section of road east of Driftwood became part of SH-11, so its northern terminus was truncated to US-60 in Fairview. On March 29, 1937, the majority of the northern section of route was transferred to SH-58. On December 14, 1942, SH-44 was extended north of Dill for the first time, bringing it to a southern terminus at US-66 south of Foss. SH-44 was first made a contiguous route at the beginning of the summer of 1962. On May 6, the two sections of SH-44 were joined by means of a concurrency with US-62 to Altus, where it turned north along US-283, which it followed to the present-day southern terminus. Around the same time, changes were brewing at the north end of the highway. SH-44 was extended north to Butler on September 4, 1963. At this time, SH-44 ran from SH-34 in Eldorado to Butler. The southernmost portion of SH-44 would soon undergo changes. On July 7, 1975, State Highway 6 was introduced over the portion of highway between Eldorado and the current southern terminus. On January 5, 1987, the portion of SH-44 made redundant by SH-6 was removed from the highway, truncating it to its current southern terminus. Junction list SH-44A State Highway 44's one lettered spur route is SH-44A. This route branches off from SH-44 in the Quartz Mountains and connects to the Quartz Mountains Conference Center and the southern end of Lake Altus-Lugert.

It involves a runaway thermonuclear process which spreads through the white dwarf in a matter of seconds, producing a Type Ia supernova which releases an immense amount of energy as the star is blown apart. The carbon detonation/deflagration process leads to a supernova by a different route than the better known Type II (core-collapse) supernova (the type II is caused by the cataclysmic explosion of the outer layers of a massive star as its core implodes). A white dwarf is the remnant of a small to medium size star (our sun is an example of these). At the end of its life, the star has burned its hydrogen and helium fuel, and thermonuclear fusion processes cease. The star does not have enough mass to either burn much heavier elements, or to implode into a neutron star or type II supernova as a larger star can, from the force of its own gravity, so it gradually shrinks and becomes very dense as it cools, glowing white and then red, for a period many times longer than the present age of the Universe. Occasionally, a white dwarf gains mass from another source ‚Äì for example, a binary star companion that is close enough for the dwarf star to siphon sufficient amounts of matter onto itself; or a collision with other stars, the siphoned matter having been expelled during the process of the companion's own late stage stellar evolution. If the white dwarf gains enough matter, its internal pressure and temperature will rise enough for carbon to begin fusing in its core. Carbon detonation generally occurs at the point when the accreted matter pushes the white dwarf's mass close to the Chandrasekhar limit of roughly 1.4 solar masses. This is the mass at which gravity can overcome the electron degeneracy pressure which had prevented the star from collapsing during its lifetime. The same also happens when two white dwarfs merge and the mass of the body formed is below the Chandrasekhar limit; if two white dwarves merge and the result is over the limit, a Type Ia supernova will occur. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure would expand and cool which automatically counterbalances an increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; the white dwarf is unable to regulate the fusion process in the manner of normal stars, so it is vulnerable to a runaway fusion reaction. In the case of a white dwarf, the restarted fusion reactions releases heat, but the outward pressure that exists in the star and supports it against further collapse is initially due almost entirely to degeneracy pressure, not fusion processes or heat. Therefore, even when fusion recommences the outward pressure that is key to the star's thermal balance does not increase much. One result is that the star does not expand much to balance its fusion and heat processes with gravity and electron pressure, as it did when burning hydrogen (until too late). This increase of heat production without a means of cooling by expansion raises the internal temperature dramatically, and therefore the rate of fusion also increases extremely fast as well, a form of positive feedback known as thermal runaway. A 2004 analysis of such a process states that: The flame accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instability and interactions with turbulence. The resumption of fusion spreads outward in a series of uneven, expanding \\"bubbles\\" in accordance with Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instability.http://www.jinaweb.org/docs/nuggets/truran-3-1.pdf#search=%22type%20Ia%20supernova%20simulation%22 Within the fusion area, the increase in heat with unchanged volume results in an exponentially rapid increase in the rate of fusion ‚Äì a sort of supercritical event as thermal pressure increases boundlessly. As hydrostatic equilibrium is not possible in this situation, a \\"thermonuclear flame\\" is triggered and an explosive eruption through the dwarf star's surface that completely disrupts it, seen as a Ia supernova. Regardless of the exact details of this nuclear fusion, it is generally accepted that a substantial fraction of the carbon and oxygen in the white dwarf is converted into heavier elements within a period of only a few seconds, raising the internal temperature to billions of degrees. This energy release from thermonuclear fusion (1‚Äì ) is more than enough to unbind the star; that is, the individual particles making up the white dwarf gain enough kinetic energy to fly apart from each other. The star explodes violently and releases a shock wave in which matter is typically ejected at speeds on the order of 5,000‚Äì, roughly 6% of the speed of light. The energy released in the explosion also causes an extreme increase in luminosity. The typical visual absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae is Mv = ‚àí19.3 (about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun), with little variation. This process, of a volume supported by electron degeneracy pressure instead of thermal pressure gradually reaching conditions capable of igniting runaway fusion, is also found in a less dramatic form in a helium flash in the core of a sufficiently massive red giant star.

It is known for reporting that reveals inequities, abuse and corruption, and holds those responsible accountable. In 2010, CIR launched its California Watch reporting project; in 2012, it merged with The Bay Citizen. In 2013, it launched an hour-long public radio program and podcast, Reveal, that airs on 470 public radio stations. The budget for the CIR was approximately $9.3 million in 2016. The current business model emphasizes cooperation with partners and other news outlets rather than competition. Phil Bronstein is the organization's executive chair. History Beginnings David Weir, Dan Noyes, and Lowell Bergman founded the Center for Investigative Reporting in 1977. Its offices were located in downtown Oakland, California. This was the first nonprofit news organization in the United States to be focused on investigative reporting. The Center's first large investigation exposed the criminal activity of the Black Panther Party. The organization revisited this subject in 2012. 1980s In 1982, reporters from the Center worked with Mother Jones magazine to report testing fraud in consumer products. The investigation won several awards, including Sigma Delta Chi and Investigative Reporters and Editors awards. CIR began producing television documentaries in 1980. It has since produced more than 30 documentaries for Frontline and Frontline/World, dozens of reports for other television outlets, and three independent feature documentaries. ABC‚Äôs 20/20 and CBS‚Äôs 60 Minutes have featured reporting from CIR. Major investigations in the 1980s resulted in reporting of the toxicity of ordinary consumer products, an expos√© of nuclear accidents in the world's navies, and coverage of questionable tactics by the FBI during the administration of President Ronald Reagan. 1990s In 1990, CIR produced its first independent TV documentary, Global Dumping Ground, reported by Bill Moyers on PBS‚Äôs Frontline. The film spurred federal investigations and was rebroadcast in at least 18 nations. In 1992, CIR produced The Best Campaign Money Can Buy for Frontline, an investigation of the top funders of that year's presidential campaign. It featured correspondent Robert Krulwich, and was produced by Stephen Talbot with reporters Eve Pell and Dan Noyes. The documentary won a DuPont/Columbia Journalism Award. Other notable CIR reports included an investigation of General Motors, one on the rise of conservative media figure Rush Limbaugh and another on Congressman Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia), as well as a study of education and race in an urban high school, School Colors. An investigation for the New York Daily News and FOX's Front Page revealed lethal dangers in a common diet drug.  2000‚Äìpresent  In 2005, the Center's investigations into wiretapping and data mining stimulated Congressional hearings on privacy issues. The Center also exposed the forensic practices of the FBI that resulted in wrongful convictions and imprisonments. Robert J. Rosenthal became executive director of the Center in 2007. He had more than thirty years of experience as a journalist and editor at the San Francisco Chronicle, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Boston Globe, and The New York Times. Rosenthal hired Mark Katches as the editorial director of the start-up news organization called California Watch in 2009. Katches would later be named editorial director for all of CIR, a position he held until 2014, when he left to become the editor and vice president of content at The Oregonian, in Portland Oregon. In 2010, the Center released the documentary film, Dirty Business. It explored problems with the myth of clean coal and the extensive lobbying tactics of the coal industry. The organization's reports have been published in news outlets around the country and in California including NPR News, PBS Frontline, PBS NEWSHOUR, Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, The Sacramento Bee, The Daily Beast, Salon, Al Jazeera English, and American Public Media's Marketplace. In April 2012, it partnered with Google to host TechRaking, an informal conference that brought together journalists and technologists. In September 2012, the second TechRaking brought together journalists and gamers, at IGN in San Francisco. CIR announced a partnership with Univision News in 2012 to bring investigative stories to Hispanic households in the United States. Amy Pyle became Editor in Chief in 2015 after two decades of award-winning journalism. She had worked at The Sacramento Bee, where she was Assistant Managing Editor/Projects and Investigations, and the Los Angeles Times, where she led coverage of the Northridge Earthquake from the newspaper's parking lot of the quake-damaged San Fernando Valley office. In February 2019, Matt Thompson was announced as the new Editor In Chief. Thompson was formerly the executive editor of The Atlantic. He oversaw major editorial projects and new initiatives, such as the launch of the magazine's podcasting unit, membership strategy, and talent development teams. During his time as deputy editor of TheAtlantic.com, he helped lead the magazine's digital team through three record-breaking years of audience growth. Prior to The Atlantic, he was director of vertical initiatives for NPR, where he created several broadcast and digital journalism teams, including Code Switch and NPR Ed. He is a former board member of the Center for Public Integrity, where he served for eight years. Merger with The Bay Citizen In April 2012 CIR merged with The Bay Citizen, a nonprofit, investigative news group based in San Francisco. California Watch In 2009, the Center for Investigative Reporting created California Watch, a reporting team dedicated to state-focused stories. Its website launched in 2010. Editorial Director Mark Katches said that the site would act as a watchdog team focusing on government oversight, criminal justice, education, health, and the environment. In 2010, the Online News Association honored California Watch with a general excellence award. In 2012, California Watch won the George Polk Award for its series on Medicare billing fraud. The authors of the series were Christina Jewett, Lance Williams and Stephen Doig. California Watch also was a Pulitzer finalist for its On Shaky Ground series by Corey G. Johnson, Erica Perez, Kendall Taggart and Agustin Armendariz. The series detailed flaws in state oversight of seismic safety at K-12 schools. The On Shaky Ground reporting team won a Scripps Howard National Journalism Award for Public Service. California Watch won a second Polk award in 2012, this time for Ryan Gabrielson's series about the failures of a unique police force to solve crimes committed against the developmentally disabled living in state board- and-care hospitals. The series also won an Online Journalism Award from the Online News Association. I Files In August 2012, the Center for Investigative Reporting created \\"The I Files\\" channel on YouTube. The Knight Foundation provided an $800,000 grant to make the channel possible. The channel, renamed as Reveal, presents investigative videos produced by CIR and from a variety of news outlets, including The New York Times, BBC, Al Jazeera English, ABC News, National Public Radio, and member organizations of the Investigative News Network.  Reveal  Reveal uses multiple digital platforms to publish its information from its website. The radio program, which the website is named after, airs on 470 radio stations in the Public Radio Exchange network, and the show is also available in podcast form. The main website for Reveal contains links to each podcast episode, video, and multimedia story shared by the outlet. Each video is also available on their YouTube channel, and all the podcasts can be subscribed to via the usual podcast outlets. Reveal is active on social media including Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus. The outlet also has a blog, Dig, where the staff posts about internal updates and how they created data-driven stories. All of CIR's digital reporting is now available on Reveal's website where the CIR shares podcasts, videos, and many data-driven investigative projects. Business model The Center for Investigative Reporting is a nonprofit; it relies strongly on foundation grants and individual donations to fund its efforts. In addition to publishing reports directly on its site, the Center produces content for a wide range of other news outlets, including local TV affiliates, newspapers, public radio, and PBS. More recently, the Center has invested in multimedia, particularly video, as a means of reaching larger audiences and producing a new revenue stream. In general the CIR accepts donations only from individuals or groups who are not affiliated with government officials or political parties.  Awards and recognition  In 2012, the Center for Investigative Reporting received the MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Leadership. The award is a monetary prize from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The Center received a prize of $1 million. Executive Director Robert Rosenthal explained that the money would go toward new forms of video distribution. The Center also plans to improve its technology and create a fund for future innovative projects. CIR stories have received numerous journalism awards, including the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver Baton, George Polk Award, Emmy Award, Scripps Howard Award, and numerous Investigative Reporters and Editors Awards. Additionally, it received a Peabody Award in 2013 for the Reveal show, \\"The VA's Opiate Overload\\".73rd Annual Peabody Awards, May 2014.

This strain of Flavobacterium sp. K172, became popularly known as nylon-eating bacteria, and the enzymes used to digest the man-made molecules became popularly known as nylonase. Discovery 6-aminohexanoic acid In 1975, a team of Japanese scientists discovered a strain of Flavobacterium, living in ponds containing waste water from a nylon factory, that could digest certain byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture, such as the linear dimer of 6-aminohexanoate. These substances are not known to have existed before the invention of nylon in 1935. Further study revealed that the three enzymes that the bacteria were using to digest the byproducts were significantly different from any other enzymes produced by any other bacteria, and not effective on any material other than the manmade nylon byproducts. Later research In November 1983 a publication by H Okada et al has shown that E-II (6-aminohexanoic acid linear oligomer hydrolase) has evolved by gene duplication followed by base substitution of another protein E-II'. Both enzymes have 345 identical aminoacids out of 392 aminoacids (88% homology). This discovery led geneticist Susumu Ohno to speculate (in a paper published in April 1984) that the gene for one of the enzymes, 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase, had come about from the combination of a gene-duplication event with a frameshift mutation. Ohno suggested as a likely cause the insertion of thymine. The original sequence was CGA GAA coding for arginine and glutamine at the 33rd and 34th positions respectively, which became CG ATG AA creating a new start codon new open reading frame (ORF) . This new ORF is translated to 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase, a 392 amino-acid length protein compared to 427 amino acids in the original protein. Ohno suggested that many unique new genes have evolved in this way. A 1995 paper showed that scientists have also been able to induce another species of bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to evolve the capability to break down the same nylon byproducts in a laboratory by forcing them to live in an environment with no other source of nutrients. The P. aeruginosa strain did not seem to use the same enzymes that had been utilized by the original Flavobacterium strain. A 2007 paper that described a series of studies by a team led by Seiji Negoro of the University of Hyogo, Japan, suggested that just two amino-acid alterations, i.e. G181D [ Gly181 (EII‚Ä≤-original enzyme ) to Asp (EII - new enzyme )] and H266N ( His 266 (EII‚Ä≤) to Asn (EII), confer the Ald-hydrolytic activity to nearly 85% of the parental EII enzyme. As described in a 1983 publication, other scientists were able to get the ability to generate the enzymes to transfer from the Flavobacterium strain to a strain of E. coli bacteria via a plasmid transfer. Role in evolution teaching There is scientific consensus that the capacity to synthesize nylonase most probably developed as a single-step mutation that survived because it improved the fitness of the bacteria possessing the mutation. More importantly, the enzyme involved was produced by a mutation completely randomizing the original gene. Despite this, the new gene still had a novel, albeit weak, catalytic capacity. This is seen as a good example of how mutations easily can provide the raw material for evolution by natural selection.Evolution and Information: The Nylon BugWhy scientists dismiss 'intelligent design', Ker Than, NBC News, September 23, 2005Miller, Kenneth R.

History Opened on 1 November 1864 and named after the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), its design is almost identical to Victoria Bridge which carries the Severn Valley Railway over the Severn between Upper Arley and Bewdley in Worcestershire. Designed by John Fowler, its span cast iron arch has four ribs, each of nine parts bolted together. The patterns for the radiused beam castings for the bridge were prepared by Thomas Parker at the Coalbrookdale Iron Company. Originally it was built to carry the Wenlock, Craven Arms and Lightmoor Extension Railway of the Wellington and Severn Junction Railway across the river. Until the closure of Ironbridge power station it carried coal traffic as part of the line between Lightmoor Junction and Ironbridge Power Station. The bridge's timber and wrought iron deck was replaced by a structural steel deck in 1933. It may be one of the last large cast iron railway bridges to have been built.Cragg, p.240 Due to its age and the condition of the ironwork, traffic over the bridge is restricted to a speed limit to minimise stress. Although it carries two tracks only the one on the downstream side is still in use. The bridge is a Grade II Listed Building, one half by Shropshire Council, the other by Telford and Wrekin District Council as the boundary is mid-span. Telford Steam Railway have aspirations to run trains over the bridge using the presently unused track as part of their southern extension to Buildwas.

The land had formerly been part of the U.S. Army's Camp Kilmer, a staging area during World War II. The army reserve continued using a small part of the original army campus until 2009. The Livingston College campus currently sits on 540-acres acquired by Rutgers in 1964. A large amount of parking was created on this campus, mainly because the Louis Brown Athletic Center served as the temporary home of the New Jersey Nets basketball team from 1977 to 1981. Student center facilities were initially located in Tillett Hall. The Livingston Student Center opened in 1986. The campus was renamed as Livingston Campus in 1991 following a student campaign. In fall 2007, Rutgers University consolidated several undergraduate liberal arts colleges in the New Brunswick-Piscataway area, including Livingston College, to a School of Arts and Sciences, but Livingston Campus continues to serve the Rutgers community. Campus revitalization In 2009, Livingston Campus installed a large swath of solar panels on its campus (mostly over large, open-air parking lots), one of the largest such groupings of solar panels in New Jersey. In 2010, the renovated and expanded Livingston Student Center was completed. In 2011, the campus opened the Livingston Dining Commons to replace Tillett Dining Hall. In 2012, the new Livingston Apartments opened. In 2012, The Plaza at Livingston, which contains the Livingston Apartments, a cinema, eateries, and stores, opened. Rutgers Business School, 100 Rockafeller Road In fall 2013, the new Rutgers Business School building opened at 100 Rockafeller Road, Piscataway, New Jersey. Also in 2013, Tillett Hall renovations finished. Roadways The campus has several generically named roads, such as \\"Road 1,\\" \\"Road 2,\\" and \\"Avenue E,\\" which date back to the campus's military days. Efforts to rename the roads have failed to date. Livingston Campus and adjacent Busch Campus received their own exits on Piscataway's Route 18 expressway, completed in 2005, expediting inter-campus bus travel to these and the College Avenue Campus and the Douglass-Cook Campus across the Raritan River in New Brunswick.

He succeeded to the titles of 6th Lord Kennedy and 4th Earl of Cassillis on 28 November 1558. He fought in the Battle of Langside on 13 May 1568, for the side of Mary, Queen of Scots. He married Margaret Lyon, daughter of John Lyon, 7th Lord Glamis; and became a Protestant after his marriage. They had two legitimate children. *John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis (1575‚Äì1615) *Hew Kennedy, Master of Cassilis (1576/77-1607) Cassilis was known as the \\"King of Carrick\\" for the feudal influence he possessed in that region. Cassilis died in 1576 after falling from his horse. Reputation According to Robert Pitcairn, an early historian of Clan Kennedy, Earl Gilbert was a ‚Äúwerry greidy manne and cairitt nocht how he gatt land sa that he culd cum be the samin.‚Äù During the era of the Protestant Reformation, Earl Gilbert desired the Abbey of Glenluce and entered into transactions with the abbot in an effort to hold the abbey by feudal tenure. However, before the transaction could be completed, the abbot died. Undeterred, Gilbert turned to a monk in the abbey, requesting him to ‚Äúcounterfeit‚Äù the abbot's handwriting to draw up a deed and to forge the signatures of all the members of the convent. This ruse succeeded, but, fearing the monk would reveal this deceit, he solicited a peasant ‚Äúto stik him.‚Äù That done, he began to fear that the peasant would reveal the crime and arranged with his uncle, Hugh of Bargany, to accuse the peasant of theft and have him hanged. \\"And sa the landis of Glenluse wes conqueist.\\"  Roasting of the Commendator  In 1565, he seized Allan Stewart, the Commendator of Crossraguel, and imprisoned him at Dunure Castle, seeking to obtain from him certain of the rights over the lands of Crossraguel Abbey. For two days he was left to consider his fate, when Stewart proved recalcitrant, Cassilis had him dragged to the Black Vault of Dunure, and roasted him alive over a fire until he was willing to subscribe to the charters the Earl had drawn up. Stewart was finally rescued by his brother-in- law, the Laird of Bargany, who captured Dunure and procured his deliverance. The rescue, however, occasioned a feud between the subsequent Earls of Cassilis and Lairds of Bargany.

During King Philip's War (1675‚Äì78) he distinguished himself as a battlefield commander and has been credited as one of the executioners of Canonchet. Later, he was the lead petitioner in a legal case that tested whether the Mohegan sachemate was a political equal to The Crown. Biography Oneco, the son of Uncas, served as war chief of the Mohegans during King Philip's War, distinguishing himself in battle. His service to the colonial cause during the war made him an important ally and he was given the right to sell his prisoners as slaves to New England settlers. In 1676, Oneco joined in the execution of Canonchet, the Narragansett commander who had led the defense of the great swamp fortress. After the Pequot leader Robin Cassacinamon shot Canonchet, Oneco beheaded him and then quartered his body. Canonchet's death at the hands of Oneco was notable as Canonchet's father, Miantonomoh, had been killed by Oneco's father, Uncas, in 1643. After Uncas' death, Oneco succeeded to the leadership of the Mohegans. He was, in turn, succeeded by his own son, Caesar. 1703 land claims case In 1703, the Mohegans found themselves in the midst of a property dispute with the Connecticut Colony. The colony claimed land traditional to the Mohegans on the basis of a 1699 sale executed by Oneco to the son of Nathaniel Foote. The legality of the sale, however, was questioned as Oneco had reportedly been intoxicated at the time it occurred. Samuel Mason, the son of John Mason, had succeeded his father as protector of the Mohegan lands ‚Äì an office into which he had originally been commissioned by the great sachem Uncas ‚Äì and organized an appeal to the Great and General Court of Connecticut, which was rebuffed. At Mason's urging, Oneco addressed a final appeal directly to Queen Anne in which he explained to her his divine right as sachem. With his authority originating directly from the gods, as opposed to the Crown, Oneco argued that the sachemate was a legal equal to the English monarchy. According to Oneco, his ancestors had been given a sacred pipe by the gods as a symbol of their authority and, as a testament to their friendship towards the English, now stored it in the same location as they kept a ceremonial sword given to them by Charles II of England. Oneco's argument was novel for describing a peer-to- peer relationship with the Crown and invoking the receipt of a diplomatic gift as proof of it. Oneco's letter was considered by the Board of Trade who referred the matter to the Attorney-General who, in a written opinion, determined Oneco's property claim had probable legal validity: A royal commission was thereafter convened, with Massachusetts Bay governor Joseph Dudley at its head, to inquire into the matter. In a protest, the Connecticut government rejected the right of the Crown to intervene in what it viewed as its internal affairs, refused to appear in front of the inquiry, and prohibited all citizens of Connecticut from giving testimony. Nonetheless, on August 24, 1705, the commission unanimously ruled in favor of the Mohegans and ordered the return of land between New London and Norwich to tribal control.

It was founded by L.W. St. John, (Ohio State University Athletic Director, 1912-1947). The golf club has two classical golf courses called Scarlet and Gray. The Scarlet was completed in 1938 and the Gray was finished later in 1940. The dedication ceremony was held on May 18, 1940, when Bob Kepler (golf coach from 1938-1965), Chick Evans, Blanche Sohl, and Patty Berg played 18 holes on the Scarlet course. Both the Scarlet and the much shorter Gray golf courses were designed by Dr. Alister MacKenzie, a world-renowned golf course architect. The Scarlet course is rated as one of the top collegiate courses in the nation. In 2005 and 2006 the Scarlet Course underwent a major restoration project overseen by former Buckeye legend Jack Nicklaus that was intended to restore play on the Scarlet course to the way that MacKenzie had envisioned it. In 1941, Ohio State made history when it hosted the first ever women's collegiate golf championship on the Scarlet course. In 1982, Ohio State hosted the final Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) Division I National Championship. In 1991, Ohio State hosted the NCAA Women's Championship, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the national tournament for women on the course on which it was conceived. The women's program later went on to host the 1997 and 2006 tournaments as well. The Scarlet Course has also played host to 10 men's National Championships.

In 2016, Pope began a new independent movie/transmedia project, SYNEMATIKA, by creating a \\"3-dimensional script\\" as a site-specific installation in a 2400-square foot industrial space in Kingston, NY. The creation of the script was done as a 30-day lockdown endurance art piece, after which it was opened to the public for viewing and photographed to become a graphic \\"shooting bible\\" for the eventual movie. Biography Born and raised in New York City, Pope is a self-taught filmmaker. He claims an eclectic collection of life experiences that fuel his creative work: a childhood of dyslexia and truancy and a widely varied career track as bike messenger, house painter and phone sex operator have proven to be the training ground for his film making. He made his first films on Super8 when he was 7 years old.

It was affiliated with NEFAC and shared some members with the Atlanta group of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) . One of its members is an octogenarian and was a fighter in the anarchist Durruti Column during the Spanish Civil War. The group engages in various political activities including pamphleting, demonstrating against groups such as The 21st Century Paul Revere Ride and Hammerskins, and building community ties and awareness.  Birth  It was the idea of a few Atlanta attendees of the Million Worker March in 2004 to create an anarchist collective in Atlanta, and early in 2005, a few locals began holding study groups on anarchism and political theory. Apart from the study groups, the collective began organizing to promote the idea of a Southeast anarchist-communist federation, much like that of NEFAC, or FAI of Iberia. In April 2005, with the intent of further spreading their desire to form a Southeastern anarchist-communist federation, members of CTC attended the 2nd annual Southeast Anarchist Network (SEANET) gathering in Charleston, SC. Capital Terminus held a workshop in the idea, and proposed it to the assembly, however, most of the attendees were not necessarily convinced of the idea. The collective continued however to spread the idea as best they could to parts of the Southeast.  July 2005 Conference  In July 2005, the CTC held the conference that was meant to establish a Southeastern anarchist- communist federation. Attending were people from North Georgia, Atlanta, and Athens, GA, as well as observers from the Northwestern Anarchist Federation (NAF) and participants from the labor union UNITE-HERE. At the beginning of the conference, it was clear that a federation was a goal that was too long term, and the conference became a \\"second formation\\" of the collective. The collective membership boosted to at least two-dozen, and potential for an effective organization was realized, and CTC was re-organized into three working groups. Two working groups were to focus on issues sorted out and elected by the assembly, which were Self-defense/Women's rights and the other Counter-recruitment/Anti-militarism. The third working group was for constant production of the newsletter, Anarchist Atlanta, and production and maintenance of a website. Coordinators were elected for each working groups and each acted autonomously within the whole. Prior to the Conference, the offices of Secretary and Treasurer had not been re-elected because of the short lived life so far, and the two offices were reorganized and new people were elected.  Self Defense/Women's Rights  In the following months, the Women's rights working group would decide to create a women's self-defense class as well as produce small leaflets to distribute throughout the community. These were coined \\"info-bombs.\\" The classes fell through due to external complications and as to this date, the infobombs are still being produced.  Counter-recruitment/Anti-militarism  At the beginning of the school-year, CTC met with Georgia Peace and Justice Coalition and adhered to their plan to flyer local football games with information concerning military enlistment, opt-out forms, and sign-up lists to receive more information. As the football season of that year ended, talk of doing the same thing at basketball games was discussed among the two groups, but nothing came of it. The GPJC continued with the efforts as CTC left the project.

The cast-iron arch bridge has four arch ribs each of nine parts bolted together. The arch elements were cast by the Coalbrookdale Company and the bridge was built by Thomas Brassey, Samuel Morton Peto and Edward Betts. Its design is almost identical to the Albert Edward Bridge which spans the Severn at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, both designed by John Fowler.Richard Morriss The Archaeology of Railways, 1999 Tempus Publishing, Stroud. p. 89. Opened for traffic on 31 January 1862, the railway line was closed to traffic in 1963. The bridge survived the threat of demolition and was then used by the Severn Valley Railway. In May 1974, heritage passenger services were re-introduced between Alveley Colliery and Bewdley over the Victoria Bridge. It was restored in 2004. The bridge has appeared in several films, including the 1978 film The Thirty-Nine Steps. Construction The Victoria Bridge was constructed to carry the Severn Valley Railway over the River Severn just south of Upper Arley. The line was a 64 km long running from Hartlebury in Worcestershire to Shrewsbury in Shropshire, passing through several towns including Stourport- on-Severn, Bridgnorth, and Ironbridge. The line was built between 1858 and 1862 and it was opened on 31 January 1862 and regular services commenced the following day.\\"Victoria Bridge, Upper Arley.\\" engineering-timelines.com, Retrieved: 1 June 2018. The bridge was designed by John Fowler, the chief engineer of the Severn Valley Railway. It is a single cast-iron segmental arch, considered to be quite large for the era, with a span of 61 metres and a 6.1-metre rise. The bridge arch has four ribs made up of nine H-section pieces bolted together; the ribs are cross-braced by tie bars with tensioning nuts and the spandrels are perforated by vertical slots. The weight of the ironwork has been estimated at about 500 tonnes. The ironwork was cast by the Coalbrookdale Company. The bridge abutments are made of rusticated sandstone ashlar, topped by plain parapets. Each abutment has a single 12-ring blue brick arch to provide river-side access. Along the west bank, the towpath is carried around the abutment on a walkway plinth that juts out into the river. On the east side the abutment wall drops straight to the river. The single track is carried on a ballasted timber deck even though the bridge is wide enough to accommodate double tracks. On 24 November 1859, the bridge's foundation stone was laid by Henry Orlando Bridgeman using a ceremonial silver trowel presented to him by the contractors.\\"Ceremonial trowel presented to Henry Orlando Bridgeman.\\" Science Museum, Retrieved: 18 June 2018. The contractors involved in the bridge's construction included Thomas Brassey, Samuel Morton Peto and Edward Betts. A time capsule was placed under the foundation stone. The glass jar contained silver and copper coins and a signed paper with details of the occasion. By early February 1861, the foundations were completed. The four cast iron ribs were put in place and on 10 May 1861, bridge was completed. Commemorative inscriptions were cast into the midspan of the arch ring on each face of the bridge. They read, \\"Victoria Bridge, 1861. John Fowler, Engineer\\" (central position) \\"Messrs. Brassey & Co., Contractors\\" (left position) and \\"Cast and erected by the Coalbrookdale Company\\" (right position). The Victoria Bridge was the longest single-span bridge made of cast iron in Britain when built. Its design was replicated by Fowler when he built the similar Albert Edward Bridge over the River Severn outside Coalbrookdale. Operational use 7802 Bradley Manor crossing Victoria Bridge. In the early 1950s, the bridge deck was relaid. Rail traffic on the line diminished during this period and the planned closure of the northern end of the Severn Valley Branch including Victoria Bridge was announced in 1962, pre-dating the Beeching report.Severn Valley Railway Memories, Christopher Magner (1997) pp. 25-26. On 9 September 1963, the Severn Valley line was closed to regular passenger services and most freight traffic but the southern portion was used by coal trains up to 1969 and limited passenger services; all such use ended during 1970. On 6 July 1965, the Severn Valley Railway Society was formed to preserve and restore as much as possible of the line. The new Severn Valley Railway Company was incorporated in May 1967 and set about acquiring as much of the line as its finances would allow. In May 1974, it succeeded in re- introducing passenger services between Alveley Colliery and Bewdley which involved crossing the Victoria Bridge. Between November 1979 and April 1980, a refurbishment programme was undertaken to safeguard the bridge and its capacity to support 21-tonne axle loading for running train services. Refurbishment cost of ¬£94,346 including the replacement of the transverse timber deck support beams with 54 steel beams. More than half of the iron platework was replaced with steel, 3,500 rivets were replaced with high tensile friction grip bolts and it was painted with 1,200 litres of paint. In March 1987, the bridge was given Grade II* listed building status. Because of its age, the bridge has required considerable investment to allow for train operations. In early 1994, about ¬£200,000 of repairs addressed cracks in the bridge's abutments and corrosion in the cast iron girders and cross bracing. To preserve the bridge a 15 mph speed limit is imposed upon all traffic and double-headed trains are no longer permitted. In early 2004, the bridge was closed for six weeks to install steel mesh material to form a new deck and a repaint. In April 2004, at the reopening ceremony the ribbon was cut by a local woman named Victoria Bridge.\\"Hunt for Vicky proves successful.\\" BBC News, 29 January 2004. Before restoration, the bridge deck made of secondhand timber sleepers was rotting away. Refurbishment cost ¬£320,000, a large proportion of which paid for scaffolding.

Usually these phenomena relate to experiences of some personal significance, such as a major life event, or the development of an important relationship. It has its theoretical origins in phenomenology and hermeneutics, and key ideas from Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty are often cited.Smith, J.A. (2007). Hermeneutics, human sciences and health: Linking theory and practice. International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-Being, 2, 3-11 IPA is one of several approaches to qualitative, phenomenological psychology. It is distinct from other approaches, in part, because of its combination of psychological, interpretative, and idiographic components.Gill, M. J. (2014). The Possibilities of Phenomenology for Organizational Research. Organizational Research Methods, 17:2, 118-137. Taking part Sometimes IPA studies involve a close examination of the experiences and meaning-making activities of only one participant. Most frequently they draw on the accounts of a small number of people (6 has been suggested as a good number, although anywhere between 3 and 15 participants for a group study can be acceptableReid, K., Flowers, P. & Larkin, M. (2005) Exploring lived experience: An introduction to Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The Psychologist, 18:1, 20-23.). In either case, participants are invited to take part precisely because they can offer the researcher some meaningful insight into the topic of the study; this is called purposive sampling [i.e. it is not randomised]. Usually, participants in an IPA study are expected to have certain experiences in common with one another: the small-scale nature of a basic IPA study shows how something is understood in a given context, and from a shared perspective, a method sometimes called homogeneous sampling. More advanced IPA study designs may draw together samples which offer multiple perspectives on a shared experience (husbands and wives, for example, or psychiatrists and patients); or they may collect accounts over a period of time, to develop a longitudinal analysis. Data collection In IPA, researchers gather qualitative data from research participants using techniques such as interview, diaries, or focus group. Typically, these are approached from a position of flexible and open- ended inquiry, and the interviewer adopts a stance which is curious and facilitative (rather than, say, challenging and interrogative). IPA usually requires personally-salient accounts of some richness and depth, and it requires that these accounts be captured in a way which permits the researcher to work with a detailed verbatim transcript. Data analysis Data collection does not set out to test hypotheses, and this stance is maintained in data analysis. The analyst reflects upon their own preconceptions about the data, and attempts to suspend these in order to focus on grasping the experiential world of the research participant. Transcripts are coded in considerable detail, with the focus shifting back and forth from the key claims of the participant, to the researcher's interpretation of the meaning of those claims. IPA's hermeneutic stance is one of inquiry and meaning-making,Larkin, M., Watts, S., Clifton, E. (2006). Giving voice and making sense in Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3:2, 102-120. and so the analyst attempts to make sense of the participant's attempts to make sense of their own experiences, thus creating a double hermeneutic. One might use IPA if one had a research question which aimed to understand what a given experience was like (phenomenology) and how someone made sense of it (interpretation). Analysis in IPA is said to be 'bottom-up.' This means that the researcher generates codes from the data, rather than using a pre-existing theory to identify codes that might be applied to the data. IPA studies do not test theories, then, but they are often relevant to the development of existing theories. One might use the findings of a study on the meaning of sexual intimacy to gay men in close relationships, for example, to re-examine the adequacy of theories which attempt to predict and explain safe sex practices.Flowers, P., Smith, J.A., Sheeran, P. and Beail, N. (1997). Health and romance: understanding unprotected sex in relationships between gay men. British Journal of Health Psychology, 2, 73-86. IPA encourages an open- ended dialogue between the researcher and the participants and may, therefore, lead us to see things in a new light. After transcribing the data, the researcher works closely and intensively with the text, annotating it closely ('coding') for insights into the participants' experience and perspective on their world. As the analysis develops, the researcher catalogues the emerging codes, and subsequently begins to look for patterns in the codes. These patterns are called 'themes'. Themes are recurring patterns of meaning (ideas, thoughts, feelings) throughout the text. Themes are likely to identify both something that matters to the participants (i.e. an object of concern, topic of some import) and also convey something of the meaning of that thing, for the participants. E.g. in a study of the experiences of young people learning to drive, we might find themes like 'Driving as a rite of passage' (where one key psychosocial understanding of the meaning of learning to drive, is that it marks a cultural threshold between adolescence and adulthood). Some themes will eventually be grouped under much broader themes called 'superordinate themes'. For example, 'Feeling anxious and overwhelmed during the first driving lessons' might be a superordinate category which captures a variety of patterns in participants' embodied, emotional and cognitive experiences of the early phases of learning to drive, where we might expect to find sub-themes relating to, say, 'Feeling nervous,' 'Worrying about losing control,' and 'Struggling to manage the complexities of the task.' The final set of themes are typically summarised and placed into a table or similar structure where evidence from the text is given to back up the themes produced by a quote from the text. The analysis In IPA, a good analysis is one which balances phenomenological description with insightful interpretation, and which anchors these interpretations in the participants' accounts. It is also likely to maintain an idiographic focus (so that particular variations are not lost), and to keep a close focus on meaning (rather than say, causal relations). A degree of transparency (contextual detail about the sample, a clear account of process, adequate commentary on the data, key points illustrated by verbatim quotes) is also crucial to estimating the plausibility and transferability of an IPA study. Engagement with credibility issues (such as cross-validation, cooperative inquiry, independent audit, or triangulation) is also likely to increase the reader's confidence. Applications of IPA Due to an increased interest in the constructed nature of certain aspects of illness (how we perceive bodily and mental symptoms), IPA has been particularly recommended for its uses in the field of health psychology.Smith, J.A. (1996)\\"Beyond the divide between cognition and discourse: Using interpretative phenomenological analysis in health psychology\\". Psychology & Health, 11(2), 261-271 However, while this subject-centered approach to experiencing illness is congruent with an increase in patient-centered research, it has also been suggested that IPA may have been historically most employed in health psychology due to the fact that many of its initial supporters operated careers in this field.Brocki J.J.M, Wearden A.J.

Biological signal amplifiers such as ECG (electrocardiogram) EEG (electroencephalogram) or EMG circuits measure very small electrical signals emitted by the body, often as small as several micro-volts (millionths of a volt). Unfortunately, the patient's body can also act as an antenna which picks up electromagnetic interference, especially 50/60 Hz noise from electrical power lines. This interference can obscure the biological signals, making them very hard to measure. Right leg driver circuitry is used to eliminate interference noise by actively cancelling the interference.

Of the many grease trails connecting the Coast with the Interior, it is the most notable and often is referred to as the Grease Trail. The trail was originally used by the Nuxalk and Carrier people for communication, transport and trade, in particular, trade in Eulachon grease from the Pacific coast. During his trek from Montreal to the Pacific Ocean in the late 18th century, Alexander MacKenzie was led by Nuxalk- Carrier guides, when natural obstacles in the Fraser River prevented his continued water route. Mackenzie's group \\"took the Parsnip River, crossed the continental divide, and eventually canoed down the Fraser River to Alexandria just south of Quesnel. On the advice of local First Nations people, who guided Mackenzie and his party to the Pacific Ocean, they gave up the river route for an overland one. The overland journey started just above the mouth of the Blackwater River at the West Road River west of Quesnel, taking them through the Upper Blackwater, along the Eliguk Lake and Gatcho Lake, through parts of what is now Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, over the Rainbow Mountains, into the Bella Coola Valley and \\"Friendly Village\\". The local people took the group down the Bella Coola River, over the salt water into the Dean Channel.\\" He reached the ocean on July 20, 1793, completing the first recorded transcontinental crossing north of Mexico. The route was designated as an official heritage trail by the Heritage Conservation Act in 1987. From east to west, the modern-day trail begins at the West Road River (Blackwater River) 53.269063 N,123.148917 W between Quesnel and Prince George, passes Kluskus Lake, Eliguk Lake, then crosses through what is now |Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, then follows the Bella Coola River to the North Bentinck Arm inlet. Because of its length and difficulty, experienced hikers can expect the route to take about 18 days, whereas intermediate hikers may require at least 24 days. Also, hikers may choose to hike only sections of the trail, such as the route through Tweedsmuir Provincial Park which passes the extinct Rainbow Range shield volcano. Only a few hiking or horse riding parties, plus a few ATVs or trucks, pass along the trail each year. The middle section of the trail passes within 5 km of Pan Phillips' Home Ranch, popularized by the books by Rich Hobson, Grass Beyond the Mountains, Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy, and The Rancher Takes a Wife, and the CBC television series based on the same books. The Home Ranch closed operations in the early 1970s, but the remains of the ranch are in good shape.

He served as Treasurer of Scotland. The son of Gilbert Kennedy, 2nd Earl of Cassilis, he succeeded to the titles of 5th Lord Kennedy and 3rd Earl of Cassillis in August 1527. On 6 February 1540/41 he had a charter of the Fief of Cassilis. As a young man, Kennedy studied at the University of St. Andrews and in Paris under the Scottish humanist George Buchanan for five years. In November, 1542, Kennedy, in his late twenties at the time, was taken prisoner at the Battle of Solway Moss, and after a short stint in the Tower of London, was placed under the care of Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury. Scottish historian Gilbert Burnet (1643-1715) believed that it was this relationship with Cranmer that led Kennedy toward Protestantism, as certainly he was one of the first of the Scottish nobility to adopt Reformed views. However, since his time with Cranmer lasted only one month, it is likely that his earlier contact with Buchanan had been a stronger influence in this regard. Sir Thomas Wharton, Warden of the English West March, wrote to the Privy Council of King Henry VIII, on the tenth of December 1542, regarding ransoms for prisoners taken at the battle, including the Earl of Cassilis, who was taken by Batill Routlege. Credit was also given to John Musgrave who \\"claimeth a part for the loan of his horse to the said Routlege.\\" Nicolson, Joseph.

Cassilis held the office of Treasurer of Scotland in 1554, of Extraordinary Lord of Session between 1546 and 1558. He fought in the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh on 10 September 1547. Cassilis borrowed money from Timothy Cagnioli, an Italian financier, for his expenses as a diplomat in France in 1558. The sum of ¬£6,720 Scots was not repaid in 1586, and Cagnioli claimed it from his grandson, John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585‚Äì1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 66. In 1558 he was present, as one of the eight Commissioners appointed by the Scottish Parliament, at the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the Dauphin of France, to whom the Scottish deputies unanimously refused the Crown matrimonial. The Court of France appeared deeply mortified by this disappointment, and the Earl of Cassilis, with two others of the Commissioners, dying in one night, on 28 November 1558, at Dieppe, a report was raised that they had been poisoned, which was further countenanced by the death of a fourth Commissioner, Lord Fleming, at Paris, on 16 December 1558. However, according to the Dictionary of National Biography, this report was untrue, as the actual dates of death of these persons were not the same, Cassilis dying in November. Henry II of France had appointed Gilbert as Gentleman in Ordinary of his Chamber on 4 May 1558, and this honour was transferred to his heir, Gilbert, 4th Earl of Cassilis on 10 February 1559.Historic account of the family of Kennedy, Ailsa, Cassilis, (1849), appendix, pp.1-6 Family In 1540 the Earl married Margaret Kennedy (d. 1580), a daughter of Thomas Kennedy of Bargany and widow of Hugh Wallace of Craigie, and they had five children. * Lady Katherine Kennedy, who married Sir Patrick Vans of Barnbarroch * Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis (c. 1541‚Äì1576) * Sir Thomas Kennedy, Master of Cassilis (b. between 1543‚Äì1558, d. 1602).

The school includes grades 9‚Äì12, and serves all of Braxton County. School history BCHS replaced three smaller high schools in the county, Sutton High School, Gassaway High School, and Burnsville High School, thereby consolidating both Braxton County's students and its educational resources. The two-story school building initially consisted of three wings, known as A, B, and C. C wing was the academic wing which contained classrooms for classes such as chemistry, math, and English. B wing was the vocational wing which held vocational classes, such as typing, cooking, building construction, electrical and welding. A wing consisted of administrative offices, a cafeteria and a gymnasium, including a training area behind the second level. All of the wings were connected by a ground floor central area that included the main offices, cafeteria, library, and band room. In the summer of 1991, a wooden covered bridge was built that connected the second floors of B and C wings to help students transition from classes more quickly. In the 1990s, the open area where the bridge had previously been built was enclosed to create more classrooms, and to fully connect B and C wings. In the summer of 2006, the entire front area of the school was expanded to accommodate Fairmont State University, filling in the previously open walkway to the school entrance and closing the gap between the B wing, and the gymnasium. A ribbon-cutting ceremony for these changes was held on August 15, 2006. Students of junior level and adults were able to enroll in college classes at Braxton County High School, through Fairmont State University and Glenville State College. School grounds The school sits on top of a hill. Its grounds include a large parking lot and open hillside on three sides. Jerry Burton Drive, named after a much-loved coach who died from leukemia in the 1980s, runs along the edge of the hill, circling the school. In 2006, a second parking lot was created in the lot below the high school. There is a football field with various athletic buildings nearby. In 1991, a new Braxton County Middle School was built on the other side of the parking lot, placing both these schools within walking distance of each other. This new middle school, located on Carter Braxton Drive, also replaced three middle schools: Burnsville, Gassaway and Sutton. As a result, the county contained one consolidated high school and consolidated middle school. Statistics As of the 2016-2017 school year, there were 571 students attending BCHS. The students are 99% Caucasian. The student-teacher ratio is 14.28:1. Sports The school's mascot is the Eagle and the school colors are green and gold. Braxton County is ranked an AA team in sports, and participates in soccer (both women and men), golf, football, Basbetball, women's basketball, baseball, women's softball, track, wrestling, and women's volleyball. The baseball team was WV AA state champions for the 2010 season. In 2013, the cross country team was ranked 3rd in the state at the \\"AA\\" level.

His business dealings had sometimes appeared to take advantage of his connections to the Clintons and accordingly attracted public scrutiny. Early life and education Born on August 8, 1954, Rodham was raised in a United Methodist family in suburban Park Ridge, Illinois. His father, Hugh Ellsworth Rodham (1911‚Äì1993), was of Welsh and English descent. He managed a successful small business in the textile industry. His mother, Dorothy Emma Howell (1919‚Äì2011), was a homemaker of English, Scottish, French Canadian, and Welsh descent. He was the younger brother of Hillary and Hugh. Attending Maine South High School in Park Ridge, Rodham was known as what one writer later termed a \\"fun-loving jock\\" and was not as academically oriented as his sister had been. Rodham subsequently attended Iowa Wesleyan College and the University of Arkansas, although he never received a degree from either school. Career Early career Rodham worked on future brother-in-law Bill Clinton's 1974 nomination campaign for Congress.Hillary Rodham Clinton, Living History, Simon & Schuster, 2003, , pp. 7, 73-74. He then worked at a metal equipment company in Texas, sold insurance in Chicago, acted as a repossessor in Chicago, where shots were fired at him in the infamous Cabrini‚ÄìGreen housing project,Viveca Novak and Jay Branegan, \\"Are Hillary's brothers driving off course?\\", CNN, November 1, 1999. Accessed July 10, 2007. and worked as a prison guard, a job that Bill Clinton helped him get. He moved to South Florida in 1983, where he shared a condominium with his brother Hugh, and worked as a process server and private detective until 1992. 1992‚Äì2006 In 1992, during Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign, Rodham began working for the Democratic National Committee, coordinating constituency outreach. In 1993, he and his brother Hugh ignited a small controversy when they tried to solicit corporate donations for Clinton's inaugural parties; they dropped the effort after a public outcry.Priscilla Painton, \\"Guess Who's Paying for Dinner\\", Time, January 25, 1993. Accessed July 19, 2007. By 1994, Rodham had left his position at the Democratic National CommitteeKeelin McDonell, \\"Oh Brother: The Return of the Rodhams\\", The New Republic, July 23, 2007. Accessed July 28, 2007. and described himself as \\"a consultant ... [in] all kinds of businesses. I'm a general consultant. I just bring different peoples together. I help them negotiate deals. I solve problems for people.\\" In 1997, Rodham tried to arrange meetings between Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Bill Clinton, and also powerful Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov and the president. In 1998, he paid a visit to dictatorial Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia. In each of these cases, there was criticism that he was giving an unauthorized impression of White House approval to these foreign figures, or was seeking financial gain for himself. In 1999, Rodham and his brother Hugh Rodham entered into an $118 million venture to grow and export hazelnuts from the Republic of Georgia. The U.S. State Department and National Security Advisor Sandy Berger became upset, however, when the Rodhams' local business connection in Batumi turned out to be Aslan Abashidze, a major political opponent of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, then a key U.S. ally in the region. Moreover, Rodham flew to Rome to become godfather to Abashidze's grandson. After initial resistance, Berger and the Clintons prevailed upon the Rodham brothers to drop the deal. Rodham would not state what his financial stake in the venture was. Episodes such as these led Hillary Clinton's White House staff to refer to Rodham and his brother as \\"the Brothers Rodham\\",Todd S. Purdum, \\"Siblings Who Often Emerge In an Unflattering Spotlight\\", The New York Times, February 23, 2001. Accessed July 28, 2007. extending the American tradition of troublesome presidential siblings to the brother-in-law category. One senior White House official would be quoted as saying, \\"You never wanted to hear their name come up in any context other than playing golf.\\" In March 2001, it was revealed that Rodham had helped gain a March 2000 presidential pardon for Edgar Allen Gregory Jr., and his wife, Vonna Jo, a Tennessee couple in the carnival business who had been convicted of bank fraud.Marc Lacey, Don Van Natta, Jr., \\"Second Clinton In-Law Says He Helped to Obtain Pardon\\", The New York Times, March 1, 2001. Accessed July 24, 2007. The pardon was granted over the objections of the U.S. Justice Department. Rodham acknowledged talking to Bill Clinton about a pardon; he said he received no money for his work, but he did have financial ties to the couple as a consultant. His actions gained much public focus and criticism, as they came on the heels of the general Bill Clinton pardons controversy and his brother Hugh's own involvement in taking money for work done towards pardons. Hillary Clinton, who had strongly criticized Hugh Rodham's involvement and requested he return his money, said that Tony Rodham was not paid for his work.Michael Kranish, \\"Pardons reemerge as issue in Clinton run\\", The Boston Globe, February 28, 2007. Accessed July 24, 2007. The Republican-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform investigated the matter and concluded that Tony Rodham had in fact been paid. One aspect of the case dragged out into 2007, as Tony Rodham battled a bankruptcy court's order that he repay over $100,000 in loans from the now-deceased Edgar Gregory. 2007‚Äì2019 As of mid-2007, Tony Rodham was helping Hillary Clinton raise funds in Pennsylvania for her 2008 presidential campaign. By the end of 2007, he was back in the news for owing Nicole Boxer about $158,000 in back alimony, child support, and related payments following a court judgement. This earned him renewed unfavorable publicity, including the headline \\"HILL'S BROTHER A DEADBEAT\\" in the New York Post. In May 2008, he expressed disgust with how the Democratic National Committee was handling the Michigan and Florida primary delegate issue between Clinton and Barack Obama, and said he did not know who he would vote for if his sister were not nominated. By the early 2010s, after a string of unsuccessful ventures in oil and gas, water, housing, pharmaceuticals, and tutoring, Rodham was in financial distress, behind on his mortgage payments, facing home foreclosure, and being sued by his lawyer in the child support case for lack of payment. He said in a legal proceeding that while the Clintons had helped him in the past, including paying for his son's school tuition, that was over: \\"Hillary and Bill are done. I mean, look at what they've done for me. They've given me money all the time.\\" Nevertheless, Bill Clinton did help him get a job with longtime Clinton associate Terry McAuliffe to find foreign investors for McAuliffe's GreenTech Automotive firm. Rodham did not play a large, hands-on role in this effort, however, and a trip to China that he made to recruit investors went sour due to Chinese resentment of various Clinton administration actions, including the 1999 United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Rodham found himself in the news again in 2013 when it was disclosed that Alejandro Mayorkas, the director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and President Obama's nominee for United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, was being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General for Mayorkas' role in helping Gulf Coast Funds Management secure approval for participating in the EB-5 visa program for foreign investors. Rodham had been president and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management, a financing firm, since 2010 or so. The firm had been granted the go-ahead even though the original application had been denied and an appeal had been rejected. At least one of the visas that Rodham's firm was trying to acquire was for Huawei Technologies, a Chinese telecommunications company sometimes accused of close connections with Chinese intelligence operations. In 2015, the Inspector General issued a report that on the GreenTech Automotive matter that criticized Mayorkas for creating the appearance of favoritism but passed no particular judgment on either Rodham or McAuliffe. In 2015, an investment fund where Rodham was working as Chief Global EB5 Investor Relations & Government Affairs, the Global City Regional Center, was also using him to recruit EB-5 visa foreign investors in China for a community center project in Philadelphia Chinatown. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake and with Bill Clinton co-chair of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, Rodham and some partners proposed a $22 million deal to rebuild homes in the devastated nation, with funding to come from the Clinton Foundation. The deal never went forward and the Clinton Foundation said it was unaware of the proposal. In October 2013, Rodham joined the advisory board of VCS Mining, a Delaware-based company that was planning a gold mine in the Cap-Ha√Øtien Arrondissement area of Haiti. By 2015 the project had become controversial due to possible environmental effects and the level of foreign ownership; for his part Rodham objected to any inference that he had gotten this position due to his family: \\"I'm a very accomplished person in my own right. I raise money for a lot of people. That's what I basically do.\\" On February 19, 2016 he resigned as a board member from VCS Mining as part of a \\"restructuring plan\\" with no disagreement among the parties implied.\\"Advisory Board Members' Resignation\\", VCS Mining, March 21, 2016. During the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign, he and Hugh appeared with her at a rally in their childhood summer home of Scranton, Pennsylvania in April 2016. He otherwise kept a low profile during the campaign. The GreenTech Automotive matter reemerged in November 2017 when McAuliffe and Rodham were hit with a $17 million lawsuit from a group of thirty-two Chinese investors in it, charging fraud. However, in April 2018, a federal judge dismissed both McAuliffe and Rodham from the case. On June 12, 2019, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling from the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia judge who said the suit was not specific enough about how allegedly misleading and false statements from McAuliffe and Rodham induced the Chinese nationals to invest in the project. Personal life and death At a party in East Hampton, New York, following the 1992 Democratic National Convention, Rodham met Nicole Boxer, daughter of the U.S. Senator from California, Barbara Boxer, and the two began dating. On May 28, 1994, Rodham and Boxer were married in a ceremony at the White House attended by 250 guests; it was the first White House wedding since Tricia Nixon married Edward Cox in 1971. The couple had one son, Zachary, born in 1995\\"What Was Tony Rodham's Role in Pardons Granted by the President?\\", Larry King Live, CNN, March 2, 2001.

(who later held a unique distinction in that he was simultaneously the grandson and nephew of sitting U.S. senators). Rodham and his wife separated by 2000, and were divorced around 2001. Although the situation was difficult, both sides of the greater family continued to work together politically and be involved in Zachary's life. In August 2001, Rodham was involved in an assault at the multi-generational Rodham family summer cottage at Lake Winola in Wyoming County, Pennsylvania.\\" An Intruder Assaults A Clinton Relative\\", The New York Times, August 21, 2001.

The film was restored and re-released by Demy's widow, French filmmaker Agn√®s Varda. The names of the film and title character were inspired by Josef von Sternberg's 1930 film Der blaue Engel, in which Marlene Dietrich played a burlesque performer named \\"Lola Lola\\".  Plot  Lola takes place in the Atlantic coastal city of Nantes, France. A young man, Roland Cassard (Marc Michel, who later reprises the role of Roland in Demy's 1964 film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg), is wasting his life away until he has a chance encounter with Lola (Aim√©e), a woman he knew as a teenager before World War II, who is now a cabaret dancer. Though Roland is quite smitten with her, Lola is preoccupied with her former lover Michel, who abandoned her after impregnating her seven years earlier. Also vying for Lola's heart is American sailor Frankie (Alan Scott), whose affection Lola does not return. Struggling for work, Roland gets involved in a diamond-smuggling plot with a local barber. C√©cile (Annie Dup√©roux), a 13-year-old girl, crosses paths with Roland; in many ways she reminds him of Lola, whose real name is also C√©cile. In the end, Michel returns to Nantes, apparently very successful and hoping to marry Lola, just as she is leaving for another job in Marseille. She goes away with Michel as she always said she would.  Critical reception  Lola received moderate reviews from critics. The Chicago Reader's Jonathan Rosenbaum said it was \\"among the most neglected major works of the French New Wave\\" and \\"in some ways [Demy's] best feature.\\" Travis Hooper of Film Freak Central gave it 3.5/4 stars, saying that he believed that it \\"doesn't have the intellectual rigour of those other films\\". He went on to say that it \\"is stronger for feeling, showing that we need more than the confirmation of the worst if we intend to make it through our lives intact.\\" Not Just Movies gave Lola an A rating, mostly for Demy's \\"New Wave- cum-classical style\\", which \\"creates a self-contained world that gives a softly lift haze to reality as characters constantly aim for each other and miss, sometimes passing within mere inches of each other before carrying on or being redirected.\\"  Awards and nominations  *1963 BAFTA - Nominated for \\"Best Film from any Source\\" and \\"Best Foreign Actress\\" for Anouk Aim√©e. *2001 New York Film Critics Circle Awards - Won the Special Award (also for the re- release of Demy's second film La Baie des Anges).

The film about a bookseller in love in 1990s Beijing, marked a move away from earlier period pictures of Zhang's earlier work to a more realistic Cin√©ma v√©rit√©-like period in his career that also saw him make Happy Times (2000) and Not One Less (1999). Keep Cool also marked only the third time Zhang placed his film in the modern era and the first time Zhang did not work with actress Gong Li. The film was produced by the Guangxi Film Studio. Synopsis The film is set in modern-day Beijing. It begins with bookseller Zhao Xiaoshuai (Jiang Wen) who is following his ex-lover An Hong (Qu Ying) home, obviously after an unhappy and one-sided break-up. He tracks the fast-walking An Hong on a bus and later on a bicycle, until she reaches her flat and goes up to her apartment. There, Zhao gets a junk peddler (Zhang Yimou, the director himself, speaking in his native Shaanxi accent) and another peddler to call out her name and declare his undying love to her at the high-rise flats. The next day, the temperamental An Hong becomes impressed enough by Xiaoshuai's efforts to take him up her apartment for a quickie, but their tryst is interrupted by another man (Zhao Benshan) downstairs, reciting some nonsensical poetry through a loudhailer. Apparently, the person is hired by the peddler Xiaoshuai hired the day before (who has absconded from the job). Xiaoshuai tries unsuccessfully to get the man to stop, and in a huff the angered An Hong leaves her apartment. Xiaoshuai is baffled by his ex blowing hot and cold at him. The scene shifts to some time later. While waiting at a public bicycle stand Xiaoshuai gets beaten up by nightclub owner Liu Delong and his hired thugs, who warn him never to attach himself to An Hong again (apparently Liu is An Hong's new flame). The concussed Xiaoshuai is sent to a hospital by well-mannered middle- aged stranger Mr. Zhang (Li Baotian), who claims Xiaoshuai has accidentally wrecked his brand-new laptop in the act of him being beaten up. The angry Xiaoshuai refuses to compensate, insisting Zhang finds Liu Delong - the main culprit - for payment. The bothersome Zhang keeps finding Xiaoshuai over the laptop compensation and Xiaoshuai finally relents: the two decide to get down to Liu's nightclub to get Zhang's compensation. Once there, however, Xiaoshuai is unable to contain himself and launches a reckless physical attack on Liu, which lands him at the police station for seven days. Xiaoshuai is released after a reprimand by the police chief. Some time later, Zhang interrupts Xiaoshuai (again) during his tryst with An Hong to inform that Liu has agreed, somewhat belatedly, to pay up and apologize. The next scene shows Zhang and Xiaoshuai waiting at a karaoke restaurant for Liu to make his indemnity and to end their entanglements with one another. Zhang is happy the two can talk, but Xiaoshuai reveals, after some drinks, that he has come, not really to make up, but with an intent ‚Äì to sever Liu's right hand. Xiaoshuai then compensates Zhang with a new laptop and tells him to leave and not get implicated with his \\"crime\\", but Zhang, realizing the import of the matter, leaves and immediately starts looking for a mobile phone to call up the unsuspecting Liu to stop this \\"tragedy\\". Zhang grabs a nearby passer-by's mobile phone, but fails to contact Liu. Xiaoshuai, realizing Zhang is about to wreck his revenge mission, convinces passers-by Zhang is a mad relative and drags him back to the restaurant. Once back to the restaurant, Zhang realizes he must act quickly to grab the restaurant customers' attention. He overturns a table; in the mayhem, to his chagrin, everyone in the restaurant is convinced by Xiaoshuai that Liu is simply stark mad. The restaurant owner gets Zhang tied up and gagged upstairs, after which he leaves, and an irate chef attacks Zhang for molesting (unwittingly) a fellow waitress whom he fancies. Downstairs, Xiaoshuai waits for Liu. Liu turns up and pays up very amicably, but before Xiaoshuai can launch his attack, the wall-mounted loudspeaker above their table collapses and injures Liu badly. The frantic restaurant owner and customers bring Liu to the nearest hospital, and Xiaoshuai finds himself quite bemused that his revenge plans has turned to nought (although Liu has seemingly had his retribution). When Xiaoshuai returns upstairs to release the gagged Zhang, he finds a curious scene. Zhang has gone completely berserk and is wreaking havoc by going after the chef with a cleaver. Xiaoshuai tries desperately to calm Zhang, but only manages to see Zhang wreck the new laptop. Like Xiaoshuai, Zhang is detained at the police station for seven days. He is given a light reprimand by the station-master, who advises him to \\"speak nicely when everyone has something to work out\\". In an ending requested by the state censors (see below), Xiaoshuai gets someone to pick Zhang up in a van after Zhang's seven-day detainment period is up. Xiaoshuai apologizes in a well- phrased letter for the troubles he caused, promises to curb his violent temper, and pays Zhang a new laptop. Style Keep Cool is largely different in style from the rest of Zhang's oeuvre. It is Zhang's first urban comedy, and uses a hip, rock soundtrack and a roving handheld camera with multiple jump cuts to give a feel of contemporary Beijing. The perpetually awry camera angle expresses the chaos of the city, as well as the possibility that anything can happen.  Censorship  Keep Cool, originally scheduled for a world premiere at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, was pulled by Chinese censors at the last minute, ostensibly part of a general retrenchment of Chinese control over its film industry following the release of Zhang Yuan's homosexual-themed East Palace, West Palace. Chinese censors additionally asked for Zhang to implement substantive changes to the film's story, most notably adding a happy ending.  Cast  *Jiang Wen as Zhao Xiaoshuai (ËµµÂ∞èÂ∏Ö); Jiang Wen, one of China's most famous actors and directors, takes a leading role in Keep Cool (his second time working with Zhang Yimou). Zhang referred to the actor as \\"the best actor in China today, and intelligent. I saw the movie he made [In the Heat of the Sun] and took a video back to my hometown for my parents. We all laughed.\\" *Li Baotian as Zhang Qiusheng (Âº†ÁßãÁîü) or Lao Zhang; Li Baotian, one of Zhang's regular actors (Ju Dou, Shanghai Triad), again provides a pivotal performance for Keep Cool. *Ge You as The Policeman; Ge You, a comedic actor, has a cameo in the film. *Qu Ying as An Hong (ÂÆâÁ∫¢); Zhang Yimou selected the model Qu Ying for the only female role in the film. *Zhao Benshan as Junk Peddlar No. 3 *Liu Xinyi (Âàò‰ø°‰πâ) as Liu Delong (ÂàòÂæ∑Èæô)  References  External links  Movie review from Sinologic *Movie profile from the University of Southern California library Category:Chinese films Category:1997 films Category:Films based on Chinese novels Category:Mandarin-language films Category:1990s black comedy films Category:Films set in Beijing Category:Films directed by Zhang Yimou Category:Chinese comedy-drama films Category:1997 comedy films ","title":"Keep Cool (film)"},{"id":"7195872","text":"The Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) is a major generator of economic activity in Atlantic Canada. Largest employers Government and military The largest employer in HRM is government, with most provincial government departments headquartered in the area, as well as many regional offices for federal government departments and agencies. The Department of National Defence is the single largest employer and Halifax Harbour continues to serve a major military purpose as the Atlantic Ocean home port for the Royal Canadian Navy. CFB Halifax is Canada's largest naval base and the nation's largest military base in number of personnel. This base comprises various shore-based facilities including HMC Dockyard, Stadacona, CFAD Bedford, and other adjunct facilities throughout HRM and central Nova Scotia. Approximately 2/3 of the navy's major ships are home ported in Halifax. Another major military facility is located at 12 Wing, CFB Shearwater in Eastern Passage. This is the home base of naval aviation in Canada and is used as a heliport for the CH-124 Sea King. Port of Halifax The largest influence on HRM's economy is its port and related spin-offs. Halifax is one of Canada's top four container ports in terms of the volume of cargo handled. Halifax Harbour is strategically located just north of the Great Circle Route between western Europe and the Eastern Seaboard of North America as the first inbound, last outbound major port of call on the continent with strategic rail connections to central and western Canada and the United States. The Halifax Port Authority operates two major container terminals, a medium-sized oil refinery, numerous general cargo piers and more specialized cargo handling piers for products such as automobiles and bulk gypsum. Port facilities are also increasingly used for logistics support of offshore natural gas production platforms near Sable Island, and for ongoing oil and gas exploration. The port has a shipyard and the eastern side of the harbour is home to Canadian Coast Guard Base Dartmouth and the internationally renowned Bedford Institute of Oceanography. In recent years, there has been an increase in number of cruise ships through a redeveloped passenger terminal at Pier 21. The port is also the eastern terminus of the transcontinental Canadian National Railway which maintains extensive facilities around the waterfront. The Halifax Shipyard is one of Canada's most well-equipped, having recently undergone a $300-million modernization to accommodate the building of new combat vessels for the Canadian navy. Another deep water port is the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port, which mainly serves the offshore and forestry industry in eastern Nova Scotia. Primary industries Agriculture, fishing, mining, forestry and natural gas extraction are major resource industries found in the rural areas of HRM. The main agriculture area of the Halifax Regional Municipality is the Musquodoboit Valley. The total number of farms in HRM is 150, of which 110 are family-owned, and at the 2001 census there were 3,630 people working in agriculture and resource-based industries in the municipality, out of a total population of 359,111. Fishing harbours are located along all coastal areas with some having an independent harbour authority, and others being managed by small craft harbours under the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Forestry is most common in the Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore area where there are 21 sawmills. Other resource industries in HRM include the natural gas fields off the coast of Sable Island, as well as clay, shale, gold, limestone, and gypsum extraction in rural areas of the city. Secondary industries HRM is a major regional manufacturing centre. It is an exporter of beer, being home to the Keith's brewery and Oland Brewery as well as several local specialty beers produced in micro-breweries. The aerospace industry has an increasing significance in the regional economy, through engine manufacturer Pratt and Whitney Canada, and IMP Aerospace, as well as the increasing passenger and cargo traffic at Halifax International Airport. Tertiary industries With the largest population centre in Atlantic Canada and a geographically central location in Nova Scotia, HRM has witnessed a transformation in its economy during recent decades with the growth of the service sector. The historic home to the Bank of Nova Scotia (branch #1 is located there), the municipality has received an influx of banking and financial service-related employment in recent years. Maritime Life is headquartered in the municipality and many call centres, computer and information technology firms are located in HRM. Halifax is also home to the three largest law firms in Atlantic Canada, McInnes Cooper, Stewart McKelvey, and Cox Palmer. Growth prospects The economy of HRM has been relatively strong in the past decade. Growth in public sector employment at all levels of government that far exceeds demographic population growth nationally, coupled with wage and benefits packages that are at least 12% greater than comparative private sector jobsComparing Public and Private Sector Compensation in Canada have provided HRM with sustained growth in population and economic activity in recent years. HRM has also benefited from a demographic shift of younger Atlantic Canadians from rural and small town communities to urban centres. Another important ingredient in HRM's growth has been a major investment in offshore oil and gas exploration, resulting in many high-paying jobs locating to the area. Halifax Harbour was also the staging site for much of the development of the Sable Offshore Energy natural gas project during the late 1990s, as well as somewhat smaller crude oil development projects during the 1970s-1990s. Unemployment is relatively low (5.9% in July 2010) and is well below both the provincial and national averages.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/provincial- jobless-rates/article1664073/ Communications HRM is also a major communication centre and gateway. Private sector telecommunication companies Bell Aliant and Eastlink have extensive service in the municipality and offer wire telephone, Internet and television signals. Rogers Wireless, Bell Canada, and Telus offer cellular telephone service in urban areas and along major transportation corridors. The communities of Pennant Point, Herring Cove and Beaver Harbour are landing sites for fibre optic Trans-Atlantic cables. The communities of Harrietsfield and Pennant Point are home to earth stations. Corporate headquarters Headquarters of Air Canada Jazz Air Canada Jazz,\\"Contact Us.\\" Air Canada Jazz.

Today's Herald News is descended from several papers, but did not come to be until two Passaic County papers out of Passaic and Paterson merged in 1988. The Herald News is an edition of The Record, a publication serving Bergen County, New Jersey that was formerly based in Hackensack, New Jersey. Both papers are owned by Gannett Company, which purchased Herald News parent North Jersey Media Group in 2016. History One of the two papers that merged to form the now-Herald News was the North Jersey Herald-News, which grew from the mergers of several papers in the Passaic-Clifton metropolitan area, and for many years was known as the Passaic Herald News. The paper was headquartered at the intersection of Main Avenue and Highland Avenue in Passaic, just over the border with Clifton. In the 1970s, the paper became known as the North Jersey Herald-News and was owned by the Drukker family, with former Congressman Dow Drukker founding the paper and relative Austin Crane Drukker owning and publishing the paper by the early 1980s. Beginning publication in 1890, the Paterson Evening News was one of several daily papers that called the county seat of Passaic county home. The paper's chief competitor was the Paterson Morning Call, which eventually grew and absorbed the Paterson Morning News to become the Paterson News and Call. By the 1970s the News and Call and Evening News were the two remaining papers in Paterson. The two eventually merged in 1980, operating out of the headquarters of the Evening News on 16th Avenue, and became simply known as The News. At the time, the paper was owned by Allbritton Communications Company. In 1985, MediaNews Group bought The News from Albritton. Shortly thereafter, the Drukker family sold control of the Herald-News to a MediaNews affiliate. MediaNews continued to operate both The News and the Herald-News out of their respective plants in Paterson and Passaic while beginning to plan a merger. In July 1987, the weekend editions of The News and North Jersey Sunday (the name for the Sunday Herald-News) were merged. Then, in September, MediaNews finalized the merger of the daily editions and the paper became known as The North Jersey Herald & News. Following the merger the former Evening News headquarters were closed, and publishing operations were moved to the old Herald-News headquarters in Passaic. The Evening News building is now used by a Paterson elementary school. For its new combined paper, MediaNews developed the slogan \\"FIRST with the news...everyday!\\" and designed an accompanying rising sun logo. In 1997 MediaNews sold the paper to the Borg family, owners of The Record of Hackensack, New Jersey. In 2000, North Jersey Media Group was formed as a holding company for the Borgs' assets, including the Herald News. Early in the 2000s, the paper dropped the ampersand from its name, and later would drop \\"North Jersey\\" as well, just being called the Herald News. Shortly thereafter, the operations of both The Record and the Herald News were merged. North Jersey Media Group set up a new headquarters in what is now Woodland Park (at the time, the municipality was still known as West Paterson) and moved the entire operation of the Herald News there. They also moved most of the operations of The Record, including its former Passaic County bureau that was located in Wayne, New Jersey, to the new site. Later, North Jersey Media Group closed the former Record headquarters in Hackensack and consolidated the remaining resources there into the corporate headquarters in Woodland Park. The two papers have operated largely as a single entity, featuring mostly the same stories but laid out in different areas; for instance, an article might be on the front page of The Record but be found somewhere inside the main section of the Herald News. Gannett ceased this practice following their acquisition of both papers and both are now identically printed, with the only differences being the papers‚Äô respective mastheads. The Herald News' primary area of concentration is in Passaic County, while also covering news in the suburbs of the county (areas of Bergen, Essex, and Morris Counties) as well.

It was established in 2001 by Daisaku Ikeda, the founder of the Soka Gakkai International Buddhist movement, but maintains a secular curriculum which emphasizes pacifism, human rights, and the creative coexistence of nature and humanity. A much larger and older sister school, S≈çka University in Japan, is located in Hachi≈çji, Tokyo. SUA encompasses both a four-year liberal arts college and a graduate school offering a Master's program in Educational Leadership and Societal Change.http://www.soka.edu/academics/academics-overview-ma- program/default.aspx SUA hosts the Pacific Basin Research Center and the academic journal Annals of Scholarship. The university has an endowment of $1.2 billion , giving it the second-highest endowment per student of any college or university in the United States. History and philosophy Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, first President of the Soka Gakkai. ca. 1930 SUA is a secular and nonsectarian university founded by Daisaku Ikeda, the President of Soka Gakkai International (SGI). SUA's philosophical foundation originated in the work of Tsunesabur≈ç Makiguchi, who was the first President of Soka Gakkai (previous name Soka Kyoiku Gakkai) and created a society for educators dedicated to social and educational reform in Japan during the years leading up to World War II. Makiguchi was an elementary school principal, strongly influenced by John Dewey and American educational progressivism. Between 1930-1934, Makiguchi published his four-volume work, S≈çka Ky≈çikugaku Taikei (Value Creating Education System), to argue for his belief that education should proceed through dialogue instead of \\"force-feeding\\" information to students. This student-centered and humanistic philosophy, he argued, made \\"the purpose of education\\" an effort \\"to lead students to happiness.\\" Education, he asserted, should be directed toward \\"creating value\\" for the individual and society. Makiguchi was a pacifist and an ardent believer in religious liberty and freedom of conscience. Jailed by Japanese authorities during World War II for ideas and actions inimical to the war effort, he died in prison on 18 November 1944. After the war, as the Soka Gakkai organization grew, Makiguchi's educational philosophy became the centerpiece of a number of Soka schools in Japan advocated by his successors, J≈çsei Toda (second President of Soka Gakkai, a former elementary school teacher) and Daisaku Ikeda (third President of Soka Gakkai), who is the founder of SUA. Ikeda describes the founding of SUA as the fruition of the dreams of Makiguchi and Toda.Sharma, 1999Bethel, 1990 Campus Calabasas In 1987, SUA was formed as a not-for-profit organization incorporated in the state of California. Initially it was a small graduate school located on the former Gillette‚àíBrown Ranch in Calabasas and the Santa Monica Mountains. Originally the location was the site of pre-Columbian Talepop, a settlement of the Chumash people. It was within the Spanish land grant Rancho Las Virgenes in the 19th century. In the 1920s, it became the rural estate of King Gillette with a mansion designed by Wallace Neff. In 1952, it became the Claretville seminary of the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church, and in 1977 it became the religious center of Elizabeth Clare Prophet and the Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT). In 1986, CUT sold the property to Soka University of Japan. Soka University of America(SUA), originally called Soka University of Los Angeles (SULA), initially operated a small ESL (English as a Second Language) school at the Calabasas campus, enrolling just under 100 students. In 1990, SUA announced plans to build a future liberal arts college on campus\\"Soka University Expansion Stirs Calabasas Controversy,\\" Los Angeles Times, Sept. 24, 1990, http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-24/local/me-913_1_soka- university-map/2 and plans to expand the facility over the next 25 years to an enrollment of as many as 5,000 students. SUA began making plans to expand the campus infrastructure to accommodate living quarters and classrooms for the proposed expansion, but ran into opposition from some local residents, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, environmentalists, and government representatives. Opponents sought to protect the Chumash ancestral site, the natural habitats and ecology, and the expansive open space viewshed within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and to prevent a development of unprecedented urban density adjacent to Malibu Creek State Park. In 1992, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA), a joint-powers authority associated with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, resorted to its powers of eminent domain to condemn the core parcel comprising the university and thereby halted SUA‚Äôs plans for expansion. SUA appealed the eminent domain action. In 1994, SUA opened a small graduate school, offering an MA in Second and Foreign Language Education with a concentration in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL.) The legal debate continued for the remainder of the decade. Soka University was prevented from developing any expansion plans at the Calabasas property and began looking for alternative sites to build a larger campus. The Graduate School held its first commencement in December 1995, and in the same year SUA acquired a 103-acre site in Aliso Viejo for a private non-profit four-year liberal arts college. The Aliso Viejo campus opened on May 3, 2001 to a freshman class of 120 students from 18 countries and 18 states. In June 2005, Soka University received its accreditation from the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC.)University Catalog 2014-2016, Soka University of America, pg. 5 SUA sold the Calabasas property in April 2005 to a coalition of buyers led by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA). The former campus is now managed jointly by the Mountain Recreation and Conservation Authority, the state parks department, and the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The former campus is now public parkland, known as King Gillette Ranch Park, and houses the visitor center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. In 2007, the Calabasas campus was closed and the Graduate School relocated to the Aliso Viejo campus.University Catalog,Soka University of America, pg. 5S Aliso Viejo Founders Hall, Aliso Viejo campus. In 1995, the university bought of rough-graded property for $25 million in Aliso Viejo, located in southern Orange County, California. It then spent $225 million to build the first 18 buildings of the new campus, which opened to 120 first year undergraduate students on 24 August 2001. The architecture was designed in a style resembling an Italian hillside village in Tuscany, with red-tiled roofs, stonework, and earth colors. Three academic buildings were named after the founder and S≈çka Gakkai's third president Daisaku Ikeda and his wife, Kaneko Ikeda; 20th‚àícentury peace activists Linus Pauling and Eva Helen Pauling; and Mohandas Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi. An additional academic building dedicated in 2012 was named after Nobel Peace Laureate Wangari Maathai.http://www.soka.edu/about_soka/our_campus/campus-map.aspx Since August 2007 the Aliso Viejo campus has been the home for all of SUA's graduate, undergraduate, and research programs. The Aliso Viejo campus is bordered on three sides by Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park encompassing a county wildlife sanctuary. Academics Linus and Ava Helen Pauling Hall Student Center SUA has an 8:1 student/faculty ratio and an average class size of 12. * The undergraduate college offers a Bachelor of Liberal Arts with emphasis areas in Environmental Studies, Humanities, Social & Behavioral Sciences, or International Studies. Classrooms typically use seminar methods. * The graduate school offers a Master of Arts degree in Educational Leadership and Societal Change. * The Pacific Basin Research Center supports research on the humane and peaceful development of the Asia-Pacific Region, including the Latin American border states. It awards grants and fellowships to researchers studying public policy interactions in the Pacific Rim in such areas as international security, economic and social development, educational and cultural reform, environmental protection and human rights. The Center also sponsors campus conferences, occasional lecture series, and student seminars that extend and support its research activities. * The academic journal Annals of Scholarship has been edited at SUA since 2005, when humanities professor Marie-Rose Logan joined the faculty. Annals of Scholarship promotes the study of the development of methodological and historical criteria in all the disciplines with an emphasis on the interaction between art practices and the human sciences in a global culture.  Rankings  Soka University of America's ranking in the U.S. News & World Report 's 2020 edition of Best Colleges is tied for 27th overall, 7th in \\"Best Value\\", and 9th in \\"Top Performers on Social Mobility\\" among U.S. liberal arts colleges. For 2020, Washington Monthly ranked Soka 87th among liberal arts colleges in the U.S. based on their contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service. In 2015, the Christian Science Monitor listed SUA 2nd on a top 10 list of the most globally minded colleges.  Curriculum  There are no discipline-based departments at Soka University. Instead the university has focused on interdisciplinarity, a movement in collegiate curriculum that is used by certain American colleges and universities, including the nearby University of California, Irvine. SUA undergraduates get a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts, while choosing one of four possible concentration tracks: *Environmental Studies *Humanities *International Studies *Social & Behavioral Sciences A 5th concentration track in the Life Sciences will be added in the Fall of 2020 with the completion of the new science building and residence halls. Learning Clusters Learning Clusters are three-week intensive courses focused on a significant problem of contemporary relevance. Faculty and students develop Learning Clusters in collaboration during each fall semester. The primary goal is to produce an \\"educated response\\" and build student skills for research, critical thought, and active engagement in the world. Learning clusters typically create a collaborative final project designed to be shared with the \\"off campus\\" world in some way. Each year several Learning Clusters travel within and outside the United States (South America, Central America, China, India, and Korea as well as other places) with funding from the Luis & Linda Nieves Family Foundation. Study abroad All undergraduate students at Soka University of America must study a non-native language. The languages offered are Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese. The language must be studied for two years, then all undergraduate students at Soka University of America study abroad for one semester in the spring or fall of their junior year in a country whose language they are studying (costs included in tuition). SUA was the first liberal arts college in the US to require mandatory study abroad for all students when it opened in 2001.\\"New West Coast College, Born of the Far East\\" by Todd S. Purdon, New York Times, July 20, 2001, Pg 1 The first students went abroad in 2004. Student life Residence Halls: \\"Horizon,\\" \\"Aurora,\\" \\"Abeona,\\" and \\"Sunrise\\" About 60% of SUA's student body is from the United States, with the other 40% coming from 30 other countries on six continents. From 2014 until the present, Soka University has been ranked #1 in Foreign Student Factor (Highest % of International Students) among National Liberal Arts Colleges by U.S. News & World Report. SUA is a residential college and students live on campus in one of eight residential buildings. Parking is free on campus and a free half-hourly shuttle service is offered to enrolled students. Athletics Soka University teams, nicknamed the Lions, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the California Pacific Conference (CalPac). Sports, for both men and women, include cross country, soccer, swimming and track & field. Admissions and graduation rate The Soka Performing Arts Center For the Class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018), Soka received 462 applications, accepted 180 (39.0%) and enrolled 111. The middle 50% range of SAT scores was 570‚Äì670 for reading and 610‚Äì740 for math, while the middle 50% range for the ACT composite score was 25‚Äì30 for enrolled first year students. Since 2008, full tuition Soka Opportunity Scholarships are available for admitted students whose families make $60,000 or less. SUA was named #4 in U.S. News and World Report's 2015 national rankings for \\"Best Value - Liberal Arts Colleges\\". Between 2005-2007 SUA graduated its first three undergraduate classes with an average graduation rate of 90%. As of 2007, 38% of SUA graduates had gone on to graduate programs.  Expansion  In 2017, Soka University of America began construction on two new residential halls and a new science building. Each new residence hall is estimated to house 50 people, allowing the campus to expand its student population by 100. The science hall will be the home of the new Life Sciences Concentration, which will allow undergraduates to complete pre-med requirements and study topics related to biology, medicine, and health. Both projects are set to be completed by Fall 2020. Ultimately, Soka University of America plans to build additional residence halls, academic buildings and expanded dining facilities to accommodate up to a maximum of ~1,000 students in total.  Notable people  A notable alumna of Soka University of America is Tahereh Mafi, New York Times best selling author. Notable faculty includes humanities professors Robert Allinson and Jim Merod, the latter having recorded numerous jazz artists (including Herbie Hancock and Ella Fitzgerald) in addition to his scholarship.  Allegations of sectarianism  In 2003, two professors claimed they experienced religious discrimination, breach of contract as well as age discrimination. One professor took legal action against SUA based on these allegations, but her case was dismissed on summary judgment. University administrators disputed all allegations of discrimination and noted that the majority of faculty and staff are not Buddhist, said there was no evidence of preferential treatment, and said that Soka University has never taught nor will it teach Buddhist--or any other--religious practices. In 2011, Michelle Woo wrote an article for OC Weekly, a local publication in Orange County, California, in which she mentioned possible proselytizing of non-Buddhist staff and students. The article was disputed by Soka University students, faculty, and staff.

The caterpillars feed on various native plants of especially the family Rutaceae, but have also taken to the leaves of cultivated citrus trees. Life cycle Citrus swallowtails pass through approximately three generations per year. Eggs Female butterflies lay their eggs singly on citrus leaves. After about six days, the egg hatches into an immature larva. Immature larva The immature larvae are black, yellow, and white with spikes. Their coloration provides effective camouflage, as they resemble bird droppings. They grow to a length of 10 or 15 mm before changing into mature larvae. Mature larva Mature larvae are green with white or pink markings and eyespots. They grow to a maximum length of about 45 mm. Mature caterpillars lack the camouflage of their immature state. Instead, when threatened by a bird or other predator, they produce a forked, orange-coloured organ known as an osmeterium. The organ emits a strong smell which acts as a discouragement to the predator. The larvae are sometimes known as 'orange dogs'. Pupa The caterpillars attach themselves to branches with silk, transforming into pupae. They remain in the pupal form for two to three weeks before emerging as adults. Adult Adult butterflies have black and yellow markings with red and blue eyespots. Female butterflies tend to be larger than males. An adult visiting ixoras in the garden Natural enemies As with most butterflies, various predators, parasitoids and diseases attack Papilio demodocus, so that integrated pest management is generally the most rational approach to control of infestations, paying due attention to avoiding destruction of the populations of enemies. In particular parasitic wasps in the family Encyrtidae, such as some species of the genus Ooencyrtus develop in Papilio eggs. Other parasitoidal wasps in families such as Chalcidae and Braconidae (for example genus Apanteles) attack the larvae, and Pteromalidae (for example genus Pteromalus) are parasitoids of the pupae. Predatory insects such as certain Heteroptera, in particular Reduviidae known as assassin bugs, and some Pentatomidae attack the larvae, and certain Mantodea such as genus Sphodromantis attack both larvae and adults. Taxonomy Papilio demodocus is a member of the demoleus species group. The clade members are: *Papilio demodocus Esper, 1799 *Papilio demoleus Linnaeus, 1758 *Papilio erithonioides Grose-Smith, 1891 *Papilio grosesmithi Rothschild, 1926 *Papilio morondavana Grose-Smith, 1891 Subspecies *Papilio demodocus demodocus ‚Äî sub-Saharan Africa, including Madagascar *Papilio demodocus bennetti Dixey, 1898 ‚Äî Socotra Mating system Courtship Courtship is more or less the same in all Papilionidae. Once a female enters the visual field of a male, the male moves quickly to hover over her so that his wings beat rapidly. The female is then induced to land so that the male can attempt to mate with her. There are various ways in which the male entices the female, including visual, olfactory, tactile, and auditory cues. Of particular interest is the use of olfactory cues. Male butterflies produce pheromones from different structures, such as that of the anal fold of the hindwing,Scoble, M. J. The Lepidoptera: Form, Function and Diversity. [London]: Natural History Museum, 1995. Print. that cause the females to perform the appropriate response. Sometimes, however, females choose to reject a male's attempt at mating, often because she has already mated. She can do so by either avoiding his approach or, if she lands, she will flap her wings quickly and deliberately all while raising her abdomen until the male flies away. In this way, courtship is primarily a female's choice.Douglas, Matthew M. The Lives of Butterflies. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1986. Print. Furthermore, it has been observed that females also produce a pheromone that aids males in determining whether a female has already mated or not.Boggs, Carol L., Ward B. Watt, and Paul R. Ehrlich. Butterflies: Ecology and Evolution Taking Flight. Chicago: University of Chicago, 2003. Print. Mating This species primarily mates via the lek system, in which there are aggregations of males on small mating territories. When the female reaches the lek, she changes her behavior so that she helps the males to detect her by performing a long and obvious circular flight. The species operates on a polygynous system in which one male has the ability to mate with several females in one breeding season.Boggs, Carol L., Ward B. Watt, and Paul R. Ehrlich. Butterflies: Ecology and Evolution Taking Flight. Chicago: University of Chicago, 2003. Print. In Papilio glaucus, that which is of the same genus of this species, the lack of male-male competition, strong rapid flight, dispersed abundant food, and oviposition sights helped to support the idea of mating system based on polygyny.Krebs, Robert A. \\"The Mating Behavior of Papilio glaucus (Papilionidae).\\" Journal of Research on Lepidoptera (1988): 27-31. Google.Web. 17 Sept. 2013. The females are prevented from mating with other males when the male emits a sphragis, which prevents other males from mating with the female, ensuring that only the sperm from this male fertilizes the eggs. The physical act of copulation takes between one half hour to two hours. During this time, the male spermatophore is transferred to the female's bursa. The spermatophore is then absorbed and its nutrient (protein) contents are given to the female's eggs as a food source. For this reason, the male makes an indirect investment to his offspring, given that he offers them a food source, being beneficial to the female given that she risks less of her own well-being to bear her offspring. Therefore, a male is considered more fit with a larger ejaculation, given that he allows his offspring to feed so that his own genes may be passed on efficiently. Mistakes and diversity Mate assessment involves the discrimination of conspecifics, so that mating requires that males and females recognize and mate with individuals of the appropriate sex and species, as indicated by the appropriate chemical and visual cues that are made. Sometimes, homosexual copulation has been seen in addition to two males upon one female. Very rarely do females accept a mate from a different species or genus, and if they do, it is usually because they are too immature to realize the correct sexual cues of males from their own species. However, these \\"incorrect\\" matings do occur so that there is diversity in the species, as seen through the different larval patterns that have evolved in the species, depending on the type of plant the eggs are laid upon.Clarke, C. A., C.G.C. Dickson, and P.M. Sheppard. \\"Larval Color Pattern in Papilio demodocus.\\" Evolution 17.2 (June 1963): 130-37. JSTOR. Web.17 Sept. 2013.

It is home to Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball, women's basketball and men's ice hockey teams. Previously, the basketball teams played at St. John Arena, while the ice hockey team played at the OSU Ice Arena. The facility is named the Jerome Schottenstein Center in honor of Jerome Schottenstein, of Columbus, late founder of Schottenstein Stores Corp. and lead benefactor of the project, while the seating bowl is named for Schottenstein's store Value City Furniture.

In May 2010, the Blue Jackets and OSU signed a one-year, annually renewable, agreement to turn over day-to-day operations and non-athletic event booking of Nationwide Arena to OSU, effective July 1, 2010. This agreement put both arenas under the same management and made the facilities sister venues. As part of the March 2012 sale of Nationwide Arena to the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority (FCCFA), the non-profit company Columbus Arena Management was created.

Buckeye Nuthouse The student section at men's basketball games is known as the Buckeye Nuthouse. From the time when the venue opened to the end of the 2009-2010 season, the students were seated behind the baskets. In response to the criticism for lacking the energy and gameday atmosphere seen in many other college basketball arenas, the athletic department reconfigured the student section in 2010 so that the students would then be seated behind the team benches allowing them to be visible on television broadcasts, as well as behind the basket that the opponent shoots at during the second half. In making this reconfiguration possible, 240 seats are tarped off behind the student section so that spectators seated behind the students could see the game without having to stand up, reducing its capacity to 18,809 during men's basketball games. To compensate for the revenue lost from the tarped-off seats, the student allotment was reduced from 2,000 to 1,400 tickets.

The original Zone of the Enders was released for the PlayStation 2 in March 2001. A sequel, Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner was released for the same system in 2003. In 2012, the two games were re-released in high-definition for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as Zone of the Enders HD Collection. Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars was released for Game Boy Advance in 2001. Zone of the Enders: 2167 Idolo, an original video animation was released in March 2001. A twenty-six episode anime television series Z.O.E. Dolores, I ran from April to September 2001. Common themes Setting The Zone of the Enders series is set in the late 22nd century. Mankind has colonized Mars, and space colonies are set up in orbit around Jupiter. Fueling this expansion are two scientific advances: the development of the Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicle, or LEV, a mecha used for labor and military use, and the discovery of Metatron, a high-energy ore found on Callisto. Those in power on Earth begin to take a dim view of the colonists of Mars and Jupiter, calling them \\"Enders\\", and imposing harsh and exploitative laws and taxes against them. Eventually, different groups on Mars begin to rise up in opposition to Earth, the most well known of these called Bahram. A new weapon given to these rebels is the Orbital Frame, a mecha which makes extensive use of Metatron-based technology. These Orbital Frames come to shape the destiny of Earth and its colonies, for both good and evil. Plot Throughout the Zone of the Enders series, a number of themes and dramatic devices show up prominently. The story usually revolves around two specific Orbital Frames: Jehuty and Anubis created as the two \\"keys\\" of a superweapon called Aumaan. In the first game, Bahram forces attack Jupiter's colony Antilia to secure the two Frames, killing several civilians in the process. One of the few survivors, Leo Stenbuck, finds Jehuty and uses it to stop the Bahram soldiers. Leo is hired by the Space Force to deliver Jehuty back to their ship. On his way to the Space Force, Leo rescues several civilians; and often talks with Jehuty's artificial intelligence, A.D.A., regarding the value of life. When succeeding, Leo is requested to work for the Space Force to protect the colony from a terrorist attack. Although Leo succeeds in saving the colony, he is saddened by the revelation that A.D.A. is programmed to self-destruct Jehuty in Bahram's fortress Aumann. Shortly before the release of the sequel, Konami released a side story that explores Leo training in the Space Force and hiding Jehuty. The sequel, Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner, is set two years after the first game. The story introduces the player to an ex-Bahram operative named Dingo Egret, who stumbles upon the hidden Jehuty. Bahram soon finds Dingo; Nohman, the leader of Bahram, wishes to have Dingo back on his side. Dingo's reluctance to go back to Bahram results in Nohman shooting him. However, Nohman's minion, Ken Marinaris, saves Dingo's life by connecting his body to Jehuty and requests his help to defeat him. Dingo agrees to defeat Nohman after learning from Leo that Jehuty will self-destruct in Aumann. Dingo joins with Leo and the Space Force to defeat the Bahram forces. In Aumann, Dingo defeats Nohman and Anubis and then uses the remains of the two Frames to stop Aumann.  Games   Zone of the Enders (2001)  The first game in the series details the story of a boy named Leo Stenbuck, a colonist from Jupiter who accidentally finds himself piloting the Orbital Frame Jehuty.  Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars (2001)  This is a side-story released for the Game Boy Advance, about a conspiracy involving the construction of Orbital Frames for Earth. The protagonist, a young man named Cage Midwell, finds himself getting involved with a resistance organization known as BIS.  Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner (2003)  A new pilot, Dingo Egret, finds Jehuty on the Moon of Callisto two years after the events of the first game and travels to the superweapon Aumaan in order to defeat Colonel Nohman of the Bahram army, who pilots Jehuty's sister craft, Anubis.  Zone of the Enders HD Collection (2012)  At E3 2011, Konami announced a re-release of Zone of the Enders and Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It includes updated interfaces for the HD resolutions, redrawn art, Trophy/Achievement support, improved audio and rumble support. It includes a demo for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, mirroring the first game's inclusion of the Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty demo. A PlayStation Vita version was announced but was later canceled.https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/zone-of-the-enders- hd-collection At an event in May 2012, the HD Collection was given a release date in Japan for October 25. At the same event, Kojima confirmed that work on the next installment in the Zone of the Enders series had begun. Future Since 2008, Zone of the Enders 3 has been in concept development by Hideo Kojima, but was kept away from game development until all the big titles were completed. On May 25, 2012, Kojima confirmed that work on the next installment in the Zone of the Enders series had begun. However, the project was cancelled after Kojima Productions acknowledged issues within the HD Collection. At Tokyo Game Show 2017, Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner M‚àÄRS was announced, featuring enhanced graphics, 4K resolution support, VR headset support, new sound design and ‚Äúnext-gen surround sound‚Äù. Anime Zone of the Enders: 2167 Idolo (released 21 February 2001) is a prequel for the entire series, telling the story of Radium Lavans, the pilot of the first Orbital Frame. Zone of the Enders: Dolores, i (released April to September 2001) is a followup to Idolo, following the exploits of James Links, an alcoholic trucker, who, while trying to reunite with his estranged family, discovers an Orbital Frame hidden in one of his shipping containers. The frame, calling itself Dolores, seems to consider James her prince. Reception Zone of the Enders achieved moderate success. While the first game obtained good sales in North America as a result of including the demo for Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner, received mediocre sales. Hideo Kojima cites \\"errors in setting the release time frame\\" and being overshadowed by other major titles as the reason it did not achieve high sales. Critical reception to the two PlayStation 2 titles has been positive. The action elements and graphics generated good response. The sequel was found to have improved several elements from the first game to the point GameSpot called it \\"what the original Zone of the Enders should have been.\\" Both games have also been criticized for their story modes' short length and mixed views were offered regarding their replay value. The voice acting and script translation has been panned by most writers as it made the character unappealing and the dialogue repetitive, respectively. The HD Collection ported by High Voltage Software received mixed reviews, citing that the games' graphics have been improved but suffering from an inconsistent framerate not seen in the PS2 titles as well as suffering from technical issues and lack of special content for all console versions. A patch was worked on by HexaDrive and released which improved textures, anti-aliasing, and framerate, as well as restored other visual effects, but only for the PS3 version and only affected The 2nd Runner HD Edition.

Rumana (born July 18, 1964) is an Assyrian-American Republican Party politician, and was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly, where he represented the 40th legislative district from January 8, 2008 until his resignation on October 20, 2016. On October 20, 2016, he was confirmed by the New Jersey Senate as a judge of the New Jersey Superior Court for Passaic County. He has also served as the mayor and as a councilman in Wayne and is a former member of the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders. Biography Rumana is the descendant of an Assyrian tailor from Paterson. He was raised in Wayne where his interest in public service was sparked by his godfather Robert A. Roe, for whom Rumana later served as an intern while Roe was in Congress. Rumana was awarded a B.A. from Hartwick College with a major in management in 1987, and earned a J.D. from New York Law School in 1991. He is an attorney with the firm of Hunziker, Jones and Sweeney. A resident of Wayne, he is married to Laura and has one son. Early political career Rumana served on the Wayne Township Council from 1994 to 1996. He served until his appointment to the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders. In December 1996, Rumana was appointed to the Freeholder Board to replace Republican John C. Morley III, who resigned due to a conflict with him running the county's garbage collection agency. At the time of his appointment, the Republican Party had a majority of the seats on the Passaic County Freeholder Board. In his first bid for a full three-year term, Rumana finished in the top three in the 1997 election, joining Democratic newcomers Jim Gallagher and Lois A. Cuccinello; however, the majority control of the board shifted to the Democrats in this election. Due to the fall from grace of former Passaic County Chairman Peter Murphy and the resulting \\"corruption costs you money\\" campaign of the Democrats, Rumana finished fourth behind incumbents Gallagher and Cuccinello and newcomer Sonia Rosado in the 2000 election, losing his seat whilst filing a lawsuit against his opponents for allegedly tying Rumana to another county official under investigation. Rumana launched a successful comeback the next year defeating incumbent Wayne mayor Judy Orson in the June Republican primary then defeating Chris McIntyre in the general election. He was re-elected to the position in 2005 and in 2006 was elected to head the Passaic County Republican Committee, a position he held until 2012. Under Rumana's leadership as Passaic County Republican Chairman, the Democratic 7-0 hold on the freeholder board of the past decade was broken. Michael Marotta, Deborah Ciambrone and Ed O'Connell were elected to the Board of Chosen Freeholders and Kristen Corrado was also elected County Clerk during his tenure. Assembly career In 2007 upon the selection of Assemblyman Kevin J. O'Toole to run for a State Senate seat, Rumana was elected in the primary election along with incumbent David C. Russo to be the Republican candidates in the general election for the General Assembly in the 40th District. He was re-elected to two-year terms with Russo thereafter. Rumana served in the Assembly on the Environment and Solid Waste Committee, the Transportation and Independent Authorities Committee, and the Legislative Services Commission.Assemblyman Rumana's Legislative Webpage, New Jersey Legislature. Accessed October 21, 2016. He previously served as the Assistant Republican Leader from 2008 to 2009 and the Deputy Conference Leader/Policy Co-Chair in 2010 to 2011. Since 2012, he has been the Republican Whip in the Assembly. As a legislator, Rumana advanced opposition to Council on Affordable Housing mandates and the advancement of clean energy initiatives. Scott Rumana voted against a bill legalizing same sex marriage in 2012 and voted against the override of Governor Chris Christie's veto of the bill in 2013. In 2011, a former opponent in an Assembly election filed state ethics complaints against Rumana alleging that Rumana's appearance at a Board of Public Utilities advocating for a not- for-profit energy company grant was in conflict with his position as a state legislator. Though the Joint Legislation Committee on Ethics dismissed the charges in September 2011, a Superior Court judge overturned the dismissal in February 2012 claiming that the vote to dismiss was per the committee's bylaws. A state appellate court reinstated the dismissal of charges in 2013.

It contains the village of Weeton. Geography and administration The area is mostly rural. Weeton is in the Fylde parliamentary constituency and the Staining and Weeton electoral ward. The parish covers an area of east of Blackpool, and has a population of 1,096,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Fylde Retrieved 7 February 2010 decreasing to 656 at the 2011 census. Preese ‚Äî which has recognition in the official name ‚Äî has no separate measurement while Mythop (or less commonly Mythorp) has its area recorded as . Mythop, not recognised in the parish name, is divided from Weeton by mossland and the track of the Preston to Blackpool railway. In the east, Weeton occupies most of the southern half of the parish, with Mythop in the south western corner, the northern half containing Preese on the west and Swarbrick on the east. Watson argues that these sub-manors ‚Äî each with its own hall ‚Äî may be based on the ancient pre-Conquest quarterland divisions characteristic of the Irish Sea cultural basin of Celtic North Wales and the Isle of Man. Each of the four manors occupies an area of slightly higher ground, each divided from the others by depressions: Weeton is above sea level, Swarbrick and Preese and Mythop . In an unpublished article, Watson (1994) \\"chases the shadows left on the ground\\" by suggesting that \\"the Manx Balla or Treen and the Welsh Tref offer a model for the Lancastrian township with its fourfold manorial division of approximately five thousand acres of land\\". Although the modern day Weeton with Preese is just over half this size, Watson argues that \\"the documentary facts support the still discernible evidence of the quarterland skeletal frame of the townships surviving from the days of the comital estates. The evidence is further bolstered by the existence of four principal houses in most of the lowland and non-vaccary townships in the Amounderness Hundred\\". A road from Kirkham goes west and then north to Weeton and through Swarbrick to Singleton. From Weeton a road goes west through Mythop to Marton and Blackpool, another east to Greenhalgh and another south to Great Plumpton. The main road from Preston to Fleetwood runs north-west through the parish and the branch line to Blackpool crosses the south-west corner (cutting beneath the Mythop Road, south-east of Westfield Cottages). History Remains of Weeton Windmill The place-name Weeton ‚Äî first recorded in the Domesday Book as Widetun ‚Äî derives from the Old English wi√∞ig (willow) and -t≈´n (settlement).Victor Watts (ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v. WEETON (1). The village presumably derived its name from the presence of indigenous or farmed willows. To this day, there are fine specimens of willow trees in Weeton. After 1066, the lordship of Weeton passed from the Northumbrian Earl Tostig to the Norman warlord Roger of Poitou. Weeton‚Äôs value at this time was assessed at \\"two carucates\\" (an area of arable land that could be worked in one day by two ploughteams). Some time after the Domesday survey, the lordship of Weeton passed to the Butler family, early lords of Amounderness, who in 1328 became the Earls of Ormonde. the fourteenth century, the Butlers owned extensive lands, mills and fisheries in the manors of Weeton, Little Marton, Treales, Wesham, Mowbreck, Greenhalgh, Thistleton, Out Rawcliffe, Bradkirk, Medlar and Esprick. The manors of Weeton, Preese, Mythop and Swarbrick were acquired by Sir Thomas Stanley of Lathom, later the first Earl of Derby, in 1400. They continued as part of the family estate until 1955. In the nineteenth century, the Earl of Derby commonly used the title ‚ÄòBaron of Weeton‚Äô. The title is no longer used and although there is evidence it may also have been used by Theobald Walter in the twelfth century, Weeton‚Äôs status as a barony was it seems always a matter of dispute. By 1522, the estate had expanded to include the manors of Treales, Wesham, Out Rawcliffe, Little Marton, Greenhalgh, Plumpton and other lands. On 4 October 1637, William, 6th Earl of Derby, surrendered to James, Lord Strange, the manor of Weeton and various other ones, to enable him to make leases. In 1670, a charter from Charles II granted Weeton an annual fair for the sale of cattle and small wares to take place on the Tuesday and Wednesday following Trinity Sunday Tolls were to be paid to the Earl of Derby and are recorded in the Bailiff ‚Äôs Accounts for the manor from 1682 (they amounted to ¬£4 12s in that year). During the seventeenth century, a weekly fair also took place in the parish. The Trinity fair began to falter in the 1920s as local cattle-farmers sought richer markets for their stock. The fair was eventually reduced to a huddle of bring-and-buy stalls on the triangular \\"goose green\\" at the centre of the village, and was eventually replaced by the annual Gala. The village also had a windmill, Weeton Windmill, which was built in 1812. It fell into disrepair and was demolished in the 1950s. One of the most notable local families were the Jollys of Mythop who dominated village life for more than three hundred years. Members of the family were largely responsible for the draining of Marton Mere in the eighteenth century. Their most renowned son was Edward Jolly (1664‚Äì1738) declared Master of Mythop in 1715 for his exploits in the Battle of Preston (known colloquially as the Preston Fight). The family was also related to Major James Jolly, Oliver Cromwell's Provost-Marshal General for Lancashire, and Thomas Jolly, founder of Congregationalism.http://www.mythop.co.uk Modern day village The village green, with the Eagle and Child in the background The village has one church, St. Michael's, and one primary school, Weeton St. Michael's Church of England Junior School. The one public house in the village, the Eagle & Child, dates back to 1585 and takes its name from the family crest of local landowner Lord Derby. In front of the pub stands the old mounting steps, dating back to 1755 and the only part of the premises which are officially listed. During the years of the English Civil War Cromwell is reputed to have stayed at the premises. Each year the village hosts the Weeton Gala with a parade through the village and a garden party.

Built to the designs of James Pennethorne, it was consecrated as an Anglican place of worship called Christ Church in 1837. It became an Orthodox cathedral in 1989. Description The building, designed by James Pennethorne, stands on the corner of Redhill Street (formerly Edward Street) and Albany Street. It is not strictly orientated, its ceremonial east end, with the altar, facing slightly west of north. It is rectangular in plan, and built of brick with stucco and stone dressings, its four corners emphasised by wide tower-like features, projecting slightly beyond the main lines of the walls. The architecture is broadly classical in style. A deep stucco entablature runs around the whole building, with a simple brick parapet above it. The windows are round-headed. There is a tower above the entrance, topped by an octagonal spire. The steeple is unusually small in comparison with the main body of the church. History Anglican church  It was built as an Anglican church to serve the largely working class district of Cumberland Market. Consecrated on 13 July 1837, it established itself firmly within the high church Oxford Movement. Its first incumbent, William Dodsworth, previously of the Margaret Street Chapel, resigned on his conversion to Roman Catholicism. On the recommendation of the painter William Collins R.A, a copy of Raphael's Transfiguration by Thomas Brigstocke was purchased as an altarpiece. Alterations were made to the church between 1839 and 1843 by the architect R.C. Carpenter, and further changes, including the installation of an elaborate inlaid marble floor, were made in 1867 by William Butterfield. Christ Church was frequented by Christina Rossetti who lived in Albany Street for a couple of years. Her brother Dante Gabriel Rossetti produced a stained-glass window depicting the Sermon on the Mount for the church (a second version is elsewhere).William Morris and Selsley Church. Examples of Morris & Co's stained glass and the genesis of the Arts and Craft movement in the Cotswolds A school grew up on Redhill Street near the church, called Christ Church Primary School. On 26 January 1950 the funeral service of George Orwell, was held at the church, as it was near to both Middlesex Hospital where he died and BBC Broadcasting House, where he worked. In 1974, the Albany Consort, an early music group, was founded at the church. The church was designated a Grade II* listed building on 10 June 1954. Orthodox cathedral In 1989 Christ Church ceased to be a place of Anglican worship and became St George's Cathedral. With St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate in the City of London it is one of two Antiochan churches in London. A new roof was built in 2000.

The fort rises above the sea level and is located in the Sahyadri mountain range. There are approximately 1737 steps leading to the fort. The Raigad Ropeway, an aerial tramway exists.The height of this ropeway is 400 meters in height and 750 meters in length and takes only 4 minutes. In 1765 the fort was an armed campaign by British east Indian Company. Finally, on 9 May 1818 fort was looted and destroyed by British.The rope-way facility is available at Raigad Fort, to reach at the fort from ground in few minutes. History The Ghats from Ryghur Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj seized the fort in 1656, then known as the fort of Rairi from Chandraraoji More, The King of Jawali. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj renovated and expanded the fort of Rairi and renamed it as Raigad (King's Fort). It became the capital of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Maratha Empire. The villages of Pachad & Raigadwadi are located at the base of the Raigad fort. These two villages were considered very important during the Maratha rule in Raigad. The actual climb to the top of the Raigad fort starts from Pachad. During Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's rule, A cavalry of 10,000 was always kept on standby in Pachad village. Shivaji also built another fort Lingana around 2 miles away from Raigad. The Lingana fort was used to keep prisoners. In 1689, Zulfikhar Khan captured Raigad and Aurangzeb renamed it as Islamgad. In 1707, Siddi Fathekan captured the fort and held it until 1733. After 1733 maratha sardar captured raigad again and hold it until 1818. In 1765, The fort of Raigad along with Malwan in present Sindhudurg District, the southernmost district of Maharashtra, was the target of an armed expedition by the British East India Company, which considered it a piratical stronghold. In 1818, the fort was bombarded and destroyed by cannons from the hill of Kalkai. And on 9 May 1818, as per the treaty, it was handed over to the British East India Company. Major features The Maha Darwaja The Samadhi of Jijabai The Raigad Fort was built by Shivaji and the chief architect/engineer was Hiroji Indulkar. The main palace was constructed using wood, of which only the base pillars remain. The main fort ruins consist of the queen's quarters, six chambers, with each chamber having its own private restroom. In addition, ruins of three watch towers can be seen directly in front of the palace grounds out of which only two remain as the third one was destroyed during a bombardment. The Raigad Fort also has ruins of a market which was accessible to horseback riders. The fort also overlooks an artificial lake known as the Ganga Sagar Lake. The only main pathway to the fort passes through the \\"Maha Darwaja\\" (Huge Door) which was previously closed at sunset. The Maha Darwaja has two huge bastions on both sides of the door which are approximately 65‚Äì70 feet in height. The top of the fort is 600 ft above this door. The King's Darbar, inside the Raigad Fort has a replica of the original throne that faces the main doorway called the Nagarkhana Darwaja. This enclosure had been acoustically designed to aid hearing from the doorway to the throne. A secondary entrance, called the Mena Darwaja, was supposedly the private entrance for the royal ladies of the fort that lead to the queen's quarters. The convoy of the king and the king himself used the Palkhi Darwaja. To the right of Palkhi Darwaja, is a row of three dark and deep chambers. Historians believe that these were the granaries for the fort.Write-up from the Raigad ropeway From the fort, one can view the execution point called Takmak Tok, a cliff from which sentenced prisoners were thrown to their death. This area has been fenced off. The statue of Chatrapati Shivaji is erected in front of the ruins of the main market avenue that leads to the Jagdishwar Mandir and his own Samadhi and that of his loyal dog named Waghya. The Samadhi of Jijabai,Chatrapati Shivaji's mother, can be seen at base village of Pachad. Additional famous attractions of the fort include the Khubladha Buruj, Nane Darwaja and the Hatti Talav (Elephant Lake). Hirakani Buruj The fort has a famous wall called \\"Hirakani Buruj\\" (Hirakani Bastion) constructed over a huge steep cliff. The legend goes \\"that a woman by the name of Hirakani from a nearby village had come to sell milk to the people living at the fort. She happened to be inside the fort when the gates got closed and locked at sunset. Hearing the cries of her infant son back at the village echo after nightfall, the anxious mother couldn't wait till dawn and courageously climbed down the steep cliff in pitch darkness all for the love of her little one. She later repeated this extraordinary feat in front of Shivaji and was bravely rewarded for it.\\" In appreciation of her courage and bravery, Shivaji built the Hirakani Bastion over this cliff.

Upstairs are 14 bunks and a lounge area; downstairs is the galley and a second lounge area. Jumbocruiser 2012 Ayats Bravo sleeper coach JU11BUS Bunks in a Jumbocruiser Ayats band bus Sleeper coaches are often used for work other than with bands. This one was used to shuttle England football fans to and from the 2006 World Cup in Germany. A sleeper bus, also known in the US as an entertainer coach and in Europe as a nightliner, is a type of specially adapted coach, often used to transport bands and their technicians and road crew between cities and shows. Other terms used are band bus, crew bus, entertainer bus, NightRider, sleeper coach, and tour bus. In Europe, such vehicles are full-sized coaches but are designed internally to carry only between 8 and 18 passengers. There are always full galley facilities, comfortable lounges and bunk beds to allow the passengers to eat, relax and sleep during the journey to the next gig or concert. Such vehicles sometimes have blacked out or mirrored windows, allowing passengers to see out, but preventing fans from peering in. They are well equipped, as the comfort of the passengers is paramount. DVD players, large screen TV, and game systems are now the norm, while some vehicles even have personal DVD players and screens in each bunk. Well-known bands such as Bon Jovi or U2 may use as many as seven or eight sleeper buses on their tours to accommodate the many road crew members required. However, such bands themselves rarely travel on the bus but usually use air transport or limousines or a luxury splitter Tour Bus, leaving their crew members to travel by bus. Smaller, less well- known bands will usually travel on the bus along with their tech crew. Sleeper coaches have come a long way from the old days, when ex-National Express coaches were retired into sleeper coach use. Now, the leading companies are buying new coaches, which, after fitting out, cost over ¬£350,000 (), though the rates for these coaches are not much more than conventional coaches. Both in the United Kingdom and the United States, there has been an increase of expectations: TV and video games in every bunk, 3G internet access, coffee machines, wide memory foam mattresses, decent air conditioning, etc. Some travel companies use them as mobile hotels, taking tourists to locations where there is no hotel or there are long distances overnight. China In China, sleeper buses are a common means of long-distance transportation. They are slightly more expensive than trains, but also a little faster, and tickets are more readily available. There have been a number of fatal crashes involving these buses in China. Due to increased safety incident, sleeper bus was banned from registration start 2012. India In India, these buses are used for inter city travel and are operated by both the government and private bus companies. They are operated between cities which are 6 hours to 10 hours apart by road. The journeys usually start late in the evening or at midnight and are scheduled so that most of the travel is at night. This service is a good alternative to trains, as seats in trains get booked well in advance. Also, these buses are seldom filled beyond capacity. Several State Transport units such as the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and the State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) also operate sleeper bus services. United Kingdom Sleeper services, open to the general public, are known to have existed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. At least two such services operated, from London to Liverpool (The Albatross Sleeping Car Co.) and London to Manchester/Liverpool, run by a company called Land Liners Ltd. But the vogue passed, until 2011. On August 2, 2011, the Stagecoach Group announced it was launching a new Sleeper coach service, open to the general public, using 'bendybuses'. This service is operated under the Megabus brand, offering overnight travel on a budget. Trial journeys started on 5 September 2011. The service officially started on 21 October 2011. The service was officially terminated on 21 May 2017 with the company stating that while \\"the service was popular, unfortunately, the overall level of demand dropped\\".

Most horses have some markings, and they help to identify the horse as a unique individual. Markings are present at birth and do not change over the course of the horse's life. Most markings have pink skin underneath most of the white hairs, though a few faint markings may occasionally have white hair with no underlying pink skin. Markings may appear to change slightly when a horse grows or sheds its winter coat, however this difference is simply a factor of hair coat length; the underlying pattern does not change. On a gray horse, markings visible at birth may become hidden as the horse turns white with age, but markings can still be determined by trimming the horse's hair closely, then wetting down the coat to see where there is pink skin and black skin under the hair. Recent studies have examined the genetics behind white markings and have located certain genetic loci that influence their expression.http://www.thehorse.com/articles/32985/genetics-behind-horses-face- and-leg-markings-studied In addition to white markings on a base coat, there are other markings or patterns that are used to identify horses as with Appaloosa, Pinto or Brindle, as well as artificial markings such as branding. Types of white markings Facial markings Facial markings are usually described by shape and location. There may be more than one distinct facial marking and if so, will be named separately. Occasionally, when a white marking extends over an eye, that eye may be blue instead of brown, though this is not consistently seen in all cases. Facial markings. Top row, L-R: blaze, stripe, stripe (or thin blaze) and nose, irregular blaze, interrupted stripe, bald face. Bottom row, L-R: faint star, star, star and strip, irregular star, snip, lip masking. Common facial markings are: *Blaze: a wide white stripe down the middle of the face. *Strip, stripe, or race: a narrow white stripe down the middle of the face. *Bald Face: a very wide blaze, extending to or past the eyes. Some, but not all, bald faced horses also have blue eyes. *Star: a white marking between or above the eyes. If a stripe or blaze is present, a star must be significantly wider than the vertical marking to be designated separately. *Snip: a white marking on the muzzle, between the nostrils. Additional terms used to describe facial markings include the following: *Faint: A small but permanent marking that usually consists of white hairs without any underlying pink skin. *Interrupted: A marking, usually a strip or blaze, that is broken and not solid for the entire length of the face. *Connected: Occasionally used to describe distinctively different markings that happen to be joined to one another *Irregular or crooked: A marking, usually a strip or blaze, that does not have a more or less straight path. *Lip markings: have no specialized names, usually are described by location, such as \\"lower lip,\\" \\"chin\\", etc. Lip markings may indicate presence of the sabino color pattern. Leg markings Leg markings. Top row, L-R: Stocking, Sock or Boot, Fetlock or Sock. Bottom row, L-R: Pastern, Coronet, Partial Pastern Leg markings are usually described by the highest point of the horse's leg that is covered by white. As a general rule, the horse's hoof beneath a white marking at the coronary line will also be light-colored (\\"white\\"). If a horse has a partial marking or ermine spots at the coronary band, the hoof may be both dark and light, corresponding with the hair coat immediately above. Where the leopard gene is present, the hoof may be striped even if markings are not visible at the coronary band. From tallest to shortest, common leg markings are: *Stocking: white marking that extends at least to the bottom of the knee or hock, sometimes higher. *Sock: white marking that extends higher than the fetlock but not as high as the knee or hock. This marking is sometimes called a \\"boot.\\" *Fetlock or Sock: white marking that extends over the fetlock, occasionally called a \\"boot.\\" *Pastern: white marking that extends above the top of the hoof, but stops below the fetlock. *Coronet: white just above the hoof, around coronary band, usually no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the hoof. Additional terms used to describe white leg markings include: *Irregular: A marking within the broad confines of a given height, but with significantly uneven edges. Indicated by the highest point of the white. Most often used to describe certain types of stockings. *Partial: An irregular marking that only extends up part of the leg to the height indicated, sometimes with the other side of the leg dark. Usually used to describe socks and other short markings. *\\"High White:\\" White stockings that extend above the knee or hock, sometimes extending past the stifle onto the flank or belly, considered characteristic of the sabino color pattern.

Chestnut horses generally have more extensive white markings than bay or black horses. Horses with the W20 allele typically have white face and leg markings. Non-white markings *Bend-Or spots: Dark faint spotting, usually seen on horses with a Chestnut or Palomino coat color. *Ermine marks: The occurrence of black marks on a white marking, most often seen on leg markings just above the hoof. May cause the hoof to be striped. *\\"Medicine hat\\": An unusual type of Pinto or Paint coloring where the horse has dark ears and poll (like a hat on the head), but surrounded on all sides of the head and neck by white.Medicine Hat horses *Shield: A dark Pinto marking where the horse has a dark colored chest, surrounded completely by white on the shoulders, legs, belly and neck. Occasionally used to describe the rarer example of a horse with a totally dark head surrounded completely by white. Other markings This horse has a belly spot. It also has a blaze and three stockings Horses may have isolated body spots that are not large or numerous enough to qualify them as an Appaloosa, Pinto or Paint. Such markings are usually simply called \\"body spots,\\" sometimes identified by location, i.e. \\"belly spot,\\" \\"flank spot,\\" etc. When this type of isolated spotting occurs, it usually involves sabino genetics. Horses may develop white markings over areas where there was an injury to the animal, either to cover scar tissue from a cut or abrasion, or to reflect harm to the underlying skin or nerves. One common type of scarring that produces patches of white hairs are \\"saddle marks,\\" which are round or oval marks on either side of the withers, produced by a pinching saddle that had been worn over a long period of time. Natural markings Birdcatcher spots are small white spots, about the size of a dime to the size of a quarter. They have not been linked to any specific breed, but they do tend to run in families. These spots may occur late in a horse's life, or may occur and then disappear. The spots may look like scars, but they are not caused by skin damage. The name comes from a Thoroughbred horse named Birdcatcher, who had similar flecks of white on his flank and tail. Ticking or rabicano involves white flecks of hair at the flank, and white hairs at the base of the tail. The most minimal form can have only striped white frosting at the base of the tail, called a coon tail or skunk tail. Flecks of white on the root of the tail or scattered over the flanks may also be called Birdcatcher ticks. Scarring, skin disease and injury Scarring on a horse usually results in white hairs growing in over the injured area, though occasionally there may be no hair growth over the scar at all. *Rainscald or Dermatophilus congolensis can leave a horse with small white spots, especially along the topline. *Roan horses often develop patches of solid (dark) hair on the roan sections of their bodies wherever there has been any scratch or damage to underlying skin, even if only slight. These are sometimes called \\"corn marks\\" or \\"corn spots.\\" *A type of deliberate human-created scarring that results in white hair is Freeze branding, a method of permanently marking a horse for identification purposes. Some forms of hot branding may also scar lightly enough to leave white hairs rather than bare skin. *Leg scars left from pin firing or bar firing, in which an injury is blistered with hot iron, can leave dots or lines of white hair in a very distinct pattern. This is usually seen on Thoroughbreds that have raced. This treatment is not commonly practiced, but such markings are still occasionally seen. *Scars from accidents, as well as old injury sites (such as bowed tendons), can also be used to identify a horse. *Saddle marks may be seen on the back or withers as a patch of white hairs, usually a result of wearing an improperly-fitted saddle for long periods, but also could be related to straightforward long- term saddle wear, unclean saddle blankets and other causes. White marks just forward of the withers may be the result of an ill-fitting horse blanket worn for a long period of time.

Other identifying features A tovero horse with blue eyes and \\"Medicine hat\\" markings. Horses can be uniquely identified by more than just markings or brands. A few other physical characteristics sometimes used to distinguish a horse from another are: *Whorls, colloquially known as \\"cowlicks\\": divergent or convergent patches of hair found anywhere on the body but mostly on the head, neck, chest, belly, or just in front of the stifles. *\\"Glass\\" eye, \\"Moon\\" eye, \\"China\\" eye, \\"Wall\\" eye or \\"Night\\" eye: A blue eye. Horses with blue eyes are less common than horses with brown eyes, but can see equally well. *Chestnuts: A callous-like area on the inside of the horse's leg that has a subtle pattern, but one unique to each horse. It has been proposed that chestnuts could be used as a type of \\"fingerprint\\" to identify a horse, but the idea has failed to become widespread in practice, probably in part because the chestnut continually grows and sheds, making precise measurement a challenge. Coat colors with distinctive patterns brindle chestnut Some horse coat colors are distinguished by unique patterns. However, even for horses with coat colors that are arranged in a manner unique to each individual horse, these patterns are not called \\"markings.\\" Some coat colors partially distinguished by unique patterning include: *Bay: A horse coat color that features black point coloration on a red base coat. All bay horses have a black mane, tail and legs (except where overlain by white markings), caused by the presence of the agouti gene. Most have black hairs along the edges of their ears and on their muzzles, and occasionally will have a slight darkening of the hairs along their backbone. *Brindle: An extremely rare horse coat pattern; it typically features faint vertical striping in a shade slightly diluted from the base coat color. Brindling may be associated with chimerism. *Dun: A horse coat color that features primitive markings: a slightly darker hair shade from the base coat located in a dorsal stripe along the horse's backbone, horizontal striping on the upper legs and sometimes transverse striping across the shoulders. These markings identify a horse as a dun as opposed to a buckskin or a bay. *Leopard complex: Responsible for a variety of patterns, typically leopard-type spotting, and is most closely identified with the Appaloosa breed. *Pinto: A horse coat color that is distinguished by one of several possible broad spotting patterns, as opposed to the smaller spots typical of the Appaloosa. Variations include Piebald, Skewbald, Overo, Tobiano, Tovero and Sabino. *Roan: A horse coat color that features white and dark hairs intermingled together, but the horse has head and legs of the base color with very little white. Roans sometimes have dark areas on their coats similar to Bend-Or spots, called \\"corn marks\\".

They have a peculiar distribution, restricted to the Old World tropics of South East Asia to Australasia and Madagascar. The three subfamilies exhibit both day- and night-flying behaviour. The mainly day-flying Callidulinae can be distinguished by their resting posture, which is the most butterfly-like, with the wings held closely over the back. Resembling the butterfly family Lycaenidae, these moths can be told apart by their antennae which taper to a point or may be very subtly clubbed. The more often night-flying Pterothysaninae and Griveaudiinae have a different adult resting posture (the latter roof-like in repose) and these were not placed within the Callidulidae until recently.Minet, J.

Caneworking refers to the process of making cane, and also to the use of pieces of cane, lengthwise, in the blowing process to add intricate, often spiral, patterns and stripes to vessels or other blown glass objects. Cane is also used to make murrine (singular ‚Äò‚Äômurrina‚Äô‚Äô, sometimes called mosaic glass), thin discs cut from the cane in cross-section that are also added to blown or hot-worked objects. A particular form of murrine glasswork is millefiori (‚Äúthousand flowers‚Äù), in which many murrine with a flower-like or star-shaped cross-section are included in a blown glass piece. Caneworking is an ancient technique, first invented in southern Italy in the second half of the third century BC, and elaborately developed centuries later on the Italian island of Murano. Making cane There are several different methods of making cane. In each, the fundamental technique is the same: a lump of glass, often containing some pattern of colored and clear glass, is heated in a furnace (glory hole) and then pulled, by means of a long metal rod (punty) attached at each end. As the glass is stretched out, it retains whatever cross-sectional pattern was in the original lump, but narrows quite uniformly along its length (due to the skill of the glassblowers doing the pulling, aided by the fact that if the glass becomes narrower at some point along the length, it cools more there and thus becomes stiffer). Cane is usually pulled until it reaches roughly the diameter of a pencil,This diameter is small enough that the finished cane can be broken into short lengths or into murrine without a cutting tool, and it is convenient for picking up on a blowpipe. Contemporary glass artists sometimes use cane of larger diameter to make large murrine, which must be cut from the cane with a diamond saw. when, depending on the size of the original lump, it may be anywhere from one to fifty feet in length. After cooling, it is broken into sections usually from four to six inches long, which can then be used in making more complex canes or in other glassblowing techniques. The simplest cane, called vetro a fili (glass with threads) is clear glass with one or more threads of colored (often white) glass running its length. It is commonly made by heating and shaping a chunk of clear, white, or colored glass on the end of a punty, and then ‚Äò‚Äôgathering‚Äô‚Äô molten clear glass over the color by dipping the punty in a furnace containing the clear glass. After the desired amount of clear glass is surrounding the color, this cylinder of hot glass is then shaped, cooled and heated until uniform in shape and temperature. Simultaneously an assistant prepares a 'post' which is another punty with a small platform of clear glass on the end. The post is pressed against the end of the hot cylinder of glass to connect them, and the glassblower (or ‚Äògaffer‚Äô) and assistant walk away from each other with the punties, until the cane is stretched to the desired length and diameter. The cane cools within minutes and is cut into small sections. Variations in cane making Close-up of ballotini cane forming a part of a blown vessel A simple single-thread cane can then be used to make more complex canes. A small bundle of single-thread canes can be heated until they fuse, or heated canes, laid parallel, can be picked up on the circumference of a hot cylinder of clear or colored glass. This bundle, treated just as the chunk of color in the description above, is cased in clear glass and pulled out, forming a vetro a fili cane with multiple threads and perhaps a clear or solid color core. If the cane is twisted as it is pulled, the threads take a spiral shape called vetro a retorti (twisted glass) or zanfirico. Ballotini is a cane technique in which several vetro a fili canes are picked up while laid side-by-side rather than a bundle, with a clear glass gather over them. This gather is shaped into a cylinder with the canes directed along the axis, so that the canes form a sort of ‚Äúfence‚Äù across the diameter of the cylinder. When this is simultaneously twisted and pulled, the resulting cane has a helix of threads across its thickness. A small (1 ¬Ω‚Äù) disc of millefiori-patterned glass. Each of the stars and flowers is a cross- section of a cane Another technique for forming cane is to use optic molds to make more complex cross sections. An optic mold is an open-ended cone-shaped mold with some sort of lobed or star shape around its inside circumference. When a gather or partially blown bubble is forced into the mold, its outside takes the shape of the mold. Canes with complicated, multi-colored patterns are formed by placing layers of different or alternating colors over a solid- color core, using various optic molds on the layers as they are built. Because the outer layers are hotter than those inside when the molds are used, the mold shape is impressed into the outer color without deforming the inner shapes. Canes made in this way are used in making millefiori. Discs from eight different canes have been used to make the pendant in the photo. Finally, flameworkers sometimes make cane by building up the cross-section using ordinary flameworking or bead making techniques. This permits very subtle gradations of color and shading, and is the way murrine portraits are usually made. Cane use The generic term for blown glass made using canes in the lengthwise direction is filigrano (filigree glass), as contrasted with murrine when the canes are sliced and used in cross-section. (An older term is latticino, which has fallen into disuse). One way glassblowers incorporate cane into their work is to line up canes on a steel or ceramic plate and heat them slowly to avoid cracking. When the surfaces of the canes just begin to melt, the canes adhere to each other. The tip of a glassblowing pipe (blowpipe) is covered with a 'collar' of clear molten glass, and touched to one corner of the aligned canes. The tip of the blowpipe is then rolled along the bottom of the canes, which stick to the collar, aligned cylindrically around the edge of the blowpipe. They are heated further until soft enough to shape. The cylinder of canes is sealed at the bottom with jacks and tweezers, to form the beginning of a bubble. The bubble is then blown using traditional glassblowing techniques. Cane can also be incorporated in larger blown glass work by picking it up on a bubble of molten clear glass. This technique involves the gaffer creating a bubble from molten clear glass while an assistant heats the pattern of cane. When the cane design is fused and at the correct temperature and the bubble is exactly the correct size and temperature, the bubble is rolled over the cane pattern, which sticks to the hot glass. The bubble must be the right size and temperature for the pattern to cover it fully without any gaps or trapping air. Once the canes have been picked up, the bubble can be further heated, blown, and smoothed and shaped on the marver to give whatever final shape the glassblower wishes, with an embedded lacy pattern from the canes. Twisting the object as it is being shaped imparts a spiral shape to the overall pattern. Close-up of reticello vessel blown by artist David Patchen The classical reticello pattern is a small uniform mesh of white threads in clear glass, with a tiny air bubble in every mesh rectangle. To make an object in this pattern, the glassblower first uses white single-thread vetro a fili canes to blow a cylindrical cup shape, twisting as he forms it so the canes are in a spiral, and using care not to totally smooth the inside ribbing that remains from the canes. Setting this cup aside (usually keeping it warm in a furnace, below its softening point), he then makes another closed cylinder in the same pattern, but twisted in the opposite direction, and retaining some of the ribbing on the cylinder‚Äôs outside. When this cylinder is the right size, the glassblower plunges it into the warm cup, without touching any of the sides until it is inserted all the way. Air is trapped in the spaces between the ribs of the two pieces, forming the uniformly spaced air bubbles. The piece may then be blown out and shaped as desired. The term reticello is often loosely applied to any criss-cross pattern, whether vetro a fili or vetro a retorti , white or colored, and with or without air bubbles. See Murrine and Millefiori for information about these techniques.

Personal life Cunningham married Susie Ann Rockett on September 14, 1931, in Galena, Illinois. They had five children, eighteen grandchildren and seventeen great-grandchildren. Death After Cunningham died in 1980, the Winnebago Council (the successor to the Wapsipinicon Area Council) made inquiries to the National Council of the BSA to determine if he was indeed the first black Eagle Scout. Since Cunningham had earned Eagle Scout fourteen years after the first Eagle Scout was awarded and National did not track ethnicity, there has been no way to validate the claim.

The firm was founded in 1883 and now has more than 600 lawyers, including 170 partners, based in 20 offices across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. History HFW was founded in 1883, and its early expertise was representing maritime clients following shipwrecks and collisions. It has since broadened its practice to focus on six core sectors globally: aerospace, commodities, construction, energy and resources, insurance and reinsurance, and shipping. In June 2017, the firm changed its name from Holman Fenwick Willan to HFW. HFW was one of the first London-based law firms to expand internationally, opening its first international office in 1977, in Paris. A year later, it became one of the first international law firms to open an office in Hong Kong. HFW then launched in Singapore in 1990, Piraeus in 1993 and Shanghai in 1999. It moved into Australia and the Middle East in 2006, opening offices in Melbourne and Dubai. HFW subsequently expanded its Australia presence, launching offices in Sydney in 2009 and Perth in 2011. It also opened offices in Brussels in 2009, Geneva in 2010 and S√£o Paulo in 2011. In June 2016, HFW became only the second international law firm to enter into a formal association with a Chinese law firm under the Shanghai Free Trade Zone rules. In January 2017, the firm merged with US law firm Legge, Farrow, Kimmitt, McGrath & Brown. This was notable for being a fully integrated merger, whereas most transatlantic law firm combinations at the time used the Swiss Verein structure. In June 2018, HFW expanded its Latin America presence by entering into a cooperation arrangement with a new Brazilian law firm, Costa, Albino & Lasalvia (CAL). In October 2018, the firm opened in Abu Dhabi with the hire of two partners from Reed Smith. The move meant HFW had 19 partners and more than 50 lawyers - including 28 Arabic speakers - in four offices across the Middle East, making it one of the largest practices of any international law firm in the region. HFW also has an office in Riyadh, and is one of only two international law firms with a base in Kuwait City. In August 2019, the firm launched in Monaco with the hire of a market-leading team from Ince.  Core sectors and services  HFW is unusual for an international law firm in that it is focused on sectors, rather than practice areas. The firm's entire business, from legal services to CSR and pro bono, is built around six core sectors globally: Sectors * Aerospace * Commodities * Construction * Energy and Resources * Insurance and Reinsurance * Shipping The firm also offers a broad range of legal services: Services * Dispute Resolution *Corporate *Finance * EU, Competition and Regulatory * Fraud and Insolvency * International Trade Regulation * Commercial * Cyber Security *Data Protection *Digital Trade *Employment *Financial Institutions *Financial Services Regulation *Government Services *Logistics *Mining *Oil and Gas *Ports and Terminals *Projects The firm has one of the largest and most active disputes practices in the market, covering litigation, international arbitration and alternative forms of dispute resolution. HFW was the most active law firm in the English Commercial Court in 2017 and 2018, according to The Lawyer's Litigation Tracker. It is also the most active law firm for arbitration-related litigation and one of the most active firms litigating on behalf of FTSE 100 clients. Awards and recognition HFW featured in the 2019 Social Mobility Employer Index, which lists the UK organisations taking the most action to tackle social mobility. HFW was also ranked in the index, which is produced by UK charity the Social Mobility Foundation, in 2017 and 2018.

The municipality is governed by a mayor (elected at large) and a sixteen-person Regional Council, who are elected by geographic district; municipal elections occur every leap year. The Halifax Regional Council has also established smaller \\"community councils\\" wherein three or more councilors from a geographic area agree to form these councils to deal primarily with local development issues. Most community council decisions are subject to final approval by regional council. The Halifax Regional Council has responsibility for the Halifax Regional Police, Halifax Public Libraries, Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency, Halifax Regional Water Commission, Halifax Transit, parks and recreation, public works and waste management. Emergency services Two areas of contention during the post-amalgamation years have been in the areas of police and fire services. Police services Halifax Regional Police is an amalgamation of the municipal forces from the City of Halifax, City of Dartmouth, and Town of Bedford. Areas that were formerly part of the Municipality of the County of Halifax were policed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) under a provincial policing contract. Since amalgamation, HRP has been restricted to patrolling the former cities of Halifax and Dartmouth, the Sambro loop and the town of Bedford, while the RCMP provide rural policing services as well as highway traffic enforcement. Jurisdictional boundaries have been relaxed in recent years, allowing more integration between both forces to allow for better coverage and response. Fire services Unlike policing services, Halifax Fire and Emergency (HRFE) is an amalgamation of all fire departments in Halifax County. This created some controversy in rural areas where predominantly volunteer fire companies were being stripped of equipment and trucks which local communities had fund-raised for during the pre-amalgamation period; this equipment was being relocated to service the urban core. This has since been halted, although there is still some tension between the professional paid HRFE members in the urban core and their volunteer rural counterparts. Municipal budget Since its creation, rapid property value increases and new construction have resulted in HRM's budget growing to $589 million in 2005/06, up from $439 million in 1996. This has allowed HRM to proceed with major capital projects such as an extension of municipally-supplied water to Fall River, breaking ground on the new sewage treatment system (Harbour Solutions), and establishment of Metrolink, a bus rapid transit system. Federal representation The Halifax Regional Municipality is represented by the following federal ridings: _Halifax Metropolitan Area_ * Halifax * Halifax West _Dartmouth Metropolitan Area_ * Dartmouth‚ÄîCole Harbour _Bedford_ * Halifax West _Rest of the municipality_ * Halifax West * Sackville‚ÄîEastern Shore * Central Nova * Cumberland‚ÄîColchester‚ÄîMusquodoboit Valley * South Shore‚ÄîSt. Margaret's Provincial representation In the last three provincial elections over 50% of the population of HRM who voted, has voted for the provincial New Democratic Party (NDP), placing the region's voters outside the mainstream of provincial politics in outlying more rural areas which are split between a Liberal/Conservative voting pattern. It can be argued that HRM's recent voting pattern has actually placed the provincial (and federal) NDP or social democratic politics in general, into the political mainstream for the province. That being said, a majority of the people voted for the Liberals this past election.

Although now in Gloucestershire, Redmarley was in Worcestershire until 1931. Governance The village falls in the 'Redmarley' electoral ward. This ward stretches south to Pauntley. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 1,856. Great Domesday The King, William the Conqueror, received a report on Redmarley D'Abitot in the Domesday Book of 1086 though it would have been a very small part of his nationwide review of tax assessments.

About 2000 to 3000 troops were involved and Royalist leader General Mynn was killed. Name origin The name Redmarley comes from 'woodland clearing with a reedy pond', from the Old English words hr√´od and l√´ah.Mills, A. D. (1991): A Dictionary of English Place-Names, Oxford University Press. An alternative cod-derivation has been suggested as from the local red heavy clay or marl.Redmarley D'Abitot at genuki.com The difficulty with this explanation is that the word marl entered the language many centuries later. D'Abitot is thought to come from Urse d'Abetot, who was Sheriff of Worcestershire and who held the manor in 1086.Domesday Book Sometimes a circumflex is placed on the 'o' of d'Abitot, but this usage has been criticised. As Eric Smith says: \\"It is to be regretted that the Gloucestershire County Council placed a circumflex in the signs on the A417.

Opine biosynthesis is catalyzed by specific enzymes encoded by genes contained in a small segment of DNA (known as the T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA'), which is part of the Ti plasmid (in Agrobacterium) or Ri plasmid (in Rhizobium), inserted by the bacterium into the plant genome. The opines are used by the bacterium as an important energy, carbon and nitrogen source. Each strain of Agrobacterium and Rhizobium induces and catabolizes a specific set of opines, this set typifying the Ti plasmid and Ri plasmid. There are some 30 different opines described so far. General overview of opine-synthesis Chemical structure Chemically, opines fall into two major structural classes: Chemical structure of nopaline Chemical structure of octopine 1\\\\. The vast majority are secondary amine derivatives resulting from the reduction of the imine formed by condensation of an amino acid, either with a keto acid or a sugar. The first subcategory includes the opines from the nopaline and octopine families. The nopaline family (nopaline, nopalinic acid, leucinopine, glutaminopine, succinamopine) is formed when alpha-ketoglutarate serves as the keto substrate in the condensation reaction. The octopine family (octopine, octopinic acid, lysopine, histopine) is formed when pyruvate is involved in the condensation reaction. Chemical structure of mannopine The second subcategory includes the mannityl family (mannopine, mannopinic acid, agropine, agropinic acid) and the chrysopine family (deoxy-fructosyl glutamate, deoxy-fructosyl glutamine, deoxy-fructosyl oxoproline and chrysopine) formed by the condensation of an amino-acid with mannose. 2\\\\. Agrocinopines form a small, separate class of opines. Chemically they are sugar-phosphodiesters. For example, agrocinopine A is a phosphodiester of sucrose and L-arabinose. Nomenclature The name opine comes from octopine, the first opine discovered in 1927, not in crown galls, but in octopus muscle. Nopaline comes from the identification of this molecule in tumors that appeared on \\"nopal\\", the Spanish and French names of Opuntia spp. cactus. According to Oxford English Dictionary, the word opine was first used in print in 1977. Usually, the name of newly discovered opines has the ending \\"-opine\\". Exceptions are nopaline and strombine. On the other hand, not all molecule names ending in \\"-opine\\" are opines. For example, atropine, stylopine, europine, and lycopine belong to different classes of molecules. Other sources of opines Opines and opine-like substances are not restricted to crown galls tumors. The very first opine discovered, octopine, was initially isolated from octopus muscle. Similar derivatives have been isolated from muscle tissue of certain marine invertebrates: alanopine, strombine, and tauropine. Opines like acetopine and nopaline can also be formed in normal callus and plant tissue as a result of arginine metabolism. Saccharopine is an intermediate in the metabolism of amino acid lysine and occurs in fungi, higher plants and mammals, including man. The poisonous mushroom Clitocybe acromelalga is a source of four opine type amino acids: valinopine, epileucinopine, isoleucinopine and phenylalaninopine. List of opines This is an alphabetical list of some opines or opine-like compounds. ;Acetopine Acetopine (N2-(carboxymethyl)-arginine or demethyl-octopine) was isolated from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and soybean (Glycine max) callus. It wasn't found in plant tissues transformed by Agrobacterium and therefore it is not considered a \\"true\\" opine. ;Agrocinopines Agrocinopines (A-D) are a separate class of opines. They are sugar-phosphodiesters. Agrocinopine A is phosphodiester of sucrose and L-Arabinose. Agrocinopine B is the corresponding phosphodiester, in which the glucose has been hydrolyzed from the sucrose portion of agrocinopine A. ;Agropine Agropine (1'-deoxy-D- mannitol-1'-yl)-L-glutamine,1',2'-lactone) was obtained from crown gall tumors. It is a member of the mannityl family. It is derived from mannopine through the formation of a lactone. ;Agropinic acid Agropinic acid (N-1-(D-mannityl)-L-glutamic acid lactam) is produced by crown gall tumors. Belongs to the mannityl family.

These moths are narrower winged than Copromorphidae, with less rounded forewing tips. Males often have conspicuous patches of scales on either surface (Dugdale et al., 1999). The mouthparts are quite diagnostic, usually with prominent, upcurved \\"labial palps\\", the third segment long (especially in females), and the second segment covered in large scales. Unlike Copromorphidae, the \\"M2\\" and sometimes \\"M1\\" vein on the hindwings is absent. The relationship of Carposinidae relative to Copromorphidae needs further investigation. It is considered possible that the family is artificial, being nested within Copromorphidae (Dugdale et al., 1999). The Palearctic species have been revised by Alexey Diakonoff (1989). Distribution Carposinidae occur worldwide except the north-western Palearctic region (Dugdale et al., 1999). Behaviour Adults are greenish or greyish, with camouflage patterns, night flying and attracted to lights. Caterpillars live within leaves, flowers, fruits or buds, or also in galls within plant tissue. The larvae pupate with the larval shelter or descend to the ground and make a cocoon covered in detritus (Dugdale et al., 1999). Larval host plants The caterpillars feed on the gymnosperm family Podocarpaceae as well as the dicotyledon plant families Asteraceae, Campanulaceae, Ericaceae, Fagaceae, Myrtaceae, Rosaceae, Proteaceae and Rutaceae (Dugdale et al., 1999). As the moths can infest fruit some are considered pest species such as the peach fruit moth (Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health, n.d.). References Davis, D.R. (1968).

The Furman Center has a three-part mission, including providing objective academic research about land use, real estate, housing and urban affairs, with a particular focus on New York City, promoting intense debate and productive discussion among elected, academic, and industry leaders, and presenting essential data and analysis about the state of New York City's housing and neighborhoods. History Michael H. Schill founded the center in 1995. Jay Furman endowed the center in 2000 and the center is renamed in his honor.  Research  The Furman Center is constantly updating its collection of original research on four core issues, including affordable housing, housing finance and foreclosures, land use regulation and neighborhood change. Affordable housing The Furman Center produces a report every year called State of New York City's Housing and Neighborhoods.State of New York City's Housing and Neighborhoods 2005 Land use The Furman Center also developed a website called, CoreData.nyc which is an exhaustive planning and real estate resource that contains a database of affordable housing developments across the New York City, along with indicators from the US Census Bureau and other sources to help promote evidence and data-based conversation about housing and land-use issues. http://www.coredata.nyc  Data services  NYCHANIS New York City Housing and Neighborhood Information System or NYCHANIS is a database for community development organizations, housing organizations, and the general public.

Its closest relatives are the Saturniidae and it bears a resemblance to many species of that family, bearing prominent eyespots on all wings. The common name is derived from the Dryandra shrubs of the genus Banksia, on which the larva of this species feed, and is hence restricted to the south-west of Western Australia where these shrubs grow. Other Grevillea shrubs may also be used as host plants. Description The larva (caterpillar) of this species is grey on the dorsal side, and yellow on the ventral side. Along the prolegs there is a line of clear markings, as well as markings in the form of an eye, following the line of spiracles. In the adult, each wing presents a large eyespot. The eyespots on the hindwings are distinct, whereas the eyespots on the forewings are smaller and often duller. These eyespots are visible on both sides of the wing. The apex and outer margin of the forewing are darker than the basal region. The wing venation is similar to that of the Saturniidae. The wingspan ranges from . Behaviour The larvae are diurnal, whereas the adults fly only at night, from October to December. When disturbed, adult moths tend to lower the head and abdomen, bringing the forewings forward to expose the large spots on the hindwings, which oscillate from side to side, giving the aggressor the impression that it is being watched by two large eyes (such as an owl), in an attempt to cause the aggressor to refrain from attacking.

Other common ancestors are shown in light green. In graph theory and computer science, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes and in a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both and as descendants, where we define each node to be a descendant of itself (so if has a direct connection from , is the lowest common ancestor). The LCA of and in is the shared ancestor of and that is located farthest from the root. Computation of lowest common ancestors may be useful, for instance, as part of a procedure for determining the distance between pairs of nodes in a tree: the distance from to can be computed as the distance from the root to , plus the distance from the root to , minus twice the distance from the root to their lowest common ancestor . In ontologies, the lowest common ancestor is also known as the least common ancestor. In a tree data structure where each node points to its parent, the lowest common ancestor can be easily determined by finding the first intersection of the paths from and to the root. In general, the computational time required for this algorithm is where is the height of the tree (length of longest path from a leaf to the root). However, there exist several algorithms for processing trees so that lowest common ancestors may be found more quickly. Tarjan's off-line lowest common ancestors algorithm, for example, preprocesses a tree in linear time to provide constant-time LCA queries. In general DAGs, similar algorithms exist, but with super-linear complexity. History The lowest common ancestor problem was defined by , but were the first to develop an optimally efficient lowest common ancestor data structure. Their algorithm processes any tree in linear time, using a heavy path decomposition, so that subsequent lowest common ancestor queries may be answered in constant time per query. However, their data structure is complex and difficult to implement. Tarjan also found a simpler but less efficient algorithm, based on the union-find data structure, for computing lowest common ancestors of an offline batch of pairs of nodes. simplified the data structure of Harel and Tarjan, leading to an implementable structure with the same asymptotic preprocessing and query time bounds. Their simplification is based on the principle that, in two special kinds of trees, lowest common ancestors are easy to determine: if the tree is a path, then the lowest common ancestor can be computed simply from the minimum of the levels of the two queried nodes, while if the tree is a complete binary tree, the nodes may be indexed in such a way that lowest common ancestors reduce to simple binary operations on the indices. The structure of Schieber and Vishkin decomposes any tree into a collection of paths, such that the connections between the paths have the structure of a binary tree, and combines both of these two simpler indexing techniques. discovered a completely new way to answer lowest common ancestor queries, again achieving linear preprocessing time with constant query time. Their method involves forming an Euler tour of a graph formed from the input tree by doubling every edge, and using this tour to write a sequence of level numbers of the nodes in the order the tour visits them; a lowest common ancestor query can then be transformed into a query that seeks the minimum value occurring within some subinterval of this sequence of numbers. They then handle this range minimum query problem by combining two techniques, one technique based on precomputing the answers to large intervals that have sizes that are powers of two, and the other based on table lookup for small-interval queries. This method was later presented in a simplified form by . As had been previously observed by , the range minimum problem can in turn be transformed back into a lowest common ancestor problem using the technique of Cartesian trees. Further simplifications were made by and . A variant of the problem is the dynamic LCA problem in which the data structure should be prepared to handle LCA queries intermixed with operations that change the tree (that is, rearrange the tree by adding and removing edges) This variant can be solved using O(logN) time for all modifications and queries. This is done by maintaining the forest using the dynamic trees data structure with partitioning by size; this then maintains a heavy-light decomposition of each tree, and allows LCA queries to be carried out in logarithmic time in the size of the tree. Without preprocessing you can also improve the na√Øve online algorithm's computation time to O(log h) by storing the paths through the tree using skew-binary random access lists, while still permitting the tree to be extended in constant time (Edward Kmett (2012)). This allows LCA queries to be carried out in logarithmic time in the height of the tree. Extension to directed acyclic graphs A DAG with the common ancestors of and in light green, and their lowest common ancestors in dark green. While originally studied in the context of trees, the notion of lowest common ancestors can be defined for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), using either of two possible definitions. In both, the edges of the DAG are assumed to point from parents to children. * Given , define a poset such that iff is in the reflexive transitive closure of . The lowest common ancestors of and are then the minimum elements under ‚â§ of the common ancestor set }. * gave an equivalent definition, where the lowest common ancestors of and are the nodes of out-degree zero in the subgraph of induced by the set of common ancestors of and . In a tree, the lowest common ancestor is unique; in a DAG of nodes, each pair of nodes may have as much as LCAs , while the existence of an LCA for a pair of nodes is not even guaranteed in arbitrary connected DAGs. A brute-force algorithm for finding lowest common ancestors is given by : find all ancestors of and , then return the maximum element of the intersection of the two sets. Better algorithms exist that, analogous to the LCA algorithms on trees, preprocess a graph to enable constant-time LCA queries. The problem of LCA existence can be solved optimally for sparse DAGs by means of an algorithm due to . present a unified framework for pre-processing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to compute the least upper bound of two vertices in constant time. Their framework uses adaptive pre-processing where the asymptotic costs depend on the number of non-tree (cross) edges in the DAG. Consequently, it is possible to achieve near-linear pre-processing times for sparse DAGs with constant time LCA look-ups. A library of their work is available for public use at. present DiShIn a method that extends the computation of the LCA to all disjunctive ancestors in semantic similarity measures. He defines an ancestor as disjunctive if the difference between the number of distinct paths from the two nodes to that ancestor is different from using any lower common ancestor.

Its students take the Secondary School Certificate Examinations. Staff and enrolment Loyola has approximately 1500 students, 150 teachers, and 20 support staff. Classes run from 1st to 4th standards (primary), 5th to 10th standards (secondary) and 11th to 12th standard (higher secondary). All classes have four sections (A, B, C, D), not based on performance. Admission to the school is competitive. The Loyolite uniform is a sky blue shirt and navy blue pants, with an \\"L\\" on the left shirt pocket. Culture Three times a week an assembly is held in the open quadrangle, organized by students of each class. The student-chosen topics for these assemblies range from the importance of moral values, to current affairs, to scientific discoveries. On the first Friday of each month there is a Eucharistic celebration (Mass) held in the school hall for the entire school community. Organizational structure The school administration consists of a principal and vice-principal, assisted occasionally by other Fathers and Brothers. Class teachers handle attendance and other administrative tasks. There are 4 student houses, Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow. Students are randomly allotted a house on their first day of attendance. The calligraphic \\"L\\" on the shirt is in the colour of the student's house. Elections are held to select the Student Council. The Council is headed by the Head Boy, with the other members being the Deputy-Head Boy and Captains and Vice-Captains of each house. The primary section has its own house captains and vice-captains, although the Head-Boy and Deputy-Head Boy are common to both sections. Building architecture and facilities The building has three floors above the quadrangle, with the section below devoted to the primary section. Each standard has four divisions, located adjacent to each other. There is a large hall, a staff room, a gymnasium, three laboratories, and the largest school library in Goa ‚Äì all surrounding the quadrangle, overlooked by the statue of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the school's patron saint. The basketball court hosts inter-school, taluka-level, zonal level, and statewide games. The soccer field is situated outside the main campus, and is known as the Loyola Grounds. The old Loyola Ground is being renovated and a football (soccer) stadium built. The main school building was formerly L-shaped, with the longer arm containing the main school and the shorter arm containing the boarding and resident priests' quarters on the upper floors, the Chapel of St. Ignatius and the administrative offices on the upper ground floor with a bridge leading to the quadrangle, and the primary section on the lower ground floor. The new school building is G-shaped, with the new sections housing a hall, library, staff room, gymnasium, laboratories, toilet complex, computer room, and classrooms. In 1993, Loyola High School became the first public school in southwest India to replace black boards with green-boards. The quadrangle, which is used for morning student and staff assemblies, flag hoisting, student concerts, and school fetes, is surrounded by colourful flowering creepers growing on the walls of the school building. The quadrangle is home for South Goa's best- attended English services for Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter, Christmas, and New Years, when scores of people participate accompanied by school choirs. In 2016 the school \\"won a national-level ‚ÄòWhite Swan Award‚Äô hosted by AsiaOne Magazine as being the ‚ÄòMost Influential Brand‚Äô in the education category in India.\\" History Loyola was founded as Union High School in Salcette, Goa, on 13 July 1899, by the late Roque Santana Gracias. The Archdiocese of Goa took it over in 1932 and renamed it St Theotonius Union High School. In 1944 Goa Jesuits took charge and renamed it Loyola High School after their founder St. Ignatius of Loyola. LESA (Loyola Ex-Students' Association) is the alumni association of the school. There is also a forum for parents to voice their opinions on the running of the school, called the PTA (Parent Teacher Association). The forerunner to LESA was LOBA (Loyola Old Boys Association).

It was placed previously in the superfamily Yponomeutoidea in family Glyphipterigidae and in superfamily Sesioidea. It is now considered to represent its own superfamily (Minet, 1986). The relationship of the family to the other lineages in the group \\"Apoditrysia\\" need a new assessment, especially with new molecular data. Distribution The moths occur worldwide, with 19 genera in three subfamilies defined by the structural characteristics of the immature stages (larvae and pupae), rather than the characters of the adults (Heppner and Duckworth, 1981; Rota, 2005). Behaviour These small moths often bear metallic scales and are mostly day-flying (some also come to lights), with a jerky, pivoting behaviour, and may fluff up their wings at an extreme angle. Some tropical exemplars such as the genus Saptha are quite spectacular, with bright green metallic bands . The members of the genus Brenthia, usually placed in their own subfamily Brenthiinae, have eyespots on the wings and have been shown to mimic jumping spiders (Rota and Wagner, 2006). Larval hostplants Most species skeletonize leaves often among silken webbing . The foodplants of many Choreutinae occurring in the temperate region and some tropical species are known , being dominated by Asteraceae, Betulaceae, Boraginaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Labiatae, Moraceae (mainly Ficus), Rosaceae, Sapindaceae and Urticaceae. The European nettle-tap moth (Anthophila fabriciana Linnaeus, 1767), illustrated here is a familiar sight pirouetting around \\"stinging nettles\\" Urtica and nearby flowers while Choreutis pariana skeletonizes apple leaves. The last genus has 85 species worldwide one of which, C. tigroides, is a pest of \\"jackfruit\\" (Artocarpus) (Dugdale et al., 1999).

The famous temple situated there, is the first amongst the major 108 Durga temples, popularly called as \\"Ammathiruvadi Temple\\". Urakam Ammathiruvadi Temple is an architectural marvel with its majestic Rajagopuram (ornamental gateways), Mathilkettu (compound walls), ootupura (feeding hall), nalambalam (building immediately surrounding the sanctum sanctorum), the double storied Shrikovil (sanctum sanctorum) and the serene atmosphere maintained at the inner temple. The Valayadheeswari Temple or the more popularly known as Ammathiruvadi Temple of Urakam is the foremost of the 108 Durgaalayams (durga Temples) of Kerala. According to the Puraanaas, Kerala was reclaimed by Lord Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Mahavishnu, from sea by throwing his parasu (axe) from Kanyakumari to Gokarna and divided this land to 64 the gramas. He realized that for the prosperity and well-being of this Bhargava Land, it was essential to have the benign blessings of Durga and identified 108 places for the temple. The locations of these temples represent the scattered body parts of Sati Devi, the consort of Lord Paramasiva, cut into pieces by Mahavishnu with his chakra to pacify Siva after the incident- filled Dakshayaga. History of Urakam Ammathiruvadi Temple : According to the Kerala folklore, Poomulli Namboothiri (also sometimes referred to as Thiruvalayannur Bhattathiri) founded Ammathiruvadi temple about 700‚Äì1000 years ago. The temple site was once the location of the Namboothiri's household. ≈™rakam was then a part of the Peruvanam village (one of the 64 villages of ancient Kerala). Legend has it that during then, due to the atrocities and calamities happening within the Desham, elders suggested three prominent members from the community, viz, Valaya Bhattathiri, Kadalayil Namboothiri and then Komarathu Menon to travel to Kancheepuram and pray to goddess Kanchi Kamakshi and then please her and bring favourable solutions to ward off the evil effects happening that time. They all went and pleased with their prayers, happy with the devotion, Devi agreed to come with them to Urakam. Accordingly, Kanchi Kamakshi decided to come to Kerala on the palm leaf umbrella of Poomulli (Valayannur) Namboothiri. He reached home and placed the umbrella on the floor of his house. After a short nap, he came back and found that he was unable to take back the umbrella from the place where he kept. It was heavily grounded to the floor. Later upon further investigation it was confirmed that Kanchi Kamakshi was residing on that umbrella. The goddess came in Namboothiri's dreams that night and let him know that he was supposed to build a temple for the goddess, and leave ≈™rakam towards North. She also let him know that he was to find an idol in a well far away and reinstate the goddess from the umbrella onto that idol. Namboothiri did as the goddess wished. He built the temple, after a short period of administration of the temple matters by the Poomulli family, he left all that he owned to the temple, and gave the administration to the Maharaja of Cochin. From then on the goddess was known as the Ammathiruvadi. Later on the temple administration was transferred to Cochin Devaswam Board, who takes care of it even now. Urakam Ammathiruvadi temple is an integral part of the 1400 year old Arattupuzha Pooram festival. Arrattuppuzha pooram is called as Deva Mela, where all the gods and goddesses assemble together in the presence of Thriprayar Thevar (Sri Rama), considered their head. According to the old customs continued by the family of Cochi Raja and then subsequently by the Kerala State, whenever, Ammathiruvadi travel outside the temple, i.e. for pooram or other festivals, she is supposed to be greeted with official \\"Guard of Honour\\" by the police. All festivities of this temple are taken care of a local committee with the guidance of Cochin Devaswom board. Stories passed on from elders tell also that in those days, the idol installed by Poomulli Namboothiri was originally the Devi idol worshiped by Sri Rama before he went to war with Ravana. There are several historic connections one get to see in places nearer to Oorakam, supporting the claim that the village was part of ancient Hindu history. Due to the same connections, this village and all the adjacent villages carry a divine and prosperous aura throughout. Agricultural and other activities always flourish here. It is also said that one family close to the temple became so devoted to the Devi that she was pleased with their bhakthi and from then on, the eldest member of this family - Vazhappilly - became the guard of Ammathiruvadi and wherever she goes, she will be accompanied by this member. This continues even now. Since she came to Urakam on an umbrella made of palm leaf, whenever Ammathiruvadi's idol is carried out, it will be accompanied by a person carrying an umbrella made of palm leaf. Festivals : Ammathiruvadi Temple conducts five famous festivals annually. These are the Navaratri, Thrikkarthika, Pooram, Illam Nira and Vavarat. The Navarathri is a nine-day festival which is celebrated very grandly. This temple is decorated with lights, sounds and by flowers. The Thrikkarthika festival is celebrated as the birthday of Ammathiruvadi. On this occasion the goddess is dressed in silk cloths and adorns the temple jewels. The temple elephants are also decorated and take them for procession. The important feature of this festival is the grand feast given o more than 15,000 people's very year whoever comes on this festival occasion. It is said that, no one should go out of this temple with an empty stomach. The Pooram is an important event for cultural programs. This is a 13-day festival grandly celebrated with temple elephants and percussions. The festival is worth to enjoy as one can see the art and culture truly with the religious sentiments of the locals.

These moths have broad, rounded forewings, and well- camouflaged scale patterns. Unlike Carposinidae the mouthparts include \\"labial palps\\" with the second rather than third segment the longest. With other unusual structural characteristics of the caterpillar and adult, it could represent the sister lineage of all other extant members of this superfamily (Dugdale et al., 1999). The genus Sisyroxena from Madagascar is also notable for its unusual venation and wing scale sockets (Dugdale et al., 1999). Etymology The word Copromorphidae derives from the Ancient Greek words (') meaning \\"excrement\\" and (') meaning \\"shape\\" or \\"appearance\\", a reference to the visual characteristics of the moths' camouflage. Distribution These moths are widely distributed except the Palearctic region, occurring in Madagascar, India, South East Asia, New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, the Neotropics, with limited temperate region coverage except that the genera Lotisma and Ellabella occur in North America, and the latter also in China (Common, 1990). Over 20 belong to the genus Copromorpha occurring in Indo- Australia (Dugdale et al., 1999). Behaviour Adults are night-flying and attracted to lights. Caterpillars live between joined leaves, flowers or fruits or bore within stems, and some eat leaves. The larvae pupate with the silken gallery or descend to the ground and make a cocoon covered in detritus (Dugdale et al., 1999). Larval hostplants Caterpillars feed on the families Ericaceae, Moraceae (Ficus) and Berberidaceae.

Muhumusa (also spelled Muhumuza, Muhumsa, and Nyiragahumusa) was a feared leader of the east African Nyabingi spiritual practice, which was influential in Rwanda and Uganda from 1850 to 1950. Muhumusa is said to have been a medium of the spirit of a legendary African woman, known as Nyabinghi (also spelled Nyabingi and Nyabyinshi). According to some Rwandan sources, her original name was Muserakande, and she was married to and had a son named Biregeya with Kigeri Rwabugiri, the King of Rwanda from 1867 to 1895. Following Rwabugiri's death in 1895 and the coup at Rucunshu in 1896, which was orchestrated by Rwabugiri's favourite wife, Kanjogera, to overthrow his chosen successor, Rutarindwa, and enthrone her son, Musinga, Muserakande allegedly fled north to Mpororo with her son to escape massacre. Other sources, however, claim Muhumusa was originally named Nyakayoga and had been married to Rutarindwa prior to his death.  Spiritual Leadership  Regardless of the specifics of her affiliation with the Rwandan court, soon after arriving in Mpororo, Muserakande became known as a popular umugirwa, or medium of Nyabinghi. Oral traditions from the region recognise many possible origins for Nyabingi. The most prominent legends at present attributes Nyabinghi's origins to Kitami, an 18th century Queen of Mpororo kingdom (in modern-day southern Uganda / northern Rwanda), whose murder by her husband, Murari, was followed by a series of natural disasters and other catastrophic events. After her death, any atrocities that happened were considered to be due to Nyabinghi's revenge, while any good things that happened were attributed to her positive interference which she exercised through mediums who had been possessed by her spirit. These possessions led to the emergence of a new religious practice that European colonisers at the time widely referenced as a cult. Adherents provided gifts to Nyabinghi mediums, known collectively as abagirwa, who then spoke with (and for) Nyabinghi to convince the spirit to intervene positively in people's lives.  Resistance  By claiming spiritual authority through Nyabinghi, Muhumusa was able to rally the Abakiga people of northern Rwanda behind her to challenge to Musinga's claim to the throne. Over the next few years, she raised armies and organised a series of insurrections aimed at enthroning her son, Biregeya, who she claimed was Rwabugiri's legitimate successor. She also encouraged her followers to pay tribute to her, rather than Musinga's court. In response, Musinga asked the German colonisers for help defeating Muhumusa's movement. The Germans arrested her in 1908 for 'witchcraft' and imprisoned her in Bukoba until her escape in 1911. Once again, she fled north where she began rallying her supporters, but this time in defiance of the German and British colonisers who were laying claim to the region, in collaboration with an umutwa leader named Basebya. They were behind the first armed resistances against colonisation in the region, with Muhumusa encouraging their followers not to fear European guns because Nyabinghi would turn the Europeans' bullets into water. Muhumusa's rebellion created a great deal of concern among the European colonisers in the region, and well as the European missionaries who were attempting to spread Christianity, prompting the Germans and British to join forces. On September 29, 1911, they surrounded Muhumusa's forces and, after a short battle, arrested her. The British escorted her to Kampala, where they kept her under house arrest until her death in 1945.

He was a busy performer in Hollywood films of the 1930s. Early life A native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and son of the old-time minstrel, Milt G. Barlow (1843‚Äì1904), Barlow made his stage debut at the age of twelve in his father's minstrel troupe of Barlow, Wilson, Primrose, and West. Barlow joined the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion of The Royal Canadian Regiment on October 22, 1899, for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War. According to newspaper and other accounts, he did also serve in the United States Army during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I, and eventually rose to the rank of full colonel in 1923. Barlow had thoughts of quitting the stage for the church in 1908 and at the time remarked to an interviewer: \\"All my ancestors have been soldiers, actors, and ministers, and some of them all three. I am a direct descendant of Bishop Barlow of the days of Henry VIII.\\" Career Barlow in The Mad Monster (1942) A distinguished-looking actor who lent an air of dignity to any role he played, in the early part of his stage career he landed leading roles in The Silver King, Monte Cristo, The Sign of the Cross, Old Lady 31, and The Little Princess. Among his early silent films were The Cinema Murder (1919), the post World War I drama Love's Flame in which he plays the father-in-law: \\"M. De Ronsard\\", and in the comedy Clothes Make the Pirate (1925) in which he plays \\"Captain Montague\\", a cameo. After the changeover to sound, Barlow usually played men of means, such as military officers, senators, and bankers, turning up as a college professor in Horse Feathers (1932), with the Marx Brothers, a chaplain in Ann Vickers (1933), the sheriff in Tower of London (1939), and the Professor Warwick ostracizing mad scientist George Zucco in The Mad Monster (1942). Further, as the American Legion Hollywood Post 43 was often included in the older films without giving any actual credit as to which members of the Post were actually shown within the films, its highly likely that Barlow did also often appear in films as an uncredited member of Hollywood Post 43. Director Barlow functioned as a director of play companies before switching over to film. He was director of the Wright Huntington Players, narrated for the Eveready Hour, and on at least one occasion directed a film itself. It appears Barlow did play a director's sort of role in several films much as did Alfred Hitchcock, who was known to have made at least a cameo appearance in every one of his films. His film The Toy Maker of Leyden (1915) is listed as The Magic Toy Maker in Hanson & Givenson, eds. American Film Institute Catalogue Index, vol. F1, 1911‚Äì1920. Family Barlow married at least two times, but he did say on the 1930 Census that he was 22 years old at his first marriage.The service records for 7012 Lance Corporal R.H. Barlow of The Royal Canadian Regiment showed that he was married, with two children, in 1899 on enlistment for the South African War. His name is presented variously in the service record as \\"R.H. Barlow\\", \\"Reginald H. Barlow\\", \\"Reginald Barry Barlow\\", and \\"Reginald Harry Barlow\\". He married Clare Danforth, on April 15, 1902, in Charleston, Missouri. This \\"marriage\\", however, was subsequently refuted by the family of Bertha Merkel, infra, and was apparently an extortion attempt. He married Milwaukee heiress Bertha Merkel (aka: Selma Rose), the daughter of George and Mary Merkel, on August 6, 1903, in Los Angeles, California, and to whom he remained married until her death in 1933. He later married Carol Brown (of Pasadena, California), to whom he was married at the time of his death, according to his death certificate and according to the Los Angeles Times of 1934 when he married Carol in Tijuana, Mexico. Scandals Uplifters Club 13 September 1941; Barlow, center On August 21, 1903, the Chicago Inter Ocean reported that Barlow had committed bigamy. According to Barlow's first wife, who claimed that he married her under the pseudonym Livingston, the couple were not divorced at the time of his second marriage to Bertha Merkel. However, the Los Angeles Times subsequently published an article on August 28, 1903, which completely exhonorated Barlow, who had just recently converted to Catholicism in order to marry Bertha, of any wrongdoing. It was actually Barlow's new mother-in-law, Mary Merkel, who had earlier initiated an investigation and upon discovery, prosecution of Barlow, which of course never happened.

Richards was a director of companies involved in engineering, telecommunications and water and waste treatment, several of which entered administrative receivership or were dissolved. He became a director of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. in October 1989 and chairman five months later, following the departure of the long serving Bert McGee. Richards was made chairman of the Premier League in 1999, and left Sheffield Wednesday shortly afterwards, with the club facing relegation from the Premiership. He succeeded Lord Pendry as chairman of the Football Foundation in March 2003, and left the post in October 2008. In March 2009, Richards was made Deputy Chairman of the England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid, a position he resigned that November. In June 2006, Richards received a knighthood for services to sport. Controversies 2012 Qatar comments At a conference in Qatar in March 2012, Richards accused FIFA and UEFA of stealing football from the English. Richards said that \\"England gave the world football. Then, fifty years later, some guy came along and said, you're liars, and they actually stole it. It was called FIFA... Fifty years later, another gang came along called UEFA and stole a bit more.\\" Richards later claimed his comments were \\"light hearted\\" and said he would write to UEFA and FIFA. Richards also dismissed suggestions were that the game of football could have originated in China, stating that \\"It started in Sheffield 150 years ago...The Chinese may say they own it, but the British own it, and we gave it to the rest of the world.\\" Richards also said FIFA allowed the FA to waste money on their 2018 World Cup bid when, he said, they had little chance of winning it, saying that \\"Why couldn't FIFA have said, we want to take it to the Gulf...We spent ¬£19m on that bid...When we went for it everybody believed we had a chance. But as we went through it a pattern emerged that suggested maybe we didn't.\\" Richards also warned fans may boycott the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar unless alcohol is made freely available. The Football Association and the Premier League distanced themselves from Richards remarks, stressing that he was attending the conference in a personal capacity. 2012 Hillsborough Independent Panel Enquiry It emerged from the Hillsborough Independent Panel enquiry in September 2012 that Richards, who was the Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday from March 1990 to February 2000, had refused to put up a memorial at Hillsborough, on legal advice, for the 96 Liverpool supporters that died on 15 April 1989, in the disaster in Hillsborough.

She is best known for her ground-breaking travel guide of France and Italy which served as an essential companion for British travellers to the Continent in the early nineteenth century. She also wrote plays and poetry early in her career but was discouraged by harsh reviews. She was unmarried but sometimes referred to as Mrs. Starke. Life and writing career Starke's mother was Mary (n√©e Hughes) and her father was Richard Starke, governor of Fort St George in Madras (now known as Chennai). Starke grew up in India and used it as a background for her plays The Sword of Peace and The Widow of Malabar. Starke then lived in Italy for an extended period, between 1792 and 1798, to attend a sick relation, and this experience formed the basis for her later writing. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Starke returned to Italy and devoted the rest of her life to continual revisions of her travel series, in so doing effectively reinventing the genre.Mullen, Richard and Munson, James The Smell of the Continent: The British Discover Europe. London: Macmillan, 2009. pp. 143‚Äì149. Previously travel guides had concentrated on architectural and scenic descriptions of the places to be visited by wealthy young men on the Grand Tour. Starke recognised that with the enormous growth in the number of Britons travelling abroad after 1815 the majority of her readers would now be travelling in family groups and often on a budget. She therefore included for the first time a wealth of advice on luggage, obtaining passports, the precise cost of food and accommodation in each city and even advice on the care of invalid family members. She also devised a system of !!! exclamation mark ratings, a forerunner of today's stars. Her books, published by John Murray, served as a template for later guides. Her work earned her celebrity status in her lifetime.

Inspired by the memory of the Roman Empire, dominium mundi implied the recognition of one supreme authority, which generated a prolonged political and spiritual struggle between imperial and ecclesiastical power. This struggle can be said to have begun with the Investiture Controversy, and was mainly embodied by the Holy Roman Empire and Catholic Church, which elevated the emperor and Pope, respectively, to the status of supreme ruler. The idea of universal dominion divided Italy into the warring faction of Guelphs and Ghibellines. Guelphs supported the Church, while Ghibellines supported the Empire. After two hundred years of division during the 12th and 13th centuries, neither of the powers had prevailed, due to their mutual dependency and the rise of the powerful and practically independent reigns of Church and the State. The idea of dominium mundi did not reappear in its original form, despite the fact that both universal powers subsisted.  The imperial idea  Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire between 1152 and 1190, was the biggest figure of imperialism in the first stage of the dispute over Dominium Mundi.  Height and sustenance  At the time of the reign of Frederick I (1152-1190), the imperial idea had already reached maturity. Its continuity was emphasized in Europe from the Roman times, through the Carolingian Empire link. In fact, Frederick I spoke about Charlemagne as the model of emperors and had him canonized in 1165 without the requirements. The thesis on the public sovereignty that Roman law (rediscovered by the European jurists and politicians in the twelfth century) contains were also used in favor of the imperial ideas. It was of them that it was deduced the unicity and the universal character of the Holy Roman Empire, considered \\"a project of worldwide dominion\\" that symbolizes the whole period. Given these premises, it was believed in the court of Frederick I that the Empire, established directly by divine will as a form of political organization of humanity, was sacred. The expression Sacrum Imperium appears for the first time in a document of 1157. Portrait of Henry VI from the Codex Manesse (folio 6r, ca. 1300) In a different plane, it cannot be forgotten that the 12th century saw the beginning of the revitalization of the monarchic power over feudalism, after several centuries of deep decay of the royal authority. The Empire did not stay at the margin of this evolution, recovering strongly its prestige. Nevertheless, it was badly managed, causing important consequences for the political future of the territories of Germany and Italy. The reconstruction of the monarchies also went against the projected Dominium Mundi. Because of this, Frederick I, as well as his son and successor Henry VI, tried to conciliate both events imagining a universal temporal empire, at whose front was an emperor with supreme authority, superior to the power of various kings, called \\"r√©gulos\\" or \\"local kings\\". This supreme authority seemed necessary, because it was believed that the Empire was the way to maintain unity in Christianity in preparation for the end times. Without considering this eschatological and messianic element, one cannot correctly understand what the Empire meant for the men of the time, in particular for emperor Frederick I.  The vision of the Church  Antichristus, a woodcut by Lucas Cranach of the pope using the temporal power to grant authority to a generously contributing ruler The foundations of the ecclesiastical vision can be exemplified by these sources: * According to Pope Alexander III: \\"The unicity of the creation also implies the unicity of the supreme authority on all the creatures. This had to belong to the Pope because of the superiority of his spiritual power and because the eternal salvation, that he promoted, was the prime social aim. \\" * According to Summa Coloniensis (1170 text): \\"The Pope is the true emperor, the emperor being his effective vicar.\\" (imperator Papa verus est, imperator est vicarius eius). * According to Geroh de Reichersberg and the great canon lawyers like Graciano and Huguccio: \\"The lay temporary power had independent operation, being able to choose those who exerted it either by means of election or inheritance, as well as to develop its own administrative means without interferences. The Pope conserved, nevertheless, a supreme authority, but he could only exert it to sanction or to authenticate the political acts, not to stop or modify them nor to directly act, except for moral or religious reasons (ratione peccati: \\"because of sins\\") or when it was necessary to dissolve an issue for which no other power of the world was authorized.\\"  Imperial and ecclesiastical law in the 12th and 13th centuries   Roman law  In the 12th and 13th centuries the rediscovery of old Roman law and the ordenaci√≥n of the canon law sparked a new era for the legal ordering of the western world. This deeply influenced the politics of the time, especially in the course of the struggle of the Dominium Mundi between the Empire and the Pontificate. The Roman law known by the medieval Europe was exclusively the compilation made by the emperor Justinian in the 6th century, which consists of several differentiated parts: # The Digest or Pandectas, compendium of jurisprudence. # The Institutions or a manual of study which, in part, summarizes the previous one. # The \\"Justinian Code\\", that reunites all the constitutions by the emperors starting from the times of Hadrian. # The Novels, or imperial constitutions after the year 53. Bologna University seal. Bolognian teachers commented the Justinian texts through the glosses, favoring the empire. Of all these, the one of greatest influence in the medieval rediscovery was the Digest. The Justinian work would, starting in the 16th century, be known as Corpus Iuris Civilis, but at the time it lacked diffusion and was known through compendiums that deformed it. The renaissance in Roman studies during the 12th and 13th centuries that would influence all of Europe, occurred in Bologna, a city in the Italian Romagna. It wasn't small, in this diffusion, the role of the romano-Germanic emperors, who were moved by their political interests as much as by their supposed condition of successors to the old Roman Empire. The teachers of this most famous \\"school of Bologna\\" acted according to a method of medieval study, the one of glosses or commentary of the content and meaning of justinian texts. They are not critical commentaries, but rather, analytical. The bolognian professors accept justinian law as something superior, even supreme; they are limited to comment on it, without too much critical baggage, because for that they needed philological command of Greek language and study of original texts and historical knowledge, in which they were lacking. But from their commentary fundamental consequences for the Europe of the time are deduced, by the creation of a rich casuistry that covered a field of superior and more ample legal hypothesis from what was widely known until then. The foundation of this school of bolognian professors is due to Irnerius at the beginning of the 12th century. Disciples of his were Hugo de Porta Ravennate, Bulgarus, Jacobus de Boragine and Martinus Gosia, called \\"the four doctors\\" because of their wisdom and influences. All of them were Ghibellines (supported the idea of the Empire being over the pontificate) and in favor of Frederick I, of whom they were contemporary.  Canon law  Pope Alexander III was one of the main glossists of the Decree of pontifical Graciano and Decretals, playing a decisive role in the fight with the Holy Roman Empire. Around the same time, with some decades of difference, a systematization of the ecclesiastical law took place, which was going to give birth to the canon law in all its fullness. Romanists and canon lawyers were brothers of mentality and duties, although the later defended the pontifical rights. The first one to compile and systematize the previous universal council canons was Graciano, a bolognian theology teacher, who wrote ca. 1140 his Concordance of the Discordances of the Canons, commonly called Decree. The work of Graciano did not have official status, but it reached great prestige and caused in the following decades a height in legal consultations formulated to the pontiff s, something to be expected at a time of insufficient organization of the civil power. These answered by means of litteras decretals or \\"decretals\\", whose compilation became necessary, as the only way to use and preserve the jurisprudential wealth they contained, since they not only affected ecclesiastical matters, but also those of civilians and seculars. The first compilation was made by Raymond of Pe√±afort, a Dominican Catalan, and is named Gregory IX Decretals; it reunites the decretals appeared between 1154 and 1234 and is divided in five books, this being the reason the following compilation, which includes material up until 1298, was known Liber sextus (\\"Sixth book\\"). In the 14th century new compilations were made, Clementines, and the Extravagantes, of John XXII and Comunas. From the 16th century on, all canon law in its recognized compendiums will take the official name of Corpus iuris canonici. Tee Decree of pontifical Graciano and the Decretals were commented by the same procedure of glosses as was applied to the Roman law. Some of the main glossists played a decisive role in the struggle against the Empire: Rolando Bandinelli (Pope Alexander III) and Sinibaldo Fieschi (Pope Innocent IV). The synthesis of the glosses was made, mainly, by Bartholomew de Brescia, in the 12th century, and also by Juan the Teut√≥nico, in the 13th century, of Hugh of Pisa and Henry of Segusio.  Development of the conflict  In varied occasions the cities of Lombardy, headed by Milan, revolted to the imperial authority, approaching the Papacy.  The diet of Besan√ßon and the first differences  On his return from Italy, after being crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV, Frederick I summoned a diet in Besan√ßon (1157), with object to reform the political statute of his kingdom in Arles. In that diet the first differences between the high civil employees of the emperor, in special took place the chancellor Rainaldo de Dassel, and the pontifical legacy, and future Pope Alexander III, Rolando Bandinelli. The complaint between theocrats and avivava, being the pretext the interpretation of a papal document in which it was alluded to the \\"benefits\\" that Pontiff granted to emperor. The word \\"benefit\\", in that then, had a very specific meaning, because vassals were the ones who received benefits or fiefs from their lord. To thus Rainaldo de Dassel understood it and, put forth the argument that, Rolando Bandinelli did not gain a disadvantage in accepting the thesis of its rival: in effect, for him, the emperor received the Empire as a \\"benefit\\" of the Pope. Adrian IV, the Pope of English origin that crowned emperor Frederick I, clarified later that the word had a more general sense: the Pope granted spiritual benefits, not fiefdoms. But the complaint had been revived, and when Rolando Bandinelli was raised to the pontifical seat as Alexander III, it was as a true restorer of papal authority (in the spirit of Pope Gregory VII). Theories that no longer had the energetic simplicity of the Gregorian times. In first half of the 12th century, mainly, some authors continued the theses of Gregory VII, like Hugo of San Victor, John of Salisbury or Honorio Augustodunense, but the predominant theories assimilate in some form the new realities: rediscovery of the Roman Law, affirmation of the political powers, complication of the social scheme in a world in which the possible offices and individual situations are multiplied, breaking the primitive ideal of the \\"trinitarian society\\" (politicians, the military and agriculturists).  Frederick I against Alexander III  After the death of Adrian IV, 24 cardinals choose the Pope Alexander III. Nevertheless, Frederick I recognized like Pope Victor IV (Antipope). In 1158 took place the second travels imperial to Italy. Shortly after, the death of Adrian IV opened a successory crisis in the pontificate. Around both facts the first propitious conjuncture for the confrontation between emperor and Pope takes place. Frederick tried to subjugate the Lombard cities. Milan was raised at the top of this new urban world. The emperor besieged it and forced it to capitulate, preserving its internal autonomy but accepting totally the imperial authority. Next, Frederick reunited to one magna assembly in Roncaglia with the purpose of reorganizing the administration of the kingdom of Italy and recovering in him all his authority. It seemed to obtain it, but the resistance against its measures would raise to the cities and would renew its old \\"entente\\" with the Pontiff, for whom the constitution of an imperial power hard in the north and center of Italy was more serious the immediate danger against its political independence. pseudocanonization of Charlemagne was an example of the culmination of imperial interventionism.  Pope and antipope  When Adrian IV died, the 24 cardinals in favor of opposing the dominion of Frederick I in Italy chose Pope Alexander III, while the three that preferred to reconcile gave their vote to cardinal Octavian, who was titled Victor IV. The split allowed Frederick to attempt a conciliation in Pavia (January 1160), where Pope Victor IV was recognized, while Alexander III looked for support in the Norman kingdom of the south of Italy, whose kings were vassals of The Holy See, and in other European countries, to foment opposition against the emperor. Milan again revolted in 1161, but it was conquered by force of arms and devastated; shortly after, Alexander III was forced to divide for France. Frederick won, but Alexander was the Pope recognized by Europe, except for the Empire, and, even so, he counted within this one frightful allies, in particular in Italy, where the emperor and his chancellors, Rainaldo de Dassel and Christian de Bach, organized authoritarian government to counter the old local autonomies, that were not resigned to accept their new lot without resistance.  Culmination of the imperial intervention  The death of Victor IV also deprived Frederick of an important support, because antipopes that made choose to happen to him (Paschal III, Callixtus III) did not have possible justification nor were recognized willingly by his own German clergy, since the Emperor took advantage of the circumstances to intervene himself in the ecclesiastical life like at the worse moments of \\"Investiture Controversy\\": In 1165, synod of W√ºrzburg and Canonization of Charlemagne was the culmination of imperial interventionism. In addition, the dispute with Alexander III forced him to make concessions and to obtain alliances in Germany as well as in other countries. Great German nobles made Frederick pay dearly for their fidelity and, in the outside, Frederick looked for so much the French alliance, never obtained, like the English, taking advantage of the existing fight between the king Henry II of England and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket.

Bobrof Island is a small, uninhabited island about north and west of Kanaga Island, and northeast of Cape Sudak on Tanaga Island. Bobrof Island is long and wide with an area of , and consists primarily of the high Bobrof Volcano. The volcanic crater, or cone, has been heavily dissected. Underwater deposits adjacent to the island's northeast flank suggest an immense debris- avalanche has taken place.  Bobrof Volcano  Bobrof Volcano is an inactive stratovolcano which forms the small Bobrof Island. No recorded eruptions have taken place at Bobrof or in its vicinity. It has been considered as Holocene age.  Geography and geology  Because of the inclusion of Alaska, the United States has the largest number of active volcanoes in the world, many of them geologically young. In Alaska, at least 50 volcanoes, including those in the Aleutian archipelago, have erupted in historical time. Alaska accounts for about 80% of the United States' volcanoes, excluding the seamounts in the area, about 8% of the world's volcanoes, and most of these are located among the Aleutian Islands. The Aleutian Islands arc forms the northern boundary of the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic activity generates earthquakes and volcanic eruptions regularly. The volcano is thought to be of Holocene age. Though no historical eruptions have taken place at Bobrof, it has erupted at least once. This data can be confirmed through pyroclastic flow deposits containing andesite. Once these flows were studied, at a building intended for earthquake monitoring, they confirmed that Bobrof was prone to explosive activity. There are lava deposits on the mountain which also suggest activity similar to shield eruptions. In collected samples, there are traces of basaltic andesite and dacite. No complete publications exist for Bobrof's definite geology, just those with facts and some information.

Life and career He was born in Coole in County Cork, Ireland, the eldest son of Robert and Catharine Hedges. The Hedges had their roots in Wiltshire, and had originally gone by the surname of Lacy. Details of Hedges' early career are unclear, but it is known that he went to Turkey as a trader for the Levant Company. In his diaries, he refers to his knowledge of colloquial Turkish and Arabic. Initially posted to the trading station (or factory) in Smyrna, by 1668 he had risen to the position of company treasurer in Constantinople. It is alleged, however, that the demands of this position became too much for him. Having arranged for a replacement from Smyrna, he quit Turkey and returned to England around 1670‚Äì71. In London, Hedges involved himself in a variety of ventures. He joined the Mercers' Company, supreme among the City's Livery Companies. He invested ¬£500 in the recently reformed Royal African Company. He served two stints as a Levant Company assistant. From 1677 to 1680, he was even a councilman for his local ward of Bassishaw. Through his first marriage, Hedges had also aligned himself with London's dissenting Protestant movement. His brother-in-law and fellow merchant Jeremy Sambrooke was to become a leading dissenter. Hedges took part in the campaign against the Conventicle Act that forbade religious assemblies of more than five people outside the auspices of the Church of England. In the end, however, Hedges returned to the Anglican church. India Nearly a decade later, Hedges got his East India Company posting. At the time, the Company's commercial interests in Bengal were managed from Fort St George in Madras, more than 800 miles down the coast. However, for a number of reasons, this arrangement was proving inadequate. Business in Bengal was expanding steadily, but at the same time the Company's interests were increasingly under threat from native rulers as well as from commercial parties keen on breaking its trade monopoly in that part of India. Further, there were rumblings against the management in Madras and accusations of dishonesty against the Company's own officials. The Court of Directors therefore decided that the Bengal station needed more autonomy to cope with its various challenges, and created a separate Agency for the province. Hedges had already been elected as one of the Company's 24 directors in April 1681. On 3 September of that year, he was appointed the first chief agent and governor of the new Bengal Agency. He was instructed to put a stop to the growing exactions of the native rulers and their subordinates, to check the recently organised efforts of the 'interlopers' to break through the EIC's monopoly, and to punish the dishonesty of many of the company's own servants. In particular he was to arrest his predecessor, Matthias Vincent. Hedges sailed from the Downs on 28 January 1682, anchored in Balasore Road on 17 July, and reached Hoogly on 24 July. His want of tact and prudence brought him into constant collision with his associates in the council at Hoogly, especially with Job Charnock, John Beard, and Francis Ellis, and in the end they proved too strong for him. His detention of Beard's letter to Sir Josiah Child, the contents of which he had contrived to know, subjected him to the ill-will of the latter. When he attempted to capture Matthias Vincent, the latter, aware that he was about to be taken prisoner, appeared with a party of well armed soldiers and forced Hedges to retreat to the Dutch settlement of Chinsurah further inland. Vincent's position was further strengthened by the arrival of his protege Thomas \\"Diamond\\" Pitt with more men. Return to England On 21 December 1683 the EIC court issued a formal revocation of Hedges' commission, which reached him on 17 July 1684. He accordingly left Hoogly, embarked on 30 December, visited Persia on his way, and landed at Dover on 4 April 1687. On 6 March 1688 he was knighted by James II, and became a member of the Mercers' Company. On 26 May 1690 he, together with Thomas Cook, was put forward by the church party as a candidate for the shrievalty of the City of London, but neither won. In June 1693 he was chosen sheriff along with Alderman Thomas Abney. A month later he was elected alderman for Portsoken ward. In 1694 he was chosen one of the twenty-four directors of the 'New Bank' (Bank of England), and four or five years later resumed to a certain extent his connection with the East India Company. In 1698 the old company formed a 'grand committee' of twenty-six gentlemen associated with the twenty-six of their court to deal with certain resolutions hostile to their interests which had been passed by the commons on 24 May. A similar committee was again formed in January 1699, and of this last Hedges and Sir John Letheuillier were members. The two were deputed on 17 January in that year to open negotiations for coalition with the new company. In 1700 Hedges was a candidate for the mayoralty, but was not successful. He died in London on 5 August 1701, and was buried, as directed in his will, with his first wife at Stratton St Margaret on the 15th. Personal life He was twice married. His first wife, Susanna, eldest daughter of Nicholas Vanacker of Erith, Kent, died in childbirth at Hoogly on 6 July 1683, leaving two sons, William and Robert, and a daughter Susanna. He married as his second wife, on 21 July 1687, Anne, widow of Colonel John Searle of Finchley, and by her had two sons, John and Charles. In 1693 Hedges bought land to the value of ¬£200 in Stratton St Margaret, and settled it for an augmentation of the vicarage and better maintenance of the vicar and vicars' widows for ever. He also directed that a sermon on charity should be preached annually by the vicar 'the next Sunday to the sixth of July,' the day of his first wife's death. The sermon is suspended, though the endowment continues.

Purportedly intended as a warning against the dangers of pill-popping Sixties hedonism along the lines of 1936's Reefer Madness, the film's primary purpose appears to have been titillation, thus landing it in the genre of exploitation cinema. The film is a drama set in Spain where a small group of American young adults is living. The leader of the group is a drug dealer. The others are there living carefree lives as beatniks. The leader has more nefarious aims in mind, and uses drugs to lure the others into lives of crime. Most of the film is in black and white, but there is a psychedelic sequence depicting the purported effects of the group using LSD which was filmed in color. It is often cited as an example of counterculture cinema. George Montgomery is the psychedelic advisor to a circle of young expatriates living on the Isle of Ibiza. Visitor Danny Stone, who avoids taking part in the fun until his mother cuts off his allowance, seeks help in a monastery after an LSD-induced crime spree results in the murder of a Barcelona antiques dealer.

This skin makes her nearly invulnerable and grants her a measure of superhuman strength (enough to throw a car with ease and hurt Wonder Girl and other moderately powered super beings with a punch). She can fly and fire blasts of energy. Bombshell can generate energy waves capable of scrambling the minds of others, and can control electromagnetically powered technology, like the electronic parts of Cyborg. Bombshell's origin is different from Captain Atom's and Major Force's in that she was not exposed to a nuclear explosion in the course of acquiring her Dilustel coating; she was merely covered with the alien material. Thus, there is no risk of a radiation hazard if her quantum metal skin is breached: in fact, damaging the metal coating beyond a certain point temporarily negates her powers. Teen Titans #63 reveals that the metal had managed to bond to her body and she can bring forth a new coating whenever she wants to, with all the powers of the original.

Game play A panel of three celebrities faced a studio contestant who came in with an unusual story. He/she read the story to the panel. When he/she came to a sentence with a blank or blanks at the end or near the end, each panelist tried to guess the missing word or words. A correct answer from one celebrity won $50 for the contestant (unlike most panel shows using this type of format), but an incorrect answer passed the turn to the next celebrity. If all three missed, the host gave the starting letter or letters of the answer and the round continued as before, with a correct guess earning only $25. Three guests played each day, with the final guest being a celebrity. On the August 21, 1963 pilot, the guest predicted whether each word would be guessed or not. If the guest predicted that the word would be guessed, he or she earned $10 for each of six chances remaining. Predicting the word would not be guessed earned $10 for each wrong guess. On the sixth and final part of the story, each panelist took only one guess with the first letter revealed and a correct prediction earned $25 per incorrect guess or chance remaining, depending on the guest's prediction. Broadcast history Missing Links debuted on September 9, 1963 at 11:30 AM Eastern (10:30, Central), replacing The Price is Right in a scheduling shuffle with Concentration (which took Price's slot at 11:00/10:00) against Seven Keys on ABC and local programming on CBS. On December 30, ABC executives replaced Keys with Dick Clark's first foray into game-show hosting, The Object Is, which was cancelled after thirteen weeks. On March 30, 1964, Missing Links moved to ABC to replace the cancelled The Object Is with Clark replacing McMahon as host. Its place on NBC's schedule was taken by Jeopardy! which quickly grew in popularity. Shortly after this, CBS began counterprogramming Missing Links with reruns of The Jack Benny Program and the ratings for the game show slid even further. ABC cancelled Missing Links almost nine months later and the show came to an end on December 25, 1964. Episode status All episodes except for three are believed to have been destroyed as per network policies of the era. As part of Buzzr's Lost and Found week the pilot was aired on September 13, 2017. The pilot was one of five episodes that were videotaped on August 21, 1963, approximately three weeks before the episodes were telecast on NBC's daytime schedule. The three panelists for that first week were Milt Kamen, Phyllis Newman and Chester Morris. Toward the end of the pilot, host Ed McMahon can be heard summarizing the unusual story of contestant Gloria Steinem, then a magazine writer and editor who was known for having gone undercover as a Playboy Bunny at a Playboy Club. McMahon says she will appear as a contestant in the next day's episode. Steinem's episode, which was another of the five that were videotaped on August 21, was wiped. A 1964 episode exists with host Dick Clark and panelists Sam Levenson, Kaye Ballard and Joel Grey. An episode dated December 24, 1964 is held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.UCLA Archive: Missing Links and the Library Of Congress. Arlene Francis is one of the three panelists on this episode. Clark is the host. All other episodes were lost as a result of the wiping of reel-to-reel videotapes before the videocassette was invented.

The MOV is the largest civic museum in Canada and the oldest museum in Vancouver. The museum was founded in 1894 and went through a number of iterations before being rebranded as the Museum of Vancouver in 2009. It creates Vancouver-focused exhibitions and programs that encourage conversations about what was, is, and can be Vancouver. It shares an entrance and foyer with the H. R. MacMillan Space Centre but the MOV is much larger and occupies the vast majority of the space in the building complex where both organisations sit as well as separate collections storage facilities in another building.MOV Functioal Program Report, July 2013 Aldrich Pears History The museum was founded by the Art, Historical, and Scientific Association of Vancouver (AHSA), which formed on April 17, 1894, with the objective of cultivating \\"a taste for the beauties and refinements in life.\\"\\"Our detailed History,\\" Museum of Vancouver online . Shortly after its inaugural meeting the AHSA opened its first temporary exhibition ('Paintings and Curiosities') in rented premises on the top floor of the Dunn Building on Granville Street, Vancouver. This exhibition triggered a series of donations to the new museum's collections which were mostly natural history or ethnographic in origin. The first recorded donation to the collection was of taxidermy - a stuffed Trumpeter Swan which was donated by Mr Sydney Williams in 1895. Regular purchasing of artefacts for the collections of the AHSA began in 1898 and acquisitions were eclectic and multi-disciplinary reflecting the interests of the decision-makers rather than any strategic approach to collecting. Carnegie Library. As the collection grew the question was raised as to a permanent place to display it and following discussions with the Vancouver City Council agreement was reached on August 26, 1903 that title to the museum collection would pass to the Council in exchange for the provision of suitable and convenient premises where they could be displayed. It was agreed at the same time that the new museum would be located on the top floor of the new Carnegie Library. The museum opened at this location on April 19, 1905. Between 1915 and 1925 the museum and the AHSA attempted to establish in Stanley Park a reconstructed First Nations village built around a series of major totem and house poles that had been acquired by the AHSA. This project ultimately failed but it did result in the current display of totem poles in Stanley Park which remain one of the most photographed tourist attractions in Vancouver. In 1930 the museum sponsored an extensive series of archaeological excavations of the Marpole Midden which was one of the most important archaeological sites on the Pacific Northwest Coast but was also an unceded ancestral territory of the Musqueam First Nation and was where the village of cÃì…ôsna î…ôm (Musqueam Marpole Village Site) had been located. The outcome of this has been dealt with in the award-winning exhibition cÃì…ôsna î…ôm, the city before the city, a joint project between the Musqueam Indian Band, the Museum of Vancouver and the Museum of Anthropology. In 1957 the public library which shared the Carnegie building with the museum moved to a new dedicated building in Burrard Street tripling the available storage and display space for the museum and in 1959 the museum was incorporated into the City Council and became a city department under the control of a Civic Museum Board. A report was commissioned on the future of the museum (the Heinrich Report of 1965) and this recommended the building of a new museum on the south shore of False Creek near the Burrard Bridge. Federal and provincial money was made available for the 1967 Confederation Centennial celebrations and the current building was constructed which opened to the public in October 1968. From the opening of the new museum building to 1981, the museum was branded as Centennial Museum; before reverting its name back to Vancouver Museum. In 1972 the city council relinquished its control of the museum and a joint Museum and Planetarium Association was formed as a descendant of the original AHSA which founded the museum. In 1977 the museum was designated a Category A cultural institution by the federal government and named in the Cultural Property Export and Import Act. In 2009, the museum was re-branded as the Museum of Vancouver, in an attempt to reflect its changed focus to Vancouver rather than the lower mainland region of British Columbia as originally set out in its objectives and reaffirmed in 1977. Building The Museum of Vancouver as seen from Vanier Park. The museum is situated at the southern portion of the park. The building is located at 1100 Chestnut Street in Vanier Park, in the neighbourhood of Kitsilano in Vancouver, BC. The museum is situated at the south end of Vanier Park, with the park acting as a connecting greenspace between the Vancouver Maritime Museum, Bard on the Beach, the Vancouver Archives, and the Vancouver Academy of Music. The building was constructed in 1967 to a design by the architect Gerald Hamilton who had studied at Leeds University before moving to Vancouver in 1950. Hamilton was a practitioner of the New Formalism school of architecture and its most visible proponent in Vancouver at the time. Originally, the building was planned to only house a museum, but a generous gift by the lumber magnate H.R. MacMillan allowed the architect to incorporate a planetarium into the design. As a result, the distinctive roof was added, designed to reflect the shape of a woven basket hat made by Northwest Coast First Nations people. This decision has created ongoing confusion over the identity of the building as many people associate it mistakenly as only a planetarium whereas the vast majority of the building space is occupied by the galleries of the Museum of Vancouver and the planetarium part was renamed the H.R. MacMillan Space Centre in the late 1990s. The building was officially dedicated on May 20, 1967 and the ceremony was attended by Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra, who was the granddaughter of Queen Mary and King George V and also a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. Alex Bozikovic remarks that the building closesly resembles the John Nugent Studio designed by Saskatchewan architect Clifford Wiens built six years earlier.. The building is considered iconic by Vancouverites and is one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in Vancouver. It was nicknamed 'the Taj Mahal on the creek' when first built and is characterised by its sweeping conical shape and reflecting pools crossed by curved pedestrian bridges. Collection The museum has a large collection of objects which reflect to a large extent the interests of the donors and of the curators who made decisions on acquisitions over the years in a similar way to many museums that were established in this way. The collection is nationally significant but much of it remains in storage due to a lack of exhibition space. The collection includes the First Nations and Oriental artefacts that were collected by Mary Lipsett who established along with her husband the Lipsett Indian Museum which opened in a former aquarium in the PNE grounds in 1941. This collection was said to be the finest in Canada when reported on by the Vancouver Sun in 1948 and Mary Lipsett was well-respected for her positive relationship with the First Nations and was honoured with the Kwawlewith name 'Ha-wini-po-la-o-gua', which means ‚Äúa matriarch to whom many come for good counsel.‚Äù She donated the entire collection to the then Vancouver Museum and it remains in storage there. Particular strengths in the MOV collection include:  Ethnology  One of the most significant Pacific Northwest Coast First Nations collections in Canada with assemblages such as: * Argillite carvings * Small wooden carvings (mini totem poles, figures) * Monumental wooden sculptures (totem poles, house posts) * Baskets (extensive including Nuu-chah-nuith and Coast Salish) * Objects carved by Charles Edenshaw including the Edenshaw Casket * Glass slides painted by Frederick Alexcee * Basket and bracelet collected by George Vancouver on his first voyage to the Pacific Northwest * Selected masks, boxes, bowls, canoes, carvings, regalia * Pauline Johnson's performance costume * Human seated figure bowls and other anthropomorphic or zoomorphic carvings in stone  Asian antiquities  These include collections such as: * Chinese art objects dating from the Shang dynasty (16th-11th century BCE) to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) including a comprehensive ceramics collection from the Han dynasty (206 BCE- 220 CE) to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911; a comprehensive coin collection; ivory carvings, jade carvings, lacquer objects, snuff bottles, textiles, and armour, largely form the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) * Japanese objects dating from the Muromachi period (1392-1572) to the Meiji period (1868-1912 ) including woodblock prints, ceramics, ivory carvings, textiles, armour, swords, sword accessories, Buddhist and Shinto objects and dolls (20th century).

The rule was adopted in the 1990‚Äì91 season and named after New York Knicks player Trent Tucker, and officially adopted in FIBA play starting in 2010. When the WNBA was established in 1997, this rule was adopted too. The Official Rules of the National Basketball Association state :NOT UNDER 0.3 must expire on the game clock and shot clock when a ball is thrown inbounds and then hit instantly out-of-bounds. If under 0.3 expires in such a situation, the timer will be instructed to deduct AT LEAST 0.3 from the game clock and shot clock. If, in the judgment of the official, the play took longer than 0.3, he will instruct the timer to deduct more time. If under 0.3 remain on the game clock when this situation occurs, the period is over. If under 0.3 remain on the shot clock when this situation occurs, a shot clock violation is called. :The game clock and shot clock must show at least .3 in order for a player to secure possession of the ball on a rebound or throw-in to attempt a field goal. Instant replay shall be utilized if the basket is successful on this type of play and the game clock runs to 0.0 or the shot clock expires on a made basket and the officials are not reasonably certain that the ball was released prior to the expiration of the shot clock. The only type of field goal which may be scored if the game clock and shot clock are at 0.2 or 0.1 is a ‚Äútip-in‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh lob.‚Äù The Article 16.2.5 of the 2010 FIBA Official Rules states: \\"The game clock must indicate 0.3 (three tenths of a second) or more for a player to gain control of the ball on a throw-in or on a rebound after the last or only free throw in order to attempt a shot for a field goal. If the game clock indicates 0.2 or 0.1 the only type of a valid field goal made is by tapping or directly dunking the ball.\\" The incident The rule was born out of a game between the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls on January 15, 1990 at Madison Square Garden. The game was tied at 106 with one- tenth of a second left in regulation and the Knicks in possession. During a time-out called by the Knicks, both teams prepared for what was seen as the only possible way the Knicks could win in regulation: an alley oop tap-in from out of bounds by Patrick Ewing. When play resumed, the Knicks player throwing the ball in, Mark Jackson, saw the alley-oop play get broken up. He proceeded to throw the ball inbounds to Tucker, who was the only player open. Tucker then turned around and hit a three-point jump shot before the buzzer, giving the Knicks the win, 109‚Äì106. Replays showed that the clock was not started until Tucker's shot was already midair and coming down towards the basket. The protest The Bulls, led by first-year head coach Phil Jackson, later filed an official protest with the NBA about the play. By their estimate, the play took closer to 0.4 seconds. However, timekeeper Bob Billings and referee Ronnie Nunn, who were working that game, claimed everything went perfectly fine. The protest was disallowed. Vice president of operations Rod Thorn was the only NBA executive to side with the Bulls. (Incidentally, Thorn was once the general manager of the Bulls.) Thorn argued that it was physically impossible for a player to receive an inbounds pass and release it for a shot in less than a tenth of a second. He pointed out that tests in European basketball leagues, which had counted down the final minute of a period in tenths of seconds for many years (the NBA had just adopted it for 1989‚Äì90), proved that a catch-and-shoot takes at least three-tenths of a second. Rule implementation Although the Bulls lost the protest, the dispute became the backbone for the time requirements of the new rule. Teams with the possession of the ball with less than 00.3 left also have the option of trying a Hail Mary shot like the one that the Knicks were going to try before Tucker's shot, or to simply let the clock run to zero. At the start of the 1989‚Äì90 season, the NBA had adopted a rule from FIBA making game clocks register tenths of seconds in the final minute of a period. Madison Square Garden, like the majority of NBA venues at the time, used an American Sign & Indicator scoreboard. During the first weeks of the season, it was evident the manufacturer's scoreboards would have frequent calibration flaws with tenths in the final minute. In some cases the clock would be very inconsistent in timing tenths, while in other cases after calibration, the clock would actually \\"freeze\\" at one-tenth of a second before 00.0 appeared. The firm would be purchased by Trans-Lux eventually, and many college arenas which had AS&I; scoreboards did not modify their scoreboards to carry tenths, knowing of the problems, until at least their purchase by Trans-Lux. (The NCAA did not officially adopt tenths until 2001; middle & high schools adopted this around 1990.) The notorious scoreboard problems of the AS&I; units led to most new arenas switching to rivals White Way, Daktronics (which Madison Square Garden now uses), or in recent years, Canadian manufacturer OES. The late NBA Commissioner David Stern made it a requirement that all NBA arenas have their official game clocks properly calibrated in the wake of the incident, resulting in scoreboard overhaul. The AS&I; scoreboards' notorious problem with clock mismanagement would sometimes still be a problem at some venues where the clock would still \\"hold\\" at one-tenth of a second, before the horn sounded. This was after Bulls coach Phil Jackson noted that this clock incident was not the first in Madison Square Garden. As a player for the Knicks in the 1970s, he noted that the clock there tended to run slower when they were behind, but faster when they were ahead. Further changes in 1991 were designed to eliminate the problem with the AS&I; units with a new directive for 1991‚Äì92 to add shot clocks with duplicate game time. At that point most venues purchased new scoreboards from White Way, Fair-Play, or Daktronics because of the calibration consistency of the new units. Very few NBA teams purchased the AS&I; (or later, Trans-Lux) units when the new rule was adopted in 1991. The last NBA arena to use the manufacturer's unit was the Charlotte Coliseum (II), which installed a successor Trans-Lux unit for the 2001‚Äì02 season (the Hornets' last in Charlotte, but the arena closed after the 2004‚Äì05 season, the Bobcats' inaugural season, after its replacement, the Spectrum Center, opened (with a new Daktronics unit). By 2011, all NBA venues used either a Daktronics or OES system. In 2002, the NBA instituted new rules regarding the end of period indicators. A LED light strip on the backboard and the scorer's table replaced the traditional electric red light behind the backboard, and a shot clock visible to all three viewable sides was mandated. Venues using Daktronics units installed new four-sided shot clocks with red indicator lights on the sides of the shot time to further assist the electric light. By 2004, shot clocks were available with a perimeter light strip around the clock that also lit up when the clock read 00.0. Today, the see-through shot clock units from Daktronics and OES have implemented the light strips that surround the shot clock that are turned on upon the clock registering 0.0. In recent years, timekeeping rules have changed with the implementation of a system where the blowing of an official's whistle stops the clock at the instant of the whistle, along with a rule change where the on-court official (not an official at the scorer's table) starts the clock by pressing a button attached to the official's belt. On December 20, 2006, New York Knicks forward David Lee scored a game-winning basket with only 0.1 left on the clock. The shot counted because Lee deflected in the inbounds pass into the basket (just like what was foreseen by the Knicks and Bulls in their game years before). This was the first occurrence of a team winning an NBA game with 0.1 left since Trent Tucker, and coincidentally from the same team, the New York Knicks. Furthermore, this took place after the NBA adopted the Precision Time Systems unit, where officials, not the timer, start the clock. In 2004, FIBA adopted a rule where the system would be mandatory in international competitions. Michael Jordan, Charles Oakley and Patrick Ewing, all of whom participated in the original Trent Tucker game, were in attendance at the David Lee game in Madison Square Garden. In 2010, FIBA instituted Article 16.2.5 to officially institute the Trent Tucker Rule in international basketball. Another example of this rule being invoked occurred at the end of a game between the University of South Florida and Florida Gulf Coast University on December 17, 2013, when FGCU appeared to tie the game at 68 on a Chase Fieler shot off a full-court inbounds pass with 0.3 seconds remaining in double overtime. Replays showed that Fieler got the shot off before the 0.3 expired, but the equivalent NCAA rule (Rule 5, Section 18, Article 1) was invoked to waive the Fieler basket, giving USF the win. However, under the FIBA and NBA interpretation, the restrictions only apply to 0.2 or 0.1, as the ball was put in play at 0.3. The NBA in 2016 adopted a deal with Tissot, requiring all scoreboards and shot clocks be manufactured by the Swiss timekeeper. All NBA venues must use the identical Tissot unit during games for consistency reasons.

The materials can be designed for specific function and applications. Various approaches based on the bulk (particulate processing), preform processing, layer processing and melt processing are used to fabricate the functionally graded materials. History The concept of FGM was first considered in Japan in 1984 during a space plane project, where a combination of materials used would serve the purpose of a thermal barrier capable of withstanding a surface temperature of 2000 K and a temperature gradient of 1000 k across a 10 mm section. In recent years this concept has become more popular in Europe, particularly in Germany. A transregional collaborative research center (SFB Transregio) is funded since 2006 in order to exploit the potential of grading monomaterials, such as steel, aluminium and polypropylen, by using thermomechanically coupled manufacturing processes. General information The basic structural units of FGMs are elements or material ingredients represented by maxel. The term maxel was introduced in 2005 by Rajeev Dwivedi and Radovan Kovacevic at Research Center for Advanced Manufacturing (RCAM). The attributes of maxel include the location and volume fraction of individual material components. A maxel is also used in the context of the additive manufacturing processes (such as stereolithography, selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, etc.) to describe a physical voxel (a portmanteau of the words 'volume' and 'element'), which defines the build resolution of either a rapid prototyping or rapid manufacturing process, or the resolution of a design produced by such fabrication means. Applications There are many areas of application for FGM. The concept is to make a composite material by varying the microstructure from one material to another material with a specific gradient. This enables the material to have the best of both materials. If it is for thermal, or corrosive resistance or malleability and toughness both strengths of the material may be used to avoid corrosion, fatigue, fracture and stress corrosion cracking. The transition between the two materials can usually be approximated by means of a power series. The aircraft and aerospace industry and the computer circuit industry are very interested in the possibility of materials that can withstand very high thermal gradients.http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT2000/images/5920arnold3.jpg This is normally achieved by using a ceramic layer connected with a metallic layer. The Air Vehicles Directorate has conducted a Quasi-static bending test results of functionally graded titanium/titanium boride test specimens which can be seen below. The test correlated to the finite element analysis (FEA) using a quadrilateral mesh with each element having its own structural and thermal properties. Advanced Materials and Processes Strategic Research Programme (AMPSRA) have done analysis on producing a thermal barrier coating using Zr02 and NiCoCrAlY. Their results have proved successful but no results of the analytical model are published. The rendition of the term that relates to the additive fabrication processes has its origins at the RMRG (Rapid Manufacturing Research Group) at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom. The term forms a part of a descriptive taxonomy of terms relating directly to various particulars relating to the additive CAD-CAM manufacturing processes, originally established as a part of the research conducted by architect Thomas Modeen into the application of the aforementioned techniques in the context of architecture. Gradient of elastic modulus essentially changes the fracture toughness of adhesive contacts. Modeling and simulation Functionally graded armor tile after ballistic testing (front and back) Numerical methods have been developed for modelling the mechanical response of FGMs, with the finite element method being the most popular one. Initially, the variation of material properties was introduced by means of rows (or columns) of homogeneous elements, leading to a discontinuous step- type variation in the mechanical properties. Later, Santare and Lambros developed functionally graded finite elements, where the mechanical property variation takes place at the element level. Mart√≠nez-Pa√±eda and Gallego extended this approach to commercial finite element software. Contact properties of FGM can be simulated using the Boundary Element Method (which can be applied both to non-adhesive and adhesive contacts). Molecular dynamics simulation has also been implemented to study functionally graded materials. M. Islam studied the mechanical and vibrational properties of functionally graded Cu-Ni nanowires using molecular dynamics simulation.

Stereotypes of South Asians are broadly believed impressions about individuals of South Asian origin that are often inconsistent with reality. While the impressions are wrongly presumed to be universally true for all people of South Asian origin, these stereotypes adversely affect the South Asians as well as the acculturation process.Hagendoorn, L, (1993), Ethnic categorization and outgroup exclusion: The role of cultural values and social stereotypes in the construction of ethnic hierarchies, Ethnic and Racial Studies, 16, pages 26‚Äì51John Berry (1997), Immigration, Acculturation, and Adaptation, Applied Psychology: An International Review, 46 (1), pages 5‚Äì68 With 20th century immigration of South Asians around the world, especially to the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, ethnic stereotyping of South Asians has become common place. These stereotypes have been found by scholars to be dehumanizing, making South Asians more prone to mistreatment and crime, a constraint on their ability to productively contribute, as well as a cause of depression and ill health.Isobel Bowler (1993), They're not the same as us: midwives stereotypes of South Asian descent maternity patients, Sociology of Health & Illness, Volume 15, Number 2, pages 157‚Äì178Jennifer Wang, John Oliver Siy, and Sapna Cheryan (2011), RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG ASIAN AMERICAN YOUTH, in Frederick T. Leong, Linda Juang (Editors), Ethnic stereotypes of South Asians have included Orientalism and Romanticism as well as scientific racism. These stereotypes are applied in both an unrealistically ideal way and sometimes an unrealistically negative way.  Contemporary stereotypes  South Asians are stereotyped around the world in ways that are dehumanizing, and in some cases it can lead to depression and mental health issues.Rahman and Pollock, Acculturation, Competence, and Mental Health Among South Asian Students in the United States, Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development, Volume 32, Issue 3, pages 130‚Äì142, July 2004Ankita Rao, The Persistence of Apu: Why Hollywood Still Mocks South Asians The Slate (May 7, 2012) Stereotypes included cultural prejudices related to the South Asian predilection for certain professions, such as medicine, engineering, and computing, or their presence in service industries as motel owners or cab drivers.Peter Claus et al. (2002), South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia, , Routledge, page 109 As South Asians continue to assimilate, more positive perceptions prevail.Marieke Jochimsen, Deconstruction of Stereotypes, Asian British Culture on Film and TV, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universit√§t, M√úNSTER, Germany (March 2008) Dual socioeconomic profiling South Asians are stereotyped as belonging to two socioeconomic groups. They are stereotyped either as convenience store or restaurant owners, cab drivers or motel operators who are uneducated, greedy, with large families and live in crowded homes. Alternatively, they are stereotyped as snobbish, upwardly mobile software programmers and doctors, who lack English-speaking fluency and are willing to take a lower salary. These stereotypes are built, claim scholars,Jorge Sanchez, The South Asian Neighbour and Her/His Stereotype Goes Global, Universidad de Salamanca, (2012) by media shows such as the Bangladeshi store owners represented as Sirajul and Mujibur in David Letterman's show, or by the character Apu in The Simpsons, or the Babu Bhatt character on Seinfeld, or the British TV show The Kumars at No. 42 (though this may be an intentional invoking of the stereotype to call attention to it). This contrasts with the reality that South Asians are active, in various levels of prominence and service, in every profession. Model minority Along with East Asian people, South Asians are stereotyped as model minorities with certain expected behavior.Navaratnam, S. (2011), Guilt, Shame and Model Minorities: How South Asian Youth in Toronto Navigate the Canadian Educational System, MA Thesis, University of Toronto, Canada These stereotypes are encouraged by media stories such an article by Forbes Magazine entitled \\"Indian Americans: The New Model Minority\\". Richwine claims, \\"The success of Indian Americans is often ascribed to the culture they bring with them, which places strong ‚Äì some would even say obsessive ‚Äì emphasis on academic achievement\\". The article highlights how Indian American children win spelling bee contests, but the article does not mention that some Indian-American immigrant children also struggle to learn fluent English as a second language.Richwine, J. (2009), Indian Americans: The new model minority, Forbes Magazine. February 2, 2009 Similarly, while Asian Indians in the United States have among the highest percentage of college degrees as well as highest income among all ethnic and racial groups, for every South Asian who has a degree with high income, there is another South Asian who struggles to gain job skills and become trained to be gainfully employed.Sarita Ahuja and Robert Chlala, Widening the Lens on Boys and Men of Color, AAPI & AMEMSA PERSPECTIVES, California, page 12 (June 2013)C.N. Le, School of Education at Johns Hopkins University-A Closer Look at Asian Americans and Education Johns Hopkins University (2010) South Asian women  In a 1993 study of stereotypes held by midwives in the British National Health Service, several stereotypes were found to be prevalent against women of South Asian descent. One, the South Asian mothers were stereotyped as abusing the social service and failing to take recommended treatment. Second, they were stereotyped as those who make fuss about nothing. Third, they were stereotyped as lacking 'normal maternal instinct'. The study found communication difficulties to be part of the problem, particularly among women who were Muslim South Asians with Urdu as their first language; this problem vanished when hospital staff of South Asian descent were included in the team attending the expectant mother. Further, the study found experimenter's bias in a population wide study that included native British people, people of South Asian descent and people from other parts of the world.Jowell and Airey (1984), British Social Attitudes, Gower, London, Contrary to the stereotypes, comparative analysis revealed that the rate of health care service use, rate of diligent treatment and follow up, as well as 'maternal instinct' behavior was no different among South Asian women than natives or other ethnic groups. Too eager or awkward in assimilation Two conflicting but prevailing stereotypes in Europe and North America relate to alienation and assimilation by people of South Asian origins. Hernandez, for example, in her analysis of Richard Rodriguez ‚Äì the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award winner ‚Äì and V.S. Naipaul ‚Äì the Nobel laureate in literature of Indo-Caribbean origin ‚Äì quotes Albert Memmi's classic, illustrating the stereotype. Memmi claims they make every effort to look Western, in the hope that no one will recognise them; from this proceeds their efforts to forget their past, to change their collective customs, their enthusiastic adoption of the Western language, culture and values, alleges Memmi. Simultaneously these people are also stereotyped as old fashioned, irrational, weird in their customs, servile to their ethnic habits, lacking all sense of individuality, not eager to learn and grow, not speaking or adopting local language (for example, French or English), not wanting to assimilate and be a part of the melting pot. Some stereotype them as betraying a past, others as betraying the future. These stereotypes reflect innate discomfort, confusion and possibly a struggle with rejection by those who stereotype as well as those who are being stereotyped. Hernandez notes, for Naipaul, after a start in a humble family background, personal and professional success could only be achieved through learning, understanding and assimilation. This conflicting stereotype is not unique to South Asians. As Hernandez outlines, the same stereotypes exist against people from different regions of the world, such as against Rodriguez of Mexico. Historical  Komagata Maru  In 1914, a steamer named Komagata Maru arrived in the harbour of Vancouver, Canada. On it were 376 Indians, mostly Sikhs. Both Canada and India were part of the British Commonwealth at the time, movement of people and migration within the empire was permissible, with millions of Indians sought by the British government for its World War I efforts outside India. The passengers on Komagata Maru were not soldiers but workers. The provincial government stopped the steamer at sea, refused the tired passengers from disembarking for two months, argued that the South Asians didn't belong in Canada, then forced the steamer and passengers to go back to India. Political leaders and newspaper media parroted allegations, impressions and cartoons for two months, mocking the immigrants waiting in the boat at sea.see: *Media Representations of the Komagata Maru Incident Simon Fraser University (2010) *The story, documents and cartoons against Komagata Maru Canada This action has been explained by scholars,Robert McDonald (2011), Making Vancouver: Class, Status, and Social Boundaries, 1863‚Äì1913, University of British Columbia Press, , pages 206‚Äì207Patricia Roy, British Fear of Asians, 1900‚Äì1950, in British Columbia: Historical Readings, Douglas & McIntyre, 1981 as a result of four stereotypes. First, they were stereotyped as polluting the collective character of British Columbia as a land of White, European-based settlers. Second, South Asians were stereotyped to be from an insulated and unassimilable culture. Third, they were stereotyped as those who were willing to work for less than fair wage. Fourth, South Asians were stereotyped as unclean, diseased and a threat to public health. Robert McDonald suggests that these stereotypes were false because it was the prevalent prejudice that contributed to their segregation and difficulty in their assimilation, they did not compete with Whites for employment but took the unskilled and rough jobs for which there were no White workers available, and they were neither diseased nor unclean as wealthier Europeans families eagerly sought them as cooks and errand houseboys inside their homes. The stereotypes, claims Robert McDonald, were irrational constructions. After being forced to go back, Komagata Maru returned to India with emotionally distraught and angry Indians. Some were arrested on arrival of the steamer in Calcutta by British officials, few shot for resisting arrest, others jumped off the ship and escaped, then joined the cause of independence of India from British rule. The Indian government in 1952, and the Canadian government in 1989 marked the Komagata Maru incident with memorials and a reminder of the dangers of discrimination and stereotypes.Citizenship and Immigration Canada Government of Canada (2009)Voyage of the Komagata Maru Echoes of Freedom Series, University of California, Berkeley (2009) On May 18, 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tendered a formal \\"full apology\\" for the incident in the House of Commons. Indomania Friedrich Schlegel wrote in a letter to Tieck that India was the source of all languages, thoughts and poems, and that \\"everything\\" came from India.Ludwig Tieck und die Br√ºder Schlegel, Briefe. Edited by L√ºdecke. Frankfurt/M. 1930. In the 18th century, Voltaire wrote that \\"I am convinced that everything has come down to us from the banks of the Ganges, astronomy, astrology and metempsychosis.Voltaire, Lettres sur l'origine des sciences et sur celle des peuples de l'Asie (first published Paris, 1777), letter of 15 December 1775. Mark Twain similarly enthused about Indian culture and achievements. Indophobia The term \\"Indophobia\\" was first coined in western academia by American Indologist Thomas Trautmann to describe negative attitudes expressed by some British Indologists against Indian history, society, religions and culture.\\"Aryans and British India\\". Thomas R. Trautmann Historians have noted that during the British Empire, \\"evangelical influence drove British policy down a path that tended to minimize and denigrate the accomplishments of Indian civilization and to position itself as the negation of the earlier British Indomania that was nourished by belief in Indian wisdom.\\"Trautmann 1997:113 In Charles Grant's highly influential \\"Observations on the ...Asiatic subjects of Great Britain\\" (1796),Grant, Charles. (1796) Observations on the state of society among the Asiatic subjects of Great Britain, particularly with respect to morals; and on the means of improving it, written chiefly in the year 1792. Grant alleged that the Hindus are \\"a people exceedingly depraved\\". Similarly, British colonial era historian, James Mill claimed that both Indians and Chinese people are cowardly, unfeeling, and mendacious. Both Mill and Grant attacked Orientalist scholarship that was too respectful of Indian culture.Mill, James ‚Äì 1858, 2:109, The history of British India. James Mill wrote extensively about India and on Eastern religions, even though he never once visited India.Leonard Gordon, in Ainslie Embree and Carol Gluck (Editors), Asia in Western and World History, , Columbia Project on Asia, M.E. Sharpe Inc, pages 138‚Äì142 Nevertheless, James Mill was widely read, and influenced the initial impressions of South Asia in Western mind. Mill was later criticised for being prejudiced against Hindus.Trautmann 1997:117 The Indologist H.H. Wilson wrote that the tendency of Mill's work is \\"evil\\".H.H. Wilson 1858 in James Mill 1858, The history of British India, Preface of the editor Such historic Indophobic literature has been suggested as a cause of dehumanizing stereotypes about South Asians.Bhabha, Homi, Of mimicry and man: the ambivalence of colonial discourse, October, Volume 28, Discipleship: A Special Issue on Psychoanalysis (Spring, 1984), MIT Press, pages 125‚Äì133Kopf (1980), Hermeneutics versus history, Journal of Asian Studies, 39(3), pages 495‚Äì506 Rebellion and miscegenation Stereotypes of Indians intensified and changed during and after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 when some Indian sepoys and members of the native population rebelled against the British East India Company's rule in India. It has been argued that allegations of war rape were used as propaganda by British colonialists to justify the colonisation of India. While incidents of rape committed by Indian rebels against English women and girls were generally uncommon during the rebellion, this was exaggerated to great effect by the British media to justify British colonialism in the Indian subcontinent and to violently suppress opposition. At the time, British newspapers had printed various apparently eyewitness accounts of English women and girls being raped by Indian rebels, with little corroboration to support these accounts. It was later found that some of these accounts were false stories and a few created to paint the native people of India as savages who needed to be civilised by British colonialists, a mission sometimes known as \\"The White Man's Burden\\". One such account published by The Times, regarding an incident where 48 English girls as young as 10‚Äì14 had been raped by Indian rebels in Delhi, was criticised as false propaganda by Karl Marx, who pointed out that the story was written by a clergyman in Bangalore, far from the events of the rebellion. These stereotypes and allegations were later argued as false by scholars, but they did harden the British attitude to the Indian population.Hall, C. '\\"From Greenland's icy mountains ... to Africa's golden sand\\": ethnicity, race and nation in mid 19th-century England' Gender and History 5 (1993) pp. 219‚Äì221 The stereotype of the Indian \\"dark- skinned rapist\\" occurred frequently in English literature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The idea of protecting English \\"female chastity\\" from the \\"lustful Indian male\\" had a significant influence on the policies of the British Raj to prevent racial miscegenation between the British elite and the native Indian population. While most of these discriminatory policies were directed against native Indians, some restrictive policies were also imposed on British females to \\"protect\\" them from miscegenation.  Sexual jealousy  Indo-Caribbean people were brought to the Caribbean from various parts of India as indentured labourers for agricultural estates over a century ago. At these times they were stereotyped as being jealous for women of their ethnic origins. For example: > The shortage of Indian women resulted in violence committed by jealous > lovers and husbands, creating a stereotype of East Indian men, which gained > in infamy, coolies reputation with the police was bad and significantly > while the Negroes use their tongue in argument, the Indian commit murder, > and given the scarcity of Indian women, without hesitation. Thus the > stereotype is reinforced ascribing to the Indian husband a frantically > jealous and physically violent disposition.Ramdin, Ron. Arising from > Bondage: A History of the Indo-Caribbean People. Published by NYU Press, > 2000, Unqualified to be a judge In 1883, the Ilbert Bill, which would have granted judges of Indian descent in Bengal the right to judge offenders irrespective of their ethnic origins including those of British descent, was opposed by the British. The opposition was based on stereotyping Indian judges as someone who could not be trusted in dealing with cases involving English women, colloquially called memsahib. The British press in India even spread wild rumours about how Indian judges would abuse their power to fill their harems with white English females, which helped raise considerable support against the bill. The stereotype of Indian males as dark-skinned rapists lusting after white English females was challenged by several novels such as E. M. Forster's A Passage to India (1924) and Paul Scott's The Jewel in the Crown (1966), both of which involve an Indian male being wrongly accused of raping an English female. Some activists argued that these stereotypes were wrong because Indians had proven to be more receptive to women's rights and progress, with the University of Calcutta becoming one of the first universities to admit female graduates to its degree programmes in 1878, before any of the British universities.  Region-specific stereotypes   Great Britain and English-speaking territories   Cultural stereotypes  British sociologists Mike O'Donnell and Sue Sharpe studied British Asian students and came to similar conclusions regarding problems faced by Asian youths at lower class schools. Whereas Black British students were respected and admired by their White British peers as \\"macho,\\" Asian youths had trouble gaining this same kind of respect and status. O'Donnell and Sharpe found that many Asian youths are stereotyped as weaklings, warriors or as a patriarch.Sociology AS for OCR Stephen Moore, Dave Aiken, Steve Chapman, Peter Langley pages 250-251 The weakling stereotype, found in Great Britain and English speaking territories, refers to the idea that South Asians are conformists, intelligent, lacking in athletic ability and non- confrontational.SELVARAJ VELAYUTHAM, \\"Everyday Racism in Singapore\\" (Proceedings of the Everyday Multiculturalism Conference of the CRSI ‚Äì 28‚Äì29 Sep 2006), Centre for Research on Social Inclusion, Macquarie University, February 2007, . The warrior stereotype is growing in the United Kingdom. Some Brits stereotype Sikhs and Muslims as warriors and inbred, as opposed to the rest of the South Asian community who are generally viewed as Hindu pacifists or intellects. The Warrior stereotype has become the replacement for the Thug stereotype. During Colonial Era, South Asian criminals were referred as Thugs due to the presence of the Thuggee syndicate. The word thug originates from the syndicate and was originally used as a term for South Asian criminals. Due to the African-American hip-hop group adopting the name Thug Life, the word Thug is no longer associated with South Asian criminals. Many South Asian youths are often caricatured as rebelling against a society which stereotypes them as a model minority, as well as against their perceived strict upbringing. In comparison to the Hindu Community, the South Asian Muslim community tend to be viewed: more likely to be in poverty, more likely to be in prison, and more likely to be less educated. This has fed the stereotype that Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are more aggressive and form gangs. They are then further stereotyped as having poor social skills, being unable to speak to ordinary White British people and have poor listening skills. Since post 9/11 and 7/7, South Asians Muslims (Particularly those of Bangladeshi and Pakistani origin), have been stereotyped as anti-Western. This may have contributed to increased tensions with ethnic and religious groups in the West.MMU Psychology Journal (Dissertations) In literary studies, critics such as Homi Bhabha and Rey Chow have theorized that cultural stereotypes prevail because they work through repetition and ambivalence, easily shifting between contradictory meanings. Thus in colonial culture the 'native' or 'ethnic' is stereotyped as sly and indolent, lascivious and impotent.Bhabha, Homi. The Location of Culture (Routledge, 1994); Chow, Rey. The Protestant Ethnic and the Spirit of Capitalism (Columbia University Press, 2002) More recently, scholars such as Mrinalini Chakravorty have considered how contemporary fiction from and about South Asia traffics in stereotypes.Chakravorty, Mrinalini. In Stereotype: South Asia in the Global Literary Imaginary (Columbia University Press, 2014)  China  Due to China's economic rivalry with India, a large number of Chinese view India aggressively, with several negative stereotypes of Indians commonplace in Chinese culture. In 2012 Krish Raghav, an Indian journalist, stated that within China, the notion of India and Indian-ness is largely built on rumour and stereotype.\\"In Beijing, Indians are seen as stereotypes or not seen at all\\", Raghav, Krish (31 December 2012), Quartz. Within the Chinese state media, there is China's official line, parroted in newspapers and TV news media, of India as a \\"rival\\"; India's woeful infrastructure is emphasised and connected to defects of democracy. Historical documentaries on China Central Television paint Indians as \\"soldiers of the British\\", lumping them together with other imperialist powers. Raghav reported that for China's online community, \\"India\\" is a combined construct of the character Rajesh Koothrappali from the sitcom Big Bang Theory, the comedian Russell Peters, images of overcrowded Indian train with people hanging off the sides, and dead bodies floating down the river Ganges. These stereotypes are frequently evoked with the descriptor, \\"disgusting\\". The smell of curry is often used as a derogatory epithet. However, many Chinese view Indian Hindus with positive attributes too due to historic connections through Buddhism and ancient cultural contact. A commonly held view is that India is rich in culture but under-developed.  Malaysia  Currently, around 7% of Malaysia's population consists of Indians, mainly from the Tamil ethno-linguistic group of Southern India, as a minority of a largely Malay population in Peninsular Malaysia. There are many stereotypes concerning Malaysian Indians. Some of them include that Malaysian Indians are considered as heavy drinkers and robbers. Malaysian Indians are also primely suspected of being members of Gangster or Terrorist Organisations and sometimes become victims to false accusation. Racism still remains a major problem in Malaysia and some stereotypes have led to cases of public bullying and racially hurtful commentary, such as being called a 'Keling', 'mabuk' (drunkard) etc.  Singapore  Around 10% of Singapore's population consists of Indians, mainly from the Tamil ethno-linguistic group of Southern India, as a minority of a largely Chinese population. There are also some 160,000 non-skilled foreigners currently working in Singapore ‚Äì a majority of them are from the Indian subcontinent. A stereotype of Singaporean Indians is that the Indian body is lacking in athleticism. They are however the richest and most successful ethnic group in Singapore, with exceptional educational attainment rates and low levels of poverty. Racism remains a minor problem in Singapore and some stereotypes have led to cases of public bullying and racially hurtful commentary, such as being called a 'black tofu'. Lower class foreign workers congregate in the Indian historical and now tourist enclave called Little India. Little India with its large concentration of Indians is not frequented by some Chinese Singaporeans because it is perceived as an alien space which is potentially threatening and dangerous. In 2013 a minor riot occurred in the area involving construction workers from Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, which helped fuel stereotypes of construction workers as being dangerous.  Fiji  In Fiji, another country where large numbers of people of Indian origin were brought for agricultural plantation work, over 125 years ago, they are viewed in a manner different from some other parts of the world. Sienkiewicz finds the stereotypes popular in Pacific Islands is that Indians are too materialistic, caring only about money; that while the Indians work very hard to attain financial success, they refuse to share it. People with origins in India are also thought in Fiji to be too private and lacking a culture of caring for larger families. Indians, Sienkiewicz finds, intentionally prefer to be in nuclear families, living in isolated homes rather than communal joint families in koros (villages). Some she interviewed claimed, \\"Before we were in extended families, but now we are all in nuclear families. Just a small house, their family and that's it. Relatives come and they go; they do not live in that house. It is a better way of living. Everyone's needs and wants are cared for. Mostly, by having nuclear families and not living in the koro (village), we find that there is less conflict, less chance of conflict.\\" This preference for private and diligent life is a matter of significant ethnic stereotypes and conflicts in Fiji. Sienkiewicz suggests that the British incorporation of the ethnic separation model in Fiji, while originally devised to help colonialists govern smoothly, has had long-term effects on the ethnic identities and mutual stereotypes between both Fijians and Indians in Fiji. New Zealand A Massey University study finds that the ethnic minority of Indian descent are stereotyped, but so are other ethnic groups. However, inter-ethnic and stereotypes-driven bullying of students of Indian descent was higher; the students of Indian descent were least likely to retaliate, report abuse to authorities or approach officials for assistance in prevention. Stereotyped and bullied Asian Indians were most likely to accept suffering, emotional trauma and ill health problems.A. Sobrun-Maharaj, The Social Acceptance of Visible Ethnic Minority Adolescents of Asian Origin in Auckland Secondary Schools, Ph.D. Thesis, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand (2002) Ethnic groups of Maori, European and Chinese descent stereotyped Asian Indians with attributes such as arrogant, lazy, stupid, sexist, and perverts. Negative stereotypes for Asian Indians included being presumed as unfriendly, cliquish, unemotional, weird, snobbish, uncivilised, terrorists and cheap. Many of these stereotypes did not lead to inter-ethnic bullying, but some did. United States Cultural prejudices in American schools Cultural stereotypes prevalent in American schools negatively impact students of South Asian origin, in terms of social stress, feeling dehumanized and their general sense of well being.See: * Anju Kaduvettoor-Davidson, South Asian Americans: Perceived Discrimination, Stress and Well-being, Lehigh University, 2010; * Kaduvettoor-Davidson, Anju; Inman, Arpana G. (September 2013), South Asian Americans: Perceived discrimination, stress, and well-being, Asian American Journal of Psychology, Vol 4(3), Sep 2013, pages 155‚Äì165 American sociologist Yvette Rosser finds that negative attitudes and images about South Asian cultures are taught in American schools or through the media, and these misconceptions may color people's personal socialization experiences.Joseph Zajda (2004), Cultural transferability and cross-cultural textbook development, Education and Society, 22(1), pages 83-‚Äì95 Sensationalist news stories about India often reinforce preconceived ideas. Social studies teachers can play a critical role in eliminating cultural prejudices, but instead typically reinforce stereotypes about cultures different from their own, and present biased information about Asians, thereby losing the opportunity for deeper understanding. In numerous interviews of students of Asian descent, as compiled by Rosser, individuals of Asian origin were asked the following questions: *Describe any stereotypes and misrepresentations about India that were taught in America as fact. *Do you feel, as a student of South Asian descent, that your presence in the classroom had an influence on the manner in which the course materials on India (or Asia in general) were presented? *If Indian and South Asian topics were presented in your classes, what ideas were emphasized? *Compare the coverage of South Asia with that of other areas of Asia. Many Americans of South Asian origin who participated in the survey reported numerous stereotypes. Some sample stereotypes reported by Rosser, and others,Nita Tewari and Alvin N. Alvarez (Editors), Asian American Psychology: Current Perspectives, , Taylor & Francis, pages 321‚Äì325 include the following: Rosser notes that the stereotypical discourse in much of the United States about South Asia is rarely devoted to economic development and democratic institutions in independent India. India is not depicted as a viable political state. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about its religion and culture, but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge whereas its attempts to modernize or develop are to be winked at and patronized. After her own studies, Rosser began to question the interpretations of some of the more well-known, leftist-oriented scholars from India who dissect the nascent nation, for whatever reasons, along with their Western counterparts, regularly demonize India's national urges, deconstructing and disempowering individuals of South Asian origin. Most people stereotype South Asians as if the nation is little more than \\"Taj Mahal, famine, hunger, population, poverty, Hare Krishna, and Gandhi.\\"Rukmani, T. S. (1998), International Conference on the Hindu Diaspora ‚Äì A Review, International Migration Review, 32(1), pages 227‚Äì230 Alternatively, the stereotypes stress prejudices about \\"Hinduism, the caste system, poverty, third world country, inferiority\\" as if that is all India is. One survey participant confided that the diversity of views and culture within India was not depicted accurately and \\"only negativity was enforced; we of South Asian origin are stereotyped as that we all starve, eat monkey brains, worship rats and cows.\\" It is as if every single individual in India is oppressed or oppressing others, it is stereotyped as a backward country that treats their women poorly and kills their baby girls. Checking for facts or reality is considered unnecessary. Similar observations have been made by other scholars, for both recent immigrants and second generation South Asian Americans born in the United States.Das & Kemp (1997), Between two worlds: Counseling South Asian Americans, Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development, 25(1), pages 23‚Äì33Inman et al., Bereavement and coping of South-Asian families, Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development, 35, pages 101‚Äì115 In the minds of many Americans, Rosser writes, Indian women are to be pitied and the positive social progress made by many women in India is completely ignored. Despite the fact that women's right to vote, other labor and civil rights in the United States took time in American history, such facts are never contextualized or compared to the social and political uplift of modern Indian women. The prevailing image is that if the unfortunate females of South Asia survive a deprived childhood they are likely to be burned in a dowry death after their forced marriage to a complete stranger. Indian women are shown as downtrodden and powerless victims, unlike American women who have more freedom. Indira Gandhi is seen as an anomaly. The numerous Indian women who every year join the colleges in America are also seen as anomalous. Rosser notes that while India's religion and the caste system are emphasized in American discourse, no mention is made of post-independence secular India's efforts toward national integration of its minorities. No mention is made of laws and efforts against discrimination, or the country's 60-year effort towards active inclusion of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe population in educational and employment opportunities. People also forget to introspect the fact that social discrimination and prejudice has been a widespread worldwide issue, for example the treatment of African Americans in southern United States. Outsourcing/offshoring/call centres Barack Obama has said that the prevailing stereotype being cultivated against Indians in the United States is that \\"all U.S. jobs are being outsourced to India,\\" and the stereotype is adversely affecting India-United States relations. He also commented that such stereotypes have \\"outlived their usefulness\\" and \\"ignore today's reality.\\" Obama said, \\"Trade between our countries is not just a one- way street of American jobs and companies moving to India. It is a dynamic two-way relationship that is creating jobs, growth and higher standards in both our countries.\\" Consequences Stereotypes of South Asians have been found by scholars to be dehumanizing, making them more prone to mistreatment and crime.Sam Lewis et al. (2005), Race and Probation, , pages 205‚Äì214 As reported in cases of other stereotyped ethnic groups, scholars also confirm the phenomenon of stereotype threat in South Asians, a psychological process that increases anxiety while reducing the potential performance of South Asians and their ability to productively contribute. The constant presence of a social or work environment filled with stereotypes has been found as a significant cause of depression and ill health.

His Anishinaabe name was \\"Chibenashi\\" (from Chi-bineshiinh \\"Big little-bird\\"). Summary Northrup's regular column, the Fond du Lac Follies, was syndicated through several Native American papers, such as The Circle, The Native American Press and News From Indian Country. It won many awards (see below) and was known for a warm humour with a sharply political undertone. Northrup often told stories through the perspective of his immediate family, most of whom, like he did, live a traditional Anishinaabe lifestyle and uses a folksy style to make points about United States-Native American interactions. Fond du Lac Follies was named Best Column at the 1999 Native American Journalists Association convention. In 1990-1992, Jim worked as a roster artist for the COMPAS Writer in the Schools Program. He was a Mentor in the Loft Inroads Program, a Judge for the Lake Superior Contemporary Writers Series and The Jerome Fellowship, and a Member of the Minnesota State Arts Board Prose Panel. Jim also gave radio commentaries on the Superior Radio Network, National Public Radio, Fresh Air Radio, and the BBC-Scotland. His books Walking the Rez Road, Rez Road Follies, and Anishinaabe Syndicated are written in the same style, and have been highly praised for their insights into reservation life. He peppered his column, and the books, with jokes (e.g. Q: Why is the white man in such a hurry to get to Mars? A: He thinks we have land there) and words or phrases from his tribal language, Ojibwemowin, of which he was a student. Born in the Government Hospital on the reservation, Northrup was brought up at Pipestone Indian School, where he was physically abused by teachers and fellow students, Northrup grew up a tough streetfighter with a smart mouth. Service in Vietnam and a surfeit of family tragedy added to a strong, humorous voice that was unafraid to talk about the darker side of life. Jim, with his family, lived the traditional life of the Anishinaabe in northern Minnesota, on the Fond Du Lac reservation. Year around they practice the construction of making winnowing baskets, and harvest wild rice and maple syrup. Nonetheless, his traditional lifestyle did not deter him from participating in events like the Taos Film Festival and the Taos Poetry Circus. Jim died on August 1, 2016, due to complications from kidney cancer. He was 73. Quotes I used to be known as a bullshitter but that didn't pay anything. I began calling myself a storyteller - a little better, more prestige - but it still didn't pay anything. I became a freelance writer. At first it was more free than lance, then I started getting money for my words (Rez Road Follies, p. 2) Awards * Jim was named Writer of the Year in syndicated columns for 2001 by the Wordcraft Circle of Native Writer's and Storytellers for his column The Fond du Lac Follies. * Walking the Rez Road was awarded a Minnesota Book Award and a Northeast Minnesota Book Award. Jim was honored as writer of the Best Feature Story in 1987 by the Native American Press Association for the story \\"Jeremiah, Jesse and Dan\\". In 1987 he also was named winner of the Lake Superior Contemporary Writers Series for \\"Culture Clash\\". * The film Jim Northrup: With Reservations received an award at the Dreamspeakers Native Film Festival '97, and was named Best of Show at Red Earth '97. It was named Best Short Film at the Native American Voices Showcase 2002 at the Fargo Film Festival. It was also shown at the 1997 Native American Film & Video Festival, National Museum of the American Indian, New York City. * The Rez Road Follies was nominated for a Minnesota Book Award, in the Creative Non-fiction category in 1995. * Fond du Lac Follies was named Best Column at the 1999 Native American Journalists Association convention.

He is the only member of the group to appear in every incarnation of the band. He joined a mostly instrumental Cleveland rock and R&B; band called the Starfires while in high school and also remained as a member of its successor band, the Outsiders. Fox took advantage of the opportunity to study drums in school when he was in the fourth grade. Beginning with a pair of sticks and a practice pad, he also had the chance to take instruction from a junior high band director each week. As he recalled in an interview, he began taking music theory classes at the Cleveland Music School Settlement when he was approximately seven or eight years old. \\"They were valuable to me because over and above what I actually learned there. I was already aspiring to be a drummer,\\" Fox says. \\"But my father was dead set against it, preferring that I choose a 'musical' instrument.\\" The elder Fox had good reason to be cautious‚Äîhe had been a professional violinist and vocalist with Paul Whiteman's orchestra, working with the bandleader in Los Angeles and also on the road in the 1920s. With the help of his instructor at the Settlement, he was eventually able to change his father's mind and his dad helped him find further education resources to develop his playing skills. \\"My dad checked out the local teaching scene and found a private drum teacher who was involved in both classical music and popular music, as well as the basics of jazz,\\" he says. \\"This was very beneficial to me because it allowed me to receive a rounded education on not only drums, but all percussion instruments, including mallets (marimba, xylophone, etc.) and tympani.\\" In addition to his work with the James Gang, he has additional session credits with Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Stephen Stills and Chuck Mangione. 2016 brought the release of Sunday Morning Revival, a free-form jam session that was captured on a single Sunday morning in the spring of 1967 and christened decades later as the Schwartz-Fox Blues Crusade. Fox and two other members of the James Gang, guitarist Glenn Schwartz and bassist Tom Kriss, came together with Bill \\"Mr. Stress\\" Miller (vocals/harmonica), Rich Kriss (guitars/vocals) and pianist Mike Sands in a small recording studio overlooking Lake Erie. A deep-rooted love for the blues brought the grouping of Cleveland-based musicians together. They spent time playing through a selection of standards by Sonny Boy Williamson II (‚ÄúNinety Nine,‚Äù ‚ÄúDissatisfied‚Äù), Muddy Waters (‚ÄúLong Distance Call‚Äù), Elmore James (‚ÄúDust My Broom‚Äù), Willie Dixon (‚ÄúEvil‚Äù), among others. As Fox would recollect in an interview at the time the collection was released by Smog Veil Records, their intentions were pure. \\"We were immersed in the blues, and I thought, 'Wow, wouldn‚Äôt it be great to get some of this on tape?'\\" He is an avid collector of automobile license plates, serving as an officer of the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association and authoring the most prominent published work within the hobby, License Plates of the United States (), which was issued initially in 1994. Fox first became interested in license plates in 1954 when he was seven years old and at one time, he had a collection of 30 thousand plates. Fans and friends were always curious about his chosen hobby. \\"Not everyone can appreciate the fineries of a rusting hunk of old steel,\\" he wrote in his book. Although he would stop collecting for a short period of time in the early '60s after he became focused on his musical aspirations and drumming, it wasn't a permanent shift. By the time he was on the road as a touring musician in the late '60s, he quickly rediscovered his love for license plates. Although his book only covers the history of United States license plates, Fox's own interests extend far beyond that and he likes to collect unusual non-passenger plates domestically and \\"all types of plates\\" from other parts of the world. Still based in the Cleveland area, he has a collection of about a thousand plates and remains an active participant in the scene.

Geography Nautical chart of Kasatochi Island ASTER on September 23, 2003. Kasatochi Island is a member of the Aleutian Islands, which lie above a narrow ridge that separates the Bering Sea from the North Pacific.Gary S. Drew, Donald E. Dragoo, Martin Renner and John F. Piatt Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research , Vol. 42, No. 3 (August 2010) , pp. 325-334 It lies at the Atka Pass northwest of the western tip of Atka Island and east of Great Sitkin Island. It is at 52.177¬∞ N latitude and 175.508¬∞ W longitude, with a summit elevation of 314 m (1030 ft.)Smithsonian Institution Kasatochi Island has a land area of 1.9503 sq mi (5.051 km2) and currently does not support any consistent human population. Pre-2008 ecology Auklet flock, Kasatochi Island Geology Kasatochi Island has a unique landscape that makes it an ideal home for many types of species. Some of these aspects that created such a beneficial habitat reflected strictly on the island's geology. Before 2008, the island was about 3 km in diameter and stood about 314 m high on the highest side.William E. Scott, Christopher J. Nye, Christopher F. Waythomas and Christina A. Neal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research , Vol. 42, No. 3 (August 2010) , pp. 250-259 The island is steeper to the northern side than the southern side, and slightly north of the center of the island is a steep-walled caldera surrounding a lake. The crater is about 4,000 feet in diameter, with its lake's surface lying only about 60 m above sea level. In all areas surrounding the crater, the island is characterized by steep sea-cliffs, talus slopes, and small, boulder-filled beaches. These many habitat possibilities set the stage for the numerous species that took residence there.Kasatochi Volcano: Eruption and Recolonization Flora Before the 2008 eruption, the Kasatochi Island landscape was steep and rugged, home to dense vegetation and different species of flora. Except crater walls and sea-cliffs, nearly the entire island was vegetated with grasses and herbaceous plants. This terrestrial vegetation created the habitat for many of the species unique to Kasatochi Island. The coastal and marine habitat flourished with their own species of vegetation as well, including many different types of sea grasses, kelp, corals, sponges, and roots(namely along the rocky coasts).USGS: Kasatochi vulcano Fauna Kasatochi Island was the home of many species, but most notable were the populations of diverse seabirds, avian predators and marine invertebrates. Ocean currents, productivity, and the habitable island geology created the ideal conditions for these select groups of fauna. The island differentiated itself from many of the others in the Aleutian chain by supporting a large diverse group of seabirds, most famously for their colony of more than 100,000 crested auklets and 150,000 least auklets, which was one of only seven colonies in the Aleutian chain. Other species included seabirds such as the Fork-tailed petrel, the whiskered auklet, the ancient murrelet, gulls, guillemots, and cormorants. These seabirds attracted many avian predators as well, such as bald eagles and peregrine falcons. The birds of Kasatochi were the dominant vertebrates on the island and the most prominent link between the terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Many other species were on the island, including various insects, arthropods, and fish. The abundance of fish and various marine life helped support the massive influx of auklets to the island every year. It was also noted for the presence of an endangered Steller sea lion rookery on the north half of the island. Near-shore benches were carved out of lava flows that could have been dated up to hundreds of years earlier. Approximately 1000 Steller sea lions occupied these rookeries before the 2008 eruption. August 2008 eruption Before 2008, little was known about the eruptive history or probability of future eruptions on Kasatochi Island. There were no monitoring devices on the island, but devices on two nearby islands had indicated detectable seismic activity on Kasatochi for several years. Because of the lack of necessary technology, predicting the following eruption would have been an extremely unlikely feat. Thus, it happened quite rapidly and without much warning. On 7 August 2008, Kasatochi began erupting explosively with an ash plume maintaining an altitude of 35,000 feet and reaching 45,000 feet. The eruption lasted for 24 hours and included \\"two initial explosive pulses and pauses over a 6-hr period that produced ash-poor eruption clouds, a 10-hr period of continuous ash-rich emissions initiated by an explosive pulse and punctuated by two others, and a final 8-hr period of waning ash emissions.\\" Pyroclastic flows continuously fell over the island and buried most of it in deposits ranging from decimeters to tens of meters. Before the 2008 eruption, there had been little documented activity on the island. The last confirmed activity on Kasatochi was in 1899, but that was not believed to be an eruption. Mild degassing was reported to the AVO in 2005, but that could not be confirmed. A significant number of people were affected by the 2008 eruption, from the eruption and its secondary consequences. As the eruption became imminent, it forced the only humans on the island, two biologists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to evacuate. Their research was stopped and later replaced with the research currently ongoing on the island.Alaska Volcano Observatory website There were also nearby islands that were affected by the eruption. An ashfall advisory was issued at the time for Adak Island, a populated island in the Aleutian chain. Later, up to 6 cm of ash was found on Adak and other neighboring islands, the rest falling into the surrounding sea. At the time there were about 300 people living on the island, and while there were no immediate deaths or injuries, the long-term effects of this population being so close to the eruption are still unknown. Post-2008 ecology Geology The geological setting of Kasatochi was greatly impacted by the eruption. Where there had been beaches, forests, and soils once, there were now meters of deposits from the volcanic ash and flows. The area of the island as a whole was increased by about 40%. The area of the crater was increased by about 28%, and was enlarged laterally by about 300 m. The crater rim was lowered about 60 m, moving nearer to the lake below. The water level in the lake on Kasatochi significantly decreased following the eruption; however, several streams flowing out of the lower crater walls slowly refilled it. The shoreline surrounding the crater was extended hundreds of meters by pyroclastic deposits, destroying a large amount of the marine habitat that resided near the edge of the island. Flora All apparent life on the island appeared to be destroyed after the 2008 eruption. The pyroclastic flows and volcanic ash buried the entire island in deposits, rendering even the soil on the island almost useless. Almost all terrestrial vegetation, including grasses, trees, and herbaceous plants, was destroyed by the high temperatures before being covered, which would become one of the main problems for recolonization on land. Several auklet rookeries that were located below lava flow cliffs were buried by the deposits, along with many of the Steller sea lion rookeries as well. Boulder-filled kelp beds, an important marine habitat surrounding the island, were buried by the pyroclastic deposits that extended the islands shoreline after the eruption. Fauna Directly following the eruption, it was believed that there were no present surviving species on the island. The organisms were either killed or forced to flee as their habitat was destroyed around them. Nearly all of the marine and avian mammal breeding habitat was covered by volcanic ash, including the rookery on the north side of the island for the endangered Steller sea lions that previously resided there. It was not until weeks to years later that species began returning to the island. Approximately 200,000 auklets returned to the island in the summer of 2009, but as their rookeries were still covered with ash, they could not to be used for nesting. Surprisingly enough, sea lions were present on the island up to two weeks after the eruption. Their rookeries had been thickly buried as well, but coastal erosion had cleared them by the summer of 2009. Because of the intensity of this natural disturbance and the almost complete devastation of life on Kasatochi right after the eruption, the island became a textbook site for primary succession. Scientists took this opportunity and started a research project in 2009 to study ecosystem impact and long-term recovery. Their goal was to find the patterns and reasons for the returning of various species to the island. This was a rare opportunity to study this type of succession, as it is not often that data on an area exists after a disaster of this magnitude. Research Purpose Prior to the 2008 eruption, Kasatochi Island was a part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge(ANMWR). The United States Fish and Wildlife Service(USFWS), United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service had studied marine birds and mammals here since 1996, where they learned much about the pre-eruption ecology of the island. The eruption in 2008 basically destroyed all signs of life on Kasatochi. This situation may have seemed similar to many other eruptions throughout history, including Surtsey in Iceland, Krakatau in Indonesia, Usu in Japan, Ksudach in Russia, and Mount St. Helens in the United States. However, the eruption of Kasatochi specifically gave scientists an extremely rare opportunity to study the primary succession of species back onto the island. This opportunity was due to the fact that rarely does such a devastating natural disaster occur in an environment where there had been extensive research on preexisting species and vegetation. By enhancing their understanding of the process on Kasatochi, they hoped to be able to apply gained knowledge to similar situations in the future. Observations In the summer of 2008, a team of researchers visited the island to observe and record the immediate consequences of the eruption on all present communities. The eruption had a massive effect on all aspects of the ecosystem, including soils, oceanic water, terrain, terrestrial plants, land, shore, and seabirds, arthropods, marine algae, and marine invertebrates.Roger del Moral, Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research , Vol. 42, No. 3 (August 2010) , pp. 335-341 The goal was to recognize patterns of recolonization for each individual species and see how, if at all, they coincided with each other. There were many apparent patterns researchers noticed after studying the recolonization efforts on Kasatochi. Erosion became noticed as a significant driving force of the redevelopment of the island ecosystem by removing deposits from the slopes. While for an extended period of time the island was considered devoid of plants, the greatest amount of plant diversity later on was found where erosion had removed new material and allowed old soil to come to the surface. In these rare places where soil was exposed, it allowed for the new growth of plants and vegetation. This in turn allowed for the reemergence of nesting sites, encouraging the return of different species of seabirds. The island ten years after the eruption Another observation in the field was the surprising existence of \\"legacies\\" (remnants of an ecosystem that escape total destruction) on Kasatochi, whose eruption was thought to have destroyed every sign of life down to its soil. This was previously not thought possible in a volcanic eruption of this magnitude. One specific example was the survival of arthropods, as most found during 2009 were either survivors of the disaster or their progeny. One of the greater contributing factors to recolonization on Kasatochi is the different methods of dispersal. These are the methods that are planned to bring back the largest amount of species; however, the survival of these species depends on the ability of the island to stabilize its present ecosystem. At present, it is found that most immigrants(whether by wind, flight, water, etc.) fail to find suitable habitats, so while they are continually being introduced, the majority will die. These dispersal methods will lead to greater species diversity only when the terrestrial habitat stabilizes in response to abiotic and external forces. These few examples of learned patterns by monitoring how the ecosystem of Kasatochi returns to a new equilibrium and comparing the data to similar islands are helping further scientists' understanding of terrestrial-marine interactions and allowing for new knowledge of ecosystem reassembly after a devastating natural disaster.

Biography  Early life Louis-Philippe Rigaud de Vaudreuil was born into a family with a rich political and military tradition. His grandfather, Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, and his uncle Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil de Cavagnal, were both governors of Canada; the latter was its last governor, surrendering Montreal to the British in 1760. Another uncle, Pierre-Fran√ßois de Rigaud, fought with Montcalm at the Battle of Oswego. His father, also named Louis-Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, was an admiral of the French Navy: he saved Desherbiers de l'Etendu√®re at the Second battle of Cape Finisterre while commanding the 74-gun Intr√©pide and was in charge of the Navy in North America in 1747. His younger brother, Louis de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, was also a Navy officer. They served together in 1747 on the 74-gun Intr√©pide. Although his father was born in Quebec City and there are claims that Louis-Philippe the son was born in Canada, it is more probable that he was born in Rochefort, France, as his father was in charge of that city on the west coast of France at the time. Vaudreuil took part in the Battle of Toulon on 22 February 1744, serving of Heureux, captained by his father. He was promoted to Ensign in January 1746, and served on Tigre in Duc d'Anville expedition. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1754, and given command of the frigate Fid√®le, and later of Ar√©thuse. On 18 May 1759, Ar√©thuse was captured off the Brittany coast by a British squadron serving in the Royal Navy. Vaudreuil was taken prisoner and his ship was recommissioned under the name HMS Arethusa, later known as \\"Saucy Arethusa\\".Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.65 Vaudreuil was promoted to Captain in 1765. In 1769, he captained the 50-gun Hippopotame, ferrying troops to the Caribbeans. Under the command of the marquis de Vaudreuil and the duke de Lauzun, the French captured Senegal in January 1779Dull, French Navy, pp. 125, 159n.https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-29-02-0139 American Revolutionary War Vaudreuil was dispatched to America when the French entered the war on the side of the Americans in February 1778. His first engagement came at the First Battle of Ushant, an island on the north- west part of France near Brest, where the French Navy and the British Navy fought to a draw. He was at sea for about five months. French Navy Defeat the English Navy Vaudreuil was on the Sceptre in the Battle of the Chesapeake. After one furious engagement with the British navy, Admiral de Grasse's fleet and the British fleet drifted for miles south of Yorktown and lost sight of each other. De Grasse eventually disengaged and returned to the Chesapeake, where he met the fleet of the Comte de Barras. This combined fleet outnumbered the British fleet, and gave the French control of the bay when the British opted not to attack. This had the effect of cutting the army of Cornwallis off from resupply and relief, leading to the Siege of Yorktown and his surrender. Vaudreuil's contribution to this effort was to provide the cavalry of Duke of Lauzun, a foreign legion that was a mix of Russian, Slavic, Polish and German mercenaries in the service of France. He also provided eight hundred men from his ship to Gloucester Point in defence of a peninsula near Yorktown. Together with the Duke of Lauzun these men fought the cavalry of Tarleton, and defeated him. In the 1782 Battle of the Saintes, Vaudreuil was credited with saving most of the French Navy's ships in the disastrous defeat. Since De Grasse was taken prisoner Vaudreuil took command of the entire French fleet in America. Afterward, Vaudreuil was on the flagship Triumphant in Boston harbor. He commanded the squadron intended to attack the British-ruled island of Jamaica, and for that purpose welcomed Capt. John Paul Jones as an American naval officer volunteer, when word came that the war had ended by treaty in early 1783. Vaudreuil was then responsible for bringing the victorious French army of Rochambeau back to France. French Revolution Vaudreuil as Lieutenant g√©n√©ral des arm√©es navales, 1789 Vaudreuil, with other Naval officers, forced his way into the Palace of Versailles on the night of October 5‚Äì6 to protect the Royal family. He then emigrated to London in 1791, returning to Paris in 1800. Upon returning, he was granted a Naval pension by Napoleon.

A hard-working player, he usually supported his more creative teammates defensively, excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his stamina and his ability to read the game. Despite his supporting role in midfield, he also possessed good technique and creativity, as well as an eye for goal, which also saw him participate in his teams attacking moves.  Club career  Lodetti is mostly remembered for his time as a defensive midfielder with Italian club Milan, with which he achieved great domestic and international success in the 60s alongside playmaker Gianni Rivera, winning two Serie A titles (the first during his debut season), a Coppa Italia, two European Cups, a Cup Winners' Cup, and an Intercontinental Cup. He later also played for Sampdoria, Foggia, and Novara, before retiring in 1978.  International career  Lodetti also represented the Italian national side at the 1966 World Cup in England, where they were eliminated in the first round. He was also a member of the national squad in Italy's victorious UEFA Euro 1968 campaign on home soil. Although he was set to participate in the 1970 World Cup, in which Italy reached the final, he was dropped last minute due to an injury to Anastasi, which led manager Ferruccio Valcareggi to call up Roberto Boninsegna and Pierino Prati in his place. In total he represented his national team 17 times between 1964 and 1968, scoring two goals. He also represented the under-21 side in their victorious campaign at the 1963 Mediterranean games.

It is a historical narrative of supposed demonic possession, religious fanaticism, sexual repression, and mass hysteria that occurred in 17th-century France surrounding unexplained events that took place in the small town of Loudun. It centers on Roman Catholic priest Urbain Grandier and an entire convent of Ursuline nuns, who allegedly became possessed by demons after Grandier made a pact with Satan. The events led to several public exorcisms as well as executions by burning. The story was adapted into a stage play in 1960, which was then adapted into the controversial 1971 Ken Russell film The Devils, which starred Vanessa Redgrave and Oliver Reed. There is also an opera based on the play, Die Teufel von Loudun, by Krzysztof Penderecki, available on DVD. The book, though lesser known than Huxley's other novels (such as Brave New World), is widely considered one of his best works. Historical details Urbain Grandier was a priest burned at the stake at Loudun, France on 18 August 1634. He was accused of seducing an entire convent of Ursuline nuns and of being in league with the devil. Grandier was probably sexually promiscuous and too insolent to his peers. He had antagonised the Mother Superior, Sister Jeanne of the Angels, when he rejected her offer to become the spiritual advisor to the convent. He faced an ecclesiastical tribunal and was acquitted. It was only after he had publicly spoken against Cardinal Richelieu that a new trial was ordered by the Cardinal. He was tortured, found guilty and executed by being burnt alive but never admitted guilt. Huxley touches on aspects of the multiple personality controversy in cases of apparent demonic possession within this book. Adaptations Playwright John Whiting adapted Huxley's book as the play The Devils (1960). Ken Russell directed a feature film adaptation, The Devils (1971), starring Vanessa Redgrave and Oliver Reed. Krzysztof Penderecki wrote an opera, The Devils of Loudun (Die Teufel von Loudun), in 1969.

The heckelphone-clarinet (or Heckelphon-Klarinette) is a rare woodwind instrument, invented in 1907 by Wilhelm Heckel in Wiesbaden-Biebrich, Germany. Despite its name, it is essentially a wooden saxophone with wide conical bore, built of red-stained maple wood, overblowing the octave, and with clarinet-like fingerings. It has a single-reed mouthpiece attached to a short metal neck, similar to an alto clarinet. The heckelphone-clarinet is a transposing instrument in B with sounding range of D3 (middle line of bass staff) to C6 (two ledger lines above the treble staff), written a whole tone higher. The instrument is not to be confused with the heckel-clarina, also a very rare conical bore single reed woodwind by Heckel but higher in pitch and made of metal, nor with the heckelphone, a double reed instrument lower in pitch. Timbre The instrument sounds somewhat like a saxophone, but with a much softer tone. In his 1931 catalogue, Heckel asserts that \\"the clarinet-like tone of the instrument is excellent, extraordinarily harmonious, and powerful; nor is it sharp or metallic like that of the alto saxophone\\". It was apparently intended for military use, but never became popular, and only between twelve and fifteen were manufactured.

The park covers 96 square kilometres and comprises the Santa Clara, Alejandro Selkirk and the most part of the Robinson Crusoe Island islands.Unesco page - Juan Fernandez (EN) UNESCO 2014, retrieved in December 14, 2014 Climate The islands have a subtropical, temperate Mediterranean climate, but this varies depending on the island\\"Parque Nacional Archipi√©lago de Juan Fern√°ndez\\".

Temperatures range from to , with an annual mean of . Higher elevations are generally cooler, with occasional frosts on Robinson Crusoe. Average annual precipitation is , varying from to year to year. Much of the variability in rainfall depends on the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation. There is generally a 4 - 5 month dry season during the warmer summer months. Rainfall is higher in the winter months, and varies with elevation and exposure; elevations above experience frequent rainfall, while the western, leeward sides of Robinson Crusoe and Santa Clara are quite dry. Ecosystem of the park The Juan Fern√°ndez islands are home to rare and endemic plants and animals, some of which are at risk of extinction (like the Juan Fern√°ndez Hummingbird).Picaflor de Juan Fern√°ndez / Juan Fern√°ndez Firecrown avesdechile.cl 2014, retrieved on December 14, 2014 The islands are recognized as a distinct ecoregion, and the whole archipelago, including Robinson Crusoe, Alexander Selkirk and Santa Clara islands and all the islets in the area of the national park, were designated a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1977. The volcanic origin and remote location of the islands isolate them from the flora and fauna species of continental South America. As a result, the island is home to relatively few plant and animal species. The closest relatives of the archipelago's plants and animals are found in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forest ecoregions of Southern Chile, including the Valdivian temperate rain forests, Magellanic subpolar forests, and Desventuradas Islands.Biodiversidad en Juan Fern√°ndez(es) Documento N¬∫ 21, Dr. Elie Poulin, Laboratorio de Ecolog√≠a Molecular, Departamento de Ciencias Ecol√≥gicas, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Chile. Flora There are 209 native species of vascular plants in the park, approximately 150 of which are flowering plants and 50 are ferns. There are 126 species (62 percent) that are endemic, with 12 endemic genera and one endemic family, Lactoridaceae. Many plants are characteristic of the Antarctic flora, and are related to plants found in southern South America, New Zealand and Australia. Vegetation zones generally correspond to elevation, with grasslands and shrublands at lower elevations, tall and montane forests at middle elevations, and shrublands at the highest elevations. The two main islands have somewhat distinct plant communities. Juan Fern√°ndez Goat, (originally domestic goats) showing many of the characteristic of wild goats Alejandro Selkirk Island is mostly covered with grassland from 0 to , interspersed with wooded ravines (quebradas), home to dry forests of Myrceugenia and Zanthoxylum fagara. From to are lower montane forests, with upper montane forest from to . The treeline is at approximately , above which is alpine shrubland and grassland, dominated by temperate Magellanic vegetation such as Acaena, Dicksonia, Drimys, Empetrum, Gunnera, Myrteola, Pernettya, and Ugni. On Robinson Crusoe, grasslands predominate from 0 to ; introduced shrubs from to ; tall forests from to ; montane forests from to , with dense tree cover of Cuminia fernandezia, Fagara, and Rhaphithamnus venustus; tree fern forests from to , and brushwood forests above . Santa Clara is covered with grassland. One of the main predators of endemic vegetable species, and responsible for the great extensions of grassland, is the Juan Fern√°ndez Goat. These were originally domestic goats left behind by the first explorers which became feral, recovering some of the characteristics of wild goats (Capra aegagrus). CONAF carries out ongoing work to control this and other invasive species, including mice, rats, true thrushes, sparrow and feral cats.PLAGAS DEVORAN JUAN FERN√ÅNDEZ La Nacion.cl June 04, 2004- Comunicaciones LANET S.A. 2014, retrieved on December 14, 2014 Three endemic species dominate the montane forests of the archipelago: Drimys confertifolia on both main islands; Myrceugenia fernandeziana on Robinson Crusoe; and M. schulzei on Alexander Selkirk. Endemic tree fern species of southern hemisphere genus Dicksonia (D. berteriana on Robinson Crusoe and D. externa on Alexander Selkirk) and the endemic genus Thyrsopteris (T. elegans) are the predominant species in the tree-fern forests. An endemic species of sandalwood, Santalum fernandezianum, was overexploited for its fragrant wood, has not been seen since 1908, and is believed extinct. The Chonta palm (Juania australis) is endangered.Endemic Flora (ES) proyectogefeei.cl Proyecto GEF 83266: Fortalecimiento de los Marcos Nacionales para la Gobernabilidad de las Especies Ex√≥ticas Invasoras.

Seventeen land and sea-bird species breed on the islands. The island has three endemic bird species, and two endemic subspecies. Introduced fauna by humans include rats and goats. Robinson Crusoe Island is home to an endemic and endangered hummingbird, the Juan Fern√°ndez firecrown (Sephanoides fernandensis). This large hummingbird, about long, is thought to number only about 500 individuals. The other endemic bird species are the Juan Fern√°ndez tit-tyrant (Anairetes fernandezianus) of Robinson Crusoe Island, and the Masafuera rayadito (Aphrastura masafuerae) of Alejandro Selkirk Island. The islands support the entire known breeding populations of two petrel species, Stejneger's Petrel Pterodroma longirostris (IUCN status VU) and the Juan Fernandez Petrel Pterodroma externa (IUCN status VU). In addition, the Juan Fernandez Islands may still support a third breeding petrel species, De Filippi's Petrel Pterodroma defilippiana (IUCN status VU), whose only other known breeding grounds are on the Desventuradas Islands. The Magellanic penguin breeds on Robinson Crusoe Island within the archipelago.Hogan, C. Michael (2008) \\"Magellanic Penguin\\". Global Twitcher. Retrieved 5 March 2010. The endemic Juan Fernandez spiny lobster (without claws) lives in the marine waters (Jasus frontalis). The Juan Fern√°ndez fur seal (Arctocephalus philippii) also lives on the islands. This species was nearly exterminated in the sixteenth to nineteenth century, but it was rediscovered in 1965. A census in 1970 found about 750 fur seals living there. Today, the total population reaches the ten thousands. Only two were sighted on the Desventuradas Islands, located some to the north. The actual population of the Desventuradas may be higher, because the species tends to hide in sea caves. There seems to be a yearly population increase of 16‚Äì17 percent.

By air: the local airlines LASSA and ATA fly weekly (2.5 hrs. from Santiago). By sea: a Chilean Navy ship goes to the islands in December and February, and only occasionally the rest of the year.

In 1901 Vancouver requested $50,000 from industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for the purpose of building a library. Carnegie agreed, provided the City of Vancouver supplied the site and contributed $5000 a year. The original public library was completed in 1903. For decades, the top floor was the home of the Vancouver Museum. The Vancouver Public Library moved into a more spacious building at 750 Burrard Street in 1957 and the Carnegie building eventually fell into disrepair. Neighbourhood poverty activists from the Downtown Eastside Residents' Association convinced city council to turn it into a public space for local residents, and it opened as the Carnegie Community Centre in the 1980s. It now houses recreation facilities, a low-cost cafeteria, a branch of the Vancouver Public Library, and a variety of services and programs for the neighbourhood, which is one of the poorest in Canada. The Carnegie Centre is a drug- and alcohol-free place. The Carnegie Community Centre is owned by the City of Vancouver and funded by the Social Planning Department. It is open 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., every day of the year. The centre is run by Vancouver City Staff in cooperation with the board of directors of the Carnegie Community Centre Association, a non-profit society. Directors are elected annually from the members of the association. Membership costs one dollar per year and is available to neighbourhood residents. All the centre's programs are free to members. Carnegie Community Centre has a gymnasium, a weight room, a theatre (aptly named Carnegie Hall), a cafeteria with very reasonably priced meals, a seniors lounge and a pool room. There is also an Adult Learning Centre on the top floor, which provides informal one-on-one tutoring. There is a computer lab containing multiple computers for educational use located inside the centre as well. The Carnegie Centre publishes a bi-monthly newsletter with articles concerning the Downtown Eastside Community. The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at Carnegie Community Centre. stained glass at Carnegie Community Centre. http://stainedglasscanada.ca/site.php?site=261 The Carnegie Centre supports and provides a home for a number of projects, including the political group known as CCAP (Carnegie Community Action Project), which has recently been associated with the anti-gentrification protests in the DTES.

There are four main districts of the city: Chacmultun, Cabalpak, Xetpol and the Central district. These groups of buildings were built on hills or artificial terraces to make them seem more imposing. It is thought that the city had trade links with many other contemporary Maya sites in the area, like Edzna, Oxkintok, Uxmal and Kabah. Some buildings contain preserved Maya murals, which are quite rare. The city reached its peak during the Late Classic period, during the 10th century. The buildings at Chacmultun are designed in the Puuc architectural style, with elaborate friezes decorating the buildings. The site was continuously occupied until the 15th century.

He is professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto, where he was formerly the director of the Centre for Ethics.

McCarthy and J√ºrgen Habermas.Biography - Trudeau Fondation, www.trudeaufoundation.ca He has published both academic and popular writings, including the bestselling The Rebel Sell. His philosophical work includes papers and books in political philosophy, business ethics, rational choice theory, action theory, and critical theory. Heath is the recipient of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation Fellowship (2012).Media release - Trudeau Foundation In 2013, Heath was named to the Royal Society of Canada.RSC 2013 New Fellows His popular book Enlightenment 2.0 won the 2014 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing.\\"Writers' Trust of Canada\\". March 16, 2015. Ideas The central claim of The Rebel Sell is that counter-cultural movements have failed, and that they all share a common fatal error in the way they understand society; hence, counter-culture is not a threat to \\"the system\\". For example, it is suggested of Adbusters' Blackspot campaign that the shoe's existence proves that \\"no rational person could possibly believe that there is any tension between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' culture.\\" In the book Filthy Lucre, Joseph Heath criticizes the idea that tax-paying is inherently different from consumption, and argues that the idea of a tax freedom day is flawed: > It would make just as much sense to declare an annual \\"mortgage freedom > day\\", in order to let mortgage owners know what day they \\"stop working for > the bank and start working for themselves\\". ...But who cares? Homeowners are > not really \\"working for the bank\\"; they're merely financing their own > consumption. After all, they're the ones living in the house, not the bank > manager. \\"Market failures\\" or \\"Paretian\\" approach to business ethics In business ethics, Heath advances a new theory, what he calls a \\"market failures\\" or \\"Paretian\\" approach, which states that \\"the market is essentially a staged competition, designed to promote Pareto efficiency, and in cases where the explicit rules governing the competition are insufficient to secure the class of favoured outcomes, economic actors should respect the spirit of these rules and refrain from pursuing strategies that run contrary to the point of the competition\\". The approach is neither akin to the shareholder theory, the stakeholder theory or to a personal ethics framework. Heath's market failures approach follows from his work in political economy. According to Heath, the market is not a system of natural justice. Rather, it is an imperfect but efficient institutional arrangement designed to maximize social welfare by way of an unresolved collective action problem.Heath, 2014, p. 98 In other words, markets are \\"special-purpose institutions designed to promote efficiency\\", that need to be \\"embedded within the broader context of a welfare state, which engages in both market-complementing and redistributive policies to claim to be just.\\"Heath, 2014, p. 10 Since these structured competitions are implemented \\"for the narrow reason\\" that, in a reasonably competitive market, they generate social benefits through positive externalities, \\"adversarial ethics\\" are acceptable in the circumscribed and limited role of markets. Indeed, economic actors engaged in market transaction \\"must be given a fairly broad exemption from the norms of equality or fairness\\". However, they must be held accountable to the fundamental principles required to have a competitive and efficiency promoting market. Therefore, \\"the central role of business ethics is [‚Ä¶] not to bring in 'outside' moral considerations to condemn the latest outrage, but to clarify and to correct the self-understanding of participants in the market economy [‚Ä¶]. In order to do so, it has no need to appeal to normative standards beyond those that are already implicit in the institutions of a market economy.\\" Heath, 2014, p. 19 Hence, \\"the overall set of profit-maximizing strategies is partitioned into three categories, separating out the immoral and the illegal strategies from the normatively acceptable ones. The efficiency standard can be used to make both cuts. The 'acceptable/unacceptable' distinction is imposed by the efficiency properties of the market system as a whole. The set of unacceptable strategies can then be subdivided into 'immoral/illegal' using a transaction cost or regulatory cost analysis.\\" Heath, 2014, p. 35 In other words, the \\"basic thrust of 'business ethics' is [‚Ä¶] to discourage firms from taking advantage of market imperfections, even in cases where legal regulation is not feasible.\\" Heath, 2014, p. 6 Thus, \\"the firm should behave as though market conditions were perfectly competitive, even though they may not in fact be. The following list of imperatives provides some examples of the restrictions that this would imply : # Minimize negative externalities # Compete only through price and quality # Reduce information asymmetries between firm and customers # Do not exploit diffusion of ownership # Avoid erecting barriers to entry # Do not use cross-subsidization to eliminate competitors # Do not oppose regulation aimed at correcting market imperfections # Do not seek tariffs or other protectionist measures # Treat price levels as exogenously determined # Do not engage in opportunistic behaviour toward customers or others firms\\" Heath, 2014, p. 37 \\"Public-economic\\" normative model of the welfare state Heath advocates the \\"public-economic\\" normative model of the welfare state, that is to say a normative standard of the appropriate division of labor between the public and the private sector, as superior to the \\"redistributive\\" or \\"Communitarianism\\" models. According to Heath, the \\"public-economic\\" normative model \\"provides both the best theoretical reconstruction of the existing configuration of welfare state services, as well as the most useful set of principles to guide any proposed expansion or modification of these services\\". Heath (2011). Three Normative Models of the Welfare State, Public Reason 3 (2): 13-43 Heath describes the three models as such : \\"The three normative purposes most commonly cited as providing a justification for the scope of welfare state activity are equality, community, or efficiency. These give rise to a corresponding set of models, which I refer to as the redistributive, the communitarian, and the public-economic models of the welfare state. The first sees the central function of the welfare state to be the redistribution of resources, with the goal of making the outcomes produced by the market economy less unequal. The second considers the central problem, central function of the welfare state to be that of imposing limits on the scope of the market, in order to resist the commodification of certain domains of interaction. The last model regards the welfare state as playing a role essentially complementary to that of the market. According to this view, the welfare state corrects market failure, either through regulation, subsidization and taxation, or the direct provision of goods and services.\\" Heath (2011). Three Normative Models of the Welfare State, Public Reason 3 (2): 13-43 Heath further explains the \\"public-economic\\" model this way : \\"The ‚Äúclassical liberal‚Äù state creates the market economy through the institution of property rights and civil contract. The ‚Äúwelfare state‚Äù then emerges in those areas where liberal markets fail to produce optimal outcomes. This can take the form of regulatory agencies (in cases where the rules of marketplace competition need to be adjusted), state-owned enterprises (typically in sectors where efficient competition cannot be organized), and public services (in cases where a system of effective property rights cannot be instituted, or where the transaction costs associated with a system of voluntary exchange would be prohibitive). According to this view, the welfare state essentially does the same thing as the market ‚Äì both are in the business of enabling mutually beneficial forms of cooperation to emerge ‚Äì it merely organizes the transactions under somewhat different terms. [...] The economic model of the welfare state should therefore be interpreted as the view that the state should strive to resolve collective action problems in cases where it can do so more efficiently than other institutional forms.\\" Heath (2011). Three Normative Models of the Welfare State, Public Reason 3 (2): 13-43 Heath advances that this model has \\"considerable explanatory power\\" for these state activities : 1) control of natural monopolies, 2) control of imperfections in existing markets, 3) public provision, 4) the social safety net, 5) minority public goods and 6) governance failures. Heath notes that \\"there is nothing incoherent about a hybrid ‚Äúredistribution and public goods‚Äù view of the welfare state. However, the amount of actual egalitarian redistribution that goes on in a typical welfare state is often dramatically overestimated. This is because many theorists treat the social safety net, which is essentially a set of government-run insurance programs, as a system of redistribution, and hence as governed by an egalitarian logic.\\" Heath (2011).

It first aired on October 12, 2003. Background Perry Caravello is an aspiring celebrity and struggling comedian and actor who was \\"discovered\\" in 1992 by comedian Don Barris, the warmup comic for Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Man Show, during an open mic night audition at The Comedy Store in Westwood, Los Angeles, California. Barris offered Caravello a chance at stardom and, along with Tony Barbieri playing a perpetually stoned \\"Walter 'Mole' Molinski,\\" befriended Caravello and have played pranks on him since 1995. Caravello's ongoing commitment to achieving this stardom, with the assistance and participation of Barris and Barbieri, is known as The Perry Project, which is noted with a title card at the beginning of the film. When performing as a trio, Caravello, Barris, and Mole are collectively known as \\"The Big 3.\\" In a scene in \\"Windy City Heat\\", Caravello cites an unnamed source referring to the group as \\"the Three Stooges of the new millennium\\". In the 1990s, the Big 3 prominently appeared on Simply Don the Public Access Program, a popular public-access television show in the Los Angeles area created and hosted by Barris. Kimmel later joined the show as an announcer. Plot Perry Caravello believes he has been given a chance to star in a movie called Windy City Heat, a crime film about a \\"sports private eye\\" named Stone Fury. However, there is no such film, as the entire project is an elaborate prank played on him by Don Barris and Mole with the help of producers Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla and real celebrity cameos including Carson Daly, Dane Cook, Tammy Faye Bakker, and William \\"The Refrigerator\\" Perry. Caravello's participation in the \\"film\\" begins with the audition process, where he is introduced to Daly, who is also up for the lead role of Stone Fury (and is dressed exactly like Caravello). After a botched audition, interrupted numerous times by Barris and Mole, he eventually wins the role over Daly (later in the movie, he is shown a wall of stars that have also been considered but crossed off, including Harrison Ford, Brad Pitt, and Robert De Niro). The plot of the movie revolves around a dubious story involving Fury trying to track down the actual refrigerator of William \\"Refrigerator\\" Perry and the pants of Ernie Banks (Perry appears as himself, while actor Paul Motley portrays Banks). Caravello appears in most scenes with Barris and Mole, who portray Chicago Outfit gangsters \\"Big Lou\\" and \\"Brock,\\" the antagonists of the film. Windy City Heat is directed by Bobcat Goldthwait, who is the actual director in addition to playing the director of the fake film-within-the-film, wearing jodhpurs and only speaking to people through a bullhorn. Caravello is followed around by at least fifteen cameras (some of which are hidden) during the filming process. He is told from the beginning that he is being recorded and interviewed for the film's DVD extras. Some of the pranks include repeatedly dumping him into a dumpster filled with manure; making him drink a milkshake made of coffee, Chinese food, raw egg, pizza, and beer during while filming multiple takes of a scene, giving him a case of severe diarrhea; and bringing in a stunt double to film Caravello's sex scene with his leading lady, which Caravello is told involves actual sexual penetration on set. Along the way, Barris and Mole continue to egg him on, performing a balancing act of pushing his buttons and stroking his ego. The stress increasingly infuriates Caravello and frequently leads him to scream in a high-pitched shriek. Barris regularly tells Caravello to \\"Unleash the Fury!\\" Throughout the filmmaking process, Caravello is introduced to several individuals involved with the production, purported to be real people, whose names are identical to historical and cinematic figures. Such individuals include the eccentric English producer of the movie, \\"John Quincy Adams\\" (whom Caravello never meets in person and who only calls when Mole leaves the room), casting director \\"Roman Polanski\\" (Cook), studio receptionist and soon to be co-star \\"Susan B. Anthony\\" (Lisa Arch, credited as Lisa Kushell), Japanese \\"money man\\" \\"Hiroshima Nagasaki\\" (Toshi Toda), who backs out of financing the production when Mole knocks over a table of junk food, limo driver and aspiring rock musician \\"Travis Bickle\\" (Dave Sheridan), set photographer \\"Ansel Adams\\" (Toby Huss), production assistant \\"Frances Farmer\\" (Laura Silverman), Caravello's personal assistant \\"Burt Ward\\" (Eric Marseglia), and merchandising agents \\"Sacco and Vanzetti\\" (Scott Hartman and Wayne Wilderson). Notable exceptions to this naming convention include attorney \\"Sol Sternbergowitz-Greenbaum\\" (Sal Iacono) and Santiago (Tom Kenny), a wardrobe assistant who mistakes Caravello for Luke Perry, provoking a homophobic outburst that Caravello attributes to a homosexual encounter with a casting agent in 1992. Caravello never questions these coincidences on film aside from expressing doubts as to the identity of a man purporting to be Charlton Heston (Bob Legionaire), who refuses to leave Caravello's assigned trailer. To placate him, he suavely offers the old man a cameo in the film, which he enthusiastically accepts with humorous results. The film culminates in an intentionally hindered race to the fake film's \\"one time only screening,\\" during which the Big 3 are delayed by a number of setbacks, finally making it in time to see only a select few scenes of the film. They finally arrive at the theater and discover that Caravello's name is misspelled on the marquee. A running gag in the movie is that whenever Caravello's name appears in print, it is usually misspelled. The film itself (what is actually shown of it) features laughably unrealistic special effects, lines of dialogue ripped from Casablanca, Chinatown and Gone with the Wind, ludicrously named characters such as \\"Jiggly Wrigley\\" and even a dinosaur, which is inserted into the film at the insistence of Yurgi (Tom Stern), a Romanian pornographic film producer who takes over as the film's new financier. Immediately following the screening, Caravello is met with an enthusiastic round of applause from the audience and is presented with an oversized and extravagant trophy from the \\"President of Show Business\\" (Geoff Pierson). The film ends with a montage backed by Louis Prima's version of When You're Smiling. Aftermath Unlike typical prank shows, it is not revealed to Caravello at the end of the film that the entire thing was a prank; this is due to the fact that the movie is only one component of The Perry Project, which continues to this day. However, included on the DVD for the film is a video recording of Caravello watching the actual film for the first time in his home, alongside Barris and Barbieri (still in character as Mole, who in turn tells Caravello he has adopted the stage name \\"Tony Barbieri\\"). He does not seem to react as if anything is unexpected, and does not even acknowledge the fact that the finished product he is watching is not the film he thought he was going to be in. On Caravello's star commentary track for the DVD, recorded two years after the initial release of the film, he acknowledges that he has since realized that sequences in the film were set up as pranks on him (he says he read about it online), and that he knows Barris and Barbieri were intentionally conniving to infuriate him, yet he continues to speak of the \\"film\\" and his acting abilities with the same gusto. Notably, Caravello claims that he was playing along during his audition, when Dane Cook introduces himself by the name \\"Roman Polanski,\\" stating that he had \\"fucked with everybody\\" because he did a report on Roman Polanski in elementary school. Despite acknowledging that \\"Polanski\\" wasn't really a casting director, he continues to believe that it was a real audition and he legitimately beat out the other actors (including Ford, Pitt, De Niro and Daly) to win the Stone Fury role. He also gets emotional watching the scene at the film's premiere when he receives the trophy from the \\"President of Show Business,\\" and says that he cries every time he watches it. When the DVD of the film was released in 2006, the cover is listed as starring \\"Perry Karavello\\", continuing the running gag of misspelling Caravello's name. On June 1, 2007, Caravello filed a lawsuit against Jackass star Johnny Knoxville, alleging that Knoxville, along with Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla, promised him ten million dollars to put his genitals in a mousetrap to show that Perry F. Caravello could prove his \\"Stone Fury\\" worthiness live on The Adam Carolla Morning Show on 97.1 FM KLSX as a stunt, and to promote the recently released DVD, and also for payment for his performance in the movie.BBC News Caravello dropped this lawsuit on June 10, 2008. In a 2013 appearance on WTF with Marc Maron, Barris revealed that an unnamed attorney representing Caravello received a portion of a relatively small financial settlement, but did not divulge further details.  Sequel  On 11 October 2013 the Big 3 announced plans for a sequel that would be crowd funded. The crowd funding attempt to raise $500k ran for 50 days and raised $16,220, or 3.2% of the target amount. Barris subsequently announced that enough funds were raised to film a reality show television pilot that is being actively marketed around Hollywood. Fans were encouraged to join the production as extras during the \\"Wedding Weekend,\\" which was filmed for the pilot. The Big 3 Podcast In October 2010, Windy City Heat was spun off into a weekly comedy podcast called The Big 3 Podcast. It features the Big 3 in what they describe as a discussion on \\"pop culture and our own personal lives\\". Many of the themes and running gags from Windy City Heat return, such as the constant misspelling and mispronunciation of Caravello's name and the inadvertent provocation of Caravello's self-admitted homophobia, which often results in repeated references to Caravello's enthusiastic homosexual encounter with a casting agent in 1992. Supporting characters from Windy City Heat, including \\"John Quincy Adams\\", \\"Yurgi\\", \\"Sol Steinbergowitz-Greenbaum\\" and \\"Burt Ward,\\" have made a return for the podcast, and the show has featured guest appearances by celebrity fans such as Jimmy Kimmel, Andy Dick, Dominic Monaghan, Jeff Richards, former Penthouse Pet of the Month Linda Johnson and prominent Los Angeles businessman Neil \\"The Mattress King\\" Leeds. The show was initially published by ACE Broadcasting Network, but since September 2011 it has been independently published by Don Barris' \\"Simply Don the Podcast Network\\". The Big 3 Live Debuting at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2013, The Big 3 Live is a monthly live video podcast produced and distributed by Video Podcast Network (VPN), part of the YouTube Original Channel Initiative. It uses many of the elements of The Big 3 Podcast, but also includes video clips of past Big 3 moments, such as segments from Simply Don the Public Access Program and appearances at The Comedy Store. VPN also made it part of their \\"ANiMASHUPS\\" series, where they take audio clips from VPN shows and animate them into short cartoons.

He was born in Montreal, Lower Canada in 1810, studied at the Petit S√©minaire de Montr√©al, articled in law and was admitted to the bar in 1832. In 1833, he married Marie-Ang√©lique, daughter of Augustin Cuvillier, and was named clerk of the peace and clerk of the crown at Montreal. Delisle was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Montreal County in 1841. He resigned in 1843 to accept the post of clerk of the crown. He speculated in land and also served as a director and later the president for the Montreal City and District Savings Bank. He helped promote the Montreal and Bytown Railway and also served as its president. Delisle also served as director and later president for the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railway; he was also a director of the Gulf of St. Lawrence Steamship Company. In 1859, he was named harbour commissioner. He was named sheriff in 1862. In 1863, he was accused of fraud during his term as clerk of the crown. When these claims were supported by the testimony of a number of witnesses, all Liberals, he was relieved of his posts. When the Conservatives regained power in 1866, he was reinstated to the harbour commission and also given the post of customs collector at Montreal and held these offices until the Liberals returned to power in 1874.

He was Professor emeritus of Economics at Stellenbosch University, where he built a reputation as a lecturer in History of economic thought, Economic history, the Economy of South Africa, and economic systems. Education Terreblanche matriculated from Edenville High School in the Orange Free State and went on to study at Stellenbosch University, where he obtained a BA degree with economics as one of his major subjects, and later he obtained his Master's Degree and a Doctorate in Philosophy. Later he went on to spend three months at Harvard University in 1968/1969. He was appointed to the Chair of Economics, teaching economics history, at Stellenbosch University. Academic career Terreblanche lectured at the University of the Orange Free State for eight years. He returned to lecture at Stellenbosch University from 1968 until his retirement in 1995. In the 1980s, whilst still a prominent member of the National Party, a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond and a \\"Hoofwag\\" of the Ruiterwag, Terreblanche in 1985 established the \\"Discussion group '85\\" at Stellenbosch. He was appointed as a member of the Board of Control of the SABC, and became its deputy chairman, until he was not reappointed as board member in 1987. As a result of this, he quit the National Party, also due to growing doubts and disagreements with its policies of Apartheid and became one of the government's strongest Afrikaans critics. He was a founding member of the Democratic Party (forerunner to the Democratic Alliance) and of the Vrye Weekblad of Max du Preez, but is no longer involved in politics. In 2008 he co-wrote an article to the South African media with Drucilla Cornell and Mahmood Mamdani calling for the establishment of a Justice and Reconciliation Commission to \\"educate whites, who were the beneficiaries of this exploitative system [Apartheid], as well as to develop a programme of reparations, restitution and perhaps most important, the establishment of economic measures that could effectively grapple with the devastating institutional effects of an internal system of colonisation.\\" Publications * Die industriele groeiproses, 1770‚Äì1940 (1967) * Die doelwit van 'n hoe ekonomiese groeikoers (1973) * Chroniese gemeenskapsarmoede (1977) * Vernuwing en herskikking (1973) * Die wording van die Westerse ekonomie (1980) * Politieke ekonomie en sosiale welvaart, met 'n toepassing op Suid- Afrika (1986) * Geskiedenis van die Westerse ekonomie (1988) * 'n Geskiedenis van opeenvolgende ekonomiese stelsels (1994) * A history of inequality in South Africa, 1652‚Äì2002, University of KwaZulu-Natal Press (2003) * Lost in Transformation ‚Äì South Africa's Search for a New Future since 1986, KMM Review Publishing, (2012) * Verdeelde land, Tafelberg Publishers (2014)http://www.tafelberg.com/Books/16498 * Western Empires, Penguin Random House (2015) References External links * The life and work of Prof Sampie Terreblanche * About Sampie Terreblanche * Faculty page Category:1933 births Category:2018 deaths Category:People from Kroonstad Category:Afrikaner people Category:South African non-fiction writers Category:South African academics Category:South African economists Category:Economic historians Category:Historians of economic thought Category:Stellenbosch University alumni Category:Stellenbosch University faculty ","title":"Sampie Terreblanche"},{"id":"7197518","text":":For the American astrologer, see Jeane Dixon.

Development The Dragon began life in 1986, when the US Marines Corps contracted with the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), an offshoot of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, that works on government technology development contracts, to build a small piston-powered UAV as an \\"expendable jammer\\" for battlefield electronics warfare. The program was logically named \\"ExJam\\". BAI Aerosystems was a subcontractor to APL and provided airframe parts. \\"Creeping featurism\\" infected the program as the Marines considered more applications for the little drone, and in 1987 the program was given the new name of BQM-147A \\"Expendable Drone\\" or \\"Exdrone\\". The communications- jammer configuration of the vehicle was tested in the University of Maryland Glenn L. Martin wind tunnel, and successfully completed developmental flight testing at Naval Air Station Patuxent River and a combined Developmental Test/Operational Test at White Sands Missile Range. However, APL wasn't able to meet the schedule requested by the Marines for fielding the Exdrone, and so the program was passed on to BAI Aerosystems, with the Navy assisting by developing a video imaging system for tactical reconnaissance. The NASA Langley Flight Research Center also assisted in the development effort, performing wind-tunnel tests and making recommendations for aerodynamic improvements, and after these changes the BQM-147A Exdrone went into service with the Marines in time to help them chase the Iraqis out of Kuwait City. A few years later, the UAV-JPO also bought several hundred Exdrones for demonstrations and training to help get tactical officers in tune with battlefield UAV capabilities. The current \\"Dragon Drone\\" is an improved version of the Exdrone, obtained through a 1996 contract with the Marines. BAI renamed the UAV since the Exdrone wasn't really all that expendable, given that it carried a reasonably sophisticated sensor system and flight avionics. The Dragon Drone is a flying wing with a single tailfin that is symmetrically designed to allow it to fly with either side up. The Dragon Drone is powered by a small piston engine. It can carry one of three different plug-in turrets, featuring daylight color TV with a laser rangefinder, daylight color TV, or infrared imager. It can also be fitted with an auxiliary fuel tank for increased range. Condor The United States Coast Guard is now procuring a \\"navalized\\" version of the Dragon Drone under the name \\"Condor\\", and intends to use it with Coast Guard cutters and similar small ocean-patrol vessels. The Condor will be useful for missions such as search and rescue or hunting drug traffickers. Launching and recovering a UAV off such small vessels is troublesome. Naval UAVs have traditionally been launched with a catapult or RATO boosters, and recovered using a net. Not only is this approach unsuited to smaller vessels, it is also not particularly reliable even on large vessels, with catapult launches causing drone damage, catapult failures leading to loss of the drone, and recoveries similarly leading to damage through collisions and unintended ditching. A Saint Louis, Missouri, company named Advanced Aerospace Technologies Incorporated (AATI) has come up with an alternative scheme for launching and recovering a Dragon Drone or other small UAV from small vessels. The scheme involves the use of a parasail and is referred to the \\"runway in the sky (RITS)\\". In AATI demonstrations, a Dragon Drone is attached to a piggyback frame that harnesses the drone to the parasail. The parasail is reeled out into the wind until it reaches an altitude of about . The drone is then released, diving until it builds up enough speed for the operator to pull it out of the dive and sent it on its mission. In recovery, the parasail is used to lift a tow line into the sky, with the tow line trailing a series of recovery lines hanging between the parasail and the ship. The drone is flown into the recovery lines, and a snaplock mechanism on the drone's wing grabs onto a line. The drone is then reeled back down to the ship. The tow line has more \\"give\\" to it than a recovery net, reducing the likelihood of damage. The current RITS scheme can handle UAVs weighing up to , but AATI thinks it can be scaled up to handle larger aircraft. AATI claims the system is inexpensive and easy to use. They also point out that the parasail could also be used to loft an antenna to allow over-the-horizon communications with a UAV. Whether the Coast Guard intends to use this scheme or not is uncertain, but it certainly is an interesting concept.

Ukraine has around 23,000 rivers. Most of the rivers of Ukraine drain into the Black Sea and Azov Sea belonging to the bigger Mediterranean basin. Those rivers mostly flow in southern direction, except for some Pripyat tributaries in Volhynia and Dniester tributaries in Prykarpattia. A small portion of rivers is part of Western Bug drainage basin located in Western Ukraine near the border with Poland. Those rivers usually have northern direction and are part of bigger Baltic basin. The most notable rivers of Ukraine include: Dnieper, Dniester, Southern Buh, and Siversky Donets. The longest river is Dnieper, the longest tributary is the Dnieper's tributary Desna. Two of the Danube's tributaries in Ukraine Prut and Tysa are longer than the main river within Ukraine. A NASA satellite image of the Dnieper and its tributaries. The Dnieper River passes through many cities ‚Äî notably Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. In Kyiv, more than seven bridges cross the river.

Rapa Nui is the Polynesian name of Easter Island; its Spanish name is Isla de Pascua. The island is located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeastern extremity of the Polynesian Triangle. The island was taken over by Chile in 1888. Its fame and World Heritage status arise from the 887 extant stone statues known by the name \\"moai\\", whose creation is attributed to the early Rapa Nui people who inhabited the island around 300 AD. Much of the island has been declared as Rapa Nui National Park which, on 22 March 1996, UNESCO designated a World Heritage Site under cultural criteria (i), (iii), & (v). The Rapa Nui National Park is now under the administrative control of the Ma¬¥u Henua Polynesian Indigenous Community, which is the first autonomous institute on the island. The indigenous Rapa Nui people have regained authority over their ancestral lands and are in charge of the management, preservation and protection of their patrimony. On the first of December 2017, the ex-President Michelle Bachelet returned ancestral lands in the form of the Rapa Nui National Park to the indigenous people. For the first time in history, the revenue generated by the National Park is invested in the island and used to conserve the natural heritage. Geography Rapa Nui, showing the three main volcanoes Terevaka, Poike, Rano Kau, as well as Anakena beach, the islets including Motu Nui. Modern Hanga Roa and Mataveri International Airport, the ruins at Orongo and the quarry at Rano Raraku. It marks major ahus with moai. Geographically isolated, the island forms the eastern geographic and cultural boundary of Polynesia. It is west of Chile, about east of Pitcairn Island (the nearest human habitat) and is the most remote inhabited spot on Earth. The park is triangular in shape and has a length of and a width of . It is home to an extinct megalithic culture which is seen in the form of edifices of huge statues called \\"moai\\" made out of volcanic rocks. The topography includes volcanoes and a rugged coastline. Its elevation varies from sea level to . It has fresh water lakes, volcanic craters and a coastline which is subject to erosion. Climate The park experiences a warm sub-tropical climate with southeast trade winds from October to April. The annual average rainfall is , with rains occurring during the winter season. The average temperature varies from in winter to in summer.  History  Moai at Rano Raraku, Easter Island. Restored stone houses at Orongo The Rapa Nui people inhabited the island around 300 AD. The park was created by the Chilean Government in 1935. The native people were confined to a reserve area just outside the capital city of Hanga Roa and the rest of the land was leased to sheep ranchers. The movement for independence was started in 1964 and following this the lease for sheep farming was terminated during the 1980s and the entire island was declared a historic park. The population of the island which was 2,770 in 1972 rose to 3,792 by 2002, mostly concentrated in the capital. The island was brought under the administrative control of Chile in 1888. Its fame and World Heritage status arise from the 887 extant stone statues known as \\"moai\\". Much of the island has been included in the Rapa Nui National Park. On 22 March 1996 UNESCO designated it a World Heritage Site of cultural significance under criteria (i), (iii), & (v). Culture The moai with headgear at Ahu Tahai, restored with coral eyes by the American archaeologist William Mullo. The moai in the park are of varying height from 2 to 20 metres (6 to 65 ft). The volcanic rock formations quarried for sculpting are a distinctive yellow-brown volcanic tuff found only at the Ranu Raraku on the southeast side of the island. Some of the moai were also carved from red scoria. The ceremonial shrines where they are erected for offering worship are known as \\"ahu\\". Of impressive size and form, they are normally built close to the coast and parallel to it. Many unfinished moai are also found in the quarries. The production and transportation of the 887 statues are considered remarkable creative and physical feats. The moai have been under restoration since 1950. The period between 1837 and 1864 was a critical time when, for reasons that remain unknown, all the standing statues were toppled (probably during the tribal wars), although with little damage. Subsequently they were retrieved and returned to their original positions during the period of restoration with international assistance. The moai represented a clan's \\"most revered forebears who were believed to bestow ‚Äòmana‚Äô on living leaders\\". The park also has a few petroglyphs and paintings. Rano Kau crater The Birdman cult which replaced the moai cult worship was concentrated in Orongo at a ceremonial site called Mata Ngarau. The location is at an elevation of , on a narrow ridge between the ocean, and the deep crater of Rano Kau volcano, which last erupted about 150,000 to 210,000 years ago. The earliest inhabitants of the island called it \\"Te Pito o TeHenua\\" (the navel/end of the world). The first European to discover the island was Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen on Easter day, 1722. As a result, he named it \\"Easter Island\\". He observed that the inhabitants were of three groups: \\"dark skinned, red skinned, and very pale skinned people with red hair\\". In the 19th century, a Tahitian visitor who thought the island resembled Rapa but was bigger (nui means big), gave it the Polynesian name \\"Rapa Nui\\". In Chile, the island is called \\"Isla De Pascua\\" Spanish for Easter Island. Wildlife As the island was isolated there are many endemic species of animals and plants. The park is under IUCN Management Category II in southeastern Polynesia. Its biogeographic and ecological history has undergone a sea change from what existed in the ancient days when there were palm trees and a broad leaf forest. Before the Polynesians settled here in the 4th century, the island had an extensive forest cover of trees, shrubs, ferns, and grasses. The island is now almost completely grass-covered with only a few ornamental trees and shrubs scattered over the island. Flora  Of the 150 recorded plant species, 45 are endemic. However, the island is largely covered by grass with three endemic species. In ancient times the only species of tree found here was Sophora toromiro which is now extinct on the island; it is a species related to the Chilean palm, Jubaea chilensis. In the steppe areas of the island, the vegetation consists mostly of species of Stipa and Nassella. Other species recorded are of introduced varieties. Among the shrubs, the hau hau (Triumfetta semitriloba) is still present but Coprosoma spp., is not seen on the island. The wood of the now extinct Jubaea palm was used to make devices for transporting the huge stone moai statues. It has been established by carbon dating that this species of tree existed on the island till the 17th century. Ferns are indigenous to Rapa Nui, and four of the 15 species noted are endemic: Doodia paschalis, Polystichum fuentesii, Elaphoglossum skottsbergii, and Thelypteris espinosae. Triumfetta semitriloba which was considered an extinct species on the island was located in 1988. According to a recent report (1991), apart from 166 introduced species of plants, 46 indigenous plant species including nine endemic species have been recorded. Also noted in the lower level of the Rano Raraku crater are tall bulrushes and Scirpus tautara that were probably introduced by seafarers from South America. Fauna The island's only mammals are rodents and carnivorans. The reptiles recorded are three species of marine turtles and two terrestrial lizards, Lepidodactylus lugubris and Ablepharus boutoui poecilopleurus. Four bird species - three terrestrial and one marine - are found on the island. These are: Fregata nubor, red-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda), and Kermadec petrel. Three micro-lepidopteran species are reported in the park which have no links to South American species; one of these is Asymphorodes trichogramma. Conservation Invasive plants have been introduced for livestock grazing. Forest fires are a common feature, threatening the remaining native plant species. Archaeological investigations indicate the terrain is subject to damage from erosion and the influx of tourists. Though declared a national park in 1935, the first management plan (by CONAF) was not implemented until the 1980s. As a result of inadequate funding, conservation was initially at a low level leading international conservation agencies to provide financial and technical support. Chile responded by setting up a Rapa Nui Monuments Board which enabled actions to be taken independent of the government. The World Monument Fund started working here in 1968 with UNESCO later recognizing the site as a World Heritage site of cultural importance. With an airline operating (the airport built in 1965 was expanded in 1985) between Chile and the island, more scientists have become interested in island's heritage, undertaking research on various aspects of its now defunct culture. The Rapa Nui National Park is now under the administrative control of the Ma¬¥u Henua Polynesian Indigenous Community, which is the first autonomous institute on the island. The indigenous Rapa Nui people have regained authority over their ancestral lands and are in charge of the management, preservation and protection of their patrimony. On the first of December 2017, the ex-President Michelle Bachelet returned ancestral lands in the form of the Rapa Nui National Park to the indigenous people. For the first time in history, the revenue generated by the National Park is invested in the island and used to conserve the natural heritage. Its conservation value is dictated by the archaeological investigations of the important intangible value of its cultural heritage. The management plan drawn by the park administration is oriented towards these archaeological investigations. Zoning of the park has been done accordingly under the classification of intangible zone, primitive zone, extensive use zone, service and CONAF (1976) zone and special use zone. A harmonious blend of conservation activities in the reserve areas (including monoliths and structures) with agricultural activities, livestock grazing, orchards and traditional fishing sites has evolved in the integrated management plans for the island. web|url=http://collections.infocollections.org/ukedu/uk/d/Jr0073e/3.4.html|title=Planning National Parks for Ecodevelopment - Methods and Cases from Latin America|accessdate=4 August 2013|publisher=Peace Corps: Information collection and exchange}} Sister parks * Teide National Park (Tenerife, Spain).Espa√±a: Cooperaci√≥n en Parques NacionalesCooperaci√≥n internacional entre parques nacionales Gallery File:Rapa Nui, Rano Raraku.JPG|Monument in Rapa Nui File:Parque Nacional Rapa Nui.jpg|Rapa Nui, Easter Island File:Moai Easter Island geod0095.jpg|Tukuturi, a moai at Rano Raraku File:Rano Raraku quarry.jpg|Outer slope of the Rano Raraku volcano, the quarry of the moai with many uncompleted statues.

According to this legend, Kintu was the first person on earth and the first man to wander the plains of Uganda alone. He is also known as God or the father of all people who created the first kingdoms.  Kintu in mythology In the creation myth recorded by Harry Johnston, Kintu appears on the plains of Buganda with a cow which was his only possession and he fed on its milk and cow dung before being rewarded bananas and millet from the sky god, Ggulu. Before his encounter with Ggulu, Kintu meets a woman named Nambi and her sister who had come from the sky. They first take his beloved cow to Ggulu to prove his humanness and to seek Ggulu's permission of his admission into the sky. Once arriving in the sky, Kintu's humanness is tested by Ggulu through five consecutive trials, each one trickier and more difficult than the last. However, Kintu is able to come out of each trial victorious with the assistance of an unidentified divine power. Ggulu is impressed with Kintu's wit and resilience, rewarding his efforts with his daughter Nambi and many agricultural gifts as dowry which included: bananas, potatoes, beans, maize corn, ground-nuts, and a hen. From this point, Kintu was given the basic materials to be able to create life in Uganda. However, before leaving the sky, Kintu and Nambi were warned by Ggulu not to come back for any reason as they made their journey back to Earth for fear that Nambi's brother, Warumbe or Walumbe (meaning \\"disease\\" and \\"death\\" in Bantu), would follow them back to Earth and cause them great trouble. Kintu and Nambi disregarded Ggulu's warning and Kintu returned to the sky to fetch the millet the hen had to feel on while on earth that Nambi had left behind and in his short time there, Warumbe had figured Nambi's whereabouts and convinced Kintu to allow him to live with them on Earth. Upon seeing Warumbe accompanying Kintu on their way down from the sky, Nambi at first denied her brother but Warumbe eventually persuaded her into allowing him to stay with them. The three of them first settled in Magongo in Buganda where they rested and planted the first crops on earth: banana, maize corn, beans, and groundnuts. During this time, Kintu and Nambi had three children and Warumbe insisted on claiming one as his own. Kintu denied his request, promising him one of his future children; however, Kintu and Nambi proceeded to have many more children and denied Warumbe with each child causing him to lash out and declare to kill each and every one of Kintu's children and claim them in that sense. Each day for three days, one of Kintu's children died by the hands of Warumbe until Kintu returned to the sky and told Ggulu of the killings.Thury, Eva M. and Margaret K. Devinney, Introduction to Mythology: Contemporary approaches to Classical and World Myths. 4thed. Oxford/New York: Oxford UP 2017. Ggulu expected the actions of Warumbe and sent Kaikuzi (meaning \\"digger\\" in Bantu), his son, to Earth to attempt to capture and bring Warumbe back to the sky. Kintu and Kaikuzi descended to Earth and were notified by Nambi that a few more of their children had died during Kintu's trip to the sky. In response to this, Kaikuzi called upon Warumbe and the two met and fought. During the fight, Warumbe was able to slip away into a hole in the ground and continued to dig deeper as Kaikuzi tried to retrieve him. These gigantic holes are believed to be in the present day Ntinda. After relentlessly digging, Kaikuzi tired out and took a break from chasing Warumbe. Kaikuzi remained on earth for two more days and ordered silence among all things on Earth during that time (before sunrise) in an attempt to lure Warumbe out of the ground. However, just as Warumbe started to get curious and came out from under the ground, some of Kintu's children spotted him and screamed out, scaring Warumbe back into the Earth. Tired and frustrated with his wasted efforts and broken orders, Kaikuzi returned to the sky without capturing Warumbe, who stayed on earth and is responsible for the misery and suffering of Kintu's children today. However, Kaikuzi is still chasing Warumbe and every time earthquakes and tsunamis strike, it is Kaikuzi is almost catching Warumbe.  Kintu in The Quest for Kintu and the Search for Peace  In the early 1900s, two similar oral traditions of the Kintu creation myth were recorded and published. One oral tradition recorded by John Roscoe differs from other myths in that Kintu was said to have been seduced by Nambi into going with her to the sky. In addition, after completing the trials Ggulu tasked him with, he was given permission to marry Nambi and returned to Uganda with various livestock and one plantation stalk to begin life on Earth. Furthermore, in this version Kintu was the one to try to capture Warumbe, not Kaikuzi. The other oral tradition recorded by Sir Apolo Kaggwa differed from other Kintu creation myths in that it focused more on the contributions that Kintu had on the political aspects of Buganda. According to this oral tradition, Kintu formed the political and geographical foundations of the nation by setting the physical boundaries of the nation, founding the capital, and creating the first form of politics in Baganda society through royal hierarchy.  Kintu in The Oral Tradition of Baganda of Uganda  Kintu is also present in The Oral Tradition of Baganda of Uganda. However, in this version of the Kintu creation myth, the importance of the story is placed upon Nambi; in the beginning of the myth, it is Nambi who falls in love with Kintu upon their first meeting in Baganda and convinces Kintu to seek approval from her father in order to get her hand in marriage. For this reason, Kintu's worthiness was tested by Nambi's father Ggulu through a series of trials over the course of four days. From this point, this version of the oral tradition differs from others in that Ggulu instructed Nambi to take one female and one male of each living thing in order to begin life on Earth. Ggulu also warned her not to forget anything while packing because she would never be able to return to the sky in fear that her mischievous brother Warumbe would follow them to Earth and bring hardships upon them.  Kintu as a historical figure  The name Kintu, meaning \\"thing\\" in Bantu, is commonly attached to the name Muntu who was the legendary figure who founded the Gisu and Vukusu tribes.David William Cohen, The Historical Tradition of Busoga:Mukama and Kintu. Oxford/New York: Oxford UP 1972. Kintu is believed to originate from the east, west, and north bringing with him the first materials to begin life on earth. These materials consisted of millet, cattle, and bananas.

He was educated at Princeton University, McGill University, the University of Oxford, Aix-Marseille University, and the University of Toronto. After receiving a Department of National Defence fellowship to study under propaganda scholar Jacques Ellul at Bordeaux in 1979‚Äì1980, he started a philosophy and mass communications class at Carleton called Truth and Propaganda, which has run annually ever since.Marlin, Randal. (2002) Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion. Toronto: Broadview Press, p. 10. One of the texts for this class is his 2002 book Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion, which examines historical, ethical, and legal issues relating to propaganda. The revised second edition, released in 2013, examines the Bush administration's use of propaganda based on fear to persuade Americans to support the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Marlin acknowledges that there are many definitions of propaganda, including favourable ones.Marlin, pp. 15‚Äì21. However, his book reflects Ellul's view that propaganda suppresses individual freedom and autonomy.Ellul, Jacques. (1973) Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes. New York: Vintage Books Edition, p. 256; Marlin, pp. 170‚Äì171. In 1998, Marlin published a book examining the public uproar following the appointment of a former separatist Quebec political candidate to the top administrator's post at the new Ottawa Hospital. The David Levine Affair: Separatist Betrayal or McCarthyism North? criticizes the Ottawa news media for fanning the flames of intolerance in their quest for higher circulations and audience ratings.Marlin, Randal. (1998) The David Levine Affair: Separatist Betrayal or McCarthyism North?. Winnipeg, Manitoba: Fernwood Publishing, pp. 8‚Äì10 and 156. The book also documents how the media kept the controversy going with a barrage of stories, columns, letters, editorials and radio phone-in shows.Marlin, (Levine Affair), pp. 10‚Äì11. The David Levine Affair draws on Marlin's knowledge of propaganda techniques that play on stereotypes as well as pre-existing fears, suspicions and resentments to incite intense emotional reactions.Marlin, (Levine Affair), pp. 9 and 15‚Äì16. Marlin's studies and teaching in the field of propaganda have earned him the nickname \\"Ottawa's Orwell\\". Early life and education Randal Marlin spent his early childhood in Washington D.C. where he was born in 1938. His father worked for the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency. The family moved to Montreal in 1946 after his father started working for the United Nations. Marlin moved again to Ampleforth, a Benedictine college and boarding school, in England. \\"The school ran largely through the authority of the older boys over the younger boys,\\" Marlin recalled during an interview in 2008. \\"You can see how people abuse power, and I got very interested in things about law.\\"Bennett (Grub Street) interview. In 1955, Marlin began four years of university studies at Princeton.COVE. He intended to pursue a career in physics, but discovered that he \\"couldn't really handle the math of nuclear physics in the second year.\\"Bennett interview. Fortunately, the university encouraged students to enroll in subjects outside their main fields and Marlin studied Greek philosophy. He also worked as a journalist at the student newspaper, the Daily Princetonian where he enjoyed stirring up controversy. Marlin's interest in both philosophy and journalism led him to study the philosophy of language at McGill University. He wrote his thesis on Ernst Cassirer and the phenomenology of language earning an MA degree in philosophy in 1961.Bennett interview; COVE. At Trinity College, Oxford he spent two years studying Edmund Husserl's phenomenology and the philosophy of existentialism. In 1963-64, Marlin taught and studied existentialism at the Institute for American Universities at Aix-en-Provence, France. Then in 1964, he began two years of teaching and PhD studies at the University of Toronto. His PhD thesis, completed in 1973, examined problems concerning morality and criminal law. Early professional career In 1966, Randal Marlin accepted a teaching post at Carleton in Ottawa, partly because the university had a journalism school. By then, he had worked for two summers at the Montreal Star. He decided to institute a course called Society, Values and Technology to explore several interrelated themes. One reflected his growing involvement in preserving the older neighbourhood where he lived from being overwhelmed by heavy traffic. Marlin says that in the midst of that campaign, he realized from reading Aristotle's Rhetoric that a vivid example can be much more persuasive than logical arguments, an insight reinforced by a fellow community activist. \\"One thing I recall him saying,\\" Marlin told an interviewer years later, \\"'If there's an accident in the area, exploit it. That's the time people will act to make changes in the traffic patterns. So don't miss the opportunity when something like that comes up.'\\" Marlin's growing interest in persuasion took on added dimensions as he began reading The Technological Society by Jacques Ellul. The book argues that every field of human activity is now dominated by efficient technical methods or, what Ellul calls, technique.Ellul, Jacques. (1964) The Technological Society. New York: Vintage Books, p.xxv. Marlin says Ellul's work showed him how the techniques of creating and managing public opinion feed off of or augment each other. Ellul had also published a landmark study of propaganda which explains how information can be used in the exercise of power.Ellul, Jacques. Propaganda, p.112, \\"[I]nformation is an essential element of propaganda...\\" and p.121, \\"Propaganda is needed in the exercise of power...\\" \\"That's the central idea of propaganda,\\" Marlin says, \\"the maintaining or gaining of power over others.\\" Truth and propaganda Marlin's fascination with Ellul's writings gave him an idea. \\"During a crazy moment,\\" he recalls, \\"I saw one of those advertisements for a Department of National Defence (DND) fellowship, offered for study abroad. It was $12,000, which, in those days -- 1979-1980, was a lot of money.\\" Marlin told DND that Canadians needed to know more about the dangers of subversive propaganda and that if he were given a chance to study with Jacques Ellul at the University of Bordeaux in France, he would establish a university course on propaganda. To his surprise, he won the fellowship. \\"I had this great delight of studying for a year with Jacques Ellul. I found him as fascinating in person as he was in his writings.\\" After his year abroad, Marlin returned to Carleton and created the course Truth and Propaganda. Propaganda and ethics In 2002, Marlin published Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion, the book that now serves as one of the texts for his university course on propaganda. It contains extensive information about propaganda including various definitions, a brief history from ancient times to the 20th century and a discussion of propaganda techniques.Marlin, (Ethics), pp. 13-135. Marlin bases his own definition of propaganda on what he sees as three of its main features. First, propaganda aims to influence many people in organized and deliberate ways. Second, it is likely to deceive its target audience and third, it uses psychological influences to suppress or bypass rational thought.Marlin, (Ethics), p. 22. Therefore, Marlin defines propaganda as: > The organized attempt through communication to affect belief or action or > inculcate attitudes in a large audience in ways that circumvent or suppress > an individual's adequately informed, rational, reflective judgment. In his chapters on ethics, Marlin suggests that propaganda is always ethically questionable because it tries to manipulate using misleading information, emotional appeals and psychological pressure.Marlin, (Ethics), p. 170. He notes that although we tend to associate propaganda with political power or ideology, it also includes other forms of persuasion such as advertising and public relations.Marlin, (Ethics), p. 175. Atrocity propaganda In Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion, Marlin notes that atrocity propaganda is used to demonize wartime enemies.Marlin, (Ethics, pp. 70-71. He writes, for example, that during World War I, British propaganda accused German soldiers of publicly raping women in the town square, decapitating babies and forcing parents to watch as their children's hands and ears were cut off.Marlin, (Ethics), p. 71. The American public relations firm Hill & Knowlton resorted to atrocity propaganda during the 1990/91 Gulf War when it spread the story that the Iraqi soldiers who had invaded Kuwait were ripping helpless Kuwaiti babies from hospital incubators.Marlin, (Ethics), pp. 194-199. Corpse Factory story In his textbook and in other writings, Marlin examines a specific example of World War I atrocity propaganda to illustrate propaganda techniques.Marlin, (Ethics), pp. 71-76. The Corpse Factory story incited hatred and loathing of Germans who were supposedly \\"boiling their own dead soldiers to extract from their bodies lubricating oil, fats, soap, glue, glycerine for explosives, bonemeal for animal feed, and fertilizer.\\"Marlin, (Ethics), p.71. According to Marlin's research, the story was likely concocted by British and Belgian propagandists in London and then spread far and wide beginning on April 17, 1917 by the Times and the Daily Mail, newspapers owned by Lord Northcliffe, a man with close connections to British propaganda. The Northcliffe papers gave the story credibility by combining a mistranslated report from a German newspaper about dead horses being boiled down for glue, with an invented story, ostensibly from Belgian newspapers, quoting a detailed, eyewitness description of dead German soldiers being dumped into a huge cauldron at a \\"Corpse Exploitation Establishment.\\"Neander and Marlin, pp. 73-74. Other news media spread the gruesome story worldwide.Neander and Marlin, p. 75. Propaganda techniques Marlin writes that the Corpse Factory story illustrates the seven requirements for effective propaganda outlined in the 1938 book Propaganda Boom by A.J. Mackenzie.Mackenzie, A.J., (1938). London: John Gifford, pp. 50-71, cited in Marlin, (Ethics), pp. 75&92. Those requirements are: *Repetition: The Northcliffe papers kept the story going day after day by publishing readers' letters. *Colour: The eyewitness description of the corpse factory appealed to readers' imaginations. *Kernel of truth: The Germans did have plants to boil down animal carcasses. *Slogans: The story gave support to such propaganda slogans as \\"The Germans are ghouls.\\" *Specific objective: The story incited hatred of the Germans and encouraged people to join in the fight against them. *Concealed motive: Publishing reports from \\"foreign\\" papers obscured the source of the propaganda. *Timing: The mistranslated German report on the animal rendering plant coincided with the concocted Belgian corpse factory report.Marlin, (Ethics), p.75. According to Marlin and Joachim Neander, the Corpse Factory story also illustrates other propaganda techniques including the use of deceptive language, appeal to emotion and the Big Lie.Neander and Marlin, p. 77. They write that after the story was exposed as false in 1925, people were determined not to be fooled again. Thus, many doubted reports about the Holocaust early in World War II‚Äîtestimony to the long-lasting and harmful effects of atrocity propaganda.Neander and Marlin, p.79. Two propaganda theorists Marlin makes it clear in Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion, that George Orwell and Jacques Ellul strongly influenced his own writing. He refers to both thinkers as major propaganda theorists \\"who sought to expose the forces at work integrating an individual into a larger system and frustrating an individual's self-development and freedom.\\"Marlin, (Ethics), pp. 23-24. George Orwell Marlin credits Orwell with effectively and passionately exposing the enslaving effects of propagandistic language. He points to Newspeak, the language Orwell invented in his satirical novel Nineteen Eighty-Four to illustrate how words could reinforce the totalitarian power of a police state by eradicating historical memory and narrowing the range of thought.Marlin, (Ethics), pp. 26-28. Marlin also refers to Orwell's famous 1946 essay Politics and the English Language which describes, for example, how a euphemism such as pacification served to cover up state violence and murder. \\"The extraordinary thing,\\" Marlin notes, \\"is that exactly the same word for exactly the same kind of activity was used in the Vietnam War many years later.\\"Marlin, (Ethics), p. 30. Marlin writes that Orwell showed how the owners of weekly magazines used adventure stories and comics to transmit capitalist and imperialist values partly through the repeated use of class and national stereotypes.Marlin, (Ethics), pp. 28-29. He observes that \\"the most effective propaganda is not recognized as such, and its message is often best presented obliquely.\\"Marlin, (Ethics), p. 29. Jacques Ellul \\"There is probably no other thinker who has thought as deeply about propaganda in all its dimensions and ramifications as Jacques Ellul,\\" Marlin writes. \\"What sets him apart from other analysts is his rare if not unique combination of expertise in history, sociology, law, and political science, along with careful study of biblical and Marxist writings.\\"Marlin, (Ethics), p.31. Marlin adds that for Ellul, propaganda is a technique that promotes acceptance of other techniques in a mass society where people are routinely victims of the illusion that technology will solve all our problems.Marlin, (Ethics), p. 32. Thus, propaganda is needed to adjust people to conditions imposed by technological development --- conditions that may require them to adapt to the increasingly inescapable requirements of the technological system. Elsewhere, Marlin has argued that the large and powerful vested interests that benefit from what he calls \\"the technological system\\" generate systematic propaganda glorifying technology. In a review of Ellul's book The Technological Bluff, Marlin comments on \\"the obscene way in which American television lavished praise on smart bombs\\" during the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War \\"paying little attention to the human suffering they caused.\\"Marlin, Randal. Review of The Technological Bluff by Jacques Ellul. The Canadian Catholic Review, January 1993, p.30. Marlin explains that for Ellul, propaganda is founded on the governing myths of a society. These include the myths of work, happiness, the nation, youth and the hero. Ellul sees such myths as \\"pre-propaganda\\" because they lay the groundwork for active propaganda campaigns.Marlin, (Ethics), pp. 34-35. Marlin points out that Ellul's concept of \\"sociological propaganda\\" is similar in that it also provides the basis for more overt propaganda campaigns. He writes that the notion of an \\"American way of life\\", for example, provides a sociological backdrop for active propaganda. \\"Once one accepts the American way of life as superior, it becomes a criterion of good and evil; things that are un-American become evil,\\" Marlin writes.Marlin, (Ethics), p. 37. Aside from Ellul's work on propaganda and technology, Marlin has also written appreciatively about the French thinker's theological studies. His 1986 review of Ellul's Money and Power, for example, concludes that it contains \\"a wealth of insight\\" adding, \\"[a]s Roman Catholics we have much to learn, and relearn, from this book.Marlin, Randal. Review of Money and Power by Jacques Ellul in the Canadian Catholic Review, July/August 1986, p.266. Marlin notes Ellul's belief that money predisposes people to neglect their primary obligation toward God. \\"The real question,\\" Marlin writes, \\"is whether wealth or the prospect of attaining it is the dominant force in our lives. Any time we subordinate human considerations to narrow economic exchange relationships --- ignoring the fact that cost-savings programmes cause widespread unemployment, for example --- we reveal a preoccupation with the wrong standpoint. Our heart is after the wrong treasure.\\"Marlin, CCR, p.266. David Levine affair In 1998, Marlin published a book analyzing the uproar over the appointment of David Levine as administrator of The Ottawa Hospital, an amalgamation of the Ottawa General, founded by French-speaking Roman Catholic nuns, and the Ottawa Civic which, although officially non-denominational, was regarded as a Protestant, predominantly English-speaking institution.Marlin, (Levine Affair), pp. 8 & 12. Levine, who was fluently bilingual, had 15 years experience running hospitals in Montreal. He had also served as president of the Canadian Association of Teaching Hospitals.Fraser, Graham. (2006) Sorry, I Don't Speak French: Confronting the Canadian Crisis That Won't Go Away. Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, p.176. However, in 1979, Levine had run unsuccessfully as a candidate for the separatist Parti Qu√©b√©cois in a Quebec provincial election and he had campaigned in favour of Quebec's sovereignty in the provincial referendum of 1980. At the time of his appointment to the $330,000 hospital administrator's job in Ottawa, Levine was working as the Parti Qu√©b√©cois government's representative in New York.Fraser, p.176. After the news of Levine's appointment broke on May 1, 1998, outraged readers wrote record numbers of letters to Ottawa newspapers and flooded radio phone-in shows with angry calls. Both of Ottawa's major newspapers, the Ottawa Citizen and the Ottawa Sun, published editorials and columns condemning Levine's appointment and calling on him to resign.Marlin, (Levine Affair), p.8. On May 19, 1998, the \\"hurricane of protest\\" drew national attention when a boisterous crowd confronted the hospital's board of directors in an Ottawa auditorium expressing \\"unmitigated fury\\" and referring to Quebec separatists as \\"anti- Canadians, bastards.\\"Yaffe, Barbara. \\"Why David Levine is more than an Ottawa story: Patriotism and its evil twin, intolerance, are Canadian attributes, as protests against his employment suggest,\\" Vancouver Sun, May 22, 1998, p.A23. In the end, the hospital board refused to fire Levine and after about a month, the public anger subsided.Marlin (Levine Affair), p.156. In his analysis of the affair, Marlin criticizes the Ottawa media for fanning the flames of protest in their competitive pursuit of higher circulations and audience ratings.Marlin, (Levine Affair), p.156. He also argues that although Canadians tend to regard McCarthyism as a feature of U.S. political life, the Levine affair contained its basic ingredients -- \\"a strident patriotism, which reduced complex questions to a simple us-and-them mentality.\\" He adds: \\"We are dealing not just with a local issue, but with a problem that is at the core of the Canadian unity debate. The Levine affair is a microcosm of suspicion, mistrust and misunderstanding that could someday be repeated on a larger scale with worse consequences.\\"Marlin, (Levine Affair), p.9. About 200 people turned out in November, 1998 when Marlin launched his book on the Levine affair at an Ottawa Chapters store. According to a report in the Ottawa Citizen, many heckled the author, objecting to his contention that Levine's political views were irrelevant to his work as a hospital administrator. The report added: \\"As some members of the crowd became more hostile, Mr. Marlin demanded to know if a heckler had read his book. When the man answered no, Mr. Marlin shouted back: 'It's typical of the prejudice I'm trying to fight.' The arguing continued for a lengthy time and then the heckler approached Mr. Marlin and whispered, 'I have two sons, and I'll never send them to Carleton because of people like you.'\\"Bourrie, Mark. \\"Book launch draws anti-Levine protesters: Author heckled as he criticizes reaction,\\" Ottawa Citizen, November 7, 1998, p.C7.

It lacked some improvements eventually introduced in the PaK 35/36, but was basically the same design; each gun could use ammunition of the other. The 1-K had a split trail carriage with unsprung wooden wheels (while the PaK 35/36 received a suspension and new wheels). It was equipped with a horizontal sliding block breechblock, hydraulic recoil buffer and spring recuperator. Development and production The Soviet Union started to develop anti-tank guns in the late 1920s. These attempts failed to advance beyond early stages as Soviet engineers lacked experience with this type of weapon. To solve this problem the USSR received assistance from Germany. The Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to have anti-tank artillery, but Rheinmetall secretly continued to work on anti-tank guns and in 1926 built a pre-production sample of a new 3.7 cm gun model 26. For their part the Germans were interested in any opportunity to proceed with development of this and other types of weapons. In 1929, Rheinmetall created a dummy company Butast for contacts with the USSR. In accordance with the Sovnarkom decision from 8 August 1930, on 28 August in Berlin a secret agreement was signed. The Germans were obliged to help the USSR with production of six artillery systems: *37 mm anti-tank gun *76 mm anti-aircraft gun *152 mm mortar *152 mm howitzer *20 mm anti-aircraft autocannon *37 mm anti-aircraft autocannon For $1,125 mil. Rheinmetall supplied pre-production samples, documentation and parts from which in the USSR a few pieces of each type could be assembled. All involved weapons were modern, and many of the same designs were eventually used by the Wehrmacht in World War II. In the USSR these weapons were adopted; however even with German help Soviet industry still was not ready for mass production of some types, such as anti-aircraft autocannons. Among other pieces, Rheinmetall brought to the USSR 12 37 mm anti-tank guns, which can be seen as an early variant of the PaK 35/36 - the most numerous anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht until 1942. In the USSR the gun was designated 37 mm anti-tank gun model 1930 (1-K) (). Production BT-2 light tank. The gun was produced at the Plant no. 8 (named after Kalinin), where it received index 1-K. The production rate was slow as manufacturing process included handicraft operations. In 1931 the plant built 255 pieces, but none passed quality control. In 1932 404 pieces were accepted (and in 1933 105 more followed, still from the 1932 bunch), but then the production was stopped due to adoption of more powerful 45 mm anti-tank gun M1932 (19-K). 1-K was also a base for the 37 mm tank gun B-3 (5-K), the main armament of the BT-2 light tank. Service 1-K was the first dedicated anti-tank gun of the Red Army (RKKA) and as such was actively used for training of anti-tank units. On 1 January 1936 RKKA possessed 506 guns of the type, of them 422 operational, 53 waiting for repair, 28 used for training, 3 unfit. When RKKA received large numbers of more powerful 45 mm guns, many 1-Ks were apparently relegated to training facilities and depots. The exact number of 1-Ks in service in June 1941 has not been determined. It is known that the gun was present in some units, e.g. 8th Mechanized Corps and it is likely that pieces stored in army depots were also rushed into active service. However, there are no certain reports of their combat use. Apparently most of the guns were lost in combat at the early stage of the German-Soviet War. The German designation for captured guns was 3.7 cm Pak 158(r). Summary The significance of the 1-K lies in the fact that it was the first Soviet anti-tank gun. As such, it gave some valuable experience. It also became the base for a series of Soviet 45 mm anti-tank guns. It was a light and compact gun which could be easily moved by its crew. The drawbacks were a lack of suspension, weak fragmentation shell (because of small caliber) and poor manufacturing quality. RKKA wanted a larger-caliber gun that could be used as a battalion gun as well as in an anti-tank role, so the 1-K was quickly replaced in production by its 45 mm descendants. By 1941 the gun was adequate only against lightly armoured vehicles. Modern tanks could only be penetrated from their side and only at short (less than 300 metres) range. The situation was aggravated by low ammunition quality, which explains smaller penetration figures compared to the PaK 35/36. As noted above, the 1-K could fire German shells, improving its anti-armor performance roughly to the level of early Soviet 45 mm guns, as those also suffered from problems with ammunition quality. This was due primarily to the use of gunpowder with a nitrocellulose primer as propellant in all Soviet small arms, artillery and anti-tank artillery up until well into 1942, when British convoy shipments of Cordite and more advanced propellant technology became available. Also the continued use of obsolete APHE technology ammunition, which most nations had long abandoned for considerably improved penetration performance of solid shot AP, APC and APCBC ammunition technology. The APHE shell itself was of the 1890s Hotchkiss naval type consisting of a hard-nosed forged-steel projectile with a base-mounted inertial deceleration shock-delay fuse with a stable explosive filler, most likely Picric Acid. APHE shells are more effective against battlefield sandbag, earthwork or log improvised fortifications and domestic buildings than equivalent-calibre impact detonating HE or fragmentation shells. APHE can be regarded as a useful dual-purpose round in many respects. German Rheinmetall-Borsig evaluation tests on a captured 1-K, during 1941, gave a maximum penetration of up to 42 mm of perpendicular rolled homogenous armour plate at 100 metres with APHE and up to 61 mm of perpendicular hardened carbon steel armour plate at 100 metres with APHE. (Note that all tank-building nations had abandoned the use of carburized hardened carbon steel in favour of the increased protection offered by rolled nickel-chromium homogeneous steel armour plate, cast nickel-chromium steel and cast ferro-nickel based armoured alloys by the mid-1920s onwards). By comparison the German 37 mm PaK 35/36 could penetrate up to 44 mm of perpendicular rolled homogenous armour plate at 100 metres with PzGr.18. APHE, up to 64 mm of perpendicular hardened carbon steel at 100 metres with PzGr.18. APHE, up to 65 mm of perpendicular rolled homogenous armour plate at 100 metres with PzGr.39. APCBC and up to 79 mm of perpendicular rolled homogenous armour plate at 100 metres with PzGr.40. APCR. The PaK 35/36 used Binatol as a propellant.

In 2006, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award. Early life and education  Ruth Manorama was born on 30 May 1952 as the to Dorothy & Paul Dhanraj, the eldest daughter among five girls and three boys. Her parents were Dorothy Dhanraj, a teacher; and Paul Dhanraj, a postal employee. To escape the worst of caste oppression, her parents converted to Christianity. https://web.archive.org/web/20070206173631/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/recip/2006/ruth- manorama.htm Manorama grew up seeing her parents consistently involved in social work. Her mother Dorothy fought for the right to be educated against her conservative family and eventually became a teacher and campaigned for women's education rights. Heavily influenced by Pandita Ramabai, Dorothy named her daughter Manorama after Pandita Ramabai's second daughter, who was named Mano. Her father Paul successfully mobilised economically disadvantaged people in neighbouring villages to fight for their rights to land that they'd been living on for generations. Manorama's parents strongly encouraged her and her sisters to be educated and self-reliant. After obtaining a degree in science from the Women's Christian College, Chennai, Manorama completed a master's degree in social work from the University of Madrasin 1975. In 2001, Manorama was awarded an honorary doctorate degree ‚Äúfor the distinguished contribution made to church and society‚Äù by the Academy of Ecumenical Indian Theology and Church Administration. Manorama is married to N. P. Samy, a trade unionist who is the General Secretary of the National Centre for Labour. They have two daughters together.  Career  Manorama has dedicated her life to battling a host of interconnected issues related to oppressions arising from caste, gender and class hierarchies. Among the issues she has fought for are the rights of domestic workers and the unorganised labour sector, slum dwellers, Dalits, and for the empowerment of marginalised women. She works at both the grassroots level as well as focuses on mass mobilisation and advocacy at the international level.  Positions Held  Manorama is an integral part of many organisations working for the rights of Dalits, women, slum dwellers, and the unorganised sector. Some of these are: * General Secretary, Women‚Äôs Voice Karnataka ‚Äì Founded in 1985, it works for the rights of women slum dwellers and the unorganised sector. * President, National Alliance of Women ‚Äì This was set up following the Fourth World Conference of Women in Beijing in 1995 with the aim of monitoring government performance on its responsibilities to women. * Joint Secretary, Christian Dalit Liberation Movement ‚Äì Formed in the 1980s, this movement sought to mobilise Dalit Christians for reservations in public appointments and educational institutions. * Secretary, Karnataka State Slum Dwellers Federation ‚Äì This organisation educates & mobilises slum dwellers to fight for their rights. * Secretary, Organisation Building at the National Centre for Labour ‚Äì This is the apex organisation for unorganised labour in India and is involved in the lobbying and drafting the Social Security Bill for the welfare and rights of 394 million unorganised labour in India. * President, National Federation of Dalit Women (NFDW) ‚Äì In 1993, Ruth helped organise a public hearing on Violence Against Dalit Women, which led to the creation of NFDW in 1995. It is a special platform to address the unique violence and discrimination faced by Dalit women, especially in rural areas and slums She is also a part of several international collectives and organisations such as: * Core Group MembPolier, Asian Women‚Äôs Human Rights Council ‚Äì an Asian network of women involved in human rights work. * Member, Advisory Group Of The International Women‚Äôs Rights Action Watch (Asia Pacific) ‚Äì this group supports and facilitates advocacy campaigns for women's rights * Co-Convener, International Lobby & Advocacy for Dalit Human Rights ‚Äì In 1998, on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, this campaign was founded to re-iterate that Dalit rights are human rights, and created a national signature campaign with 2.5 million signatures to root out casteism in India. Within India, she is also a member of the Karnataka State Planning Board, the State Commission for Women, the Task Force on Women‚Äôs Empowerment of the Government of India and a number of other state and national bodies.  Activism  In the 1980s and 1990s, Manorama led processions of over 150,000 people to protest against ‚ÄòOperation Demolition‚Äô by the State Government of Karnataka, which was a forced eviction campaign. She and other activists demanded protection for those to be evicted and the right to live legally and with dignity. On behalf of the slum dwellers, Manorama fought court cases at the High Court and the Supreme Court of India against this move by the Karnataka administration. Manorama also established the first trade union in the country in 1987 for domestic workers in Bengaluru and strove for inclusion in the Minimum Wages. Manorama has worked to mobilise the underprivileged from a grass-root levels since the 1980s. In more than 120 slums, she has been responsible for the mobilisation, training and empowerment of women to deal with the discrimination and violence that they face and to take leadership within their communities. Ruth is also committed to the cause of emancipation of Dalits. She has participated in several struggles against human rights violations, for land rights and for the cause of Dalit women and contributed immensely to the mainstreaming of Dalit issues. ‚ÄúDalit women in India are the Dalits among Dalits and suffer from three-fold oppression ‚Äî on account of gender as a result of patriarchy, caste ‚Äòthe untouchable', and class ‚Äî as they hail from the poorest and most marginalised communities. Eighty per cent of Scheduled Castes live in rural areas, are dependent on wage employment and have to contend with high rates of under employment which results in greater incidence of poverty,‚Äù said Ruth forcefully in an interview with The Hindu.  Politics  Manorama has been vocal of her opinion that women should be more involved in politics. In a panel about 'Dalit Women in Politics: Past, Present, and Future', organised by All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manchand The Blue Club, she talked about the shortage of dalits, particularly women, who participated in politics. She spoke about the patriarchy that is so rampant in Indian politics so most women who entered politics was through nepotism and were simply used as a false token of equality in parliament. She also said that marginalized communities, such as dalit women. were the drivers of change. She first entered the political scene as an independent candidate in the Bharathi Nagar constituency in 2004. She gained 1.61% of the vote share. In the 2014 Indian general election, she was named as the Janata Dal (Secular) candidate from Bangalore South (Lok Sabha constituency) which constitutes fairly upper-class and literate voters.No money, no biryani. Only audacity of hope, - The Times Of India (2 April 2014). She campaigned on her live long dream of seeing a safe, corruption-free, and inclusive society. She gained 2.30% of the vote share.  Nominations and awards  In 2006, Manorama was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \\"her commitment over decades to achieving equality for Dalit women, building effective and committed women‚Äôs organizations and working for their rights at national and international levels.‚Äù The Right Livelihood Award is considered the alternative Nobel Prize and the world's premier award for personal courage and social transformation. Manorama was also one among the thousand nominees for the 1,000 Peace Women for Nobel Peace Prize in 2005.

The Religious Sisters of this institute are dedicated to the service of the poor and needy. The motherhouse for the congregation is in Saint-Brieuc, Brittany, France. The members of the congregation use the post-nominal initials of D.H.S. or F.S.E. Marie Balavenne and Ren√©e Burel in Pl√©rin in 1706 History Origins The congregation was founded in the town of Pl√©rin in Brittany on December 8, 1706, by Marie Balavenne (1666-1743), the widow of a former harbormaster, and Ren√©e Burel. Both products of modest homes in the nearby port town of L√©gu√©, they felt called to commit themselves to live together and to devote themselves to the service of the poor, the sick and children, primarily through the education of poor girls. They served under the guidance of the Abb√© Jean Leuduger (1649-1722), a local priest, who was head of the Missions for Upper Brittany and who supported them in this commitment. He is considered a co-founder of the congregation. The initial principal object of their service was the education of children; but as other women joined the pair in their work, the growing community soon undertook all kinds of charitable work, serving mainly in small communities scattered throughout the rural parishes of the region. They received official approval as a religious congregation by the Diocese of Saint-Brieuc in 1733. The members of the congreation became known as the \\"White Sisters\\" from the color of their religious habit, which consisted of a white tunic with a starched white veil. For generations, a distinctive part of their habit was the use of side hoops in the manner of 18th-century women's attire, which they discontinued only in the 1950s. Additionally they wore a large, white cape with a black border on the hood, which was the local style of dress in Pl√©rin. A depiction of some Daughters of the Holy Spirit at prayer in their local church by Lucien Simon (1945) New opportunity for Religious Sisters as charitable medical practitioners were created by devout nobles on their own estates. The Sisters provided comprehensive care for the sick poor on their patrons' estates, acting not only as nurses, but they took on expanded roles as physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. The congregation grew rapidly, and became widespread over north-west France. With 75 members at the time living in 19 communities, it was suppressed during the French Revolution when many of the Daughters left the country to save their lives, but most of the communities were re-established when the practice of the Catholic faith was again allowed in 1801 through the Concordat signed between Napoleon and the Holy See. The congregation doubled in size over the course of the 19th century. Expansion With the start in 1902 of laws limiting the role of the Catholic Church and of religious communities, especially in education, which culminated in the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, again many of the Sisters began to leave France, departing for England, Belgium and the United States,Daughters of the Holy Spirit - US website while still possessing their motherhouse at Saint-Brieuc, and several other houses in France. The nation and the Holy See settled their disputes in 1921, at which time the congregation was able to take up again fully its service in their native land. In 1934, the Sisters opened a mission in Manchuria, which began a series of missions in the Third World. This was followed by foundations in Africa and South America. They either now serve or have served in Cameroon (1954), Chile (1962), Nigeria (1964-1978), Chad (1974), Peru (1979), Burkina Faso (1994) and Romania (2004). In the United States, the Sisters of the American Province founded what became Annhurst College in South Woodstock, Connecticut, in 1940. This was a women's college for much of its history, which operated until 1980. As the number of Religious Sisters declined through the latter half of the 20th century, the Daughters of the Holy Spirit in the United Stated decided to establish a network of Associates, for men and women who wanted to share in a formal way in the spiritual life and work of the Sisters. The first Associates were admitted there in 1987. By 1996 there had arisen an international network of these men and women which was officially recognized by the congregation. This movement toward further lay involvement in the life and work of the congregation was extended to the formation in 2003 of a secular institute of women living in the world who would consecrate their lives to sharing in the charism of the congregation, while maintaining their careers in the workplace. Mergers In 1994, the Sisters of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception (), founded in the early 19th century and based in Briouze, Normandy, merged with the Daughters of the Holy Spirit. The motherhouse of that congregation, built in 1834, became a retirement community for the older members of the congregation. That house was closed on 6 October 2020 and the five remaining former Sisters of Notre Dame moved to a new facility across the street. In 2003, the monastery of the Hospitalers of the Holy Spirit in Poligny, Jura, a community of canonesses regular of the Order of the Holy Ghost, a nursing order of both men and women which was founded in Jerusalem in the 9th century and re- established in Europe in 11th century where it soon spread throughout Europe, chose to merge with the Daughters. Current status The Daughters of the Holy Spirit currently serve in 13 countries. According to the Papal Yearbook for 2007, at that time they numbered 1,372 Sisters in 264 communities around the world.

James won the 2008 Man of Steel award, making him the fourth successive St Helens player to win the prestigious award having beaten rival Jamie Peacock, and team mate Leon Pryce. He follows team mates James Roby, Paul Wellens, Jamie Lyon, Paul Sculthorpe (two spells) and Sean Long in being named Man of Steel. Graham playing for St Helens in 2011 He was named in the Rugby League Writers' team of the year in 2008 and the Rugby League World magazine the following year in 2009. He played in the 2009 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford. 2011 would be Graham's final year at Saints as a host of NRL clubs coveted his signature. Canterbury Bulldogs and Parramatta Eels were thought to head the list of interested clubs. On 27 April 2011 it was confirmed by club officials that St Helens joint captain James Graham will join NRL side Canterbury Bulldogs when his contract expires at the end of the 2011 season. \\"We did everything practical to persuade James to stay,\\" said Saints chairman Eamonn McManus. \\"But we respect his wishes and ambitions. There comes a point where you have to just shake his hand and wish him luck.\\" Graham left St Helens with a 4-5 record in finals (1-5 in Super League Grand Finals in 2006, and 2007-2011; and 3-0 in Challenge Cup Finals from 2006-2008). He played in the 2011 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford. Canterbury-Bankstown He played 26 games in his d√©but NRL season and was part of the Bulldogs team which lost the Grand Final to Melbourne Storm. However he was at the centre of the match's most controversial incident when he appeared to bite the left ear of Storm fullback Billy Slater. Graham denied the charge but despite inconclusive video footage was widely condemned and subsequently suspended for 12 matches by the NRL Judiciary in a hearing lasting ten minutes. Graham after his 400th game After Canterbury captain Michael Ennis was ruled out of the 2014 NRL Grand Final due to a foot injury, Graham along with teammate Trent Hodkinson were named co- captains of the Bulldogs for the match. At the Bulldogs 2015 season launch, Graham was named the club captain for the club's 80th season, replacing former rake Michael Ennis. It was also announced that the Englishman will be joined in the role with newly appointed vice-captains, Aiden Tolman and Frank Pritchard. St. George Illawarra Dragons On the 5th of September during NRL 360, Graham announced that he had signed a 3 year deal with the St. George Illawarra Dragons starting in the 2018 NRL season. The deal was confirmed by his previous club the Bulldogs & future club the Dragons on the 7th of September 2017. In Graham's first year at the Dragons, the club qualified for the finals and defeated Brisbane in week one 48‚Äì18 before being eliminated the following week by South Sydney losing 13‚Äì12. Graham played in the club's first 11 games of the 2019 NRL season but was taken from the field during St George Illawarra's 22-9 loss against Cronulla. Scans later revealed that Graham had suffered a fibula fracture and was ruled out for 8 weeks. In Round 21 of the 2019 NRL season, Graham played his 400th first grade game as the Dragons defeated the Gold Coast 40-28 at Kogarah Oval. Graham made a total of 19 appearances for St. George Illawarra in the 2019 NRL season as the club endured one of their worst ever seasons finishing 15th on the table. On 25 June 2020, Graham was released by the Dragons to pursue an opportunity to go back home to St Helens. Representative career Graham representing England in 2011 Graham warming up for England in 2016 James made his international d√©but for Great Britain in the 2006, scoring twice in a mid-season international with New Zealand. He missed the Tri-Nations later that season after injuring himself during a drunken episode involving his St Helens teammates. He went on to make another three Great Britain appearances which would all come in the 2007 All Golds Tour before the nation would be ceased and split up into three countries: England, Scotland and Wales. The following year in June, James made his d√©but for the re-established England team against France in Toulouse. James would go on to play for England in one more fixture, against Wales in Doncaster, before being selected in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup team. He would go on to appear in 3 of England's 4 appearances in their campaign. He was selected to play for England against France in the one- off test in 2010. Due to an injury to tour captain Adrian Morley, Graham was handed over the captaincy of England's 2010 Four Nations tournament squad, and in doing so became one of the youngest ever captains of the national side. Graham played in the 2011 Four Nations and 2013 Rugby League World Cup. Graham was the vice-captain of England at the 2014 Four Nations. He captained the team in their match against Samoa. At the conclusion of the 2015 domestic season, Graham was selected to play for England in the 2015 end-of-year internationals against France and New Zealand. He appeared in the France test match where England went on to rout their opponents. He made history in the opening test-match of the series against New Zealand as he officially became the most capped England international, making his 28th appearance for England, since their re-inauguration from Great Britain. He expressed his pride and joy after realising he had now officially beaten Kevin Sinfield's record. In October 2016, Graham was selected in the England squad for the 2016 Four Nations. Before the tournament, he captained the team in a test match against France in the absence of 'usual' captain Sam Burgess after he was unavailable due to suspension. Graham captained England to a 40-6 victory. In October 2017 he was selected in the England squad for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. England made it to the final but were defeated by Australia 6-0.

He was Duke of ≈öwidnica from 1326, Duke of Jawor and Lw√≥wek from 1346, Duke of Lusatia from 1364, Duke over half of Brzeg and O≈Çawa from 1358, Duke of Siewierz from 1359, and Duke over half of G≈Çog√≥w and ≈öcinawa from 1361. He was the oldest son of Bernard, Duke of ≈öwidnica, by his wife Kunigunde, daughter of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, Duke of Kuyavia and, from 1320, King of Poland. Like his grandfather, King Elbow-high, Bolko II was of small stature; his nickname, \\"the Small\\" (Ma≈Çy), reflects this and was used in contemporary sources. Life Early years After the death of his father in 1326, Bolko II, with his younger brother Henry II as co- ruler, succeeded him in all his domains. Because both princes were still in their teenage years, they were at first aided by their two paternal uncles, Dukes Bolko II of Ziƒôbice and Henry I of Jawor, as well as their mother Kunigunde, who in 1328 remarried to Rudolf I, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg. Through this union, Bolko II gained a half-brother, Mieszko of Saxe-Wittenberg (b. ca. 1330 ‚Äì d. 1350). Kunigunde died in 1331, after which Bolko II ruled by himself. Attempts to secure the independence of his duchy One of the first problems that Bolko II had to face during the first years of his personal reign was the preservation of his small Duchy's independence. It became a separate identity during the fragmentation of Poland, and so was not under the control of the Polish Kingdom nor by any of other neighbors. However, King John of Bohemia, hoped to gain control of the small Silesian duchies. The first serious attempt by King John was to force the Duke of ≈öwidnica to accept his overlordship in 1329. He succeeded in gaining control of much of Silesia as almost all the Piast rulers paid him homage. However, two of the Silesian rulers strongly refused to become his vassals: Bolko II and his brother-in-law (husband of his sister Constance), Duke Przemko II of G≈Çog√≥w. Bolko II needed more troops in order to preserve his position, so he decided to visit the court of the King Charles Robert of Hungary, where he strongly defended the sovereignty of his dukedom. Shortly after, he also established contacts with his grandfather, the Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, and in August 1329 he went to Italy to the camp of Louis IV of Bavaria, recently crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Expedition of King John of Bohemia to Silesia in 1331 Bolko II's efforts proved unsuccessful in deterring King John, who, allied with the Teutonic Order in an attempt to distract the Poles, had invaded Silesia in 1331. Details of Bolko II's actions during that time are unknown, but King John's progress through Silesia was not easy: the siege of Niemcza and the disputed G≈Çog√≥w took longer than he expected. His forces were delayed in reaching Kalisz, where was made to come to terms with Bolko II. In the end, all King John was able to conquer was to incorporate into Bohemia the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w. Bolko II of Ziƒôbice's homage to the Kingdom of Bohemia In 1336, Bolko II achieved a sought for political goal when his uncle Bolko II of Ziƒôbice put himself under King John's rule. This submission was in return for lifelong reign over the K≈Çodzko region. This was influenced by the declaration of the new Polish king, Casimir III the Great, renouncing some of his claims over Silesia. Alliance with Poland, Hungary and the House of Wittelsbach Bolko II nonetheless continued his attempts at pursuing an alliance with Poland and Hungary against Bohemia. In order to enhance his international position, on 1 June 1338 Bolko II married Agnes (b. 1322 - d. 2 February 1392), daughter of Leopold I, and a member of the Habsburgs. The Habsburgs were among the chief rivals of the Luxembourgs and had recently fought over and won Austria and Styria. He gained some significant concessions, among them a trade agreement allowing merchants from his lands access to the Halych region. Eventually, on 1 January 1345, his mediation resulted in the official alliance between the Wittelsbachs, Poland and Hungary. War of King Casimir III of Poland against Bohemia (1345‚Äì1348) Soon afterwards, King Casimir III (The Great) of Poland used this new alliance in his favor. The Polish King imprisoned King John's eldest son and heir Charles, Margrave of Moravia (future Holy Roman Emperor). King John in turn responded by invading Bolko II's lands, and the Polish and Hungarian Kings declared war. This allowed Bolko II to push back the now divided Bohemian forces during the siege of ≈öwidnica. However, the Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV quickly signed a temporary truce with the Bohemian King. The war continue with varying fortunes for the combatants, with no major successes for either of the parties. On the ≈öwidnica side, Bolko II lost the fortress in Kamienna G√≥ra in 1345, but recaptured it in 1348, using subterfuge and disguising his troops as merchants. Bolko II Maly (≈öWIDNICKI) - picture, coat of arms, biography in form of a timeline, and other trivia The war ended in a draw. King John didn't live to see the end of it; he died in 1346, in a different war, at the Battle of Cr√©cy. The Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV died one year later. On 22 November 1348, the peace was signed in Namys≈Ç√≥w, although Bolko II, for unknown reasons, didn't take part in those negotiations, and was instead represented by King Casimir III. The final normalization of the relations between Bolko II and the new Holy Roman Emperor and German King Charles IV (also King of Bohemia after he succeeded his father) only occurred as a result of the mediation of Duke Albert II of Austria on 16 August 1350. Settlement with Charles IV of Luxembourg (1353) After the signing of the treaty of 1350, Bolko II began the process of rapprochement with the House of Luxembourg. This was done without sacrificing his good relations with the Kings Casimir III of Poland and Louis I of Hungary. By 1346, after the death of his last surviving uncle, Duke Henry I of Jawor, Bolko II inherited his domains, the Duchies of Jawor and Lw√≥wek. Soon before, Bolko II's younger brother and co-ruler Henry II died, leaving only one daughter, Anna. Bolko II, as the closest male relative, became Anna's legal guardian and began to consider his niece as heiress to all his lands. On 13 December 1350, 11-year-old Anna and the then 11-month-old Wenceslaus, eldest son and heir of Emperor Charles IV, were betrothed. Under the terms of the engagement contract, the couple would inherit Bolko II's lands in the (likely) case of his heirless death (however, it was stipulated that they could only take formal possession of the duchies after the death of Bolko II's wife Agnes of Austria, who, under her husband's will, received his domains as her ). However, fifteen days later, on 28 December, the young Wenceslaus died and the settlement was broken. Nevertheless, the emperor decided not to abandon his intentions to take control in a peaceful way over Bolko II's heritage. The death of his second wife Anna of Bavaria, mother of the late Wenceslaus, on 2 February 1353 gave him a new opportunity to obtain the Duchies; almost immediately, he asked Bolko II for the hand of his niece in marriage and the former agreement was renewed. The wedding took place in Buda, Hungary (where Anna had lived with her mother since the death of her father) on 27 May 1353. Besides Bolko II, the wedding was attended by: Duke Albert II of Austria, King Louis I of Hungary, Margrave Louis VI of Brandenburg, Duke Rudolf I of Saxe-Wittenberg (Bolko II's stepfather) and envoys of King Casimir III of Poland and the Republic of Venice. On 28 July, Anna was crowned Queen of Bohemia in Prague by Archbishop Arno≈°t of Pardubice. On 9 February 1354, in Aachen, she was crowned German Queen. As part of Charles IV's coronation as Holy Roman Emperor in the Roman Basilica of Saint Peter on 5 April 1355, Anne was crowned Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. She thereby became the first Queen of Bohemia to become Empress. Cooperation with Emperor Charles IV and expansion of Bolko II's domains The politics of close cooperation with Charles IV of Luxemburg brought the Duke of ≈öwidnica considerable benefits, especially in the expansion of his frontiers. Due to the prosperity of his domains, Bolko II bought much land from less prosperous Dukes of Silesia. In 1358 he bought the gold mine in Z≈Çoty Stok, and half of Brzeg and O≈Çawa from Duke Wenceslaus I of Legnica; soon after, he also bought half of ≈öcinawa from Duke Jan. In 1359 the Emperor allowed him to buy territories near the Bohemian border, including Frydlant, and shortly after Bolko II also bought the town of Siewierz from the Dukes of Cieszyn for the amount of 2,300 fines. In 1360, Bolko II bought KƒÖty Wroc≈Çawskie In the same year his good relations with the Emperor were demonstrated when, after almost thirty years, the rights of Przemko II's widow Constance over the half of G≈Çog√≥w were finally accepted. G≈Çog√≥w had been under Bohemian control (the other half was given to the Dukes of ≈ªaga≈Ñ in 1349). One year later, in 1361, Constance (who had been a nun since the death of her husband) renounced her domains on to her husband's brother Bolko II. The Emperor, increasingly sure he would gain the property back, was now willing to pass it to his putative father-in-law. Bolko II's biggest asset, however, proved to be the acquisition, together with the Emperor on 14 April 1364, of the large town and lands near ≈Åu≈ºyce for the enormous sum of 21,000 fine silver, which became one of the most important and prestigious of his possessions.

Its first issue was published on February 2, 1923.  History  Before the Times Mirror Company, then-owners of The Baltimore Sun, purchased The Aegis in 1986, it was known as The Aegis & Intelligencer. In 1923, then-owner John D. Worthington, Sr. simplified its name to The Aegis. The name \\"Aegis\\" originally derived from Greek mythology and is a reference to Zeus' shield, meant to \\"evoke protection for the interests of Harford residents\\" as well as the founding paper's Southern sympathies. Since 1923, The Aegis has gone through several name changes. From March 16, 1951 to January 9, 1964, the paper was known as The Aegis and Harford Gazette. From January 16, 1964 to September 18, 1969, it was named The Aegis, the Harford Gazette and the Democratic Ledger. Finally, on September 25, 1969, its original name of The Aegis was restored, and it is published under this name to this day as a sister paper to The Baltimore Sun. The first building built specifically to house The Aegis was constructed in 1871, at 119 S. Main Street in Bel Air, Maryland. In 1962 the paper moved to a larger facility on Hays Street.  Notable figures  William Robert Wallis, known to most as \\"Robbie,\\" started out on a pre-law track at the University of Baltimore, but was convinced to join The Aegis in 1952 by John D. Worthington II as the paper's first sports editor. He worked for The Aegis for 38 years and was managing editor of the paper by the time of his retirement in 1990. Robert was well known in Bel Air and active in numerous state and local organizations, even serving for 11 years as a member of the Maryland Stadium Authority. The Worthington family played a huge role in shaping the newspaper throughout its history, beginning with John D. Worthington Sr. who purchased the paper in 1904. Expanding with each successive generation, The Aegis stayed in the hands of the Worthingtons until 2010, when John D. Worthington IV retired, ending his family's 105-year ownership of the paper. He had been at the helm since 1973, surviving two purchases of the paper: one by the Times Mirror in 1986 and another by the Tribune Media Company in 2000.

Early in 1987 they changed their name to The Dubrovniks in acknowledgement to the birthplace of two founding members, Roddy Radalj, and Boris Sujdovic. Dubrovnik is a town in Croatia. Both Radalj and fellow founder James Baker had previously founded Hoodoo Gurus (as Le Hoodoo Gurus) in 1981. All three had earlier associations in the Perth punk scene of the late 1970s. The group issued four albums, Dubrovnik Blues (August 1989), Audio Sonic Love Affair (September 1990), Chrome (June 1992), and Medicine Wheel (1994), before disbanding in 1995.  History  The Dubrovniks were established in August 1986 as The Adorable Ones with the line up of James Baker on drums (ex-The Victims, The Scientists, Hoodoo Gurus, Beasts of Bourbon, James Baker Experience); Roddy Radalj on guitar and vocals (ex-Exterminators, The Scientists, Rockets, Le Hoodoo Gurus, The Johnnys, Love Rodeo, James Baker Experience); Peter Simpson on guitar and vocals (ex-Teeny Weenies, Super K, Spectre's Revenge, Hoi Polloi); and Boris Sujdovic on bass guitar (ex- Exterminators, The Scientists, Rockets, Beasts of Bourbon). Early in the next year The Adorable Ones renamed themselves as The Dubrovniks to honour the birthplace of Radalj and Sujdovic ‚Äì the historical Croatian city of Dubrovnik. They had to change their name due to a Brisbane band of that name. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described their sound as \\"clattering, yet accessible rock'n'roll was drawn along the lines of The Troggs meets T-Rex by way of New York Dolls\\". Citadel Records issued the group's debut single, \\"Fireball of Love\\", in April 1988. It was produced by Rob Younger (Lime Spiders, Died Pretty, The Stems). Their second single was a cover version of Alvin Stardust's \\"My Coo Ca Choo\\" in November. A third single, \\"Speedway Girls\\" appeared in June 1989, followed by their debut album, Dubrovnik Blues, in August. It was produced by Chris Masuak for Timberyard Records. By that time Radalj had left and formed a new band, The Punjabbers, with Brett Ford on drums (ex-Kryptonics, Lubricated Goat); Tony Robertson on bass guitar (ex-The Hitmen, New Christs, Naked Lunch); and Tony Thewlis on guitar (ex-Helicopters, The Scientists). Chris Flynn on guitar and vocals (ex-Headstones) replaced Radalj and the band signed to Mushroom Records. The band's first album on Mushroom, Audio Sonic Love Affair appeared in September 1990. It was produced by Kevin Shirley (Hoodoo Gurus, The Angels, Cold Chisel) and was preceded by the single, \\"She Got no Love\\" in June. Another single, \\"Love Is on the Loose\\", followed in October. In between albums, Baker and Sujdovic toured and recorded with Beasts of Bourbon. In early 1991 they severed their commitments to that group to concentrate on The Dubrovniks. Also in that year Glenn Armstrong (ex- Horny Toads, The Girlies) replaced Simpson on guitar. The band issued their third album, Chrome in June 1992, which was also produced by Shirley. The album provided two singles, \\"Saigon Rose\\" (February 1992) and \\"French Revolution\\" (June). McFarlane noted that both albums with Mushroom \\"maintained the revved-up, trashy rock'n'roll tradition\\". However, Mushroom dropped the group in 1993. German label, Normal, issued their fourth album, Medicine Wheel in Europe, while Mushroom Distribution Services (MDS) distributed it in Australia. The Dubrovniks broke up in 1995. Afterwards Baker returned to Perth, where he joined a power pop band, Satellite 5. Flynn and Sujdovic formed a new band, Black Dirt, together with Chris Collins and Paul Loughhead. The Dubrovniks reformed in 2015 to play a series of shows in Australia, Greece, Spain and Austria.

After its original airing, the film (which serves as the pilot episode of the TaleSpin series) was split up into four parts which were treated as episodes of the series itself, but with severe edits. This four- part version first aired from Monday, November 19 through Thursday, November 22, 1990 (airing one part per day for four days). The episodes are available on the Disney+ streaming service as episodes 34 - 37. Plot Part 1 The series opens with Don Karnage and his band of air pirates hijacking and boarding a plane owned by Shere Khan to steal a box containing something that the pirates want. However, after Karnage and his men return with the box to their mothership, the Iron Vulture, a young bear-cub named Kit Cloudkicker steals the box and then leads the pirates through a chase sequence that results in him jumping off the ship and cloud-surfing out of the area with his trusty airfoil, hitching a ride over to a tavern owned by Louie, wherein he hides the box. Karnage and his men bust in, and Kit annoys them some more before escaping and following customer Baloo, who allows him to ride in his cargo plane, which he has named the Sea Duck. The air pirates give chase, with Baloo not understanding why they are after him. However, he manages to elude them by flying to the city of Cape Suzette, where the air pirates cannot enter because the people working the cliff guns (which are anti-aircraft artillery pieces) keep shooting at them. Having eluded the pirates, Baloo takes Kit to his company headquarters building (a shack equipped with a dock) for his air cargo business called \\"Baloo's Air Service,\\" which is in trouble because he never bothers to pay his overdue bills. Baloo believes in only working when he feels he has to, and he considers making Kit his navigator. Kit explains that he has to get back to Louie's, but Baloo is not in the mood to go back to the bar so soon. Then a man from the Cape Suzette National Bank shows up to tell Baloo that since he is so far behind on his bills, his plane is going to be repossessed. Baloo is desperate for a way to prevent that, so he accepts Kit's idea of taking a $3,000 job, promising that he will take him to Louie's the next day if he helps him. However, the job he takes is a zoo delivery of gorilla-birds, large ostrich-like birds that are extremely hard to control. As they are struggling to deliver the gorilla-birds, the air pirates attack them again, this time causing Baloo to come in for a rough landing. At this point, Baloo realizes the pirates are after Kit and demands to know what the pirates want with him, but Kit reacts by storming off. Then Baloo discovers that the gorilla-birds have escaped and ran off. Kit goes hacking through the jungle, only to be captured by Karnage, who ties him upside-down to a tree, demanding to know where the box is. Baloo has, in the meantime, gone looking for the gorilla-birds, and just when he has caught them all, he overhears Karnage tormenting Kit. To rescue him, he reluctantly lets the gorilla-birds loose and has them distract the pirates while he saves Kit. They make their way over a pack of alligators to get back to the Sea Duck and take off. As they fly off, Kit admits that he has hidden a large jewel at Louie's, and Baloo realizes that with a jewel like that, he could buy back the Sea Duck. Part 2 The next morning, Baloo and Kit meet their service's new owner, Rebecca Cunningham, who says she is going to turn this failing business into a real moneymaker. Rebecca says that Baloo will have to pay her $50,000 to reclaim the Sea Duck, but until then, he is her staff pilot. Baloo reluctantly agrees to this, because he can get to Louie's this way. When the business's mechanic Wildcat demonstrates his mechanical skills, Rebecca is impressed and remarks that at least something about this business works. Afterwards, Rebecca has the business's name changed to \\"Higher for Hire\\" (because she thinks it sounds cuter), makes Baloo and Kit wear silly-looking uniforms, and has the Sea Duck covered in a clownish paint job. She then sends Baloo and Kit to go deliver mangos, but no sooner do they get out of her sight, they ditch their uniforms and try to head off for Louie's. However, her daughter Molly has stowed away, and she is willing to tell her mother about their plan to go to Louie's if they do not allow her to come along. Thus they go ahead and bring Molly with them to Louie's. Once there, Baloo and Kit find the jewel, but after Louie examines it he tells them that it is not a real jewel, and therefore it is worthless. However, when Kit mentions that Don Karnage had stolen it from Shere Khan, Baloo takes another look at it, only to have it shock him, making him decide that the jewel might be valuable after all. Just as they are leaving, the air pirates come back to attack. After a lengthy chase sequence, Baloo and Kit manage to throw the pirates off course by dumping the mangos on them. When they return to Higher for Hire, Rebecca is furious that they jettisoned the cargo and does not believe that it was because they were attacked by pirates until Molly defends them and admits that she sneaked onto the plane. The next morning, before paying a visit to Khan Industries, Baloo and Kit hide the jewel in Molly's doll, Lucy, figuring that it would be wiser to find out how much Shere Khan is willing to pay for its return before they actually return it. After Baloo and Kit arrive at Khan's office, Khan explains to them that the stone is actually an electrical alloy developed by his scientists, and he is offering $100,000 for its return. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Baloo and Kit, Don Karnage sneaks into Higher for Hire accompanied by Dumptruck and Mad Dog, looking for Baloo's plane. When Baloo and Kit return to Higher for Hire, they find that the pirates have ransacked the place and have kidnapped Rebecca and Molly, leaving behind a ransom note demanding that they be given the stone. Part 3 Kit feels that it is his own fault for the kidnapping, and as he helps Baloo find his way to Pirate Island, he confesses the story of his past. Until recently, he was an air pirate himself, but after about a year with Karnage and his men, he got sick of it and rebelled against them by taking the electrical stone and fleeing from them. Baloo sympathizes for him. While that is going on, Karnage and his men hijack another one of Shere Khan's planes, but they only steal seemingly worthless and useless items. As Baloo and Kit land in the volcanic Pirate Island, Rebecca seduces the prison guard into letting them out by saying she will give him the deed of ownership of the Sea Duck if he promises to let them go free. The guard agrees to this, but just as he gets the keys, Baloo knocks him out and takes the deed, then lets Rebecca and Molly out. Just then, Karnage and his men return, and Baloo and company are forced to hide from the pirates' sight. Upon his return, Karnage reveals the master weapon he has been working on building using the junk they have stolen ‚Äì a lightning gun, with which, he says, they will use to plunder Cape Suzette. He then sings a catchy song about what it means to be air pirates, during which Baloo and company try to sneak past disguised as other pirates, only to have Baloo foolishly try to prolong the song, blowing their cover in the process. To cover their escape, Kit pretends to rejoin the pirates and gives them the stone, but his acting angers Baloo, who believes it to be true. Baloo, Rebecca, and Molly make their escape not knowing that Kit was faking his betrayal, but the pirates are right behind. With the pirate fighters unshakable, Baloo turns on an overdrive function in the Sea Duck that allows them to get away very fast. Upon returning to Cape Suzette, they are suddenly snatched by Shere Khan's men, who bring them to Khan himself who is anxious to recover his stone. Rebecca has no clue about what the stone is, so Khan has his scientist Dr. Debolt explain it: The \\"stone\\" is a \\"sub-electron amplifier,\\" a one-of-a-kind creation that can generate limitless electrical energy and is powerful enough to run Khan's entire corporation. Khan chastises Baloo for not retrieving the stone as promised, and Baloo responds by complaining about everyone who is in the room with him. Back at Higher for Hire, Baloo packs his bags into the Sea Duck, which he buys back from Rebecca by paying her with a bag of gold dust that he had taken from the pirates earlier. Rebecca and Molly, though, do not want him to leave, partly because they do not believe that Kit has really gone bad. Part 4 Karnage and his pirates load the lightning gun onto the Iron Vulture and make their way towards Cape Suzette. In the city, Rebecca goes looking for new cargo pilots and planes. In Khan's office tower, Dr. Debolt informs Khan of the possibility that Karnage has created a lightning gun, but Khan does not believe it until he sees and hears an explosion coming from the cliff guns. He calls up the air field to combat this menace, but they are no match for the machine. On board the Iron Vulture, Karnage announces to the citizens that he and his men are now going to plunder the city. However, Kit snatches the stone and runs off with it, taking refuge in a radio room. There, he calls a Mayday to nearby pilots to let Baloo know what is happening to the city and that he never really double-crossed Baloo. Over at Louie's, Baloo is enjoying himself when a pilot runs in telling him that he has got a message from \\"Little Britches.\\" When Baloo hears Kit's message over Louie's transmission radio, he realizes he was wrong and that Kit never betrayed him, so he jumps back into the Sea Duck and activates the plane's overdrive again in order to arrive in Cape Suzette in time to rescue Kit. Back on board the Iron Vulture, Kit tries to escape on his airfoil again, only to be snatched up by Dumptruck and have his airfoil broken by Karnage. Karnage, furious that Kit lied to him and continues to insult him, orders Dumptruck to drop Kit out of the ship to his death, but Baloo comes to the rescue just in time, burning out his overdrive in the process. They hide under a bridge in order to deter Karnage from looking for them. Afterwards, Baloo radios Higher for Hire to say that they are coming back. In spite of Baloo's suggestions, Rebecca refuses to leave the city, and then states that she knows how to combat Karnage's lightning gun - coat the Sea Duck with an armor of rubber materials. After doing this, she joins Baloo and Kit for the ride, because they have armored the plane with her tires. When Karnage hears Baloo and Kit taunting him on his radio, he orders his men to blow them up, but just as specified, the rubberized Sea Duck is unaffected by the lightning gun. Karnage tries sending his men out in their fighter-planes to chase the Sea Duck, but they all end up getting wrecked along the way. Baloo then reluctantly rams the Sea Duck right into the lightning gun, sending it, and the stone that powers it, crashing into the bay where it explodes due to contact with water, creating a tsunami. With the pirates' primary weapon destroyed, reinforcements of Khan's air force attack them which forces them to retreat from Cape Suzette. Baloo and company wash up on shore and survive, but the Sea Duck is practically destroyed. A week later, the Sea Duck is repaired, but since Rebecca paid for its repairs, she owns it again, so now Baloo is again stuck as her staff pilot. This time, however, he accepts the job with less reluctance than before, saying it is only until he is able to buy it back again. The whole group takes an enjoyable flight through the skies in the restored Sea Duck, celebrating their new lives together. Cast * Ed Gilbert as Baloo * R. J.

Like with the Darkwing Duck pilot episode Darkly Dawns the Duck, these scenes were not restored when the pilot was released on the TaleSpin: Volume 1 DVD set on August 29, 2006. However, most of these edited scenes do appear in the four- issue comic book adaptation.Weiss, Bobbi J.G.

Among the scenes that were cut are the following: * When he breaks into Louie's, Karnage sees a drink on the table, downs it, and complements, \\"You always serve such tasty drinks, Louie!\\" * When discussing the job of delivering gorilla-birds, Baloo offers to take Kit to Louie's tomorrow if he will help Baloo. * After Kit apologizes, \\"I'm sorry about your plane,\\" Baloo replies, \\"Hey, don't worry.

Furthermore, some scenes were altered rather than cut, and there were also some scenes that were not in the TV-movie version but were added to the four-part version (for example, the scene where Baloo and Kit square-dance with two air pirates before knocking them out by slamming them into each other). When TaleSpin began reruns on The Disney Channel in 1995, Plunder & Lightning experienced even more cut scenes which remained absent during its reruns on The Disney Channel and Toon Disney, but unlike the earlier cuts, these scenes were restored in the TaleSpin: Volume 1 DVD release. Some examples of these later cut scenes are the following: * When Louie walks up to Karnage, the pirate shoves his sword in his face. This edit is made obvious by the jump in the soundtrack. * When Karnage and his pirates are chasing the Sea Duck, Karnage says, \\"This is no time for a Chinese fire drill!\\" Comic book adaptation Plunder & Lightning was adapted into a four- issue limited series comic called \\"Take Off,\\" which was published one issue per month between January and April 1991 by the Disney subsidiary W. D. Publications, Inc. as part of their Disney Comics line.

Admissions The ACE Academy mainly serves children aged 11‚Äì16 years for KS3 and 16‚Äì18 for Sixth Form. Pupils who mainly live in the Great Bridge, Tibbington, Horseley Heath and Tipton Green areas of the town attend the school. It is situated on Alexandra Road (B4517) towards Toll End (and West Bromwich) and near the crossroads with Church Lane (B4163) and the fire station. It is about a mile from the A41/A461 roundabout at Great Bridge, and about a half-mile north of Dudley Port railway station. History Grammar school The school was opened in 1927 as Tipton Central School. It served the local area as a grammar school for boys and girls, and its title was soon altered to Tipton County Grammar School, situated on Alexandra Road. It was administered by the South-West Divisional Executive of Staffordshire Education Committee (based in Dudley), then West Bromwich Education Committee with around 700 boys and girls. The buildings were expanded in 1962 to include a new school hall, kitchen, dining hall, swimming pool, gymnasium and Science classrooms. This building was demolished in the mid-1990s following further extensions to the site. Comprehensive Tipton Grammar merged with nearby Park Lane Secondary School in Queens Road in September 1969 and became a comprehensive school. It took the title of Alexandra High School at this time. 'O' Level and 'A' Level pupils were educated at the original site in Alexandra Road, while the younger pupils mostly attended the Park Lane buildings (which dated back to 1904). New buildings were added to the Alexandra Road site at the beginning of the 1980s, giving younger pupils a chance to have three days a week at the main site, although they still used the Park Lane site twice a week until it closed in July 1990, being demolished the following year. Since September 1990, the school has also lost its popularity with children living in the Tipton Green area of the town, with a significant percentage of children in this area selecting Dormston School or High Arcal School in Sedgley as their destination for secondary school following the reduction in the Dudley borough's secondary transfer age from 12 to 11, bringing it into line with Sandwell and the rest of the region. A new sixth form centre was built in 1995 and the early 1980s extensions were demolished in 2011 to make way for new classrooms. Academy The school converted to academy status on 1 March 2013, and was reopened by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex as The ACE Academy. The school is sponsored by the University of Wolverhamptons Education Central Multi Academy Trust. Academic performance In 2006, 25% of GCSE students attained 5 grades at 'C' or above. This placed the school at 13th out of 18 schools in Sandwell. By 2009, it had progressed further with 38% of pupils achieving similar results, placing it as joint eighth of the 17 schools in the borough. This is well under the England average, similar to most schools in Sandwell: only two schools get GCSE results above average. At A level, results are low, similar again to most schools in Sandwell that offer A levels.

It is a station on the Dublin to Waterford intercity route.http://www.irishrail.ie/index.jsp?p=119&n;=147 Irish Rail Printable Timetables and was given the name MacDonagh on 10 April 1966 in commemoration of Thomas MacDonagh, one of the executed leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916. It is on a short spur off the main railway line, at a distance of approximately 4.5 km from the Lavistown Loop Line. This requires trains to exit the station in the same direction from which they entered. This meant shunting the locomotive from one end of the train to the other. Today the use of IE 22000 Class railcars has eliminated the need for this procedure. Previous station The station opened on 12 May 1848 as the terminus of the Waterford and Kilkenny Railway. On 14 November 1850 the Irish South-Eastern Railway connection to Carlow was opened, which branched off at Lavistown. In 1867 the line from Waterford was extended from Kilkenny to Portlaoise (formerly Maryborough). This line closed in 1962. A branch line from Kilkenny to Castlecomer was opened in 1919 and closed on 1 January 1963. The old station can be seen at the bottom of the platforms, facing north. There were 3 platforms: 2 through, and 1 bay facing Waterford/Dublin via Carlow. The two through tracks carried on over a bridge, onwards to Maryborough (Now Portlaoise) or Castlecomer. This allowed running of trains from Dublin to Waterford without the need for a runaround. However, when many rural lines in the Irish Railway network shut down, the station reverted to its current state. The old Building had separate waiting-rooms for Ladies and Gentlemen and an underpass to the island platform. Formerly, locomotives could run around here, although since 2011 this is not possible any more. Present day In 2011 the tracks northwest of the two platforms were lifted, and a connection between the two platforms was built across them. This provides level access to Platform 2, creating a layout similar to Howth railway station and abolishing the runaround facility. The footbridge, formerly the only connection between the platforms, was difficult to climb during cold weather.

Their period of greatest popularity in the Netherlands was from 1965‚Äì67, but they released records until 1969. In recent years their legacy has extended beyond the Netherlands, and the group is today recognized as a distinctive exemplars of the garage rock genre. Career overview Wally Tax during a TV performance of The Outsiders in 1968 Featuring Wally Tax (vocals), Ronnie Splinter (guitar), Appie Rammers (bass guitar), Tom Krabbendam (guitar), Leendert \\"Buzz\\" Busch (drums), and Frank Beek (bass guitar 1968-1969), the band exemplified the \\"Nederbeat Sound\\", a raw, Dutch take on rock 'n' roll created in the wake of the 1960s British Invasion. Unlike the many European bands influenced by The Beatles, The Outsiders took their cues from harder-edged British groups like The Pretty Things (who frequently toured the Netherlands) and The Rolling Stones. In March 26,1966, in 's-Hertogenbosch, The Outsiders opened for Stones' second Dutch concert. The Outsiders released three full-length records, Outsiders and the singles collection Songbook in 1967, and C.Q. in 1968. The latter sold poorly upon release but is now considered a masterpiece of psychedelic garage rock. The band also released thirteen singles, including 1967's \\"Summer Is Here,\\" which reached the Top Ten on the Dutch charts. Their eponymous debut album, which featured one side of studio recordings and another taken from their live show, also sold well during this period. Unusually for this era, the band never recorded any covers. While several Dutch pop groups of the era ‚Äî namely Tee Set (\\"Ma Belle Amie\\"), Shocking Blue (\\"Venus\\"), and the George Baker Selection (\\"Little Green Bag\\") ‚Äî all had hits in the United States on the Colossus label, resulting in what some music pundits jokingly called the \\"Dutch Invasion,\\" the Outsiders were unable to join in on this success as their records were never released in the U.S. The final year, reunion After the summer of '67, many of the Nederbeat bands fell from commercial favor, including The Outsiders. Later, Outsiders singles had lower chart peaks, and personnel changes, friction, poor promotion and management problems followed. Experiments and changes in musical style, though critically well-regarded today, only served to alienate the band's fanbase. The group began attempting publicity stunts in the hopes of building interest. These included dressing in medieval costumes, and staging a haircut for lead singer Wally Tax on Dutch television. By autumn of 1969, Ronnie Splinter quit music for a while. The band disbanded, with Tax and Busch forming Tax Free, in the early 1970s, in U.S., where they recorded one album. A reunion tour of the four original Outsiders took place in October 1997. Wally Tax died in 2005. Legacy The Outsiders are the subject of an official biography, Outsiders voor Insiders (1997), written in Dutch by Jerome Blanes; the English version Outsiders by Insiders was published in December 2009 by Misty Lane Books in Italy. Two collections of photographs, The Outsiders Picture Book, Volume 1 and The Outsiders Picture Book, Volume 2 and two scrapbooks with articles have also been published. Reportedly, Kurt Cobain was a fan of the Outsiders and made an unsuccessful attempt to meet Wally Tax. When the Clash first formed they called themselves the Outsiders. A friend then showed them a record by the Outsiders, and they changed their name to the Clash.

Biography He was born in Bergamo to an artist father, Domenico Ghislandi. Initially he entered the studio of Giacomo Cotta, then Bartolomeo Bianchi, and finally the studio of Sebastiano Bombelli in Venice of the 1690s. He also reported trained with the German portrait artist Salomon Adler in Milan. In 1702, he entered the religious life in the Order of the Minims of the Monastery of Galgario, in Bergamo. He assumed the name of the saint for whom the monastery is named. He was elected a member of the Milanese Accademia Clementina in 1717. He is said to blend the attention to colorism and glamour that captivates Renaissance-Baroque portraiture of Venice, with the realism of Milanese art such as that of Moroni.

Willock appeared in 181 films and television series from 1939 to 1989. Biography Born in 1909, Willock began his professional career in vaudeville in 1931, teaming with his boyhood friend Jack Carson in a comedy song and dance routine. For a time in the mid-1930s he was a reporter and editor for a Milwaukee newspaper. He first appeared on screen in Good Girls Go to Paris (1939), in an uncredited bit part. He teamed with Carson again when Carson invited him to write for his radio show; Willock wrote and played the part of Carson's nephew Tugwell on The Jack Carson Show from 1943‚Äì1949. Willock and Cliff Arquette had their own radio and television shows in the early 1950s. Both versions were called Dave and Charley; the radio version was heard circa 1950, but the television version of it was on the air for only three months in early 1952. In the 1961‚Äì1962 season, he played Harvey Clayton, father of the 1920s teenager Margie Clayton, portrayed by Cynthia Pepper in ABC's Margie. He appeared on an episode of Dragnet as an ex-vaudevillean who is cheated out of $9,000 that he found on a sidewalk. In 1966, he had an uncredited role as the bartender in the Elvis Presley vehicle Frankie and Johnny. Willock is probably most familiar to modern audiences from his performance as Baby Jane Hudson's father in the opening scenes of the cult classic What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962). He appeared in a two episodes of The Cara Williams Show with Cara Williams in 1964 and 1965 and played seven different characters on CBS's Green Acres with Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor, mostly portraying clerks or elevator operators.

She is from The Bronx, New York.  All That  After Tricia Dickson, Katrina Johnson and Alisa Reyes left All That, the producers brought in Danny Tamberelli, Leon Frierson, and Christy Knowings. Knowings had previously been a performer on a Rosie O'Donnell sketch-comedy special produced by Nickelodeon entitled, And Now This. She and her twin brother, actor Chris Knowings, were in the Rosie O'Donnell special greenroom, unaware that two casting directors from All That were in the room. Chris told Christy to do her impressions and accents. The casting directors asked Christy to audition, which she did, and she got the job. Knowings remained on the show until the end of Season 6 in 2000. Her characters included Penny Lane (inheriting the role from Alisa Reyes, who herself had inherited the role from Angelique Bates), the dental assistant for Dr. Bynes, Lieutenant Fondue, Jessica from Whateverrr!!!, Yoko from CJ and the Cloudy Knights, and Winter Wonders from What Do You Do? What Do You Do? was a parody of the Nickelodeon game show Figure It Out, and Winter Wonders was a parody of Summer Sanders. Knowings herself was a panelist a few times on Figure It Out. Life after All That Knowings made a small cameo in the green room for the show's 10th Anniversary Special. She made three episode appearances on Sesame Street, alongside her real-life twin brother Chris Knowings.

It was replaced in 1966 by the Interstate 480 girder bridge.  History  Originally called the Douglas Street Bridge, the bridge was built by the Omaha and Council Bluffs Street Railway Company in 1888 at a cost of $500,000. It was designed to handle streetcars and replaced a ferry service that had opened in 1854. It was originally built as a single bridge. Due to increased demand, they built a twin sister bridge next to the existing one. It was the Lincoln Highway bridge from 1913 to 1930. (Notice the L for Lincoln Highway in the picture.) It was then the Highway 30 bridge, then Highway 30A, then Highway 30 S until its destruction.  Tolls  It was a toll bridge. As automobiles became more popular, there were resentments about the tolls. In 1895, a group of businessmen formed the \\"Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben\\" (\\"Nebraska\\" spelled backward). In 1938, they sold bonds to finance the purchase of the bridge for $2,350,000. They continued to charge tolls until 1947, at which point the bonds were paid off and the structure, along with the South Omaha Bridge, became free bridges. The hated toll booths were paraded through Omaha before a crowd of 35,000 observers to celebrate Free Bridge Day on September 24, 1947. The estimated traffic on the bridge doubled the following year.  Replacement and Removal  It was replaced in November 1966 with an unnamed I-480 girder bridge (I-480 was to go on and be named the \\"Gerald R. Ford Freeway\\" after the native son President). Attempts were made to salvage the bridge as a pedestrian walkway, but it was demolished in 1968 although the east pier remains in the river just south of the interstate on the Council Bluffs side. U.S. Route 6 overlaps the interstate to cross the river. See also *List of crossings of the Missouri River References External links *\\"Douglas Street Bridge\\", Omaha Public Library.

Woodward, Inc. was founded as The Woodward Governor Company by Amos Woodward in 1870. Initially, the company made controls for waterwheels (first patent No. 103,813), and then moved to hydro turbines. In the 1920s and 1930s, Woodward began designing controls for diesel and other reciprocating engines and for industrial turbines. Also in the 1930s, Woodward developed a governor for variable-pitch aircraft propellers. Woodward parts were notably used in the GE engine on United States military's first turbine- powered aircraft. Starting in the 1950s, Woodward began designing electronic controls, first analog and then digital units. Historical information The company was founded in Rockford, Illinois, in 1870 with Amos W. Woodward's invention of a non compensating mechanical waterwheel governor (U.S. patent No. 103,813). Thirty years later, his son Elmer patented the first successful mechanical compensating governor for hydraulic turbines (U.S. patent No. 583,527). In 1933, the company expanded its product line to include diesel engine controls (U.S. patent No. 2,039,507) and aircraft propeller governors (British patent No. 470,284). Woodward governors followed the rapid advancement of diesel engine applications for railroads, maritime and electrical generation in many fields. The advent of gas turbine engines for aircraft and industrial uses offered still more opportunities for Woodward designed fuel controls. And, of course, the science of electronics has added impetus to this industry. Elmer E. Woodward conceived, designed, and developed the first successful propeller control in 1933. This model PW-34 propeller governor is on display at the Udvar-Hazy annex of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

It is a station on the Dublin Connolly to Longford commuter service and Dublin to Sligo Intercity Service. Passengers change at Maynooth to travel to stations on the Dublin to Maynooth and Dublin to M3 Parkway commuter services. Description A water tower exists at the Mullingar end of the station, which is now disused. There is also a passing loop. Although no stations now exist between here and Mullingar, a passing loop remains in use at Killucan, between Enfield and Mullingar. Within Enfield railway station, there are two Porter's Houses, owned by Cravens and McDonalds. The two houses are owned by the families and leased to C.I.E. The McDonald family worked at Enfield railway station within the signal cabin, the Craven family come from a long tradition of families that worked on the railway and built coaches that ran on the railway. History The railway reached Enfield in 1847, when the Midland Great Western Railway opened between Broadstone Station in Dublin and Enfield railway station (opened on 28 June 1847). Upon the opening of the railway, canal boats ceased all passenger traffic between Dublin and Enfield. Passengers travelling west used the train to Enfield and transferred to the canal in the town. Both the canal and the railway having stop over points in Enfield, this contributed to the development of the area. The line was extended to Hill of Down by the end of 1847 and to Mullingar in October 1848. In 1877, a branch line from Nesbitt Junction (about west of Enfield) to Edenderry was opened. The Edenderry branch line and Enfield station closed in 1963, although there had been no regular passenger service to Edenderry since 1931. Passenger services from Enfield resumed in 1988. A park and ride facility was opened in 2009.

The game was first released in South Korea, but an English version was released on April 14, 2010 by WeMade Entertainment titled Digimon Battle, which ran for 3 years. The South Korean version still runs to this day. Game Basics Players control an avatar of one of the four main characters of Digimon Tamers: Takato Matsuki, Rika Nonaka, Henry Wong, and Jeri Katou. The players are not intended to be representing the actual characters, and thus are allowed to choose their own name and modify their appearance to some extent. Players then choose a \\"starter Digimon.\\" The starter Digimon selected is one of the three used by Takato, Rika, and Henry in Tamers: Gigimon, Gummymon, or Viximon. In addition, different starter Digimon are sometimes offered during special events. So far, events have offered DemiVeemon, Hopmon, Yaamon, Dorimon, and a Digimon Savers- themed Koromon. Regardless, the player chooses a starter Digimon, which they use in battle to obtain stronger Digimon and accomplish NPC-given missions. Over the course of the game, starter and captured Digimon will digivolve into stronger forms with more powerful attacks. Capturing Digimon alt=Inside a large, brightly lit convention center room with white walls is positioned a promotional display booth for a video game. A saleswoman clad in a blue shirt and skirt and a red bowtie motions towards several illustrations on the booth, explaining their implications. The illustrations are anime-styled and depict several outlandish and brightly colored creatures. Three men in dark jackets watch the demonstration. Most Digimon begin at In-Training and generally are able to digivolve to either Ultimate or Mega Level. Only In-Training Digimon can be captured. During battle, the player has three tries to capture a Digimon, via the \\"capture\\" option in the in-game interface. Battle thumb Battling is done in a turn based style. The player does not directly fight in battle. Instead, a Digimon chosen by the player as his or her \\"main\\" Digimon fights in their stead. Each Digimon has a time bar that goes up over the course of the battle. When the time bar fills, the Tamer may take action with that Digimon, such as attacking, fleeing, or using items to recover health. In battle, the player is only directly able to use card items to temporarily alter their Digimon's stats, induce digivolution, or switch in other Digimon they own. A tamer can only use 3 cards at a time, and are limited to a certain number of card uses per battle. Cards are bought in-game or traded with other players. English version In early 2010, WeMade Entertainment signed a contract with Digitalic allowing them to release Digimon RPG along with its currently-in-development sequel, Digimon Masters. Originally Digitalic had signed a contract with CDC Games, however the contract was cancelled. Digimon Battle is the English version of the Korean Digimon RPG, which was originally scheduled to be released sometime in 2009 by CDC Games. An open beta was released, with Korean MMO developer and service provider \\"WeMade Entertainment\\" handling its operation, and the game was officially released April 14, 2010. On March 27, 2013, WeMade announced Digimon Battle would be closed on 25 April 2013. Development Kevin Seo, CEO of WeMade, looked to comments from fans for inspiration when creating the English adaptation. From May 19 to June 2, players could level up their characters as quickly as possible and train five of their Digimon to the Mega stage, both in order to win prizes. Also, a \\"Mystery Box\\" containing randomly generated items was set during this time to appear more frequently than normal in the \\"Sky Dungeon\\" area.

The central portion of the current building dates to 1834, when the then-standing mill, a grist mill, was rebuilt to also perform the carding and fulling of wool. The foundation of this portion, which houses traces of the old water power works, is of 18th century origin. In 1934, the mill was converted into a machine shop by the Martin Machine Company, which operated here into the 1980s. In 1987 Jim Murphy and Allen Ross purchased the property and turned it into the bookmill. They built a deck overlooking the Sawmill River. In the building with The Montague Bookmill were restaurants, including The Blue Heron, and other specialty stores and cafes throughout the years, including The Sawmill River Arts Gallery which is a collective of fifteen local artists and celebrating its 10th year in 2020.

Responsibility for internal security may range from police to paramilitary forces, and in exceptional circumstances, the military itself. Threats to internal security Threats to the general peace may range from low-level civil disorder, large scale violence, or even an armed insurgency. Threats to internal security may be directed at either the state's citizens, or the organs and infrastructure of the state itself, and may range from petty crime, serious organized crime, political or industrial unrest, or even domestic terrorism. Foreign powers may also act as a threat to internal security, by either committing or sponsoring terrorism or rebellion, without actually declaring war. Governmental responsibility for internal security will generally rest with an interior ministry, as opposed to a defence ministry. Depending on the state, a state's internal security will be maintained by either the ordinary police or more militarised security forces (known as Gendarmerie or, literally, the Internal Troops.). Other specialized internal security agencies may exist to augment these main forces, such as border guards, special police units, or aspects of the state's intelligence agencies. In some states, internal security may be the primary responsibility of a secret police force. The level of authorized force used by agencies and forces responsible for maintaining internal security might range from unarmed police to fully armed paramilitary organizations, or employ some level of less-lethal weaponry in between. For violent situations, internal security forces may contain some element of military type equipment such as non-military armored vehicles. Justice aspects Depending on the organization of the state, internal security forces may have jurisdiction on national or federal levels. As the concept of internal security refers to the entity of the state and its citizens, persons who are threats to internal security may be designated as an enemy of the state or enemy of the people. Persons detained by internal security forces may either be dealt with by the normal criminal justice system, or for more serious crimes against internal security such as treason, they may face special measures such as secret trials. In times of extreme unrest, internal security actions may include measures such as internment (detention without trial). Relationship with the military Depending on the nature of the specific state's form of government, enforcing internal security will generally not be carried out by a country's military forces, whose primary role is external defense, except in times of extreme unrest or other state of emergency, short of civil war. Often, military involvement in internal security is explicitly prohibited, or is restricted to authorized military aid to the civil power as part of the principle of civilian control of the military. Military special forces units may in some cases be put under the temporary command of civilian powers, for special internal security situations such as counter terrorism operations.

History The station opened on 2 October 1848. The Midland Great Western Railway line to Mullingar from Dublin opened in stages from 1846 to 1848, arriving in Mullingar on 2 October 1848. This was to a temporary station, adjacent to the greyhound stadium. The original main line ran from Dublin (Broadstone) to Galway via Mullingar and Athlone, the Mullingar to Galway section opening in August 1851. The present station opened with the branch line to Longford on 14 December 1855. There were two secondary stations in Mullingar. Canal Crossing cattle bank was on the Sligo Line and on the Athlone Line, Newbrook racecourse had its own station. This was unique in that it was a two platformed station with both platforms on the Down Line. Mullingar to Athlone Line There was a railway line to Athlone but it is now disused. It was part of the Midland Great Western Railway Dublin to Galway inter-city rail service. In 2006, calls were made for the line to Athlone (via Moate) to be reopened to facilitate more services between Galway and Dublin.

Biography Gras was born into a farming family and went to secondary school at the college of Sainte Garde, in Saint Didier. He studied law as a clerk to the notary Jules Gi√©ia in Avignon, later becoming a notary himself, but also enthusiastically attended poetry meetings where he read his first poems. Soon abandoning his law training, Gras published Li Carbouni√© (The Charcoal-burners), a rustic epic poem in twelve cantos, in 1876, noted for its \\"elemental passion\\" and scenic descriptions, for which he gained immediate recognition. In 1879, he married the niece of Joseph Roumanille, the husband of his sister Rose Ana√Øs. His next work, Toloza, an epic poem about the invasion of the Albigenses by Simon de Montfort, came in 1882, to further acclaim. He produced a volume of short poems, Li Roumancero Provengal, in 1887, followed by a collection of prose stories, La Paplino, in 1891. In 1891 (succeeding Joseph Roumanille), Gras was elected 3rd Capoulie (president) of Le F√©libre Rouge, a literary and cultural association founded by Fr√©d√©ric Mistral (1st Capoulie) and other Proven√ßal writers to defend and promote the Proven√ßal language and Proven√ßal literature. He held this post until his death. Gras achieved popular success in 1896 with the novel Li Rouge dou Miejour, which was translated into French as Les Rouges du Midi (Reds of the South). It was praised by former British Prime Minister Gladstone, and was subsequently published in several other languages. He then wrote a trilogy of tales dealing with the late period of the French Revolution with Li Rouge d√≥u Miejour (The Reds of the Midi), La Terrour (The Terror) and La Terrour Blanco (The White Terror, which features Napoleon as a character).Baker, Ernest A., A Guide to Historical Fiction.

She has published more than a dozen novels, seven short story collections, and several non-fiction titles, including a reference book on feminism, Encyclopedia of Feminism (1986). She has also edited several anthologies and reviewed books for various publications. She has been living in the United Kingdom since 1981. Tuttle won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1974, received the 1982 Nebula Award for Best Short Story for \\"The Bone Flute\\", which she refused, and the 1989 BSFA Award for Short Fiction for \\"In Translation\\". Writing career Lisa Tuttle began writing when she attended The Kinkaid School in Piney Point Village, Texas. At the Mirabeau B. Lamar Senior High School in Houston she was active in science fiction fandom, and founded and edited the Houston Science Fiction Society's fanzine, Mathom. At Syracuse University in New York, she wrote for the university's fanzine Tomorrow And‚Ä¶, plus several alternative newspapers. In 1971 Tuttle attended the Clarion Writer's Workshop, running that year at Tulane University in New Orleans, after which she sold her first short story, \\"Stranger in the House\\", which appeared in 1972 in Clarion II, an anthology edited by Robin Wilson. In 1974 Tuttle received a BA degree in English Literature and moved to Austin, Texas where she worked as a journalist for five years at the Austin American-Statesman, a daily newspaper. In 1973 Tuttle and several other science fiction writers, including Howard Waldrop, Steven Utley and Bruce Sterling, founded the Turkey City Writer's Workshop in Austin, Texas, and in 1974 she was joint winner of the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer with Spider Robinson. Tuttle collaborated with author and screenwriter George R. R. Martin on a novella, The Storms of Windhaven that was nominated for a Hugo Award in 1976. Tuttle and Martin later expanded the novella into a novel, Windhaven, which was published in 1981. Over the next 25 years Tuttle wrote a number science fiction and fantasy novels, including Lost Futures (1992), which was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke and James Tiptree, Jr. Awards. She has also written young adult fiction and published several titles, including Catwitch (with illustrator Una Woodruff) (1983), Panther in Argyll (1996) and Love-on-Line (1998). She has written under different shared house pen names with other authors for series of books. In 1987 she wrote the Casualty novelization Megan's Story under the name Laura Waring, Virgo: Snake Inside for a series of twelve young-adult books called Horrorscopes (1995) under the house pseudonym of Maria Palmer (although it was later reissued under her own name), and was a contributing author to Ben M. Baglio's Dolphin Diaries (2000‚Äì2002), a young-adult series of books, writing the first 8 books in the series, which were published as by Ben M. Baglio in the US and as by Lucy Daniels in the UK. In addition to fiction, Tuttle has written non-fiction, including the Encyclopedia of Feminism (1986) and Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction (2002). As editor she has compiled several anthologies, including Skin of the Soul: New Horror Stories by Women (1990), and Crossing the Border: Tales of Erotic Ambiguity (1998), the latter covering the topic of genderbending. Tuttle's fiction often focuses on gender issues and includes \\"strong-willed women\\" who question their identities. British author David V. Barrett wrote that her stories are \\"emotionally uncomfortable\\", and that \\"they not only make you think, they make you feel\\". Her science fiction works have been associated with feminist science fiction, and The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English said that many of her stories use elements of science fiction and horror to \\"dramatize aspects of the human, and specifically the female, condition\\". It described The Pillow Friend as her \\"most satisfactory\\" novel, saying that it \\"trades more on ambiguities in its use of imaginary friends, phantom pregnancies and edible boyfriends\\". Tuttle has taught writing at several institutions, including Clarion West and the Citylit College in London. She has also reviewed books for The Sunday Times. In 1989 Tuttle received the BSFA Award for Short Fiction for \\"In Translation\\". Her short story, \\"Replacements\\" was adapted for an episode of the Canadian horror TV series, The Hunger in 1999, and another story of hers, \\"Community Property\\" was the subject of a 2005 French short film, Propri√©t√© commune.

Martin, 2012 In 1982, Tuttle became the first and only person to refuse a Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Nebula Award.Clute and Nicholls 1995, pp. 860, 1247. Her short story, \\"The Bone Flute\\", which had been published in May 1981 in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Short Story in early 1982. She had objected to another nominee in this category, George Guthridge, sending his story \\"The Quiet\\", to SFWA members. Although this practice is now generally accepted, at that time it was seldom considered. SFWA had no rules about it. Tuttle wrote a letter to the Awards director Frank Catalano requesting that her story be withdrawn, saying, \\"I don't approve of this kind of campaigning\\". But \\"The Bone Flute\\" was chosen as the best short story before Catalano received Tuttle's letter, and when she was notified that she was the winner, she responded saying that she would not be accepting the award because she had withdrawn the story from the competition. Tuttle said that she would not be attending the awards ceremony on April 24, 1982, and requested that the reason for her refusal be given at the event. However, on April 29, 1982, Tuttle was contacted by Pocket Books editor John Douglas, who told her that he had received her award on her behalf. No mention had been made at the ceremony of her refusal to accept the award. Later, George R. R. Martin, with whom Tuttle had collaborated on Windhaven, wrote an open letter to the SFWA in which he said that, while he did not necessarily agree with Tuttle's decision to refuse the award, he objected to the way the organization handled her refusal. Martin wrote: \\"She has made a difficult and considerable sacrifice on grounds of principle, and [...] I feel very strongly that she had a right to be heard.\\" In the wake of the controversy, Guthridge stopped writing for a decade, and stopped writing science fiction entirely. When asked in an interview in 2003 whether she regretted declining the Nebula Award, Tuttle said, \\"I think my main regret is that people may assume that I object to awards on principle, and never nominate anything by me for anything again! I would love to win some awards, especially ones with money attached ...\\" Personal life In the early 1970s, Tuttle was in a relationship with fellow science-fiction/fantasy author George R. R. Martin, with whom she co-wrote Windhaven. Tuttle lived with Steven Utley for several years before moving in January 1981 from the United States to London, England, where she married British writer Christopher Priest.Clute and Nicholls 1995, p. 1246. After the marriage ended in 1987, she relocated to Torinturk in rural Scotland in 1990, where she currently lives with her second husband, editor Colin Murray, and their daughter, Emily.

Founded by singer/songwriter/producer and television and film composer Siddhartha Khosla, the group has since received critical acclaim for its debut album Tally of the Yes Men (Tally), and second album And The Elephant is Dancing. The band released its third full-length, Aerogramme, on August 20, 2013. History The Los Angeles-based band Goldspot is named after the fizzy drink Gold Spot. According to an interview with Siddhartha Khosla (the band's core member), the drink was very popular back in India at the time. After a live performance on DJ Nic Harcourt's KCRW show, the band soon began playing shows across Los Angeles in venues like The Troubadour and Hotel Cafe. Harcourt championed the band, hailing them as his \\"favorite band of 2005\\", and began playing tracks from Tally of the Yes Men in heavy rotation (\\"Rewind\\", \\"Time Bomb\\", and \\"Friday\\").Virgin Radio Goldspot Biography The band was founded by singer/songwriter Siddhartha Khosla. From 2005 to 2007, the band lineup consisted of Ramy Antoun (drums), Sergio Andrade (bass), Seth McLain (guitars, keys and backing vocals) and Derek Horst (guitars and backing vocals). The band signed a record deal in 2005 with a start-up, independent label Union Records, with distribution through ADA. Thanks to KCRW's heavy airplay they were able to sell 10,000 copies of their debut Tally of the Yes Men. Tally was co-produced by Jeff Peters and Goldspot. Respected radio stations KEXP and WTMD, along with other indie radio stations across the country, began to play the record in constant rotation. Eventually, the band signed a deal with major record label Mercury Records (Universal Music Group) in the United Kingdom. An alternate version of Tally was released in the UK in June 2007, featuring A. R. Rahman's Bollywood Orchestra, and received plaudits from UK press like Q magazine, the Sunday Times, and The Guardian.MySpace.com - Goldspot - Los Angeles, US - Indie / Alternative / Rock - www.myspace.com/goldspot The Sunday Times hailed Goldspot as \\"the best band to come out of America in years\\".

It ruled that Britain would not trade with neutral nations who were also trading with the enemy. The rule was devised and approved by the British Admiralty courts, which maintained that if a neutral nation were prohibited from a particular type of trade during peacetime, then it would also be prohibited from the same variety during wartime. The rationale behind this rule was that the neutral nation was aiding the enemy. The rule has never been ratified by international law.\\"France: Decrees on Trade 1793-1810.\\" The rule was one of the causes of the War of 1812.Max Savelle, Empires to Nations: Expansion in America, 1713-1824, p.141 (1974) Contents During the Seven Years' War, France and Britain initially fought over disputed North American colonies.Schumann and Schweizer, p. 4. The war became both a naval and economic battle, spreading throughout French and British colonies around the world. The Rule of 1756 was created to hinder all French trade to its West Indies colonies. In 1757 the London Chronicle estimated that French West Indies trade had fallen by 70% since the opening of hostilities.London Chronicle, vol. 1, no. 3 (6 Jan. 1757), p. 24b. This 70% drop in trade was triggered by British privateering of French ships. France was not able to supply its West Indies colonies due to Britain's naval superiority and lock on trade routes. The French government in Versailles proposed that French goods be carried on neutral ships from the United Provinces or Spain. French goods would be able to reach their intended destinations and the neutral nation would benefit from participating in the exclusive market.Schumann and Schweizer, p. 105. France was forced to remove the trade monopoly it had with its colonies and allowed other nations to supply them with goods. In 1758 the Rule of 1756 was amended to eliminate the loophole France had discovered. The Rule of 1756 was adjusted to its modern form permitting the privateering of all ships carrying French goods. British privateers received permission to act even more aggressively at sea and were granted permission to conduct searches of neutral vessels.Schumann and Schweitzer, p. 105. Effect on War of 1812 In the years leading up to the War of 1812, France and Britain were at war. Tensions between these two European countries had arisen following the French Revolution. In 1805 the antiquated Rule of 1756 would be reinstated by Britain. American shippers had been taking advantage of the hostilities in Europe. American ports were used as a stopping point while shipping goods to French and Spanish islands in the West Indies.Infoplease, \\"War of 1812: Causes of the War.\\" By stopping at an American port, the Americans could evade seizure under the Rule of 1756. Britain noticed this loophole and amended the Rule of 1756 with the Essex Case. In doing so, British seizure of American ships greatly increased.Infoplease, \\"War of 1812: Causes of the War.\\" This heightened seizure put a real strain on Anglo-American relations and was a significant factor contributing to the War of 1812. France countered the Essex Case by creating its own version of the law, called the Berlin Decree.Walton and Rockoff, p. 154. The Berlin Decree and Essex Case resulted in the seizure of nearly 1,500 American ships.Walton and Rockoff, p. 154.

Dark Queen is the nemesis of the protagonistic Battletoads. She is a mysterious master of evil magic and the supreme commander of a space army bent on galactic conquest. The character has received considerable attention due to her sex appeal as well as for being one of the first major female villains in video games. Appearances The immortal Dark Queen is the ultimate enemy to the Battletoads, as she attempts to eliminate the 'Toads and Professor T. Bird in order to stop them from hindering her plans to rule the universe. She is depicted as a sinisterily beautiful woman with raven big hair who shows off a voluptuous body clad in a dominatrix-style black leotard with thigh boots. Throughout the games there have been several inconsistencies regarding her actual size. Even though her height is stated to be 6 feet (182 cm) tall on her profile screen in the arcade game (which would mean she is actually smaller than the Battletoads), she normally appears to be of a tremendous size in the games, usually roughly four times the height of the 'Toads. Her shifting size may however be an effect of her magic. Throughout the series she usually appears to taunt the 'Toads during the cutscenes; despite her royal stature, she prefers to be no more cultured than the Battletoads themselves, due to the crude nature of her speech which consists primarily of surfer slang and offensive puns (such as calling them \\"cattle-loads\\" and \\"wartfeatures\\"). She leads a renegade army consisting primarily of anthropomorphic pigs and rats is usually fought as the end boss of the game. Her main sidekicks are initially Big Blag, General Vermin and Robo-Manus, later joined by General Slaughter, Karnath and Admiral Oink. In Battletoads games The Dark Queen is introduced in the first Battletoads game. In it, following her defeat by the Galactic Corporation at the Battle of Canis Major, she and her remaining forces have escaped to hide in the planet Ragnarok's World \\"in dark spaces between the stars.\\" As Professor T. Bird and the Battletoads Rash, Zitz and Pimple are escorting the Princess Angelica, daughter of the Terran Emperor, the Dark Queen (disguised as a belly dancer) suddenly strikes and kidnaps the Princess along with Pimple (or Rash and Pimple in the Game Boy version), taking them away in the enormous spaceship Gargantua to the planet Armagedda (Ragnarok's World). The other two Battletoads go after her to rescue the captives and eventually confront the Dark Queen at her Tower of Shadows. During the final boss fight, she only has one special move besides basic kicks, spinning until turning into a tornado and then attempting to hit the player (how much damage is done to the player is based on how fast she is spinning). After her defeat, the Dark Queen flees into space, \\"retreating into the shadowy margins of the galaxy to recoup her losses.\\" In Battletoads in Battlemaniacs, the returning Dark Queen has partnered with the vengeful computer engineer Silas Volkmire to kidnap Zitz and Michiko Tashoku, the daughter of the President of the Psicone Corporation, creators of the computer-generated portal Gamescape, intending to transform the entire world into Gamescape Kingdom over which they would rule together.\\"Batletoads Preview\\", GamePro July 1993, p.24. In this game, she is wearing a red cape and wielding a snake-themed staff. The other two 'Toads showdown with the Dark Queen again, this time at her Dark Tower, During the boss fight, she teleports and attacks the players with magical projectiles from staff. After her defeat, she flees again \\"to the outer reaches of the Universe,\\" vowing revenge. In the crossover game Battletoads & Double Dragon, the Dark Queen teams up with the Shadow Boss, a Double Dragon universe character created specially for this game. Together, they use a mysterious energy beam from outer space to render Earth's military might powerless and use a giant spaceship called the Colossus to take over the Earth. The Battletoads join up with Billy and Jimmy Lee, otherwise known as the Double Dragons, to once again foil her plans. In this game, she is capable of transforming into a flame and moving across the floor, remaining untouchable by doing so, and can also attack by emerging from the flame and tossing fireballs. Once \\"beaten and humbled,\\" she makes her escape into space, promising to return. The Dark Queen comes back to antagonize the Battletoads in the largely plot-less Battletoads Arcade. In it, she was \\"sexed up a bit for the allegedly more mature arcade crowd,\\" having her erect nipples visible through her outfit and a breast bounce effect. An in-game portrait also shows her hair spread out in a fashion much like Medusa's. During the gameplay parts, she only appears as a holographic projection in the third stage, where she is watching the boss fight between the 'Toads and Scuzz's Robo-Rat. Her design was inspired by Cassandra Peterson's character Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. The Dark Queen was planned to be also featured in a planned Battletoads fighting game, but Rare ended up creating Killer Instinct instead. She returns in the 2020 Battletoads reboot, albeit in a radically redesigned, desexualized appearance. Other appearances The Dark Queen also appears in the Battletoads tie-in comic printed in Nintendo Power, and in the games' abortive cartoon adaptation of which only the pilot episode was produced. The Xbox One version of Shovel Knight hints at possibility that this game's villain the Enchantress might be actually a form of the Dark Queen. A San Diego Comic-Con 2015-exclusive Battletoads compilation vinyl soundtrack with music by David Wise features a Dark Queen artwork drawn by Vice Magazine art editor Nick Gazin and she was also featured in the musical trailer \\"Rare Replay Opening Number\\". Reception The Dark Queen was well received by critics upon her introduction, having been twice nominated by Nintendo Power for the Nintendo Power Awards in the category villain of the year for 1991 and 1993.Nintendo Power #34 (March 1992).Nintendo Power #60 (March 1994). Dark Queen was included on UGO's 2008 list of the top 50 evil women in all media, and on Geek World's list of the greatest villains of the 8-bit era. In 2011, Complex ranked her as tenth on the list of \\"most diabolical video game she-villains\\" while Universo Online ranked her ninth on the list of ten most beautiful and deadly game villainesses. Ryan Bates of Game Revolution placed her fourth on his 2014 list of top \\"mean girls in gaming\\", stating that \\"though the Dark Queen is often noted for her sex appeal, she was one of the first antagonists to set the bar for villainesses in video games,\\" having \\"showcased she can be as cruel and calculating as the men.\\" The Dark Queen particularly contrasted with Nintendo's Princess Peach, as, according to 64 Magazine, \\"in this game, the token female wasn't some bland princess pleading for rescue, but instead a leather clad dominatrix embarked on world domination.\\" Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi called the Dark Queen the \\"breakdown character\\", noting that \\"in a time where princesses and queens were there to be kidnapped, the Dark Queen turned the depiction of video game matriarchy on its head and boldly declared that she'd be the one doing the kidnapping.\\" UGO similarly also commented how \\"female villains were quite rare in the early days of video games, with the fairer sex usually reserved as kidnapped princesses in another castle.\\" According to UGO, \\"not only was the Dark Queen revolutionary, she was also dead sexy - possibly the hottest babe of the 8-bit era\\". UGO editors commented that the Battletoads series is \\"notorious for its insanely high difficulty, juvenile sense of humor and big-boobed antagonist\\" and adding that \\"the anger we felt at losing was only compounded by how hot and unattainable the Dark Queen was.\\" Both Seanbaby and Geek World declared her the sexiest NES game character. GamesRadar's Jim Sterling featured her in a 2011 retrospective article featuring the sexy video game women of the sprite era. Nerdist described the Dark Queen as a \\"sexed-up, dominatrix version of Natasha Fatale from Rocky & Bullwinkle.\\" Others compared her to Jessica Rabbit and Scylla the witch from Hugo,Game Senior issue 5 page 19. in addition to Elvira. Jason F.C. Clarke of Topless Robot stated she \\"rivals Sins Elexis Sinclaire and Soulcaliburs Ivy for sheer cleavage\\"Jason F.C. Clarke, Ten Video Games that Should Have Gotten Toys, Topless Robot, December 3, 2012. and Hardcore Gaming 101 described her as \\"basically a sexy Shredder\\". Gawker commented on the short-lived Battletoads cartoon how \\"Shredder had nothing on the Toads' sexy nemesis, the Dark Queen\\" and Meristation similarly stated that if they would have to choose between her and the Shredder there would be no contest. Complex noted that \\"where the TMNT had April O'Neil to flirt with, the most bodacious chick in the Battletoads universe is ironically the final boss who wants them all dead.\\" Previewing Battletoads in Battlemaniacs, GamePro praised the series' \\"cartoony, bizarre, radical style\\" and how the \\"gorgeous character sprites endow the 'Toads and their foes with personality and attitude,\\" noting \\"the Dark Queen definitely has more hex appeal than ever.\\"Slo Mo, \\"Super NES ProPreview: Battletoads in Battlemaniacs\\". GamePro issue 48 (July 1993). According to Charmaine Williams of WhatCulture, actually \\"the only thing [the cartoon] had going for it was the sexy Dark Queen. I guess if you think your show wont live to see a full season, might has well have a character with big boobs that lives in a penis shaped castle.\\" Rare Gamer included the Dark Queen in their lists of Top 5 Reasons We Still Love Battletoads, Top 5 Classic Rare Villains Who Just Didn't Know When To Quit, and Top 5 Rare Femme Fatales (That Would Have Us Switching Sides). Luke McKinney and Matthew Moffitt of Cracked.com wrote she has \\"helped [the young gamers] manipulate themselves, and was just as physically mutated as the giant talking animals.\\" Raze described her as \\"one bitch who deserves to die\\" and the original game's ending where the Battletoads \\"simply just allow her to escape\\" was included on the 2010 list of ten biggest ending letdowns in video game history by Danny Gallagher of SPIKE. Requesting an \\"awesome remake\\" of Battletoads, Brian Cullen of Maxim wrote that \\"we would rain hot, repressed justice all over our consoles, just for a chance to hate-fight the foxy, infuriating Dark Queen\\"; Sean Velasco, lead designer of 2012's Double Dragon remake Double Dragon Neon, said: \\"I wanna high five Zitz and punch the Dark Queen in the gut!\\" Alternatively, Gaming Nexus' Cyril Lachel stated: \\"Forget reviving the Battletoads, all I want is a game based on the Dark Queen!\\" References External links *Dark Queen at Giant Bomb Category:Battletoads characters Category:Female villains Category:Fictional characters who can change size Category:Fictional witches Category:Fictional pirates Category:Fictional warlords in video games Category:Microsoft antagonists Category:Queen characters in video games Category:Video game bosses Category:Video game characters in comics Category:Video game characters in television Category:Video game characters introduced in 1991 Category:Video game characters who can teleport Category:Video game characters who use magic Category:Video game characters with slowed ageing ","title":"Dark Queen"},{"id":"7198671","text":"Joseph-Alexandre Baile (19 April 1801 - 31 July 1888) was a Sulpician priest who was educated in France and came to Canada in 1825.

(') is a Spanish grassroots organization uniting individuals of various political positions against terrorism and violence, notably ETA, and against the proposal for a new Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country released by the government of President Juan Jos√© Ibarretxe. Its principal activities are anti-terror demonstrations and protests. The ¬°Basta Ya! movement is a civic initiative made up of people of differing ideologies, and welcomes any citizens willing to play an active part provided they adhere to three basic principles: defend against terrorism of any sort, regardless of origin or intensity, support all victims of terrorism or of political violence and defend the rule of law, the Spanish Constitution and the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country. ¬°Basta Ya! was created to promote social mobilization against the perpetrators of specific kinds of violence, to support those who are suffering from them, and to demand that authorities fulfill the requirements of current legislation, respecting the rule of law. The organization believes that criticism of terrorism on moral grounds is important but not enough. Criticism on political grounds is also important, and the initiative understands such criticism to be based on certain values ‚Äì such as human rights - which are common to all democrats regardless of their party affiliations or their political leanings. Main ideals The European Parliament describes the main ideals of ¬°Basta Ya! as the following:European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, Common Security and Defence Policy Notice to Members, 2000, No 16. * Clear and peaceful opposition to terrorism of any kind. * To provide support for all victims of terrorism and violence and to ensure that the perpetrators of these criminal acts are made responsible for their actions. * The right to hold views different from those of extreme and exclusive nationalists, without aggression, marginalization or discrimination of any kind. * That the democratic institutions in the Basque Country must fulfill their obligations and respect the rule of law. The ¬°Basta Ya! initiative is also critical of official nationalism. The group does not restrict itself to denouncing the erosion of the basic rights of many citizens, but also promotes various actions in defense of these rights.{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Sakharov Prize In 2000, the ¬°Basta Ya! movement won the Sakharov Prize, a prize awarded to defence of human rights and freedoms. The group was nominated for the Sakharov Prize in 2000 by Gerardo Galeote Quecedo, Jos√© Ignacio Salafranca and others. According to the European Parliament, they nominated for three distinct activities that the organization carried out in 2000. In February ¬°Basta Ya! organized a demonstration in San Sebasti√°n under the slogan \\"Por la libertad, ETA kampora\\" (\\"For freedom, ETA out\\"). This demonstration gathered more than 100,000 people.Peace Women Across the Globe, Maite Pagazaurtund√∫a. During this silent demonstration, one of the platform members invited Spanish citizens to support his cause as they stood at the Boulevard under the slogan \\"let's defend what join us together\\". The Initiative called for a demonstration in San Sebasti√°n under the slogan \\"Por la vida y la libertad. Defendamos lo que nos une: Estatuto y Constituci√≥n\\" (\\"For life and freedom. Let us defend what unites us: Statute and Constitution\\").European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, Common Security and Defence Policy Notice to Members, 2000, No 16 In June 2000, the Citizen's Initiative called for a mass meeting on the first Thursday of every month in San Sebasti√°n, in solidarity with all those citizens threatened and attacked because of their defense of democratic values. Well- known members of the platform are Jon Juaristi, Maite Pagazaurtundua, Arcadi Espada, Carmen Iglesias, Javier Urquizu and Fernando Savater. Structure ¬°Basta Ya! does not want to displace political parties, or compete against other civic and pacifist groups who share their aims. They all command respect and they have other fields of activity or other areas of representation than the initiative itself. To preserve as far as possible the open and pluralistic character of this initiative, it has decided to forgo a professional and hierarchical organization. ¬°Basta Ya! does not have a board of management; instead it appoints by common consent, whenever necessary, someone to act as the authorized spokesperson in public.{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Financing All the activities of ¬°Basta Ya! have been financed by the contributions of private citizens and by the \\"Miguel Angel Blanco Foundation's\\" subvention for the September demonstration for the defense of the Constitution and the Statute. Some other civic groups such as \\"The Gregorio Ordo√±ez Foundation\\", \\"White Hands\\" and \\"Denon Artean\\" have also helped the initiative in different ways. It now also has at its disposal the 50,000 Euros of the Sakharov Prize. End ¬°Basta Ya! wishes to be able to dissolve itself as soon as possible because it has become unnecessary. That is, because citizens of Spain are no longer running the risk of being assassinated or attacked because of their ideas or identities, and because the Rule of Law worked in a reasonable way, the organization can discontinue itself. ¬°Basta Ya! is determined to carry on functioning and calling on all citizens to mobilize whenever it seems necessary.

Former home of Plymouth City Airport (and formerly to RAF Roborough), Roborough lies just outside the northern boundary of the city of Plymouth on the main road to Tavistock, and is a popular dormitory village. The Lopes family, descendants of Jamaican-born Tory Member of Parliament and Baronet of Sephardic-Jewish Portuguese origin Sir Manasseh Masseh Lopes, 1st Baronet, lived in Roborough and acquired the title Baron Roborough in the twentieth century, after moving from nearby Maristow House on the River Tavy and before relocating to Gnaton, a smaller mansion on the coast near Noss Mayo. The very old village pub, which stands on the main street (long since bypassed by a modern dual carriageway) is called the Lopes Arms. One important son of Roborough is shoemaker and early trade unionist George Odger. After travelling to London in search of work, George became the first trades- unionist to stand for Parliament, the leader of the London Trades Council and the president of the First International Workingmen's Association, an historically important organisation of socialist, communist, anarchist and working-class activists in which Karl Marx played a prominent role. The Plymouth Argaum Rugby Club grounds are just east of the village. Part of Roborough Down, with the main bulk of Dartmoor behind Roborough Down is the name given to the long stretch of undulating moorland over which the road to Yelverton and Tavistock passes. It lies within Dartmoor National Park, but is owned by Lord Roborough's Maristow Estate. The down has a rich array of wildlife such as ravens, buzzards, foxes, deer and semi-wild ponies and its vegetation consists of pasture, gorse and bracken with frequent stands of hawthorn, oak and birch. However, the down's unique wildlife and environment is threatened by increasing deforestation and grazing pressure.

Born in Clivio, he entered the church of Milan young and was ordained a subdeacon while serving under the Archbishop Grossolano. Jordan replaces Grossolano He was appointed to Saint-Gilles, in Provence, France, to continue his education, as was typical for Milanese youths of his day. He was recalled in 1111 by Olrico da Corte, the vicedominus, and ordained a presbyter on 1 September by Ariald, Bishop of Genoa. The embattled Archbishop Grossolano travelled to the Holy Land, leaving Guazzone Comino and Amizone da Sala in charge with Arderic, Bishop of Lodi, as his acting vicar. On New Year's Day a council of equal numbers of supporters and opponents of the archbishop convened in his absence and, deposing him, elected Jordan to replace him. In February, Landulf, Bishop of Asti, consecrated the new archbishop to his post and, together with Ariald and Mainard, Bishop of Turin|Mainard of Turin, did homage to Jordan as his suffragans. Atto, Bishop of Acqui, and Arderic of Lodi refused to do homage to the new bishop and remained loyal to Grossolano. On 6 December, Mainard formally deposed Grossolano at the altar in S. Ambrogio. Jordan and Bernard, Bishop of Pavia, proclaimed a general peace throughout Lombardy, of which Jordan was now the primate. He received the recognition of Pope Paschal II, legitimising the irregularities of his election. Grossolano returns In August 1113, Grossolano returned from his pilgrimage. Tensions were raised in the city of Milan, where the old archbishop still had some supporters. Finally, on 11 March 1116, Paschal declared Grossolano's transferral from the see of Savona to that of Milan to be invalid and thus null. He was transferred back to Savona and Jordan was again confirmed as the legitimate Ambrosian pontiff. Milan Jordan was a staunch papist (later Guelph) and under him Milan was a centre of anti-imperial feeling. His episcopate saw the citizens of Milan grow in power. In 1116, they began electing consuls, with all secular powers that had been theretofore reserved for the bishops. In a solemn ceremony at S. Tecla, Jordan even excommunicated the reigning emperor, Henry V. Jordan interfered extensively in his suffragan diocese. He deposed Armanno da Gavardo from Brescia and made the elected Villanus, Bishop of Brescia|Villanus bishop there. He deposed Ugo da Noceto in Cremona and raised Oberto da Dovara in his place. He intervened in the episcopal succession to Como in 1118 and sparked a nine-year war between the cities of Milan and Como. In Spring 1120, he met the returning Pope Callistus II at Tortona (the pope had been visiting France). Jordan died in the fall of 1120 and was buried in his basilica. He was succeeded by Olrico, who had first recalled him from Provence. Sources *Landulf Iuniore di San Paolorem. Historia Mediolanensis. *Caravale, Mario (ed).

In contrast, a milkhemet reshut (◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊™ ◊®◊©◊ï◊™, \\"authorized war\\") is a discretionary war, which according to Jewish law requires the permission of a Sanhedrin. Unlike milkhemet reshut wars, which tended to be fought to expand territory or for economic reasons and had exemption clauses, milhemet mitzvah tended to be invoked in defensive wars, when vital interests were at risk. Applicability in modern times The categories of milhemet mitzvah and milhemet reshut were applied by the later rabbis to describe wars that place in earlier times, led by or against the kings of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The milhemet reshut has not been applied or used since then; because the Jewish people have neither a king nor universally recognized Sanhedrin, there is no religious authority to authorize a milhemet reshut. Notwithstanding, there is more than one description of the terms \\"Milhemet Mitzvah\\" and \\"Milhemet Reshut\\". According to the Jerusalem Talmud (4th-5th centuries), \\"Milhemet Reshut\\" is described as an offensive war, rather than a defensive war which is \\"Milhemet Mitzvah\\".Jerusalem Talmud, Sotah 8:10 (23a) The discussion over compulsory and permitted (or, perhaps, \\"optional\\") wars also applies to certain exemptions given to individuals within the ancient Israelite and Judean society: engaged men, those who have just completed to build their house and have not lived in it and those who have not yet plowed their field before the war. All of these exemptions are given only in the case of \\"Milhemet Reshut.\\" Talmud Scholars of both the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds discussed the nature of the wars commenced by the Israelites during the biblical era (Tanakh) generally tend to describe the conquest of the Land of Israel in the Book of Joshua as Mitzvah Wars, while the wars fought by King David were meant to expand his kingdom, hence regarded as discretionary wars.Babylonian Talmud, Sotah, Chapter 44, page b. Modern scholars also suggested that Mitzvah Wars originally signified a religious act.◊ê◊†◊¶◊ô◊ß◊ú◊ï◊§◊ì◊ô◊î ◊û◊ß◊®◊ê◊ô◊™, ◊û◊ï◊°◊ì ◊ë◊ô◊ê◊ú◊ô◊ß ◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù (1962). ◊¢◊ï◊®◊õ◊ô◊ù: ◊ë◊†◊ô◊û◊ô◊ü ◊û◊ñ◊®, ◊†◊§◊™◊ú◊ô ◊î◊®◊• ◊ò◊ï◊®-◊°◊ô◊†◊ô, ◊©◊û◊ï◊ê◊ú ◊ô◊ô◊ë◊ô◊ü, ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊®◊ë◊ô◊ü. ◊¢◊û' 1057-1064. ◊®◊ê◊î ◊í◊ù: ◊©◊ù, ◊¢◊û' 1061-1062, 1064-1065. ◊ú◊ì◊¢◊™◊ï ◊©◊ú ◊î◊ó◊ï◊ß◊® ◊§◊ï◊ü ◊®◊ê◊ì ◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊î◊ï◊©◊¢ ◊î◊ô◊†◊ü ◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊ï◊™ ◊î', ◊î◊ì ◊ß◊ì◊ï◊ù ◊ú◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊ï◊™ ◊ß◊ì◊ï◊©◊î ◊ë◊î◊ü ◊î◊¢◊ù ◊®◊ê◊î ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊î ◊õ◊ê◊ß◊ò ◊ì◊™◊ô ◊ï◊î◊†◊ô◊¶◊ó◊ï◊ü ◊î◊ï◊ê ◊û◊™◊™ ◊î◊ê◊ú. ◊î◊ô◊î ◊¶◊ï◊®◊ö ◊ú◊î◊°◊ë◊ô◊® ◊õ◊ô◊¶◊ì ◊©◊ë◊ò◊ô◊ù ◊†◊ï◊ì◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊î◊¶◊ú◊ô◊ó◊ï ◊ú◊í◊ë◊ï◊® ◊¢◊ú ◊ô◊©◊ï◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊û◊ë◊ï◊°◊°◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊¢◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊¶◊ï◊®◊ï◊™. Questions about the halakhic justification for war again arise in modern times in connection to military operations of, and service in, the Israel Defense Forces. To the extent that such operations are perceived to be self-defense, they are viewed as examples of milhemet mitzvah. Hence, the dispute over the terms with accordance to modern times coincides with the question what is Israel's role in the \\"Arab-Israeli Conflict\\". Many Israelis perceive the continuous sparks of violence as attempts to undermine the Jewish State, most Israelis may regard the modern wars as \\"Milhemet Mitzvah\\" defensive, and therefore, obligatory. On the other hand, large portions of the Israeli society are secular and do not think about the current conflict in these religious categories or use these historical terms.

Bennett (born January 17, 1940) is an American scientist and engineer, specializing in aerospace and energy. He has worked for NASA and the US Department of Energy (DOE) on advanced space power systems and advanced space propulsion systems. His professional career has included work on the Voyager, Galileo, and Ulysses space missions, and is currently working as a consultant in aerospace power and propulsion systems. He is also a science fiction author (The Star Sailors). Biography Bennett was born in Twin Falls, Idaho. He joined the NASA headquarters in June 1988 as the Manager of Advanced Space Power Systems in the transportation division of the Office of Advanced Concepts and Technology. There, he managed a number of transportation technology programs including hybrid propulsion, electric propulsion, low- thrust chemical propulsion, and other advanced propulsion concepts (e.g., fusion, antimatter). He was also the first program manager of the advanced technology insertion program for the Pluto Fast Flyby (now New Horizons) mission and the TIMED space physics mission. Prior to coming to NASA, Bennett held key positions in DoE's space radioisotope power program, including serving as Director of Safety and Nuclear Operations for the radioisotope power sources that were used on the Galileo mission to Jupiter and that are being used on the Ulysses mission to explore the polar regions of the Sun. This same radioisotope power source design was then flown on the Cassini mission to Saturn and on the New Horizons mission to Jupiter. Previous positions included Chief of the Research Support Branch in the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) where Bennett was instrumental in creating and managing NRC's reactor operational safety research program. Bennett was the flight safety manager for the radioisotope power sources currently in use on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft (which went to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and beyond) and on Lincoln Laboratory's LES 8 and LES 9 communications satellites. Bennett also worked as a physicist in the NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications) program at what was then NASA's Lewis Research Center (now the John H. Glenn Research Center) in Cleveland, Ohio. He did fundamental reactor safety research at what is now the Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory (INL). From 1980‚Äì1988, he was a member of or adviser to US delegations to the two subcommittees of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and he prepared the official US position papers on the use of nuclear power sources in outer space. From 1988‚Äì1990, Bennett chaired the Steering Group of the Interagency Advanced Power Group (IAPG), the national coordinating group for federally sponsored space and terrestrial power research. During his tenure and under his initiative the IAPG saw its greatest increase in membership. Bennett received his PhD in physics from Washington State University in 1970; a Master of Nuclear Science degree in 1966, and a BSc degree in physics from the University of Idaho in 1962; and an Associate of Arts degree from Boise Junior College (now Boise State University) in 1960. Since 1995, he has been active in promoting the teaching of science (specifically evolution) and received the Friend of Darwin Award. Bennett has also been a champion of the First Amendment and was elected to the National Advisory Council of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Selected works Bennett has authored or coauthored over 160 technical papers, reports and articles on power, propulsion, and space missions.

He played at representative level for England, and at club level in the Super League for Hull FC, Hull Kingston Rovers, and the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, and in the Championship 1 and Championship for Doncaster and Featherstone Rovers (Heritage ‚Ññ 1030), as a , or , and has coached rugby league (RL) for Doncaster, and the Leigh Centurions (Assistant Coach), and rugby union (RU) for the Doncaster Knights (Skills, and Backs Coach). Background Cooke was born in East Hull, Humberside. Career His pairing with Richard Horne led to the memorable victory over Leeds in the 2005 Challenge Cup Final in which Cooke scored the winning try to give Hull FC a 25‚Äì24 victory. Hull FC reached the 2006 Super League Grand final to be contested against St. Helens, and Cooke played in his side's 4‚Äì26 loss. On 22 July after being given a franchise for Super League from 2009 to 2011 Salford City Reds coach Shaun McRae said he would be interested in speaking to Cooke with an intention of him joining his side, Cooke and McRae worked together at Hull FC earlier in their careers, though Cooke did not go on to play for the Salford City Reds. On 19 April 2007, BBC Look North (East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire) announced that Paul Cooke was to walk out on Hull FC to join cross city rivals Hull Kingston Rovers. Cooke was born in East Hull where Hull Kingston Rovers are based and supported the club as a youngster. He played his last game for Hull FC against Bradford Bulls that night. The saga was based around Cooke's frustration at being on a lower wage than other established stars at Hull FC. Asking the board for a pay rise, the request was denied. With Hull FC refusing to increase his pay, Paul Cooke walked out on Hull FC and signed for Hull Kingston Rovers. On 23 April 2007, it was announced that Cooke had signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with Hull Kingston Rovers, taking effect immediately. The Rugby Football League (RFL) initially blocked this transferCooke secures switch to Hull KR BBC News ‚Äì 27 April 2007 stating that his registration remained with Hull FC. Some confusion followed amid allegations that he had never signed his contract with Hull FC, despite local media reports at the time to the contrary. However the move went ahead and he duly turned up playing for Hull Kingston Rovers the following week. In November 2007 a RFL tribunal found Cooke guilty of misconduct for approaching Hull Kingston Rovers while still under contract to Hull FC. His punishment included a ban that ruled him out of the first six games of the 2008 season. Following the tribunal decision Hull FC chief executive James Rule said \\"We will now take time to consider our next steps with regard to potential future civil action\\" suggesting the Cooke transfer saga may be far from over. However it appears to have died down, and by the end of the 2009 season Cooke had settled into the Hull Kingston Rovers team, making a major contribution to his team's next 2 Super League finishes of 7th and 4th. Wakefield Trinity Wildcats signed Paul Cooke from Hull Kingston Rovers until the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, the 28-year-old /, who made a controversial move from Hull FC to Hull Kingston Rovers in 2007, had been out of favour at Hull Kingston Rovers that season. Cooke made his d√©but with Wakefield Trinity Wildcats against Salford City Reds on Sunday 21 March 2010, and made his full d√©but in the 36‚Äì16 defeat at Warrington, and his first full home game when Wakefield Trinity Wildcats won 19‚Äì6 against neighbours Castleford Tigers. It was in that game when Wakefield Trinity Wildcats fans realised Cooke's true potential and part in the team. Cooke had the option to earn a deal for next season, whether that was at Wakefield Trinity Wildcats or another club. On 12 January 2012 Cooke signed for Championship 1 side Doncaster, after fans and sponsors agreed to pay half his salary. He combined playing for the club with a full-time job in their development department. He has also signed as a backs coach for Doncaster Knights, the town's rugby union club, for the 2013/14 season. Paul Cooke made his d√©but for Featherstone Rovers on Sunday 28 June 2015, and he played his last match for Featherstone Rovers during the 2015 season.

The name also refers to a widely scattered hamlet in the valley. Formerly the old township of Eglwysegl or Eglwysegle, the area is now best known for its dramatic rock formations and unspoiled historic landscape. Topography The former St Mary's church, beneath the tiered limestone crags of the Eglwyseg Rocks. The area is best known for the prominent limestone escarpment, the Eglwyseg Rocks, (, ), which runs north‚Äìsouth for around . The high point of the area is at on Mynydd Eglwyseg (Eglwyseg Mountain, ). Various parts of the escarpment have specific names; these include Craig y Forwyn, the Maiden's Rock, Craig Arthur (Arthur's Rock), Tair Naid y Gath (the Three Leaps of the Cat) and Craig y Cythraul (Devil's Rock). The Afon Eglwyseg (Eglwyseg River) flows through the valley, joined by a number of tributary streams such as the Nant Elli and Nant Craig y Moch. The head of the valley is known as World's End, and is a popular spot with walkers, cyclists and tourists. The lower end of the valley joins the Vale of Llangollen, the Eglwyseg River flowing into the River Dee near Pentrefelin. History The lower part of the Eglwyseg valley, near Hendre, showing its characteristic landscape of woods and steeply sloping pastures. The entire valley has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and Landscape of Special Historic Interest. The upland moors have several Bronze Age burial mounds, and there is evidence of agricultural use of the area from the Bronze Age onwards, with the higher pastures being used for summer grazing and the valleys for winter grazing and as arable land, the latter indicated by remaining lynchets.The Vale of Llangollen - Dinbren Llangollen Community, Denbighshire, and Llangollen Rural Community, Wrexham, Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust Historically, the crags have been quarried for limestone, and there are also several disused lead mines; the land use is currently a mixture of heather moorland managed for Black Grouse, improved sheep pasture and oak woodland, with conifer plantations dating from the second half of the twentieth century. In 2000 an insect infestation meant that the entire moorland was sprayed to kill off the insects. This was successful and soon after sheep were allowed to graze in the moorland. The ancient township of Eglwysegl (also spelt \\"Eglwysegle\\" or \\"Egloysegle\\", and the root of the modern name Eglwyseg) occupied part of the area. Some antiquaries, such as Edward Lhuyd and Thomas Pennant, speculated that it may have taken its name from Eliseg (Elisedd ap Gwylog), a historical king of Powys.\\"Additional Notes on Eglwyseg\\", Archaeologia cambrensis: the journal of the Cambrian Archeological Association, v.149, 1865, 369 It is, however, more likely that the name Eglwysegl was in fact derived from the Latin ecclesicula, a diminutive of ecclesia - a \\"churchlet or chapel\\".Fenton, R. Tours in Wales (1804-1813) Bedford Press for the Cambrian Arch√¶ological Association, 1917, p.134 The relatively remote area continued to be farmed under freehold tenure; Pennant alluded to this when, writing around 1778, he described the valley: > Long and narrow, bounded on the right by astonishing precipices, divided > into numberless parallel strata of white limestone, often giving birth to > vast yew-trees [...] this valley is chiefly inhabited (happily) by an > independent race of warm and wealthy yeomanry, undevoured as yet by the > great men of the country.Pennant, T. Tours in Wales: Volume 2, Wilkie and > Robinson, 1810, p.11 Ford across the river at World's End, beneath Craig y Forwyn A medieval church, perhaps the chapel referred to in the name Eglwysegl, was marked on Speed and Saxton's 17th-century maps of the valley, but it had disappeared by 1808. The school church of St Mary's, built on land donated by Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, was opened in 1871; it held its last service in 1985 and has now been converted to residential use.Llangollen - Schools , Llangollen Museum The valley also contained a nonconformist (Calvinistic Methodist) chapel, built in 1856, closed in 1930, and now ruinous. Until the early 20th century, when they were culverted, there were many fords across Eglwyseg's numerous streams (the road from Esclusham Mountain still fords the river at World's End), and there are also a number of 18th-century stone bridges. Folklore Eglwyseg was the setting for a popular legend of St. Collen, who was supposed to have killed a giantess called Cares y Bwlch, despite her call for aid from Arthur, another giant who had made his home in the Eglwyseg Rocks. The legend, related by Sabine Baring-Gould, was recorded at Corwen, amongst other localities.Baring-Gould, S. The Lives of the British Saints: The Saints of Wales, Cornwall and Irish Saints, Volume 2, p.160 The manor house of Plas Uchaf yn Eglwyseg was said to stand on the site of a hunting lodge belonging to Owain ap Cadwgan, a prince of Powys: a story related that it was the place to which Owain took Nest ferch Rhys, when he abducted her and her children from Gerald de Windsor, her husband, in 1109. There was also a local tradition that a Prince Llewelyn had once hidden in a cave in the rocks near Plas Uchaf (there were several Welsh princes of this name).Archaeologia cambrensis, 135 Plas Uchaf was later the home of John Jones Maesygarnedd, a prominent Republican in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and one of the regicides of Charles I. Today Creigiau Eglwyseg, where several nationally rare plants can be found. Offa's Dyke Path passes through the area, and Eglwyseg is also popular with rock climbers, with around 800 routes, both sport and traditional. Eglwyseg is one of the few sites where the Whitebeam Sorbus anglica is known to grow, and one of only three sites where the Welsh Hawkweed (Heiracium cambricum) has been recorded. The rare Limestone Oak Fern Gymnocarpium robertianum and Rigid Buckler-Fern Dryopteris submontana have also been recorded here.

It draws its title from the four concerti composed by Antonio Vivaldi. They, along with other Vivaldi compositions, comprise the musical score. The film spawned a short-lived CBS series in 1984 produced by Alda. Plot summary The story revolves around three upper middle-class married couples living in New York City who take vacations together during each of the seasons. After this pattern has been established, Nick leaves his wife of 21 years, Anne, during the Spring trip to the cabin, for a much younger woman, Ginny. He then proceeds to bring Ginny on the Summer, Fall, and Winter vacation trips. This causes the other two couples to be uncomfortable, feeling as if they have betrayed their good friend Anne. Characters *Jack Burroughs (Alan Alda). Jack is a lawyer and happily married to Kate. He enjoys asking deep and probing questions and then volunteering an answer. Jack is moralistic, expressing disapproval of Nick for leaving his wife. He competes with the more athletic Nick in dirtbike racing, soccer, and skiing. His friends and wife consider him too judgmental at times. Instead of keeping true feelings to themselves, Jack thinks it's better for everyone to clear the air, when some feelings could be better off hidden. *Kate Burroughs (Carol Burnett). Kate works as an editor for Fortune magazine. She suspects that her husband has fantasies of being worshipped by an attractive, younger woman the way Nick has. Since she comes across as well- organized and even perfect, Kate can feel invisible and neglected. *Nick Callan (Len Cariou). Nick is an insurance salesman and estate planner. He is bored with his wife Anne and divorces her. He admits to Jack that he wants a woman who can excite him. Ginny, a younger woman, begins joining him on seasonal vacations with the Burroughses and Zimmers. Although his four friends disapprove, Nick is happy. Ginny marries him and becomes pregnant with his child. *Danny Zimmer (Jack Weston). Danny is a dentist and married to Claudia. He shares with his male friends a passion for cooking and exotic dishes. He is oldest of the group and fears that he is approaching death. This has prompted diet changes and even irrational fears, like pressing strange elevator buttons. Danny can be quite cheap when it comes to money and often displays symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. *Claudia Zimmer (Rita Moreno). Claudia is an accomplished painter. She can be quite outspoken, even to the point of being insensitive to others. Whenever her candor is criticized, Claudia refuses to apologize and cites her heritage (\\"I'm Italian!\\"). She expresses the desire to feel in love the way Nick does with Ginny. After witnessing Nick and Ginny swim naked, Claudia and Danny try it themselves. *Anne Callan (Sandy Dennis). Anne is a housewife, mother, and aspiring photographer. She takes pleasure in taking photos of vegetables, much to Nick's chagrin. After being left for a younger woman, Anne falls into depression. She believes that both Kate and Claudia deserted her following her divorce. To break out of her rut, Anne attempts to try new (but unusual) things such as buying a snake and planning a vacation to Czechoslovakia. Eventually she is able to support herself as a magazine photographer (taking \\"pictures of people, not kumquats,\\" as Nick observes). *Ginny Newley (Bess Armstrong). Ginny begins a relationship with Nick after meeting him on a flight. She is attractive, bubbly, and a bit naive. She is in awe of the older Nick, whom she regards as quite accomplished. Although the Burroughses and Zimmers resent her as \\"the other woman,\\" they eventually accept her as a friend. Ginny defends Danny when the group mocks him for his irrational fears. Ginny marries Nick and she becomes pregnant with his child. *Beth Burroughs (Elizabeth Alda). Beth is the daughter of Jack and Kate. She attends college and is an excellent student. Noting her upbeat attitude, Danny observes that she \\"takes a real bite out of life.\\" Beth's relationship with Lisa, a classmate, has deteriorated at college. *Lisa Callan (Beatrice Alda). Lisa is the daughter of Nick and Anne. Her parents' divorce greatly affected her and caused her to become sullen, withdrawn, and isolated at school. Lisa confesses her unhappiness to her father, who is unable to cheer her up. Release The film had its premiere at the Denver International Film Festival on April 30, 1981 before opening May 22. Reception The Four Seasons was a critical and box office success. Produced on a budget of $6.5 million, the film grossed $50,427,646, making it the ninth highest-grossing film of 1981. It holds a 77% \\"Fresh\\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes from 13 reviews. The film also renewed interest in the Vivaldi concerti after which it was named and which its musical score included.

At the time of his election he was forty-one years old, one of the youngest bishops of his denomination. Episcopal election Bishop Wandabula was elected 27 May 2006 during a meeting of the Africa Central Conference of the U.M. Church, held on the campus of the Africa University in Mutare, Zimbabwe. He was elected on only the second ballot, receiving eighty-one percent of the vote of the delegates assembled. \\"This was a great and historic event for the church, and you could feel it,\\" said Bishop Eben Nhiwatiwa, leader of the denomination's Zimbabwe episcopal area, and host Bishop for the meeting. \\"The delegates have shown maturity, and this Bishop has been given to us by God.\\" Caroline Njuki, an executive with the U.M. Board of Global Ministries agreed, stating \\"The Holy Spirit was with the delegates. An election that was expected to take a day or a day and a half was over in a matter of hours.\\" The election actually began in a more tumultuous way, with some delegates questioning the candidates' slate and the voting process. In the end, however, the delegates opted for an open slate and voting began. Two other nominees were the Rev. Joel Ncahoruri and the Rev. Justin Nzoyisaba, both of Burundi. In making their choice, delegates spoke of the need for development, healing, reconciliation and unity, within the Church as well as their various, strife-torn countries. \\"We saw in [Daniel Wandabula] the kind of character that showed that he could be a leader to our wounded countries and conference,\\" explained Godelive Manirakiza, a lay delegate from Burundi. \\"It is good to give someone from outside Burundi the opportunity to lead. It will strengthen unity and promote healing.\\" Another lay delegate, Alice Wasilwa from Kenya agreed, stating \\"I am so excited in my heart because we wanted someone who is neutral, and we now have that in this leader.\\" Bishop Jose Quipungo, the Episcopal Leader of East Angola and President of the Africa Central Conference added, \\"He is a man from the new generation, and he is strong.\\" Since the election of Bishop Daniel Wandabula, the problems of leadership that existed in that particular Annual Conference before the death of the late Bishop John Alfred Ndricimpa, persisted and worsened. As the new bishop didn't do much to heal the wounds and the already existing problems. The church in Rwanda and in Burundi, being former Belgian colonies; the governing bodies of any religious association is The General Assembly, the Executive Committee and the Office of Legal Representation (overseer), and the people making such composition have got to be nationals (Rwandese or Burundians). Bishop John A. Ndoricimpa, being Burundian by nationality was elected and legally acted as the Legal Representative of the UMC-Burundi, beside being the resident bishop of East Africa Annual Conference. Therefore, after his death and while Daniel Wandabula had been invested as the resident bishop of East Africa Annual Conference, UMC-Burundi elected The Reverend Nzoyisaba Justin as its new Legal Representative as the office was vacant. For some time, bishop Daniel refused to cooperate with the Legal Representatives elected by the church and the text and constitutions that govern the church in Burundi and Rwanda. In 2007, the United Methodist Church of Rwanda in its General Assembly, which is the highest decision making body in our churches, opted for the consecration of their own bishop in order to have peace in their church. Therefore, Bishop Jupa Kaberuka was elected and consecrated as the new bishop of the United Methodist Church of Rwanda and is the Legal Representative of the church. The church of Burundi on its side waited for the situation to heal, but it seemed to have worsened, and on December the 5-6th, 2008 the Executive Committee and the General Assembly of the United Methodist Church of Burundi met and elected the bishop of Burundi by the name of the Reverend Nzoyisaba Justin. Bishop Justin Nzoyisaba Justin was consecrated to the episcopate on Sunday, December 7, 2008 in full apostolic succession as the new Bishop of the United Methodist Church of Burundi and he remains the Legal Representative of the Church. Episcopal assignment Bishop Wandabula was elected as Resident Bishop for East Africa, including all U.M. Churches in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. He replaces the late Bishop J. Alfred Ndoricimpa who died July 2005. Bishop Wandabula was consecrated 28 May 2006 at the Ehnes Memorial Church at the Old Mutare, Zimbabwe U.M.C. Mission Center. His wife Betty (whom he married in January 2005) was with him. Education Daniel Wandabula earned both his M.Div.
