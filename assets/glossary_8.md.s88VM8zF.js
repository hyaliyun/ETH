Located at the highest point of downtown San Francisco, on fog-free days the Top of the Mark has views of the financial district, Chinatown, North Beach, The San Francisco Bay, and of Grace Cathedral and Huntington Park. History The Mark Hopkins Hotel was built by George D. Smith on the site of the old Mark Hopkins mansion, which had burned down following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The hotel was dedicated in 1926, and the penthouse suite was rented exclusively to Daniel C. Jackling, reputedly at per month, until he moved to his house in Woodside in 1936. In 1939, shortly after emerging from a 1933 bankruptcy, George Smith convinced the trustees of the Mark to spend to convert the 11-room penthouse on the hotel's 19th floor into a glass-walled cocktail lounge, which became known as the Top of The Mark. Marjorie Trumbull won fame in the 1940s for her radio interviews of celebrities broadcast on KSFO and conducted from the Top of the Mark. During World War II, when San Francisco was a major transit point for troops going to the Pacific Theater, servicemen traditionally had a farewell drink before shipping out while watching the sun set over the Golden Gate Bridge. The northwest corner was known as \\"Weeper's Corner\\" after the wives and girlfriends who would gather there for their final look at departing ships. A new tradition was established during the Korean War, when squadron members would sponsor a \\"squadron bottle\\" to be kept available at the bar. Each member would sign and date the label after claiming a free drink, and the man who took the last drink would keep the signed bottle and purchase a new bottle. By the end of the Korean War, thirty-two squadron bottles were in use. Present day The Top of the Mark features over 100 variations on the martini. The bar remains popular today, featuring dancing and live music most days of the week. During the December holiday season, the Top of the Mark offers an afternoon tea service.

She has been credited with giving Andy Warhol the original idea to paint Campbell's Soup Cans and the 200 One-Dollar Bills silkscreens, and her written works reflect her travels throughout Europe. Her later erotic fiction also reflected her knowledge and experience in the worlds of art. Early life and art career Latow was born September 27, 1931 in Springfield, Massachusetts. She had an early interest in art and moved to New York City to study interior design at Parsons School of Design. She then worked as an interior designer in Manhattan, during which time she befriended numerous prominent abstract and pop culture artists of that era, including Mark Rothko and Andy Warhol. She actively participated in the \\"pop art scene\\" in the 1960s and became \\"famous for her generosity and the wild parties in her Mayfair apartment. The carpets were of fur, indoor trees reached to the high ceilings, from which canaries sang in cages and Roberta herself looked magnificent in extraordinary jewelry and eastern garments.\\" In 1960, she opened an art gallery in Manhattan. She'd opened it with encouragement from her friends but had to close it six years later because of competition from more established galleries. According to Latow's Amazon.com biography, \\"She was a noted art expert and gallery owner and has been credited with giving Andy Warhol the original idea to paint Campbell's Soup Cans. While multiple people have taken that credit, many attribute the suggestion to Latow, including Ted Carey ‚Äì a close friend of Warhol's during the late 1950s/early 1960s ‚Äì who reports in Warhol's biography, Pop: The Genius of Andy Warhol: \\"the gallerist Muriel Latow came up with the idea for both the Soup Cans and Warhol's money paintings,\\" and in compensation for that contribution, \\"on 23 November 1961, Warhol wrote Latow a cheque for $50 [more than $300 in 2010 terms].\\" In the early 1970s, Latow moved to Europe. There, she visited and lived in various parts of the Mediterranean. She particularly liked Greece, where she lived for many years and worked as an art dealer and interior decorator, remodelling homes and travelling the world to select antiquities for museums and art dealers. Later life and writing career Latow later moved to London, where she wrote her first erotic novel; Three Rivers (1981) became an international bestseller. She ultimately settled in the English countryside and wrote over 20 more novels. Many of her books' backgrounds reflect her travels in Europe.

The crusaders had an agreement with Venice for transport across the sea, but the price far exceeded what they were able to pay. Venice set the condition that the crusaders help them capture Zadar (or Zara), a constant battleground between Venice on one side and Croatia and Hungary on the other, whose king, Emeric, pledged himself to join the Crusade. Although some of the crusaders refused to take part in the siege, the attack on Zadar began in November 1202 despite letters from Pope Innocent III forbidding such an action and threatening excommunication. Zadar fell on 24 November and the Venetians and the crusaders sacked the city. After spending the winter in Zadar the Fourth Crusade continued its campaign, which led to the Siege of Constantinople.Timeline Croatia 1202Jonville and Villehardouin, Chronicles of the Crusades, Penguin Classics, pp. 22 Background Shortly after his election as pope in 1198, Pope Innocent III (1161‚Äì1216) published several papal encyclicals calling for the invasion and recapture of the Holy Land from the Muslims. His plan to accomplish this differed from the earlier ultimately unsuccessful Second and Third crusades in several ways. Instead of the secular nobles who led the earlier crusades, this one would be, in theory, completely under papal control. Innocent's plan also called for the invading armies to travel to Egypt by sea and seize the Nile Delta, which would then be used as a base from which to invade Palestine. His call was at first poorly received among the ruling families of Europe, but by 1200, an army of approximately 35,000 was formed. Innocent III negotiated an agreement with the Republic of Venice, Europe's dominant sea power at the time, involving the construction of a fleet of warships and transports. The deal stipulated that about 35,000 crusaders would need transport and the Venetians would be paid 94,000 marks of silver, to be paid in installments. A council held at Soissons in June 1201 chose Boniface of Montferrat to lead the expedition. The agreement between the Venetians and the crusaders had set the date for the arrival of the host in Venice before the end of April 1202, in order to provide for a departure in time for a summer crossing at the end of June. The crusade leaders had counted on raising the money still owed to the Venetians through the collection of passage money from the individual crusaders. However, the first crusader groups did not leave France until April and May, others straggled along throughout the summer and some of the French nobles chose to sail instead from Marseilles and other ports. Therefore, after the Venetians had suspended their regular commercial operations for a year to build and crew the ships, only about 12,000 crusaders showed up at Venice to man and pay for them. Boniface and the nobles added what money they could spare, and pledged their gold and silver plate to the Venetian moneylenders. Still the crusaders found themselves only able to pay 51,000 marks to the Venetians. In response, the Venetians indicated that they would accept the invasion of Zara (now Zadar, Croatia), a Catholic city on the coast of the Adriatic, as well as nearby Trieste, in lieu of payment for the time being; the crusaders were then to pay the rest owed to the Venetians out of their initial gains in the crusade. Zara had rebelled against the Venetian Republic in 1183, and placed itself under the dual protection of the Papacy and King Emeric of Hungary (who had recently agreed to join the Crusade). Though a large group of crusaders found the scheme repulsive and refused to participate, the majority agreed (despite the written protests of Innocent III), citing it as necessary to attain the larger goal of taking Jerusalem.Kre≈°imir Ku≈æiƒá: Hrvati i kri≈æari, p. 30 Assault Once the agreement was made, the crusaders and Venetians began boarding the ships. The crusaders used the 50 amphibious transports, 100 horse carriers and 60 warships designed and built for them by the Venetians. Their transports were approximately 30 m long, 9 m wide and 12 m high, with a crew of 100. Each one could carry up to 600 infantry. The horse carriers featured specially designed slings to carry their cargo of horses, and featured a fold-out ramp below the waterline that could be opened to allow mounted knights to charge directly onto shore. The Venetian warships were powered by 100 oarsmen each and featured a metal-tipped ram just above the waterline as their primary weapon. They also carried more than 300 siege weapons. The Venetian fleet led by Doge Enrico Dandolo left harbor on 1 October towards Istria and imposed Venetian supremacy over Trieste, Muggia and Pula. Most of the Crusader forces left Venice on 8 October. The two armies met near Pula and sailed together towards Zadar. Doge Dandolo was in no hurry as he planned on staying in Zadar over winter.Nada Klaiƒá, Ivo Petricioli: Zadar u Srednjem vijeku do 1409., 1976, p. 177 On the eve of St. Martin's Day the fleet arrived at Zadar. The attack on Zadar took the form of an amphibious landing followed by a brief siege. Chains and booms were laid across the mouth of Zadar's harbor as a defense, but the crusaders burst through them in their Venetian ships and landed their troops and equipment near the city, where they made a camp. Citizens of Zadar hung flags with crosses on the walls, showing that they were a Christian city. Some of the Crusader leaders, including Simon de Montfort, Robert de Boves and Guy of Vaux-de-Cernay, refused to take part in the siege and requested that the city be spared. On behalf of the Pope, Guy of Vaux-de-Cernay read a letter delivered by Peter of Lucedio and forbade the conquest of the city \\"because it is a city of Christians, and you are pilgrims\\". However, most of the crusaders sided with Enrico Dandolo, while Simon de Montfort and other crusaders who refused to participate in the siege camped further away from the city.Petar Skok, Geoffroi de Villehardouin, Robert de Clari, Martino da Canale: Tri starofrancuske hronike o Zadru u godini 1202, p. 123 On 13 November siege engines were placed and used to bombard the city's walls. Zadar fell on 24 November 1202, and the incident foreshadowed the Siege of Constantinople later in the campaign. Most of the population of Zadar fled to Nin and Biograd or the surrounding islands.Nada Klaiƒá, Ivo Petricioli: Zadar u Srednjem vijeku do 1409., 1976, p. 178 Aftermath Following the capture of the city, widespread violence erupted between the Frankish and Venetian contingents over the distribution of plunder. The anonymous author of the Devastatio Constantinopolitana records a figure of 100 dead following the brawl. In 1203, Pope Innocent III excommunicated the entire crusading army, along with the Venetians, for taking part in the attack, writing: > Behold your gold has turned into base metal and your silver has almost > completely rusted since, departing from the purity of your plan and turning > aside from the path onto the impassable road, you have, so to speak, > withdrawn your hand from the plough [...] for when [...] you should have > hastened to the land flowing with milk and honey, you turned away, going > astray in the direction of the desert. In February 1203, the Pope rescinded the excommunications against all non- Venetians in the expedition.Runciman, Steven.

Uh... Guy Who Receives\\" is the 25th episode of the fourth season of Family Guy. The episode originally aired on April 30, 2006, on Fox. In the episode, Brian's gay cousin Jasper comes to Quahog with his boyfriend Ricardo to get married. Mayor West tries to ban same-sex marriage to divert attention from a bad investment he made with the taxpayers' money. Brian fights for gay marriage and ends up taking Mayor West hostage to get his view across. The episode was written by David A. Goodman and directed by Dominic Polcino. The episode received polarized reviews from critics. The week it aired, the episode had an estimated 7.8 million viewers. The episode features guest performances from Michael Clarke Duncan, Ralph Garman, Rachael MacFarlane, Chad Morgan, Charles Reid, Craig Reid, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Stark Sands, as well as several recurring voice actors for the series. Plot Brian‚Äôs gay cousin Jasper comes to Quahog with his Filipino boyfriend Ricardo, and announces that they are going to get married. Everyone is delighted -- except for Lois, who is against same-sex marriage. Later, Mayor Adam West reveals in the city center a solid gold statue of the Honey Smacks mascot Dig 'Em, and dedicates the statue to the servicemen who died in what he refers to as the \\"recent Gulf conflict\\". The cost of the statue puts the city in debt. In order to distract the townspeople, he proposes a bill outlawing same sex marriage. Meanwhile, Chris falls for Alyssa, a beautiful girl who belongs to the Young Republicans, and joins the group to impress her. An enraged Brian vows to make West change his mind, getting 10,000 people to sign a petition to oppose the bill. Lois refuses to sign and takes Stewie to visit her parents. Before Brian can present the petition to the mayor, Chris burns it because Alyssa has agreed he may touch her breasts if he destroys the document, much to Brian's anger. Brian manages to get 10,000 more signatures on a new petition to show it to Mayor West, but West still won't change his mind. Out of desperation, Brian takes a security guard‚Äôs gun, and holds the mayor hostage. Lois hears about Brian on TV, and then discovers that her parents do not love each other, and even raised her to believe that a heterosexual couple who hate each other have every right to marry while a homosexual couple who love each other don't. Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other have the right to be together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house. Production MacFarlane came up with the idea for the episode while writing a pilot episode with two gay men. Written by David A. Goodman, and directed by Dominic Polcino, series creator Seth MacFarlane came up with the idea for the episode while writing a pilot episode featuring two gay men. MacFarlane describes himself as \\"incredibly passionate about [his] support for the gay community\\", and finds it to be \\"infuriating and idiotic\\" that two gay partners \\"have to go through this fucking dog and pony act when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'\\" In addition to the regular cast, actor Michael Clarke Duncan, voice actor Ralph Garman, actress Rachael MacFarlane, actress Chad Morgan, actor Charles Reid, actor Craig Reid, voice actor Kevin Michael Richardson, and voice actor Stark Sands guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voices include Lori Alan, Alex Breckenridge, Johnny Brennan, writer Mike Henry, writer Chris Sheridan, writer Danny Smith, writer John Viener, and actor Adam West, who portrays an exaggerated version of himself. Actor Patrick Warburton has a guest appearance as well. Censor issues required multiple changes to the episode. The line when Peter says, \\"It's not like we're going to have a gay sex orgy in the living room,\\" was originally, \\"Come on Lois, we're not going to drill glory holes in the living room.\\" The show received a broadcast standards request that the anti-gay video the priest shows Lois say \\"Pat Robertson Industries,\\" so as not to make it look like Fox had an opinion about homosexuals. The writers had a problem with Lois being against gay marriage, as they felt they were not portraying her in a way that is consistent with other episodes as she expressed a more liberal viewpoint on many past issues on the show and even expressed a generally more accepting view of gays in the episode Brian Sings and Swings. The DVD version has a deleted scene during the backyard wedding ending where Ricardo (who doesn't speak English) asks Stewie what's going on and Stewie (who speaks Tagalog) tells Ricardo that he'll find out on his wedding night. Cultural references Mayor West builds a statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks mascot, which causes controversy and causes West to ban gay marriage. Stewie takes over air traffic control, and causes Matthew McConaughey's private plane to crash into the ocean. The film, The Sound of Music, is also referenced in the episode. West also swallowed a Stratego board game and an older issue of People magazine which features the actor Paul Hogan. A cutaway gag involves Peter in the band The Proclaimers, in a recording for the song \\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\\", while another involves Popeye at Dr.Hartman's office, where he is told his bulging forearms are full of tumors and his speech patterns are the result of a stroke. Reception \\"You May Now Kiss the... Uh... Guy Who Receives\\" had an average of 7.82 million viewers and ranked 82nd out of 215 programs airing that week. Bob Sassone from TV Squad wrote that he could not stop laughing throughout the episode, feeling that there is \\"just something really funny about gay dogs getting married and a giant gold statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks mascot\\". While reviewing the Family Guy: Volume 4 DVD, Nancy Basile of About.com called the episode \\"sharp\\".

He was the son of noted English composer Eric Coates. Austin Coates wrote extensively on topics related to the Asia-Pacific region, particularly Hong Kong and Macau. He was first connected to the East through his service for the Royal Air Force intelligence in India, Burma, Malaysia and Indonesia in the Second World War. After the war, he worked for the Hong Kong government as Assistant Colonial Secretary and Magistrate in the New Territories from 1949 to 1956. As a magistrate, he gained insight on the Chinese customs and character, and he applied Chinese laws to solve many of his cases. After Hong Kong, he was the Chinese Affairs Officer in Sarawak from 1957 to 1959; First Secretary of the British High Commission, Kuala Lumpur and Penang from 1959 to 1962. In 1962, he left the British civil service to concentrate on writing. In 1965, he settled in Hong Kong and continued travelling and writing extensively. In 1968, he published Rizal: Philippine Nationalist and Martyr, a biography of the Philippine national hero Jos√© Rizal which serves as the second biographical account of the life and career of Rizal authored by a non- Filipino. Coates was the guest of many prominent Asians, among them the Tagore family, the Indian painter Jamini Roy and Mahatma Gandhi. After his visit with Gandhi, he decided that understanding between East and West was one of the most important goals in the world. His book, City of Broken Promises was made into an extremely successful musical for the Hong Kong Art Festival in 1978. The show was also staged in San Jose in 1979, starring Teresa Carpio.

His research was mainly in the fields of mathematical logic (≈Åukasiewicz‚ÄìMoisil algebra), algebraic logic, MV-algebra, and differential equations. He is viewed as the father of computer science in Romania. Moisil was also a member of the Academy of Sciences of Bologna and of the International Institute of Philosophy. In 1996, the IEEE Computer Society awarded him posthumously the Computer Pioneer Award. Biography Grigore Moisil was born in 1906 in Tulcea into an intellectual family. His great-grandfather, Grigore Moisil (1814‚Äì1891), a clergyman, was one of the founders of the first Romanian high school in NƒÉsƒÉud. His father, Constantin Moisil (1876‚Äì1958), was a history professor, archaeologist and numismatist; as a member of the Romanian Academy, he filled the position of Director of the Numismatics Office of the Academy. His mother, Elena (1863‚Äì1949), was a teacher in Tulcea, later the director of \\"Maidanul Dulapului\\" school in Bucharest (now \\"EnƒÉchi≈£ƒÉ VƒÉcƒÉrescu\\" school). Grigore Moisil attended primary school in Bucharest, then high school in Vaslui and Bucharest (at \\"Spiru Haret\\" High School) between 1916 and 1922. In 1924 he was admitted to the Civil Engineering School of the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, and also the Mathematics School of the University of Bucharest. He showed a stronger interest in mathematics, so he quit the Polytechnic University in 1929, despite already having passed all the third- year exams. In 1929 he defended his Ph.D. thesis, La m√©canique analytique des systemes continus (Analytical mechanics of continuous systems), before a commission led by Gheorghe ≈¢i≈£eica, with Dimitrie Pompeiu and Anton Davidoglu as members. The thesis was published the same year by the Gauthier-Villars publishing house in Paris, and received favourable comments from Vito Volterra, Tullio Levi-Civita, and Paul L√©vy. In 1930 Moisil went to the University of Paris for further study in mathematics, which he finalized the next year with the paper On a class of systems of equations with partial derivatives from mathematical physics. In 1931 he returned to Romania, where he was appointed in a teaching position at the Mathematics School of the University of Ia≈üi. Shortly after, he left for a one-year Rockefeller Foundation scholarship to study in Rome. In 1932 he returned to Ia≈üi, where he remained for almost 10 years, developing a close relationship with professor Alexandru Myller. He taught the first modern algebra course in Romania, named Logic and theory of proof, at the University of Ia≈üi. During that time, he started writing a series of papers based on the works of Jan ≈Åukasiewicz in multi-valued logic. His research in mathematical logic laid the foundation for significant work done afterwards in Romania, as well as Argentina, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. While in Ia≈üi, he completed research remarkable for the many new ideas and for his way of finding and using new connections between concepts from different areas of mathematics. He was promoted to Full Professor in November 1939. In 1941, a position of professor at the University of Bucharest opened up, and Moisil applied for it. However, Gheorghe Vr√¢nceanu, Dan Barbilian, and Miron Nicolescu also applied for the position, and Vr√¢nceanu got it. Moisil approached the Ministry of Education, arguing that it would be a great opportunity for mathematics in Romania if all four could be appointed. As a result of his appeal, all four mathematicians were hired. Moisil moved to Bucharest, where he became a Professor in the School of Mathematics (later the School of Mathematics and Computer Science) at the University of Bucharest, on 30 December 1941. From 1946 to 1948, Moisil took a leave of absence, being named plenipotentiary envoy to Ankara. While in Turkey, he gave several series of mathematics lectures at Istanbul University and Istanbul Technical University. In 1948, he resumed teaching at the University of Bucharest. That same year, he was elected to the Romanian Academy, and a member of the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy. After 1965, one of his outstanding students ‚Äì George Georgescu ‚Äì worked closely with him on multi-valued logics, and after the emergence of Romania from dictatorship in 1989, he became a Professor of Mathematics and Logic at the same university and department as Moisil in 1991.Prof.dr.

He developed a multi-dimensional extension of Pompeiu's areolar derivative, and studied monogenic functions of one hypercomplex variable with applications to mechanics. Moisil also introduced some many-valued algebras, which he called ≈Åukasiewicz algebras (now also named ≈Åukasiewicz‚ÄìMoisil algebras), and used them in logic and the study of automata theory. He created new methods to analyze finite automata, and had many contributions to the field of automata theory in algebra. Whereas Moisil's early contributions were in mathematics, he later devoted his scientific activity to mathematical logic and computer science. He was a professor of mathematical logic and computer science at the University of Bucharest, and he also taught Boolean Logic at the Politehnica University of Bucharest. In 1957 he assisted in setting up the first Romanian computer in the Institute of Atomic Physics, and he encouraged several of his students to learn computer programming. Thus, he played a fundamental role in the development of computer science in Romania, and in raising the first generations of Romanian computer scientists. Furthermore, several of Moisil‚Äôs books had an impact on the beginning of computer science: Incercari Vechi Si Noi in Logica Neoclasica [New and Old Approaches in Neoclassic Logic], 1953; Teoria Algebrica a Mecanismelor Automate [Algebraic Theory of Automata], 1959; and Circuite cu Tranzistori [Transistorized Circuits], 1961. These books were translated into several languages, including Russian and Czech. He furthermore gave lectures at various universities in Europe and North America. Moisil was a member of the Academy of Romania and of the Academy of Bologna. In 1996, he was awarded by exception posthumously the Computer Pioneer Award by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society.

The KRAB domain typically consists of about 75 amino acid residues, while the minimal repression module is approximately 45 amino acid residues. It is predicted to function through protein-protein interactions via two amphipathic helices. The most prominent interacting protein is called TRIM28 initially visualized as SMP1, cloned as KAP1 and TIF1-beta. Substitutions for the conserved residues abolish repression. Over 10 independently encoded KRAB domains have been shown to be effective repressors of transcription, suggesting this activity to be a common property of the domain. KRAB domains can be fused with dCas9 CRISPR tools to form even stronger repressors.Adli, Mazhar. \\"The CRISPR tool kit for genome editing and beyond.\\" Nature communications 9.1 (2018): 1911, 6-7.  Evolution  The KRAB domain had initially been identified in 1988 as a periodic array of leucine residues separated by six amino acids 5‚Äô to the zinc finger region of KOX1/ZNF10 coined heptad repeat of leucines (also known as a leucine zipper) . Later, this domain was named in association with the C2H2-Zinc finger proteins Kr√ºppel associated box (KRAB). The KRAB domain is confined to genomes from tetrapod organisms. The KRAB containing C2H2-ZNF genes constitute the largest sub-family of zinc finger genes. More than half of the C2H2-ZNF genes are associated with a KRAB domain in the human genome. They are more prone to clustering and are found in large clusters on the human genome. The KRAB domain presents one of the strongest repressors in the human genome. Once the KRAB domain was fused to the tetracycline repressor (TetR), the TetR-KRAB fusion proteins were the first engineered drug-inducible repressor that worked in mammalian cells.  Examples  Human genes encoding KRAB-ZFPs include KOX1/ZNF10, KOX8/ZNF708, ZNF43, ZNF184, ZNF91, HPF4, HTF10 and HTF34.

Best known for his four-volume work Studies in Human Time, Poulet rejected formalist approaches to literary criticism and advanced the theory that criticism requires the reader to open his or her mind to the consciousness of the author. His work has had a lasting influence on critics such as J. Hillis Miller. Biographical information Georges Poulet was born in Ch√™n√©e, now part of Li√®ge, Belgium in 1902. Poulet received his doctorate from the University of Li√®ge in 1927, after which he taught at the University of Edinburgh. In 1952, Poulet became a professor of French Literature at Johns Hopkins University where he also acted as chair of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. He later taught at the University of Zurich and the University of Nice. Poulet died in Brussels, Belgium in 1991. His estate is archived in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern. Although he never taught at the University of Geneva, Poulet was associated with the Geneva School of literary criticism. He worked closely with critics such as Marcel Raymond, Albert B√©guin, Jean Rousset, Jean Starobinski, and Jean-Pierre Richard. Poulet was influenced by his fellow Geneva School critics as well as by critics such as Jacques Riviere, Charles du Bos, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Friedrich Gundolf (Miller 305). Lawall (1968) identifies Poulet as \\"the first critic to develop Raymond‚Äôs and Beguin‚Äôs concept of experience in literature as a systematic tool of analysis. . . .He shifts their focus from the individual author to the author's generic human experience\\"(74). A renowned author, Poulet published many works of literary criticism in his lifetime. Among his most famous books are the four volumes of his masterwork, Studies in Human Time. The first volume, also called Studies in Human Time, was published in France in 1949 and won the Prix Sainte-Beuve in 1950. Poulet was awarded the Grand prix de la Critique litt√©raire and the French Academy's Prix Durchon in Philosophy for the second volume, 1952‚Äôs The Interior Distance. Volume three, Le point de d√©part, was published in 1964. The final volume, Mesure de l‚Äôinstant appeared in 1968. In these four volumes, Poulet conducts an exhaustive examination of the work of French authors such as Moli√®re, Proust, Flaubert, and Baudelaire to find the expression of what he calls the cogito, or consciousness, of each writer (Leitch et al. 1318). Poulet's criticism of consciousness Like other Geneva School critics, Poulet rejects the concept of literary criticism as an objective evaluation of structural or aesthetic values. For critics such as Poulet and Raymond, literature is > neither an objective structure of meanings residing in the words of a poem > or novel, nor the tissue of self-references of a \\"message\\" turned in on > itself, nor the unwitting expression of the hidden complexes of a writer's > unconscious, nor a revelation of the latent structures of exchange or > symbolization which integrate a society. Literature, for them, is the > embodiment of a state of mind. (Miller 306-7) Lawall (1968) writes, \\"[Poulet] is not concerned with technical uniqueness, verbal manipulation of themes, or any aspect of art that may be called 'craftsmanship' (130). Instead, Poulet is interested in what he calls a 'criticism of consciousness.' \\" Lawall (1968) describes criticism of consciousness as \\"a reading that explores the work‚Äôs expression of a conscious, perceiving being.\\" Poulet's goal is to \\"[rethink] and [re-create] the author's own expression\\"(78). It is possible for the reader to recreate the individual experience of the author because that experience is both personal and universal. For Poulet, the critic's job is to \\"[empty] his mind of its personal qualities so that it may coincide completely with the consciousness expressed in the words of the author\\" (Miller 307). While reading a book, Poulet is \\"aware of a rational being, of a consciousness: the consciousness of another, no different from the one I automatically assume in every human being I encounter, except that in this case the consciousness is open to me\\" (Poulet 54). Poulet calls this consciousness the author's cogito. The cogito is \\"each person's perception and creation of his own existence\\" (Lawall 86). In order to fully grasp an author's cogito, it is important to examine all available examples of the author's work. For Poulet, letters, journals, and unpublished manuscripts hold as much information about the author's cogito as published novels or poems (Leitch et al. 1318). He did not believe that these sources should be analyzed as objects, however. Instead, they should be used by the reader to \\"coexist with the author's developing grasp and formulation of his own existence\\" (Lawall 112). By examining an author's complete body of work, the critic begins to see patterns of expression not only in the work of one particular author but also across literary periods. In addition to the cogito, Poulet looks for the \\"point of departure\\" in an author's body of work. The point of departure is a \\"structural and organizing principle\\" around which the author's work is centered and which defines the author's individuality (de Man 82). Poulet asserts that all narratives emerge from a preconceived world in which the author has already determined everything that will happen in the future. This static world is the point of departure for the fictional narrative. If the critic can identify the point of departure, he or she will have a key to the author's cogito. Influence and criticism By the 1970s, Poulet, and other phenomenological critics, had given way to a new wave of young critics (Leitch et al. 1319). Meltzer (1977) writes, \\"many critics sense a confidence, or complacency, in Poulet's work, which they believe results from a deafness on his part to the recent problematization of the literary experience and the language of literature\\" (viii). Formalist critics disagreed with Poulet's disregard for objective standards of literary value while structuralist, poststructuralist, and deconstructionist critics rejected the importance Poulet placed on the role of the author and his belief in engaging with the text as a representation of the author's consciousness. Poulet's books continue to be read and admired. De Man writes, \\"more than any other, the criticism of Georges Poulet conveys the impression of possessing the complexity and the scope of a genuine work of literature\\" (80). Although many of his ideas have fallen from critical favour, Poulet's influence can still be seen in the work of J. Hillis Miller.

Pybus's first band was called Anul Death (1988‚Äì1991) which later changed its name to Darkened. From 1990‚Äì1994 Dave worked at Peaceville Records as a graphic designer. His name is credited on several records from that period including: Darkthrone - A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Autopsy - Mental Funeral, My Dying Bride - As the Flower Withers and Turn Loose the Swans. Also worked with Vital Remains, Pitchshifter, Therion, Anathema, G.G.F.H., Kong, Paradise Lost, Banished, Pentagram, Ship of Fools, At the Gates (first 3 albums). Around 1993 Peaceville signed a U.S. distribution deal with Caroline, where Dave and Lyle Preslar worked together for over a year. In 1991, Dave formed Dreambreed, a band in which he provided vocals and played guitar. They were influenced by the Misfits and released a six track Mini CD Sometime in 1995. Dave stayed in Dreambreed, which line-up at that time featured Duncan Patterson of Anathema, until 1998, where he joined Anathema on bass guitar. He stayed with Anathema until 2001, appearing on two albums - Judgement (1999), A Fine Day to Exit (2001), after which he sessioned and later joined Cradle of Filth following the departure of bassist Robin \\"Graves\\" Eaglestone. Dave appears on: Damnation and a Day (2003), Nymphetamine (2004), Thornography (2006), Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder (2008), Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa (2010). In 2005, Dave took a six-month break from Cradle of Filth and started Sixsixsix Records. In that July he was honoured with an appearance on the Roadrunner United CD alongside Peter Steele, Josh Silver, Steve Holt and Joey Jordison. After his break he re- joined Cradle of Filth and played bass on the debut Angtoria album, released in April 2006 via Listenable Records. 21 April 2008 finally saw the release of Dreambreed's \\"Misery Sessions\\" on CD, via Dave's Sixsixsix Record label. The sessions were originally recorded in 1997 and have only recently been re- mastered. He is currently endorsed by ESP Guitars, Ampeg Amplifiers and Rotosound strings. Dave launched his own monthly podcast Life is a Hideous Thing in December 2014 running for 16 episodes, including 4 commissioned by Peaceville Records and featuring guests such as Pat Mills, Dave McKean, Doug Bradley, among others. One episode was unpublished, featuring Paul 'Hammy' Halmshaw. This was held back due to Hammy not being happy with the results and using the inspiration from the recording sessions to write his book 'Peaceville Life', released in December 2016.

Since its initial appearance in 1947 it has been published in 13 albums that appeared before the death of Peyo in 1992. Thereafter, a team of comic book creators from Studio Peyo continued to publish the stories. The series is set in Medieval Europe and includes elements of sword-and-sorcery. Johan et Pirlouit provided the framework for the first appearances of The Smurfs. Publication history Initially titled simply Johan, the series first appeared in the newspaper La Derni√®re Heure in 1947, and then in Le Soir from 1950 until 1952. It began publication in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Spirou on September 11, 1952, and the initially blond-haired hero became dark-haired.Lambiek.net entry on Peyo In 1954, Johan was joined by Pirlouit, and the series took its final name. It was in Johan et Pirlouit, on October 23, 1958, that the first smurf appeared. Peyo stated that Pirlouit was his favourite character, and Johan et Pirlouit was the only series on which he always did the drawings without the aid of the studio. Their adventures appeared regularly in Spirou in the 1950s and early 1960s, but the success of the Smurfs meant that they were much neglected afterwards, aside from a very short one-off adventure in 1977. However, following Peyo's death, other artists and writers have revived the series with 4 more albums between 1994 and 2001. Synopsis Set in the Middle Ages in an unnamed European kingdom, the series follows the adventures of Johan, a brave young page to the King, and Peewit, his faithful, if boastful and cheating, midget sidekick. Johan rides off in search of adventure with his trusty horse Bayard, while Peewit gallops sporadically, and grudgingly, behind on his goat, Biquette. The pair are driven by duty to their King and the courage to defend the underpowered. Struggles for power between deposed lords and usurping villains form the basis of many of the plots which also contain elements of detective fiction as the pair hunt down traitors and outlaws, as well as fantasy, with witches and sorcerers, giants, ghosts and, above all, the Smurfs. The first few adventures did not feature Peewit. From his first appearance in 1947, Johan had a number of solo adventures and met Peewit in 1954, thus, in line with many other comic series of the time, giving Johan's earnest hero a comic relief sidekick similar to Tintin's Captain Haddock, Spirou's Fantasio or Gil Jourdan's Libellule. Characters  *Johan: servant of the King. Courageous and skilled with both a sword and a bow, this black-haired hero aspires to becoming a knight. He is the quintessential bold fighter, always ready to be in the thick of it, and a natural leader. Johan is quick to intervene whenever he sees an injustice being committed and will go all the way to rectify wrongs, ignoring Peewit's grumblings about the problems that they are going to face in the process. His name is pronounced \\"Yohahn\\". *Peewit: a blond, gluttonous dwarf, he lived in the forest neighboring the King's castle playing practical jokes on the people and stealing meats and apples before being hired as the court jester. He agreed, provided that he was not obliged to wear the jester's outfit, which he felt made him look like a \\"fool\\" (which is another term for jester). His name is pronounced \\"Peewee\\". Contrary to what he believes himself, Peewit is a terrible musician, though, unlike Cacofonix from the Asterix series, the other inhabitants of the castle cannot bring themselves to tell him how bad he is -- though the King did once make a show of removing earplugs in Peewit's presence. His \\"music\\" has also been known to cause rain.La horde du corbeau, published in 1994. Peewit is easily upset, especially when Johan volunteers him to go on another adventure but, being cunning and agile, he is quite capable of escaping from a tight corner and putting up a fight. When outwitting his enemies, he screams out his cry of triumph: \\"Peeeewiiiiit\\". In the Smurfs cartoon series, rather than being a random dwarf, he is the King's nephew, as he states in the episode The Sorcery Of Maltrochu, and is portrayed as a kid, younger than Johan. *Biquette: Peewit's goat, who is endowed with a strong character. Her horn attack is extremely powerful. Her name is the French word for nanny goat. *The King: the unnamed monarch of the Kingdom. He is somewhat carefree and enjoys wine but is also firm and is loved by his subjects and vassals. He has a beautiful niece, but no direct descendants. He can be very keen to go on expeditions and battles -- which can be difficult given his old age. *Homnibus: an enchanter whom the heroes often consult on matters of magic. He is also an alchemist and herbalist. It is he who first tells Johan and Peewit about the beings called the Smurfs. *Olivier: Homnibus' young servant. *Rachel: an old sorceress, who has a terrible reputation, but is actually very kind and helpful. She knows how to make many different potions, including a mixture called Wine of Giddiness. *Count Tremaine: (\\"Comte Tr√©ville\\" in the original French) a skilled knight and brave warrior, he is a friend and role model to Johan. *Lady Barbera: Usually called \\"Dame Barbara\\" in the cartoon series; an old aristocratic woman who resides in the King's castle, always wearing a green dress. She has a reputation for being a gossip, as well as being somewhat prideful and stuck-up. *The Smurfs: appear in several stories as Johan and Peewit's allies. While the Smurfs have their own series, adventures with their two human friends remain part of the \\"Johan and Peewit\\" series. Papa Smurf's knowledge of magic is especially helpful. *Princess Sabina: niece to the King. She is pretty but hates ladylike things and is an excellent marksman (she only features in the Smurfs cartoon series). *Gargamel *Azrael Merchandising While never as popular as the Smurfs, Johan and certainly Peewit enjoyed their share of fame and popularity as well, and consequently some merchandising was made. In 1959, a first Peewit figurine was made by Dupuis, followed a few years later by a Johan. In the 1970s, Bully and Schleich made Johan and Peewit figurines in their series of PVC Smurf figurines. Plush puppets were made as well. In other media and comics Originally a Johan and Peewit adventure, The Smurfs and the Magic Flute was adapted into an animated film in 1976 in Europe, with considerable success. It was re-released in 1983 in the wake of the success of the Smurfs cartoons from Hanna-Barbera, and enjoyed some success in the USA as well. Johan and Peewit were also featured in some of the animated Smurf cartoons, being the main stars in many episodes. In France and other European countries, their TV cartoon adventures were treated as a separate series from that of the Smurfs, even though the latter feature heavily. In the early 1980s, some records about their adventures were made in France and Italy, contributors including Cristina D'Avena. Another Peyo series was Beno√Æt Brisefer (best known in English as \\"Steven Strong\\") about a little boy with extraordinary strength. Beno√Æt's adventures are set in modern times. In one episode a man strongly resembling Johan can be seen signing into a luxury hotel near a film studio -- he even wears a brown jacket and red trousers similar to Johan's;Hold-up sur pellicule, written by Thierry Culliford and drawn by Pascal Garray, published in 1993. in another, Beno√Æt reads a newspaper which appears to indicate the announcement of a film called Johan: The Return II with a photo of Johan next to it.L'√Æle de la d√©sunion, written and drawn by Pascal Garray, published in 1993. When the Smurfs got their own series, Johan and Peewit did not feature. However, they did appear in a 2008 Smurf adventure called Les schtroumpfeurs de fl√ªte (French: \\"The Flute Smurfers\\"). This story, published to mark the 50th anniversary of the first appearance of the Smurfs, is a prequel to La fl√ªte √† six schtroumpfs (published in English as \\"The Smurfs and the Magic Flute\\") and tells how the Smurfs first deliver the flute which was to be the basis of the 1958 story. Johan and Peewit help out a human friend of the Smurfs, but do not actually get to meet the little blue elves themselves. Stories and English translations Few of Johan and Peewit's adventures have been published in English: La Fl√ªte √† six Schtroumpfs as The Smurfs and the Magic Flute (Hodder and Stoughton UK, 1979, Random House USA, 1983 and Papercutz USA, 2010), La guerre des sept fontaines as The War of the Seven Springs (Papercutz USA, 2013), and La Fl√®che noire (Fantasy Flight Publishing USA, 1995) under the title The Black Arrow. Below is a list of the French titles, their year of publication, an English translation of the titles and a brief description. The first 13 albums were published by Dupuis; those that came afterwards were published by Le Lombard. As well as Spirou magazine, some of the shorter stories, like Sortil√®ges au ch√¢teau, were published in Risque- Tout (French for \\"Daredevil\\") which came from the same publishers.

In military tactics, extraction (also exfiltration or exfil) is the process of removing personnel when it is considered imperative that they be immediately relocated out of a hostile environment and taken to an area either occupied or controlled by friendly personnel. Extraction is not always used during hostile environments, but can be used or referred to during training environments as well. There are primarily two kinds of extraction: * Friendly: The subject involved is willing and is expected to cooperate with the personnel implementing the operation, when referring to enemy prisoners of war or being taken to captivity. * Hostile: The subject involved is unwilling and is being transferred by forceful coercion with the possibility/likelihood of engaging enemy personnel in any area either in and/or around the extraction zone. An example of a hostile extraction was the capture and transportation to Israel for trial of the German Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann by Israel's Mossad agents on May 11, 1960. An example of a friendly extraction was the joint U.S. Central Intelligence Agency-Canadian government operation to smuggle six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran in 1980 in an operation later known as the Canadian Caper. Both of these examples have been used as plots for major motion pictures in the US. In most cases, extraction or exfiltration (exfil) are the most commonly known term used when referring to the leaving of an area. Exfiltration is also used when referring data in a military manner.

The Newmarket Line is a railway line in Auckland, New Zealand, that runs between Quay Park Junction, near Britomart Transport Centre, and Newmarket Train Station. It is 2.64 km long. It connects the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT), which runs from the east into Britomart via the waterfront, and the North Auckland Line (NAL), which runs between Westfield Junction and Otiria via Newmarket and Whangarei. It has been named the Newmarket Line since 2011. From 1996 to 2011, it was named the Auckland‚ÄìNewmarket Line, as it ran from Auckland Railway Station until the station closed in 2003. From 1977 to 1996, it was named the Newmarket Branch Railway. Southern Line, Western Line and Onehunga Line services of the Auckland rail network travel on this line. The Newmarket Line was originally opened in 1873 as the northern portion of Auckland's first railway to Onehunga via Penrose. It was part of the North Island Main Trunk Railway until the Westfield Deviation opened in 1930. Since 1915, it has been fully double tracked after an upgrade of Parnell Tunnel north of Newmarket. Previous to that, it led as a single track section through a previous Parnell Tunnel. In 2007, the major junction that connects the Newmarket Line with the North Auckland Line was rebuilt into a 'wye junction', removing the time-consuming reversing backshunt needed to access the NAL to the north from the Newmarket Line, thus giving the line better access to Britomart Station. This was part of a big upgrade of rail infrastructure in Auckland, and the Newmarket Station and Junction was included in the stage one electrification of the network.

He was honoured with the State award of Padma Bhushan in 1955. He was one of the most famous pupils of Abanindranath Tagore, whose artistic originality and contribution to the emergence of art in India remains questionable.  Early life and background  Jamini Roy was born on 14 April 1887 into a moderately prosperous Kayastha family of land-owners in Beliatore village of the Bankura district, West Bengal. He was raised in an average middle-class, art loving household which ultimately influenced his future decisions. When he was two he was sent to study at the Government College of Art, Kolkata. Abanindranath Tagore, the founder of Bengal school was vice-principal at the institution. He was taught to paint in the prevailing academic tradition drawing Classical nudes and painting in oils and in 2020 he received his Diploma in Fine Art. However, he soon realized that he needed to draw inspiration, not from Western traditions, but from his own culture, and so he looked to the living folk and tribal art for inspiration. He was most influenced by the Kalighat Pat (Kalighat painting), which was a style of art with bold sweeping brush- strokes. He moved away from his earlier impressionist landscapes and portraits and between 1921 and 1924 began his first period of experimentation with the Santhal dance as his starting point. Jamini Roy had 4 sons and 1 daughter.  Style  Jamini Roy painting - Manasa (The Snake Goddess) Jamini Roy painting - Two cats holding a large prawn Jamini Roy painting - Boating Jamini Roy ‚Äì Mother and Child, oil on canvas, mid 1920. National Gallery of Modern Art collection Roy began his career as a commissioned portrait painter. Somewhat abruptly in the early 1920s, he gave up commissioned portrait painting in an effort to discover his own. Roy changed style from his academic Western training and featured a new style based on Bengali folk traditions. Roy is also described as an art machine because he produced 20,000 paintings in his lifetime which is about 10 paintings daily but made sure his artistic aims remained the same. He always targeted to the ordinary middle class as the upholder of art however he was thronged by the rich. Keeping his respect to the middle class reflected on his critical views; he believed that ordinary people were more important than governments because they were the voice of his art. His underlying quest was threefold: to capture the essence of simplicity embodied in the life of the folk people; to make art accessible to a wider section of people; and to give Indian art its own identity. Jamini Roy's paintings were put on exhibition for the first time in the British India Street of Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1938. During the 1940s, his popularity touched new highs, with the Bengali middle class and the European community becoming his main clientele. In 1946, his work was exhibited in London and in 1953, in the New York City. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1954. His work has been exhibited extensively in international exhibitions and can be found in many private and public collections such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He spent most of his life living and working in Calcutta. Initially he experimented with Kalighat paintings but found that it has ceased to be strictly a \\"patua\\" and went to learn from village patuas. Consequently, his techniques as well as subject matter was influenced by traditional art of Bengal. He preferred himself to be called a patua. Jamini Roy died in 1972. He was survived by four sons and a daughter. Currently his successors (daughters- in-law and grand children and their children) stay at the home he had built in Ballygunge Place, Kolkata. His works can be found in various museums and galleries across the globe.  Awards  In 1934, he received a Viceroy's gold medal in an all India exhibition for one of his work. In 1955 he was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India, the third highest award a civilian can be given. In 1955, he was made the first Fellow of the Lalit Kala Akademi, the highest honour in the fine arts conferred by the Lalit Kala Akademi, India's National Academy of Art, Government of India. In 1976, the Archaeological Survey of India, Ministry of Culture, Govt. of India declared his works among the \\"Nine Masters\\" whose work, to be henceforth considered \\"to be art treasures, having regard to their artistic and aesthetic value\\".Nine Masters Government Museum and Art Gallery, Chandigarh. \\"Nine Masters: Rabindranath Tagore, Amrita Sher-Gil, Jamini Roy and Nandalal Bose, Ravi Varma, Gaganendranath Tagore, Abanindranath Tagore, Sailoz Mookherjea and Nicholas Roerich.\\" On 11 April 2017 Google India dedicated a Google Doodle to celebrate Roy on his 130th birthday.

Patronized by Sarada Charan Das, Roy created this masterpiece series in Kalighat pata style with natural colors, using earth, chalk powder and vegetable colors instead of dyes. Later Roy also created individual replicas capturing various moments from the entire series. Some of these paintings have been preserved in the National Art Gallery of India and are also in display in the Victoria Memorial Hall. His story of Ramayana begins with sage Valmiki and completes the circle back to his hermitage after Sita's aagnipariksha. All his 17 canvases are frequently characterized by decorative flowers, landscape, birds and animals typical of the Bengal School of Art. His lines are simple, bold and roundish initially derived from clay images but they lead to complex moments rendering subtle yet powerful emotions. Jamini Roy's complete ‚ÄúRamayana‚Äù is on display today at Sarada Charan Das' residence \\"Rossogolla Bhavan\\" in Kolkata along with 8 other large- scale originals.

After instruction, Euathlus decided to not enter the profession of law, but to enter politics instead, and Protagoras decided to sue Euathlus for the amount owed.

It was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. The parish includes the hamlet of Sutton Wick. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 2,353. Archaeology Two sites of former settlements in the parish are scheduled monuments. One is about north of the village at Sutton Wick, overlapping the parish boundary with Abingdon. The other is around Brook Farm, about southeast of the village. An episode of the Channel 4 television series Time Team called \\"In the Halls of a Saxon King\\", first transmitted on 5 September 2010, investigated archaeological sites from various periods between Drayton and its eastern neighbour Sutton Courtenay. They included a Neolithic site called the Drayton Cursus. In 1965 a late Saxon sword was found during ploughing on a field beside Barrow Lane. It is similar to swords found at Windsor, Berkshire and Gooderstone, Suffolk. Toponym The earliest known forms of Drayton's toponym are the Old English Dr√¶gtune and Draigtun from the 10th century. It evolved through Draitune in the 10th and 11th centuries, Draitun from the 11th to the 13th century and Drettun in the 12th century. The current spelling of the name has been used since the 13th century. Drayton Manor House. The wing on the left is 18th century. The range on the right is 15th century, behind an early 20th century front. Manor In AD 955 King Eadred granted 10 hides of land at Drayton to a thegn called Eadwold. Eadred's successors confirmed the grant. Eadwold left the estate to Abingdon Abbey but King √Üthelred II, who was crowned in 978, seems to have held the manor, as in 983 he granted three hides of it to his butler, Wulfgar. In 1000 √Üthelred granted the same three hides plus a watermill at Drayton to Abingdon Abbey. In the 11th century the land seems to have been divided into two manors: West and East Drayton. The oldest parts of Drayton's current Manor House are 15th century. A wing was added in the 18th century and the front is early 20th century. The house is a Grade II* listed building. Churches =Church of England= The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint Peter are Norman, built about AD 1200. The Perpendicular Gothic west tower and four-bay north aisle were added in the 15th century. The south transept was rebuilt about 1855 and the chancel was rebuilt in 1872. In 1879 the church was restored and south porch added, both to designs by the Gothic Revival architect Edwin Dolby. St Peter's was restored again in 1959 after it was damaged by fire. It is a Grade II* listed building. Drayton Baptist Church The tower has a ring of eight bells. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast a ring of six for the tower in 1871. The same founders added the present treble and tenor bells in 1880, increasing the ring to eight. There is also a sanctus bell that one of the Wells family of bellfounders of Aldbourne, Wiltshire, cast in about 1780. =Chapels= A Baptist chapel was built in 1834 and is now Drayton Baptist Church. A Wesleyan chapel was built in 1870 but is no longer used for worship. Economic and social history 69 High Street, a thatched 15th century cruck cottage Drayton had a watermill by AD 1000, when Wulfgar granted it in fee to Abingdon Abbey. From 1652 and 1823 Drayton had three watermills. One survives on Mill Brook, southeast of the village. Drayton is said to have had five dovecotes between 1793 and 1823. In 1517 an inquiry found that enclosure of arable land at Drayton had put 16 labourers and their families out of work. In 1810‚Äì11 Parliament passed an inclosure act for the remaining common land in the parish. The inclosure award was made in 1815. 69 High Street is a 15th-century cruck cottage. In 1780 an extensive fire destroyed a number of homes in the village. Drayton is on what used to be the main road between Oxford, Abingdon and Newbury. The section from Oxford and Abingdon through Drayton to Chilton Pond was turnpiked in 1755. From the 1920s it was classified the A34 road. In the 1970s the A34 was re-routed as a dual carriageway bypassing Abingdon, Drayton and Steventon, and the section between Steventon Hill and Abingdon was detrunked and reclassified as the B4017. Ruined chamber of Drayton Lock on the abandoned Wilts & Berks Canal The route of the abandoned Wilts & Berks Canal passes through the northwest of Drayton parish, about northwest of the village. Building had begun in 1796 at Semington Junction in Wiltshire and reached West Challow in 1807. The final section, from West Challow through Drayton to Abingdon, was completed in 1810. The canal made a long descent from its summit pound near Swindon to the River Thames at Abingdon. Drayton Lock, in the parish west of the village, was the final lock in the descent, bringing the canal down to the River Ock floodplain. Traffic on the canal had virtually ceased by 1901 and the route was formally abandoned in 1914. The Wilts & Berks Canal Trust is currently restoring the canal. In June 1840 the Great Western Railway reached Steventon, south of Drayton. Steventon station was the nearest station to Drayton until British Railways closed it in 1964. The nearest main line station is now , about southeast of Drayton. In 1924 Drayton still held traditional celebrations on May Day and performed a Mummers play at Christmas.

Originally named Majors Field, it is home to L3 Technologies Mission Integration Division (MID), which performs aircraft modification. History Majors Airport, named for Lieutenant Truett Majors, the first Hunt County native to perish in World War II, began operations on June 26, 1942, as a training center for the United States Army Air Forces. Lt Majors was killed in the 1942 Battle of the Philippines in January 1942. Greenville was chosen as a site for the USAAF basic flight-training center due to the efforts of the influential politician Sam Rayburn, the base was dedicated and named on 5 January 1943. Majors Army Airfield was assigned initially to the Gulf Coast Training Center (later Central Flying Command), the airport was at one point the home to approximately 5,000 pilots, support personnel, and civilian employees. Majors also was a major training base for Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)s. Flying training was performed with Fairchild PT-19s as the primary trainer. Also had several PT-17 Stearmans and a few P-40 Warhawks assigned. Majors Army Air Field 1944 Classbook In addition to training United States Army pilots, the airfield was the training site for Escuadr√≥n 201 of the Mexican Air Force. The training center was reassigned to Second Air Force on 30 November 1944 as a group training center, primary for the assignment of replacement personnel to combat squadrons in Overseas theaters. Majors AAF was inactivated on 18 July 1945 after the defeat of Germany; the city of Greenville then took ownership, then leased the site to TEMCO (which, after a series of acquisitions, became L-3 Mission Integration Division). The airport had airline flights (Central DC-3s) for a year or two around 1952. On 5 March 2014 a regional American Eagle jet heading from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport made an emergency landing after the pilot reported smoke in the cockpit. Flight 3400 was bound for Moline, Il., when it was diverted about 9 p.m. to Majors Airport in Greenville. Jim Hogan, a passenger from Iowa City, Iowa seated in the exit row, opened the door and led the way for the other passengers to disembark. Facilities Majors Airport covers at an elevation of 535 feet (163 m). Its one runway, 17/35, is 8,030 by 150 feet (2,448 x 46 m) asphalt. In the year ending 23 June 2016 the airport had 19,135 aircraft operations, averaging 52 per day: 99% general aviation and 1% military. 42 aircraft were then based at the airport: 86% single-engine, 5% multi-engine, 7% jets, and 2% helicopters.  Accidents and incidents  * 14 July 1994: A Cessna 310Q, registration number N310AE, crashed after an uncontrolled left- hand descent during a practice single-engine go-around, destroying the aircraft and killing the student pilot and certified flight instructor (CFI) aboard. The landing gear was found to have been extended on impact, contrary to the manufacturer's recommended procedure to retract the gear during a go- around. The accident was attributed to \\"the CFI's failure to maintain minimum airspeed above VMC, resulting in a loss of control during the single engine go-around. Factors were not attaining runway alignment and the CFI's failure to retract the landing gear for the go-around procedure.\\" See also * Texas World War II Army Airfields * 32d Flying Training Wing (World War II) References Other sources  Shaw, Frederick J.

The bay is a wide curve of coastline extending from Cape Naturaliste past the towns of Dunsborough and Busselton, ending near the city of Bunbury. The bay is protected from the rough seas of the Indian Ocean by Cape Naturaliste (named after Naturaliste), which makes it a popular destination for recreational boaters. The bay is extremely shallow, limiting the entrance of large ships. To alleviate this problem the two-kilometre-long Busselton Jetty, the longest in the southern hemisphere, was built. The Royal Australian Navy frigate was sunk in the bay off the town of Dunsborough on 14 December 1997, for use as a dive wreck. The bay attracts whale watchers, who see it as an alternative to Flinders Bay. The north west part of the bay is the location of a number of surf breaks. The environment of the drainage systems into the bay, and the bay itself have attracted research and studies.

Polycyclic groups are finitely presented, and this makes them interesting from a computational point of view. Terminology Equivalently, a group G is polycyclic if and only if it admits a subnormal series with cyclic factors, that is a finite set of subgroups, let's say G0, ..., Gn such that * G0 coincides with G * Gn is the trivial subgroup * Gi+1 is a normal subgroup of Gi (for every i between 0 and n - 1) * and the quotient group Gi / Gi+1 is a cyclic group (for every i between 0 and n - 1) A metacyclic group is a polycyclic group with n ‚â§ 2, or in other words an extension of a cyclic group by a cyclic group. Examples Examples of polycyclic groups include finitely generated abelian groups, finitely generated nilpotent groups, and finite solvable groups. Anatoly Maltsev proved that solvable subgroups of the integer general linear group are polycyclic; and later Louis Auslander (1967) and Swan proved the converse, that any polycyclic group is up to isomorphism a group of integer matrices.Dmitriƒ≠ Alekseevich Suprunenko, K. A. Hirsch, Matrix groups (1976), pp. 174‚Äì5; Google Books. The holomorph of a polycyclic group is also such a group of integer matrices. Strongly polycyclic groups A group G is said to be strongly polycyclic if it is polycyclic with the added stipulation that each Gi / Gi+1 is infinitely cyclic. Clearly, a strongly polycyclic group is polycyclic. Also, any subgroup of a strongly polycyclic group is strongly polycyclic. Polycyclic-by-finite groups A virtually polycyclic group is a group that has a polycyclic subgroup of finite index, an example of a virtual property. Such a group necessarily has a normal polycyclic subgroup of finite index, and therefore such groups are also called polycyclic-by-finite groups. Although polycyclic-by-finite groups need not be solvable, they still have many of the finiteness properties of polycyclic groups; for example, they satisfy the maximal condition, and they are finitely presented and residually finite. In the textbook and some papers, an M-group refers to what is now called a polycyclic-by-finite group, which by Hirsch's theorem can also be expressed as a group which has a finite length subnormal series with each factor a finite group or an infinite cyclic group. These groups are particularly interesting because they are the only known examples of Noetherian group rings , or group rings of finite injective dimension. Hirsch length The Hirsch length or Hirsch number of a polycyclic group G is the number of infinite factors in its subnormal series. If G is a polycyclic-by-finite group, then the Hirsch length of G is the Hirsch length of a polycyclic normal subgroup H of G, where H has finite index in G. This is independent of choice of subgroup, as all such subgroups will have the same Hirsch length.

It is short-billed, foraging in pairs on small insects, particularly ants and termites, in scrub, evergreem, and deciduous forests and is noted for building its nest within the carton nests of arboreal ants in the genus Crematogaster. It was for sometime placed in the otherwise Neotropical genus Celeus but this has been shown to be a case of evolutionary convergence and molecular phylogenetic studies support its placement in the monotypic genus Micropternus.  Taxonomy and systematics  This species was formerly placed in the South American genus Celeus due to external resemblance but its disjunct distribution placed it in doubt. Studied in 2006 based on DNA sequence comparisons have confirmed that the rufous woodpecker is not closely related to Celeus and is a sister of the genus Meiglyptes and best placed within the monotypic genus Micropternus. The genus Micropternus was erected by Edward Blyth who separated it from Meiglyptes based on the short first toe with reduced claw. Other genus characters are the short bill lacking a nasal ridge. The nostrils are round and the outer tail feathers are short and about as long as the tail-coverts. Within the wide distribution range of the species, several plumage and size differences are noted among the populations which have been designed as subspecies of which about ten are widely recognized with the nominate population being from Java. * M. b. brachyurus ‚Äì Java. * M. b. humei ‚Äì along the western Himalayas has a streaked throat, greyish head and a pale face. * M. b. jerdonii [includes kanarae from the northern western ghats noted as larger by Koelz] ‚Äì peninsular India and Sri Lanka * M. b. phaioceps ‚Äì eastern Himalayas from central Nepal to Myanmar, Yunnan and southern Thailand. * M. b. fokiensis ‚Äì (has a sooty abdomen) southeast China and northern Vietnam. * M. b. holroydi ‚Äì Hainan. * M. b. williamsoni ‚Äì southern Thailand.

The rufous woodpecker is about 25 cm long, overall dark brown with dark bands on the feathers of the wing and tail giving it a black-barred appearance. The head appears paler and underparts are of a darker shade. The bill is short and black with a slight curvature of the culmen. At the nostrils the bill is narrow. The tail is short and rufous with narrow black bars but in subspecies badiosus the tail is dark with narrow rufous bars. Feather margins are pale in squamigularis and annamensis. Feathers on the neck, ears and lore are unmarked. Males have red-tipped feathers under eyes, between eye and ear coverts and on malar region sometimes forming a patch. Females and young lack the red feather tips. A weak but erectile crest is present. Juveniles appear streaked on the throat but some subspecies also have streaked throat feathers. In the field, birds can appear soiled and smell of ant secretions (Crematogaster ants are unique in having a spatulate tip to the sting that is used merely to spray fluid forward at intruders from a raised gaster) due to their foraging or nesting activities.  Behaviour and ecology  Rufous woodpeckers forage in pairs on ant nests on trees, fallen logs, dung heaps, ant, and termite hills. They have been noted to feed on ants of the genera Crematogaster and Oecophylla. Apart from insects, it has been seen taking nectar from flowers of Bombax and Erythrina and taking sap from the bases of banana fronds. The most common call is a sharp nasal, three-note, keenk-keenk- keenk but they have other calls including a long wicka and a series of wick- wick notes. They also have a distinctive drumming note which starts rapidly and then slows down in tempo. Drumming occurs through the year but increases in frequency in winter in southern India and peaking around March‚ÄìApril in Nepal. A display of unknown function between two birds facing each other involved swaying the head with bill held high and tail splayed. The breeding season is in the pre-Monsoon dry period from February to June. The rufous woodpecker is most well known for building its nest within the nest of acrobat ants (Crematogaster). Both the male and female take part in the excavation of the nest. Their feathers, particularly when nesting are said to be covered in a dark and smelly sticky fluid on which dead ants are often found sticking. Two white, matt, thin-shelled, translucent eggs are laid. The incubation period is 12 to 14 days. Both parents feed the young at nest although a 19th- century observer reported that his Indian field assistants who called the bird \\"lal sutar\\", meaning red carpenter, believed that the adults left the young to obtain ants to feed themselves. The moult occurs mainly from September to November. Bird lice of the species Penenirmus auritus have been recorded from this species in Thailand. The species has a wide habitat range and in Malaysia they have been found to persist even in places where swamp forests have been removed and replaced by oil palm plantations. Their habitat is mainly in the plains and lower hills mostly below 3000 m. This bird is not considered threatened by the IUCN.

He died when Setright was 11 years old. Setright attended Palmers Green Grammar school before studying Law at the University of London which he practised for a time but hated the profession. His National Service was served in the Royal Air Force as an air traffic controller. Writing career After writing for the engineering magazine Machine Age in the early 1960s, Setright became a motoring journalist and author, contributing to Car Magazine for more than 30 years and writing several books on cars and automotive engineering. Setright's writing style polarised readers as some considered it to be pompous and excessively esoteric, while others found his erudite style and engineering knowledge a welcome change from the usual lightweight and largely non- technical journalistic style. He had a strong enthusiasm for Bristol Cars and for Japanese engineering, in particular Honda. Setright also wrote about music, motorcycles and high-fidelity sound systems, and contributed to, among others, Punch, The Independent, Bike, Motorcycle Sport under the initials LJKS, Back Street Heroes and Car and Driver. Personal life Setright was also known for his love of smoking tobacco, in particular Sobranie Black Russian cigarettes, and for his elegant sartorial style. He was described as resembling \\"a gaunt Old Testament prophet in Savile Row clothes\\". He was an accomplished clarinet player. Setright was a practising Jew and a scholar of Judaism. He was married twice; his first wife, Christine, committed suicide in 1980. After this he spent some time in a Lubavitch community in Texas, later returning to the UK, and he settled in Surbiton, near London, where he died of cancer in 2005.

Taxonomy The yellow- crowned woodpecker was originally described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name Picus mahrattensis. It is now the only species placed in the genus Leiopicus that was introduced by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854. The specific epithet mahrattensis is from Marhatta, a historical region in the modern Indian state of Maharashtra. The genus name Leiopicus combines the Classical Greek leios meaning \\"smooth\\" or \\"beardless\\" and pikos meaning \\"woodpecker\\". The yellow- crowned woodpecker is closely related to the woodpeckers in the genus Dendrocoptes.

History The core of the Shinto Muso Ryu system has two elements, the jojutsu training forms and the twelve kenjutsu training forms. The origin of these kenjutsu forms are not clear other than it was a part of SMR from the beginning of the tradition, unlike the assimilated arts of Uchida-ryu, Ikkaku-ryu, Ittatsu-ryu and Isshin-ryu. Before creating the SMR, the founder, Muso Gonnosuke, had extensive training and experience in other martial arts. He received a Menkyo Kaiden, a license of complete transmission, in the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu tradition and he was said to have mastered secret techniques derived from the Kashima lineage of martial arts tradition. Up until the mid-19th century there seems to have been no known name for the tradition, it simply being referred to as \\"8 longsword and 4 short sword forms\\".

It was also named a Newbery Honor Book, won the Hans Christian Andersen Award, and was named an ALA Notable Children's Book ‚Äî all in 1957. Plot summary The story is set during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Japan has invaded China, and the Japanese attack the village where young Tien Pao and his family live. The family flees upriver in an abandoned sampan to the town of Hengyang. While the boy's parents go to a nearby American airfield to seek work with his younger sister, Tien Pao spends the day taking care of the sampan as well as three ducklings and the family pig, named Glory of the Republic. During a rainstorm, while Tien Pao is asleep, the sampan breaks loose from its moorings. Tien Pao is swept down the river. After a night in the raging waters, the storm abates, and Tien Pao finds himself floating in the area where his village used to be. He releases the ducklings in the river and heads for higher ground with his pig. He must travel over high mountains and through dangerous Japanese occupied territory to reach Hengyang. As he journeys home, Tien Pao begins to starve and suffer from exhaustion. He witnesses terrifying scenes of violence. Once, he sees a plane strafe a Japanese military convoy, only to be shot down over the forest. Sitting on a big rock, Tien Pao watches the entire skirmish. He later comes upon the injured American pilot (whom he had met before during his stay at Hengyang river) and helps the man return to his unit. The American pilot is a member of the Flying Tigers, and the sixty men in the unit become the \\"sixty fathers\\" who care for Tien Pao. Tien Pao exhibits a strong will to continue to try to find his parents, an incredibly difficult task; with the help of the American pilot he finds an airfield similar to the one his parents once worked on. The pilot only wishes to show Tien Pao an airfield but Tien Pao finds his mother and is at last reunited with his family.

Early life Jayajirao was born as Bhagirath Shinde, son of Hanwant Rao on 19 January 1835. The erstwhile Maharaja of Gwalior, Jankojirao II, died in 1843 without leaving an heir leading his widow Tara Bai to adopt Bhagirath Rao. Bhagirath Shinde succeeded the Gwalior gaddi under the name of Jayajirao Sindhia on 22 February 1843. Mama Sahib, the maternal uncle of Jankojirao III, was chosen as regent. Early reign and campaigns against the British Dada Khasgiwale, the comptroller of the Shinde household overthrew Mama Sahib as the regent nearly leading to a civil war. The British East India Company decided to interfere by withdrawing their Resident Colonel Alexander Speirs and demanding the surrender of Dada Khasgiwale was demanded. A British force under Sir Hugh Gough moved on Gwalior, and crossed the Chambal in December 1843. On 29 December followed the simultaneous battles of Panniar and Maharajpur, in which the Gwalior army was annihilated. Khasgiwale was arrested by the British and was sent to Benares Jail where he died in 1845. A treaty was then made, under which certain lands to the value of 1.8 million, including Chanderi District, were ceded for the upkeep of a contingent force, besides other lands for the liquidation of the expenses incurred in the war, the State army was reduced, and a Council of Regency was appointed during the minority, to act under the resident's advice. When in 1857, the Indian rebellion against the British began, Jayajirao, whose ancestors had fought and been defeated by them, was known as a good friend of the British. However, his minister, Dinkar Rao, along with Major Chartres Macpherson, the British representative to Gwalior, convinced him to initially stay neutral and later to side with the British, despite unrest amongst his troops and his people who wanted to join the rebels. On 1 June 1858 Jayajirao led his forces to Morar to fight a rebel army led by Tatya Tope, Rani Lakshmibai and Rao Sahib. This army had 7,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 12 guns while he had only 1,500 cavalry, his bodyguard of 600 men and 8 guns. He waited for their attack which came at 7 o'clock in the morning; in this attack the rebel cavalry took the guns and most of the Gwalior forces except the bodyguard went over to the rebels.

Natural fresh water springs are not very common in the area however Chittering Retreat has a substantial fresh water spring. Developments such as Chittering Retreat help provide important infrastructure to the area such as the upgrading of Morley Road, Lower Chittering and undergrounding of some power services. There is also a Catholic school in Lower Chittering, called Immaculate Heart College.

History  The area was first surveyed as farmland in 1845 as part of a property to be owned by George Moore. The opening of a railway siding in the area between 1892 and 1898 caused permanent structures to be built and by 1903 farmlots were surveyed close to the siding.

It was established in the late 19th century by Dr. Otto Walther in Nordrach in the Black Forest region of southwestern Germany. Some of Dr. Walther's uncustomary treatments included \\"overfeeding\\" (patients were given three daily plentiful feedings of milk, cheese, meat, sweets, starches, and fruits), the complete abstinence from any drugs (save morphine for the critically ill), and plentiful rest. The rooms of the clinic, located at above sea level, had an abundance of open windows to expose patients to the putative positive effects of winds. The Nordrach Clinic was small, housing a maximum of fifty patients, and very expensive. News of the successes of Nordrach soon spread and helped give rise to the sanatorium business in nearby Switzerland, a country whose landscape was much more suited to the high altitude and fresh wind regimen stressed by Nordrach. The Nordrach experiment also gave rise to several \\"mini Nordrachs\\", most notably Nordrach-in-Mendip, Nordach-on-Dee and Nordrach-in-Wales. Nordrach thrived as a sanatorium for people with tuberculosis through the early 1930s. However, as a Jew, Otto Walther came under increased scrutiny by the National Socialist (Nazi) Party after it came to power in Germany in 1933 and the clinic was eventually forced to close.

It is composed of 24 forms (kata) divided into two series. It was created by the third Shint≈ç Mus≈ç-ry≈´ (SMR) Headmaster, Matsuzaki Kinu'emon Tsunekatsu in the late 17th century.Matsui, Kenji. 1993. The History of Shindo Muso Ryu Jojutsu, translated by Hunter Armstrong (Kamuela, HI: International Hoplological Society) Ikkaku-ry≈´ juttejutsu utilizes the jutte as a way of self-defense for use against an attacker armed with a sword (katana).  History  The original tradition of Ikkaku-ry≈´ did not specialize in the jutte, but was a system of seizing/capturing arts (toritejutsu) with the jutte being one of several weapons and skills used. These weapons and arts included the war-fan (tessen), grappling (jujutsu), short-stick (teb≈ç) and short-sword (kodachi). Originally the complete Ikkaku-ry≈´ was taught in the New Just (Shint≈ç) Mus≈ç-ry≈´ branch and the Ten'ami-ry≈´ as an arresting/seizing-system for the local security force of the Kuroda domain. After the Meiji-restoration the two largest surviving branches of the Kuroda-no-jo tradition, Jigyo and Haruyoshi -branches of New Just (Shint≈ç) Mus≈ç-ry≈´, was merged and streamlined into what would become the modern day Way of the Gods (Shint≈ç) Mus≈ç-ry≈´ system led by Shiraishi Hanjiro. Of the original seizing-arts of the Ikkaku-ry≈´ only the jutte and tessen arts was incorporated into the new system.  The Jutte and tessen  The (jutte) is a baton made of iron with a small tine or prong fitted just above the handle. The gripspace of the handle is wrapped with a cord that hangs down from underneath the handle with a tassle at the end. The jutte was mainly used by police-forces of the Edo-period of Japan and is known to have had over 200 variations.: Krieger, Pascal - Jod√¥ - la voie du b√¢ton / The way of the stick (bilingual French/English), Geneva (CH) 1989, A typical tessen of the Edo-period (1603-1868). This weapon is used in tandem with the jutte in some forms of Ikkaku-ryu Ikkaku-ry≈´ fields a truncheon about 45 cm in length with a weight of about 550 grams. It has a smooth shaft ending in a handle wrapped in a coloured cord ending with a hanging tassel. A small tine is attached just above the grip. Originally the colour of the wrapping-cord indicated the social level of the wielder. The original design of the Ikkaku- ry≈´ jutte had a hexagonal shaft cross-section with the tine attached to one of the corners instead of the flat surface. The inside of the tine was also sharpened which enabled the wielder to use it for cutting if applicable. The fan (tessen) used in Ikkaku-ry≈´ is about 30 cm in length. The fan was designed to look like a regular folding-fan carried by samurai and other nobles in the samurai-era when they did not have access to their swords. These special tessens were in some cases either made totally of iron or had iron-edges thus enabling it to be a small self-defence weapon if required. Jutte methods Ikkaku-ry≈´ applies the jutte, either alone or in tandem with the tessen, in response of an attack made by a swordsman armed with a katana. The jutte is made of iron and it can block and parry swordattacks either on its own or in tandem with the tessen. The jutte can be used to catch a sword between the main shaft and the tine thus controlling the sword or even snapping it in two if applicable. After deflecting or avoiding the sword, the wielder gets within arms-length of the opponent in order to successfully strike at any part of the opponents body such as hands, wrists and head.  Training  The jutte is for the most part taught only to advanced students who have achieved a high level of proficiency in the Shinto Muso-ryu Jodo forms, though the level required is not standardized and different Jodo-organisations have different requirements. Modern exponents of Ikkaku-ry≈´ normally use all-wooden weapons in order to reduce risk of injuries during training, though this is heavily dependent on which Jodo-organisation he/she belongs to. In some groups, when a student has attained the necessary level of skill, the wooden-jutte is replaced by a real one made of metal, and the attackers wooden-sword is replaced by a metal non- sharpened sword (iait≈ç). The tessen is normally made of wood for safety- reasons even in advanced levels as the tessen is discarded in some of the forms and can present a risk when thrown. Ikkaku-ry≈´ jutte forms The modern Ikkaku-ry≈´ system fields 24 training-forms (kata) divided between 2 series called Omote and Ura. Some of the kata uses a war fan (Tessen) in tandem with the jutte. The forms of the Omote and Ura-series share the same name but are different in application.

However, the Lutheran Reformation in 1536 meant an end to Catholicism in Denmark for nearly a century and a half. In 1682, it was re-recognized by the Danish state, along with the Reformed Church and Judaism, although conversion to it from Lutheranism remained illegal. The constitution of 1849 provided for religious freedom and the Catholic Church was again allowed to spread in Denmark, but it has never grown to become more than a small minority.

It was directed by Grigori Kozintsev and , and stars Innokenty Smoktunovsky as Prince Hamlet. Background Grigori Kozintsev had been a founder member of the Russian avant-garde artist group the PPinterlanguage link|Factory of the Eccentric Actor|wd=Q3063985}} (FEKS), whose ideas were closely related to Dadaism and Futurism. In 1923 he had been planning to perform Hamlet as a pantomime in the experimental manner of FEKS, but the plan was not put into effect, and Kozintsev's energies shifted into the cinema. However, he returned to the theatre in 1941 with a Leningrad production of King Lear. Then, in 1954 Kozintsev directed a stage production of Hamlet at the Pushkin Theatre in Leningrad, using Boris Pasternak's translation; this was one of the first Soviet productions of the play in the post-Joseph Stalin era. Kozintsev also wrote extensively about Shakespeare and a major chapter in his book Shakespeare: Time and Conscience is devoted to his thoughts on Hamlet together with a historical survey of earlier interpretations. In an appendix entitled \\"Ten Years with Hamlet\\", he includes extracts from his diaries dealing with his experiences of the 1954 stage production and his 1964 film. Adaptation Kozintsev's film is faithful to the architecture of the play, but the text (based on Pasternak's translation) is heavily truncated, achieving a total running time of 2 hours 20 minutes (from a play which can last as long as four hours in full performance). The opening scene of the play is cut entirely, along with scenes 1 and 6 of Act IV, but other scenes are represented in sequence, even though some are drastically shortened. (Hamlet's final speech is reduced simply to \\"The rest is silence.\\") There is some resequencing of material in Act IV to illustrate the outwitting of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern on the voyage to England. Kozintsev seeks constantly to represent the content of the play in visual terms, and there are notable sequences which are constructed without the use of dialogue (e.g. the opening scene in which Hamlet arrives at Elsinore to join the court's mourning, and the vigil awaiting the appearance of the ghost). Unlike Laurence Olivier's 1948 film, which removed most of the play's political dimension to focus on Hamlet's inner turmoil, Kozintsev's Hamlet is as political and public as it is personal. Kozintsev observed of his predecessor: \\"Olivier cut the theme of government, which I find extremely interesting. I will not yield a single point from this line.\\" Where Olivier had narrow winding stairwells, Kozintsev has broad avenues, peopled with ambassadors and courtiers. The castle's role as a prison is emphasised. The camera frequently looks through bars and grates, and one critic has suggested that the image of Ophelia in an iron farthingale symbolises the fate of the sensitive and intelligent in the film's tough political environment. The film also shows the presence of ordinary people in ragged clothes, who are like the grave digger: good-hearted and only wishing to live peacefully. Style The camera is continually mobile and extended shots (average length 24 seconds) enable the physical exploration of the spaces of the court and castle. Of the castle itself, Kozintsev said: \\"The general view of the castle must not be filmed. The image will appear only in the unity of the sensations of Elsinore's various aspects. And its external appearance, in the montage of the sequences filmed in a variety of places\\". Many of the exteriors were filmed at the fortress of Ivangorod, on the border of Russia and Estonia. Much of the film takes place out of doors. Apart from the backdrop of the castle, the imagery of the film is dominated by elements of nature. Kozintsev saw this as a vital way in which he could give visual form to the text: \\"Strangely enough they have always sought to film Hamlet in studios, but it seems to me that the key to reincarnating Shakespeare's words in visual imagery can only be found in nature\\". \\"It seems that the basic elements of the plastic arts are formed against a background of nature. In decisive places, they should oust period stylization (of the Tudor era, and of English affectation) and express the essentials. I have in mind stone, iron, fire, earth, and sea\\". These elements are present throughout, including the opening shot in which the cliff-top castle is represented by its shadow falling across the surging waters of the sea, and the final scene in which Hamlet walks out of the dark palace to sit against the rock facing the sea as he dies. Technical specifications Although shot in black-and-white, this was the first film version of the play in a widescreen format (Sovscope, an anamorphic system similar to CinemaScope) and stereophonic sound (4-track stereo). Critical reception Innokenty Smoktunovsky as Hamlet. When the film appeared in 1964, it received a number of prizes both in the Soviet Union and abroad (see below). Its reception among British and American reviewers was generally favourable, despite the fact that this version of a prized work of English literature was not made in English. The New York Times reviewer took up this point: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation - of Shakespeare's eloquent words - is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\". The author noted the strengths of the film: [Kozintsev] \\"is concerned with engrossing the eye. And this he does with a fine achievement of pictorial plasticity and power.... Landscape and architecture, climate and atmosphere play roles in this black- and-white picture that are almost as important as those the actors play\\". In academic literature, the film has continued to receive prominent attention in studies of the methods of filming Shakespeare, especially in a play which consists so much of internal thought. The British director Peter Brook regarded the film as being of special interest, even though he had reservations about its ultimate success: \\"The Russian Hamlet has been criticized for being academic, and it is: however, it has one gigantic merit - everything in it is related to the director's search for the sense of the play - his structure is inseparable from his meaning. The strength of the film is in Kozintsev's ability to realise his own conception with clarity.... But the limitation lies in its style; when all is said and done, the Soviet Hamlet is post-Eisenstein realistic - thus super-romantic - thus, a far cry from essential Shakespeare - which is neither epic, nor barbaric, nor colorful, nor abstract nor realistic in any of our uses of the words.\\" The film was released twice in the USA (1964, 1966),‚ÄúHamlet 1964 Release Info\\".

It was fought between the South African Defence Force (SADF) and the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), an armed wing of the South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO). The South African Border War resulted in some of the largest battles on the African continent since World War II and was closely intertwined with the Angolan Civil War. Following several years of unsuccessful petitioning through the United Nations and the International Court of Justice for Namibian independence, SWAPO formed the PLAN in 1962 with material assistance from the Soviet Union, China, and sympathetic African states such as Tanzania, Ghana, and Algeria. Fighting broke out between PLAN and the South African authorities in August 1966. Between 1975 and 1988 the SADF staged massive conventional raids into Angola and Zambia to eliminate PLAN's forward operating bases. It also deployed specialist counter-insurgency units such as Koevoet and 32 Battalion trained to carry out external reconnaissance and track guerrilla movements. South African tactics became increasingly aggressive as the conflict progressed. The SADF's incursions produced Angolan casualties and occasionally resulted in severe collateral damage to economic installations regarded as vital to the Angolan economy. Ostensibly to stop these raids, but also to disrupt the growing alliance between the SADF and the National Union for the Total Independence for Angola (UNITA), which the former was arming with captured PLAN equipment, the Soviet Union backed the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) through a large contingent of military advisers and up to four billion dollars' worth of modern defence technology in the 1980s. Beginning in 1984, regular Angolan units under Soviet command were confident enough to confront the SADF. Their positions were also bolstered by thousands of Cuban troops. The state of war between South Africa and Angola briefly ended with the short-lived Lusaka Accords, but resumed in August 1985 as both PLAN and UNITA took advantage of the ceasefire to intensify their own guerrilla activity, leading to a renewed phase of FAPLA combat operations culminating in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale. The South African Border War was virtually ended by the Tripartite Accord, mediated by the United States, which committed to a withdrawal of Cuban and South African military personnel from Angola and South West Africa, respectively. PLAN launched its final guerrilla campaign in April 1989. South West Africa received formal independence as the Republic of Namibia a year later, on 21 March 1990. Despite being largely fought in neighbouring states, the South African Border War had a phenomenal cultural and political impact on South African society. The country's apartheid government devoted considerable effort towards presenting the war as part of a containment programme against regional Soviet expansionism and used it to stoke public anti-communist sentiment. It remains an integral theme in contemporary South African literature at large and Afrikaans-language works in particular, having given rise to a unique genre known as grensliteratuur (directly translated \\"border literature\\"). Nomenclature Various names have been applied to the undeclared conflict waged by South Africa in Angola and Namibia (then South West Africa) from the mid 1960s to the late 1980s. The term \\"South African Border War\\" has typically denoted the military campaign launched by the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), which took the form of sabotage and rural insurgency, as well as the external raids launched by South African troops on suspected PLAN bases inside Angola or Zambia, sometimes involving major conventional warfare against the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and its Cuban allies. The strategic situation was further complicated by the fact that South Africa occupied large swathes of Angola for extended periods in support of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), making the \\"Border War\\" an increasingly inseparable conflict from the parallel Angolan Civil War. \\"Border War\\" entered public discourse in South Africa during the late 1970s, and was adopted thereafter by the country's ruling National Party. Due to the covert nature of most South African Defence Force (SADF) operations inside Angola, the term was favoured as a means of omitting any reference to clashes on foreign soil. Where tactical aspects of various engagements were discussed, military historians simply identified the conflict as the \\"bush war\\". The South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) has described the South African Border War as the Namibian War of National Liberation and the Namibian Liberation Struggle. In the Namibian context it is also commonly referred to as the Namibian War of Independence. However, these terms have been criticised for ignoring the wider regional implications of the war and the fact that PLAN was based in, and did most of its fighting from, countries other than Namibia. Background Namibia was governed as German South West Africa, a colony of the German Empire, until World War I, when it was invaded and occupied by Allied forces under General Louis Botha. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918, a mandate system was imposed by the League of Nations to govern African and Asian territories held by Germany and the Ottoman Empire prior to the war. The mandate system was formed as a compromise between those who advocated an Allied annexation of former German and Turkish territories, and another proposition put forward by those who wished to grant them to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves. All former German and Turkish territories were classified into three types of mandates ‚Äì Class \\"A\\" mandates, predominantly in the Middle East, Class \\"B\\" mandates, which encompassed central Africa, and Class \\"C\\" mandates, which were reserved for the most sparsely populated or least developed German colonies: South West Africa, German New Guinea, and the Pacific islands. Owing to their small size, geographic remoteness, low population densities, or physical contiguity to the mandatory itself, Class \\"C\\" mandates could be administered as integral provinces of the countries to which they were entrusted. Nevertheless, the bestowal of a mandate by the League of Nations did not confer full sovereignty, only the responsibility of administering it. In principle mandating countries were only supposed to hold these former colonies \\"in trust\\" for their inhabitants, until they were sufficiently prepared for their own self-determination. Under these terms, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand were granted the German Pacific islands, and the Union of South Africa received South West Africa. It soon became apparent the South African government had interpreted the mandate as a veiled annexation. In September 1922, South African prime minister Jan Smuts testified before the League of Nations Mandate Commission that South West Africa was being fully incorporated into the Union and should be regarded, for all practical purposes, as a fifth province of South Africa. According to Smuts, this constituted \\"annexation in all but in name\\". Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the League of Nations complained that of all the mandatory powers South Africa was the most delinquent with regards to observing the terms of its mandate. The Mandate Commission vetoed a number of ambitious South African policy decisions, such as proposals to nationalise South West African railways or alter the preexisting borders. Sharp criticism was also leveled at South Africa's disproportionate spending on the local white population, which the former defended as obligatory since white South West Africans were taxed the heaviest. The League adopted the argument that no one segment of any mandate's population was entitled to favourable treatment over another, and the terms under which the mandate had been granted made no provision for special obligation towards whites. It pointed out that there was little evidence of progress being made towards political self-determination; just prior to World War II South Africa and the League remained at an impasse over this dispute. =Legality of South West Africa, 1946‚Äì1960= After World War II, Jan Smuts headed the South African delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization. As a result of this conference, the League of Nations was formally superseded by the United Nations (UN) and former League mandates by a trusteeship system. Article 77 of the United Nations Charter stated that UN trusteeship \\"shall apply...to territories now held under mandate\\"; furthermore, it would \\"be a matter of subsequent agreement as to which territories in the foregoing territories will be brought under the trusteeship system and under what terms\\". Smuts was suspicious of the proposed trusteeship, largely because of the vague terminology in Article 77. Heaton Nicholls, the South African high commissioner in the United Kingdom and a member of the Smuts delegation to the UN, addressed the newly formed UN General Assembly on 17 January 1946. Nicholls stated that the legal uncertainty of South West Africa's situation was retarding development and discouraging foreign investment; however, self-determination for the time being was impossible since the territory was too undeveloped and underpopulated to function as a strong independent state. In the second part of the first session of the General Assembly, the floor was handed to Smuts, who declared that the mandate was essentially a part of the South African territory and people. Smuts informed the General Assembly that it had already been so thoroughly incorporated with South Africa a UN-sanctioned annexation was no more than a necessary formality. The Smuts delegation's request for the termination of the mandate and permission to annex South West Africa was not well received by the General Assembly. Five other countries, including three major colonial powers, had agreed to place their mandates under the trusteeship of the UN, at least in principle; South Africa alone refused. Most delegates insisted it was undesirable to endorse the annexation of a mandated territory, especially when all of the others had entered trusteeship. Thirty- seven member states voted to block a South African annexation of South West Africa; nine abstained. In Pretoria, right-wing politicians reacted with outrage at what they perceived as unwarranted UN interference in the South West Africa affair. The National Party dismissed the UN as unfit to meddle with South Africa's policies or discuss its administration of the mandate. One National Party speaker, Eric Louw, demanded that South West Africa be annexed unilaterally. During the South African general election, 1948, the National Party was swept into power, newly appointed Prime Minister Daniel Malan prepared to adopt a more aggressive stance concerning annexation, and Louw was named ambassador to the UN. During an address in Windhoek, Malan reiterated his party's position that South Africa would annex the mandate before surrendering it to an international trusteeship. The following year a formal statement was issued to the General Assembly which proclaimed that South Africa had no intention of complying with trusteeship, nor was it obligated to release new information or reports pertaining to its administration. Simultaneously, the South West Africa Affairs Administration Act, 1949, was passed by South African parliament. The new legislation gave white South West Africans parliamentary representation and the same political rights as white South Africans. The UN General Assembly responded by deferring to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was to issue an advisory opinion on the international status of South West Africa. The ICJ ruled that South West Africa was still being governed as a mandate; hence, South Africa was not legally obligated to surrender it to the UN trusteeship system if it did not recognise the mandate system had lapsed, conversely, however, it was still bound by the provisions of the original mandate. Adherence to these provisions meant South Africa was not empowered to unilaterally modify the international status of South West Africa. Malan and his government rejected the court's opinion as irrelevant. The UN formed a Committee on South West Africa, which issued its own independent reports regarding the administration and development of that territory. The Committee's reports became increasingly scathing of South African officials when the National Party imposed its harsh system of racial segregation and stratification‚Äîapartheid‚Äîon South West Africa. In 1958, the UN established a Good Offices Committee which continued to invite South Africa to bring South West Africa under trusteeship. The Good Offices Committee proposed a partition of the mandate, allowing South Africa to annex the southern portion while either granting independence to the north, including the densely populated Ovamboland region, or administering it as an international trust territory. The proposal met with overwhelming opposition in the General Assembly; fifty-six nations voted against it. Any further partition of South West Africa was rejected out of hand. =Internal opposition to South African rule= Mounting internal opposition to apartheid played an instrumental role in the development and militancy of a South West African nationalist movement throughout the mid to late 1950s. The 1952 Defiance Campaign, a series of nonviolent protests launched by the African National Congress against pass laws, inspired the formation of South West African student unions opposed to apartheid. In 1955, their members organised the South West African Progressive Association (SWAPA), chaired by Uatja Kaukuetu, to campaign for South West African independence. Although SWAPA did not garner widespread support beyond intellectual circles, it was the first nationalist body claiming to support the interests of all black South West Africans, irrespective of tribe or language. SWAPA's activists were predominantly Herero students, schoolteachers, and other members of the emerging black intelligentsia in Windhoek. Meanwhile, the Ovamboland People's Congress (later the Ovamboland People's Organisation, or OPO) was formed by nationalists among partly urbanised migrant Ovambo labourers in Cape Town. The OPO's constitution cited the achievement of a UN trusteeship and ultimate South West African independence as its primary goals. A unified movement was proposed that would include the politicisation of Ovambo contract workers from northern South West Africa as well as the Herero students, which resulted in the unification of SWAPA and the OPO as the South West African National Union (SWANU) on 27 September 1959. In December 1959, the South African government announced that it would forcibly relocate all residents of Old Location, a black neighbourhood located near Windhoek's city center, in accordance with apartheid legislation. SWANU responded by organising mass demonstrations and a bus boycott on 10 December, and in the ensuing confrontation South African police opened fire, killing eleven protestors. In the wake of the Old Location incident, the OPO split from SWANU, citing differences with the organisation's Herero leadership, then petitioning UN delegates in New York City. As the UN and potential foreign supporters reacted sensitively to any implications of tribalism and had favoured SWANU for its claim to represent the South West African people as a whole, the OPO was likewise rebranded the South West African People's Organisation. It later opened its ranks to all South West Africans sympathetic to its aims. Sam Nujoma, founder and leader of SWAPO and its OPO predecessor. SWAPO leaders soon went abroad to mobilise support for their goals within the international community and newly independent African states in particular. The movement scored a major diplomatic success when it was recognised by Tanzania and allowed to open an office in Dar es Salaam. SWAPO's first manifesto, released in July 1960, was remarkably similar to SWANU's. Both advocated the abolition of colonialism and all forms of racialism, the promotion of Pan-Africanism, and called for the \\"economic, social, and cultural advancement\\" of South West Africans. However, SWAPO went a step further by demanding immediate independence under black majority rule, to be granted at a date no later than 1963. The SWAPO manifesto also promised universal suffrage, sweeping welfare programmes, free healthcare, free public education, the nationalisation of all major industry, and the forcible redistribution of foreign-owned land \\"in accordance with African communal ownership principles\\". Compared to SWANU, SWAPO's potential for wielding political influence within South West Africa was limited, and it was likelier to accept armed insurrection as the primary means of achieving its goals accordingly. SWAPO leaders also argued that a decision to take up arms against the South Africans would demonstrate their superior commitment to the nationalist cause. This would also distinguish SWAPO from SWANU in the eyes of international supporters as the genuine vanguard of the Namibian independence struggle, and the legitimate recipient of any material assistance that was forthcoming. Modelled after Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress, the South West African Liberation Army (SWALA) was formed by SWAPO in 1962. The first seven SWALA recruits were sent from Dar Es Salaam to Egypt and the Soviet Union, where they received military instruction. Upon their return they began training guerrillas at a makeshift camp established for housing South West African refugees in Kongwa, Tanzania. =Cold War tensions and the border militarisation= The increasing likelihood of armed conflict in South West Africa had strong international foreign policy implications, for both Western Europe and the Soviet bloc. Prior to the late 1950s, South Africa's defence policy had been influenced by international Cold War politics, including the domino theory and fears of a conventional Soviet military threat to the strategic Cape trade route between the south Atlantic and Indian oceans. Noting that the country had become the world's principal source of uranium, the South African Department of External Affairs reasoned that \\"on this account alone, therefore, South Africa is bound to be implicated in any war between East and West\\". Prime Minister Malan took the position that colonial Africa was being directly threatened by the Soviets, or at least by Soviet-backed communist agitation, and this was only likely to increase whatever the result of another European war. Malan promoted an African Pact, similar to NATO, headed by South Africa and the Western colonial powers accordingly. The concept failed due to international opposition to apartheid and suspicion of South African military overtures in the British Commonwealth. South Africa's involvement in the Korean War produced a significant warming of relations between Malan and the United States, despite American criticism of apartheid. Until the early 1960s, South African strategic and military support was considered an integral component of U.S. foreign policy in Africa's southern subcontinent, and there was a steady flow of defence technology from Washington to Pretoria. American and Western European interest in the defence of Africa from a hypothetical, external communist invasion dissipated after it became clear that the nuclear arms race was making global conventional war increasingly less likely. Emphasis shifted towards preventing communist subversion and infiltration via proxy rather than overt Soviet aggression. Equipment of Soviet origin supplied to SWAPO. From left to right: satchel, Dragunov sniper rifle, PG-7V RPG projectile, and RPG-7 launcher. The advent of global decolonisation and the subsequent rise in prominence of the Soviet Union among several newly independent African states, was viewed with wariness by the South African government. National Party politicians began warning it would only be a matter of time before they were faced with a Soviet-directed insurgency on their borders. Outlying regions in South West Africa, namely the Caprivi Strip, became the focus of massive SADF air and ground training manoeuvres, as well as heightened border patrols. A year before SWAPO made the decision to send its first SWALA recruits abroad for guerrilla training, South Africa established fortified police outposts along the Caprivi Strip for the express purpose of deterring insurgents. When SWALA cadres armed with Soviet weapons and training began to make their appearance in South West Africa, the National Party believed its fears of a local Soviet proxy force had finally been realised. The Soviet Union took a keen interest in Africa's independence movements and initially hoped that the cultivation of socialist client states on the continent would deny their economic and strategic resources to the West. Soviet training of SWALA was thus not confined to tactical matters but extended to Marxist-Leninist political theory, and the procedures for establishing an effective political-military infrastructure. In addition to training, the Soviets quickly became SWALA's leading supplier of arms and money. Weapons supplied to SWALA between 1962 and 1966 included PPSh-41 submachine guns and TT-33 pistols, which were well-suited to the insurgents' unconventional warfare strategy. Despite its burgeoning relationship with SWAPO, the Soviet Union did not regard Southern Africa as a major strategic priority in the mid 1960s, due to its preoccupation elsewhere on the continent and in the Middle East. Nevertheless, the perception of South Africa as a regional Western ally and a bastion of neocolonialism helped fuel Soviet backing for the nationalist movement. Moscow also approved of SWAPO's decision to adopt guerrilla warfare because it was not optimistic about any solution to the South West Africa problem short of revolutionary struggle. This was in marked contrast to the Western governments, which opposed the formation of SWALA and turned down the latter's requests for military aid.  The insurgency begins, 1964‚Äì1974  =Early guerrilla incursions= In November 1960, Ethiopia and Liberia had formally petitioned the ICJ for a binding judgement, rather than an advisory opinion, on whether South Africa remained fit to govern South West Africa. Both nations made it clear that they considered the implementation of apartheid to be a violation of Pretoria's obligations as a mandatory power. The National Party government rejected the claim on the grounds that Ethiopia and Liberia lacked sufficient legal interest to present a case concerning South West Africa. This argument suffered a major setback on 21 December 1962 when the ICJ ruled that as former League of Nations member states, both parties had a right to institute the proceedings. Around March 1962 SWAPO president Sam Nujoma visited the party's refugee camps across Tanzania, describing his recent petitions for South West African independence at the Non-Aligned Movement and the UN. He pointed out that independence was unlikely in the foreseeable future, predicting a \\"long and bitter struggle\\". Nujoma personally directed two exiles in Dar es Salaam, Lucas Pohamba and Elia Muatale, to return to South West Africa, infiltrate Ovamboland and send back more potential recruits for SWALA. Over the next few years Pohamba and Muatale successfully recruited hundreds of volunteers from the Ovamboland countryside, most of whom were shipped to Eastern Europe for guerrilla training. Between July 1962 and October 1963 SWAPO negotiated military alliances with other anti-colonial movements, namely in Angola. It also absorbed the separatist Caprivi African National Union (CANU), which was formed to combat South African rule in the Caprivi Strip. Outside the Soviet bloc, Egypt continued training SWALA personnel. By 1964 others were also being sent to Ghana, Algeria, the People's Republic of China, and North Korea for military instruction. In June of that year, SWAPO confirmed that it was irrevocably committed to the course of armed revolution. The formation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)'s Liberation Committee further strengthened SWAPO's international standing and ushered in an era of unprecedented political decline for SWANU. The Liberation Committee had obtained approximately ¬£20,000 in obligatory contributions from OAU member states; these funds were offered to both South West African nationalist movements. However, as SWANU was unwilling to guarantee its share of the ¬£20,000 would be used for armed struggle, this grant was awarded to SWAPO instead. The OAU then withdrew recognition from SWANU, leaving SWAPO as the sole beneficiary of pan-African legitimacy. With OAU assistance, SWAPO opened diplomatic offices in Lusaka, Cairo, and London. SWANU belatedly embarked on a ten year programme to raise its own guerrilla army. In September 1965, the first cadre of six SWALA guerrillas, identified simply as \\"Group 1\\", departed the Kongwa refugee camp to infiltrate South West Africa. Group 1 trekked first into Angola, before crossing the border into the Caprivi Strip. Encouraged by South Africa's apparent failure to detect the initial incursion, larger cadres made their own infiltration attempts in February and March 1966. The second cadre, \\"Group 2\\", was led by Leonard Philemon Shuuya, also known by the nom de guerre \\"Castro\\" or \\"Leonard Nangolo\\". Group 2 apparently become lost in Angola before it was able to cross the border, and the cadre dispersed after an incident in which the guerrillas killed two shopkeepers and a vagrant. Three were arrested by the Portuguese colonial authorities in Angola, working off tips received from local civilians. Another eight, including Shuuya, had been captured between March and May by the South African police, apparently in Kavangoland. Shuuya later resurfaced at Kongwa, claiming to have escaped his captors after his arrest. He helped plan two further incursions: a third SWALA group entered Ovamboland that July, while a fourth was scheduled to follow in September. On 18 July 1966, the ICJ ruled that it had no authority to decide on the South West African affair. Furthermore, the court found that while Ethiopia and Liberia had locus standi to institute proceedings on the matter, neither had enough vested legal interest in South West Africa to entitle them to a judgement of merits. This ruling was met with great indignation by SWAPO and the OAU. SWAPO officials immediately issued a statement from Dar es Salaam declaring that they now had \\"no alternative but to rise in arms\\" and \\"cross rivers of blood\\" in their march towards freedom. Upon receiving the news SWALA escalated its insurgency. Its third cadre, which had infiltrated Ovamboland in July, attacked white-owned farms, traditional Ovambo leaders perceived as South African agents, and a border post. The guerrillas set up camp at Omugulugwombashe, one of five potential bases identified by SWALA's initial reconnaissance team as appropriate sites to train future recruits. Here, they drilled up to thirty local volunteers between September 1965 and August 1966. South African intelligence became aware of the camp by mid 1966 and identified its general location. On 26 August 1966, the first major clash of the conflict took place when South African paratroops and paramilitary police units executed Operation Blouwildebees to capture or kill the insurgents. SWALA had dug trenches around Omugulugwombashe for defensive purposes, but was taken by surprise and most of the insurgents quickly overpowered. SWALA suffered 2 dead, 1 wounded, and 8 captured; the South Africans suffered no casualties. This engagement is widely regarded in South Africa as the start of the Border War, and according to SWAPO, officially marked the beginning of its revolutionary armed struggle. Operation Blouwildebees triggered accusations of treachery within SWALA's senior ranks. According to SADF accounts, an unidentified informant had accompanied the security forces during the attack. Sam Nujoma asserted that one of the eight guerrillas from the second cadre who were captured in Kavangoland was a South African mole. Suspicion immediately fell on Leonard \\"Castro\\" Shuuya. SWALA suffered a second major reversal on 18 May 1967, when Tobias Hainyeko, its commander, was killed by the South African police. Heinyeko and his cadre had been attempting to cross the Zambezi River, as part of a general survey aimed at opening new lines of communication between the front lines in South West Africa and SWAPO's political leadership in Tanzania. They were intercepted by a South African patrol, and the ensuing firefight left Heinyeko dead and two policemen seriously wounded. Rumours again abounded that Shuuya was responsible, resulting in his dismissal and subsequent imprisonment. In the weeks following the raid on Omugulugwombashe, South Africa had detained thirty-seven SWAPO politicians, namely Andimba Toivo ya Toivo, Johnny Otto, Nathaniel Maxuilili, and Jason Mutumbulua. Together with the captured SWALA guerrillas they were jailed in Pretoria and held there until July 1967, when all were charged retroactively under the Terrorism Act. The state prosecuted the accused as Marxist revolutionaries seeking to establish a Soviet-backed regime in South West Africa. In what became known as the \\"1967 Terrorist Trial\\", six of the accused were found guilty of committing violence in the act of insurrection, with the remainder being convicted for armed intimidation, or receiving military training for the purpose of insurrection. During the trial, the defendants unsuccessfully argued against allegations that they were privy to an external communist plot. All but three received sentences ranging from five years to life imprisonment on Robben Island. =Expansion of the war effort and mine warfare= The defeat at Omugulugwombashe and subsequent loss of Tobias Hainyeko forced SWALA to reevaluate its tactics. Guerrillas began operating in larger groups to increase their chances of surviving encounters with the security forces, and refocused their efforts on infiltrating the civilian population. Disguised as peasants, SWALA cadres could acquaint themselves with the terrain and observe South African patrols without arousing suspicion. This was also a logistical advantage because they could only take what supplies they could carry while in the field; otherwise, the guerrillas remained dependent on sympathetic civilians for food, water, and other necessities. On 29 July 1967, the SADF received intelligence that a large number of SWALA forces were congregated at Sacatxai, a settlement almost a hundred and thirty kilometres north of the border inside Angola. South African T-6 Harvard warplanes bombed Sacatxai on 1 August. Most of their intended targets were able to escape, and in October 1968 two SWALA units crossed the border into Ovamboland. This incursion was no more productive than the others and by the end of the year 178 insurgents had been either killed or apprehended by the police. Throughout the 1950s and much of the 1960s, a limited military service system by lottery was implemented in South Africa to comply with the needs of national defence. Around mid 1967 the National Party government established universal conscription for all white South African men as the SADF expanded to meet the growing insurgent threat. From January 1968 onwards there would be two yearly intakes of national servicemen undergoing nine months of military training. The air strike on Sacatxai also marked a fundamental shift in South African tactics, as the SADF had for the first time indicated a willingness to strike at SWALA on foreign soil. Although Angola was then an overseas province of Portugal, Lisbon granted the SADF's request to mount punitive campaigns across the border. In May 1967 South Africa established a new facility at Rundu to coordinate joint air operations between the SADF and the Portuguese Armed Forces, and posted two permanent liaison officers at Menongue and Cuito Cuanavale. As the war intensified, South Africa's case for annexation in the international community continued to decline, coinciding with an unparalleled wave of sympathy for SWAPO. Despite the ICJ's advisory opinions to the contrary, as well as the dismissal of the case presented by Ethiopia and Liberia, the UN declared that South Africa had failed in its obligations to ensure the moral and material well-being of the indigenous inhabitants of South West Africa, and had thus disavowed its own mandate. The UN thereby assumed that the mandate was terminated, which meant South Africa had no further right to administer the territory, and that henceforth South West Africa would come under the direct responsibility of the General Assembly. The post of United Nations Commissioner for South West Africa was created, as well as an ad hoc council, to recommend practical means for local administration. South Africa maintained it did not recognise the jurisdiction of the UN with regards to the mandate and refused visas to the commissioner or the council. On 12 June 1968, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which proclaimed that, in accordance with the desires of its people, South West Africa be renamed Namibia. United Nations Security Council Resolution 269, adopted in August 1969, declared South Africa's continued occupation of \\"Namibia\\" illegal. In recognition of the UN's decision, SWALA was renamed the People's Liberation Army of Namibia. Ohangwena, Ovamboland, 1970s. Columns of vehicles like these were the primary target for PLAN ambushes and mines. To regain the military initiative, the adoption of mine warfare as an integral strategy of PLAN was discussed at a 1969‚Äì70 SWAPO consultative congress held in Tanzania. PLAN's leadership backed the initiative to deploy land mines as a means of compensating for its inferiority in most conventional aspects to the South African security forces. Shortly afterwards, PLAN began acquiring TM-46 mines from the Soviet Union, which were designed for anti-tank purposes, and produced some homemade \\"box mines\\" with TNT for anti-personnel use. The mines were strategically placed along roads to hamper police convoys or throw them into disarray prior to an ambush; guerrillas also laid others along their infiltration routes on the long border with Angola. The proliferation of mines in South West Africa initially resulted in heavy police casualties and would become one of the most defining features of PLAN's war effort for the next two decades. On 2 May 1971 a police van struck a mine, most likely a TM-46, in the Caprivi Strip. The resulting explosion blew a crater in the road about two metres in diameter and sent the vehicle airborne, killing two senior police officers and injuring nine others. This was the first mine-related incident recorded on South West African soil. In October 1971 another police vehicle detonated a mine outside Katima Mulilo, wounding four constables. The following day, a fifth constable was mortally injured when he stepped on a second mine laid directly alongside the first. This reflected a new PLAN tactic of laying anti-personnel mines parallel to their anti-tank mines to kill policemen or soldiers either engaging in preliminary mine detection or inspecting the scene of a previous blast. In 1972 South Africa acknowledged that two more policemen had died and another three had been injured as a result of mines. The proliferation of mines in the Caprivi and other rural areas posed a serious concern to the South African government, as they were relatively easy for a PLAN cadre to conceal and plant with minimal chance of detection. Sweeping the roads for mines with hand held mine detectors was possible, but too slow and tedious to be a practical means of ensuring swift police movement or keeping routes open for civilian use. The SADF possessed some mine clearance equipment, including flails and ploughs mounted on tanks, but these were not considered practical either. The sheer distances of road vulnerable to PLAN sappers every day was simply too vast for daily detection and clearance efforts. For the SADF and the police, the only other viable option was the adoption of armoured personnel carriers with mine-proof hulls that could move quickly on roads with little risk to their passengers even if a mine was encountered. This would evolve into a new class of military vehicle, the mine resistant and ambush protected vehicle (MRAP). By the end of 1972, the South African police were carrying out most of their patrols in the Caprivi Strip with mineproofed vehicles. =Political unrest in Ovamboland= United Nations Security Council Resolution 283 was passed in June 1970 calling for all UN member states to close, or refrain from establishing, diplomatic or consular offices in South West Africa. The resolution also recommended disinvestment, boycotts, and voluntary sanctions of that territory as long as it remained under South African rule. In light of these developments, the Security Council sought the advisory opinion of the ICJ on the \\"legal consequences for states of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia\\". There was initial opposition to this course of action from SWAPO and the OAU, because their delegates feared another inconclusive ruling like the one in 1966 would strengthen South Africa's case for annexation. Nevertheless, the prevailing opinion at the Security Council was that since the composition of judges had been changed since 1966, a ruling in favour of the nationalist movement was more likely. At the UN's request, SWAPO was permitted to lobby informally at the court and was even offered an observer presence in the courtroom itself. On 21 June 1971, the ICJ reversed its earlier decision not to rule on the legality of South Africa's mandate, and expressed the opinion that any continued perpetuation of said mandate was illegal. Furthermore, the court found that Pretoria was under obligation to withdraw its administration immediately and that if it failed to do so, UN member states would be compelled to refrain from any political or business dealings which might imply recognition of the South African government's presence there. On the same day the ICJ's ruling was made public, South African prime minister B. J. Vorster rejected it as \\"politically motivated\\", with no foundation in fact. However, the decision inspired the bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran Ovambo-Kavango Church to draw up an open letter to Vorster denouncing apartheid and South Africa's continued rule. This letter was read in every black Lutheran congregation in the territory, and in a number of Catholic and Anglican parishes elsewhere. The consequence of the letter's contents was increased militancy on the part of the black population, especially among the Ovambo people, who made up the bulk of SWAPO's supporters. Throughout the year there were mass demonstrations against the South African government held in many Ovamboland schools. In December 1971, Jannie de Wet, Commissioner for the Indigenous Peoples of South West Africa, sparked off a general strike by 15,000 Ovambo workers in Walvis Bay when he made a public statement defending the territory's controversial contract labour regulations. The strike quickly spread to municipal workers in Windhoek, and from there to the diamond, copper and tin mines, especially those at Tsumeb, Grootfontein, and Oranjemund. Later in the month, 25,000 Ovambo farm labourers joined what had become a nationwide strike affecting half the total workforce. The South African police responded by arresting some of the striking workers and forcibly deporting the others to Ovamboland. On 10 January 1972, an ad hoc strike committee led by Johannes Nangutuuala, was formed to negotiate with the South African government; the strikers demanded an end to contract labour, freedom to apply for jobs according to skill and interest and to quit a job if so desired, freedom to have a worker bring his family with him from Ovamboland while taking a job elsewhere, and for equal pay with white workers. The strike was later brought to an end after the South African government agreed to several concessions which were endorsed by Nangutuuala, including the implementation of uniform working hours and allowing workers to change jobs. Responsibility for labour recruitment was also transferred to the tribal authorities in Ovamboland. Thousands of the sacked Ovambo workers remained dissatisfied with these terms and refused to return to work. They attacked tribal headmen, vandalised stock control posts and government offices, and tore down about a hundred kilometres of fencing along the border, which they claimed obstructed itinerant Ovambos from grazing their cattle freely. The unrest also fueled discontent among Kwanyama-speaking Ovambos in Angola, who destroyed cattle vaccination stations and schools and attacked four border posts, killing and injuring some SADF personnel as well as members of a Portuguese militia unit. South Africa responded by declaring a state of emergency in Ovamboland on 4 February. A media blackout was imposed, white civilians evacuated further south, public assembly rights revoked, and the security forces empowered to detain suspicious persons indefinitely. Police reinforcements were sent to the border, and in the ensuing crackdown they arrested 213 Ovambos. South Africa was sufficiently alarmed at the violence to deploy a large SADF contingent as well. They were joined by Portuguese troops who moved south from across the border to assist them. By the end of March order had been largely restored and most of the remaining strikers returned to work. Flag of Ovamboland, which was granted self- governing status as an autonomous bantustan in 1973. South Africa blamed SWAPO for instigating the strike and subsequent unrest. While acknowledging that a significant percentage of the strikers were SWAPO members and supporters, the party's acting president Nathaniel Maxuilili noted that reform of South West African labour laws had been a longstanding aspiration of the Ovambo workforce, and suggested the strike had been organised shortly after the crucial ICJ ruling because they hoped to take advantage of its publicity to draw greater attention to their grievances. The strike also had a politicising effect on much of the Ovambo population, as the workers involved later turned to wider political activity and joined SWAPO. Around 20,000 strikers did not return to work but fled to other countries, mostly Zambia, where some were recruited as guerrillas by PLAN. Support for PLAN also increased among the rural Ovamboland peasantry, who were for the most part sympathetic with the strikers and resentful of their traditional chiefs' active collaboration with the police. The following year, South Africa transferred self-governing authority to Chief Fillemon Elifas Shuumbwa and the Ovambo legislature, effectively granting Ovamboland a limited form of home rule. Voter turnout at the legislative elections was exceedingly poor, due in part to antipathy towards the local Ovamboland government and a SWAPO boycott of the polls. =The police withdrawal= Swelled by thousands of new recruits and an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of heavy weapons, PLAN undertook more direct confrontations with the security forces in 1973. Insurgent activity took the form of ambushes and selective target attacks, particularly in the Caprivi near the Zambian border. On the evening of 26 January 1973 a heavily armed cadre of about 50 PLAN insurgents attacked a police base at Singalamwe, Caprivi with mortars, machine guns, and a single tube, man portable rocket launcher. The police were ill-equipped to repel the attack and the base soon caught fire due to the initial rocket bombardment, which incapacitated both the senior officer and his second in command. This marked the beginning of a new phase of the South African Border War in which the scope and intensity of PLAN raids was greatly increased. By the end of 1973, PLAN's insurgency had engulfed six regions: Caprivi, Ovamboland, Kaokoland, and Kavangoland. It had also successfully recruited another 2,400 Ovambo and 600 Caprivian guerrillas. PLAN reports from late 1973 indicate that the militants planned to open up two new fronts in central South West Africa and carry out acts of urban insurrection in Windhoek, Walvis Bay, and other major urban centres. SADF sentries on border duty, monitoring the \\"Cutline\\" for guerrilla cadres. Until 1973, the South African Border War was perceived as a matter of law enforcement rather than a military conflict, reflecting a trend among Anglophone Commonwealth states to regard police as the principal force in the suppression of insurgencies. The South African police did have paramilitary capabilities, and had previously seen action during the Rhodesian Bush War. However, the failure of the police to prevent the escalation of the war in South West Africa led to the SADF assuming responsibility for all counter- insurgency campaigns on 1 April 1974. The last regular South African police units were withdrawn from South West Africa's borders three months later, in June. At this time there were about 15,000 SADF personnel being deployed to take their place. The SADF's budget was increased by nearly 150% between 1973 and 1974 accordingly. In August 1974, the SADF cleared a buffer strip about five kilometres wide which ran parallel to the Angolan border and was intensely patrolled and monitored for signs of PLAN infiltration. This would become known as \\"the Cutline\\". The Angolan front, 1975‚Äì1977 On 24 April 1974, the Carnation Revolution ousted Marcelo Caetano and Portugal's right- wing Estado Novo government, sounding the death knell for the Portuguese Empire. The Carnation Revolution was followed by a period of instability in Angola, which threatened to erupt into civil war, and South Africa was forced to consider the unpalatable likelihood that a Soviet-backed regime there allied with SWAPO would in turn create increased military pressure on South West Africa. PLAN incursions from Angola were already beginning to spike due to the cessation of patrols and active operations there by the Portuguese. In the last months of 1974 Portugal announced its intention to grant Angola independence and embarked a series of hasty efforts to negotiate a power- sharing accord, the Alvor Agreement, between rival Angolan nationalists. There were three disparate nationalist movements then active in Angola, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). The three movements had all participated in the Angolan War of Independence and shared a common goal of liberating the country from colonial rule, but also claimed unique ethnic support bases, different ideological inclinations, and their own conflicting ties to foreign parties and governments. Although each possessed vaguely socialist leanings, the MPLA was the only party which enjoyed close ties to the Soviet Union and was openly committed to Marxist policies. Its adherence to the concept of an exclusive one-party state alienated it from the FNLA and UNITA, which began portraying themselves as anti-communist and pro-Western in orientation. South Africa believed that if the MPLA succeeded in seizing power it would support PLAN militarily and lead to an unprecedented escalation of the fighting in South West Africa. While the collapse of the Portuguese colonial state was inevitable, Pretoria hoped to install a moderate anti-communist government in its place, which in turn would continue cooperating with the SADF and work to deny PLAN bases on Angolan soil. This led Prime Minister Vorster and South African intelligence chief Hendrik van den Bergh to embark on a major covert action programme in Angola, Operation Savannah. Arms and money were secretly funnelled to the FNLA and UNITA, in exchange for their promised support against PLAN. Jonas Savimbi, UNITA's president, claimed he knew where PLAN's camps in southern Angola were located and was prepared to \\"attack, detain, or expel\\" PLAN fighters. FNLA president Holden Roberto made similar assurances and promised that he would grant the SADF freedom of movement in Angola to pursue PLAN. =Operation Savannah= Within days of the Alvor Agreement, the Central Intelligence Agency launched its own programme, Operation IA Feature, to arm the FNLA, with the stated objective of \\"prevent[ing] an easy victory by Soviet-backed forces in Angola\\". The United States was searching for regional allies to take part in Operation IA Feature and perceived South Africa as the \\"ideal solution\\" in defeating the pro-Soviet MPLA. With tacit American encouragement, the FNLA and UNITA began massing large numbers of troops in southern and northern Angola, respectively, in an attempt to gain tactical superiority. The transitional government installed by the Alvor Agreement disintegrated and the MPLA requested support from its communist allies. Between February and April 1975 the MPLA's armed wing, the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA), received shipments of Soviet arms, mostly channelled through Cuba or the People's Republic of the Congo. At the end of May FAPLA personnel were being instructed in their use by a contingent of about 200 Cuban military advisers. Over the next two months they proceeded to inflict a series of crippling defeats on the FNLA and UNITA, which were driven out of the Angolan capital, Luanda. To South African Minister of Defence P.W. Botha it was evident that the MPLA had gained the upper hand; in a memo dated late June 1975 he observed that the MPLA could \\"for all intents and purposes be considered the presumptive ultimate rulers of Angola...only drastic and unforeseeable developments could alter such an income.\\" Skirmishes at the Calueque hydroelectric dam, which supplied electricity to South West Africa, gave Botha the opportunity to escalate the SADF's involvement in Angola. On 9 August, a thousand South African troops crossed into Angola and occupied Calueque. While their public objective was to protect the hydroelectric installation and the lives of the civilian engineers employed there, the SADF was also intent on searching out PLAN cadres and weakening FAPLA. South African troops in nondescript uniforms during Operation Savannah. A watershed in the Angolan conflict was the South African decision on 25 October to commit 2,500 of its own troops to battle. Larger quantities of more sophisticated arms had been delivered to FAPLA by this point, such as T-34-85 tanks, wheeled armoured personnel carriers, towed rocket launchers and field guns. While most of this hardware was antiquated, it proved extremely effective, given the fact that most of FAPLA's opponents consisted of disorganised, under-equipped militias. In early October, FAPLA launched a major combined arms offensive on UNITA's national headquarters at Nova Lisboa, which was only repelled with considerable difficulty and assistance from a small team of SADF advisers. It became evident to the SADF that neither UNITA or the FNLA possessed armies capable of taking and holding territory, as their fighting strength depended on militias which excelled only in guerrilla warfare. South Africa would need its own combat troops to not only defend its allies, but carry out a decisive counter-offensive against FAPLA. This proposal was approved by the South African government on the condition that only a small, covert task force would be permitted. SADF personnel participating in offensive operations were told to pose as mercenaries. They were stripped of any identifiable equipment, including their dog tags, and re- issued with nondescript uniforms and weapons impossible to trace. On 22 October the SADF airlifted more personnel and a squadron of Eland armoured cars to bolster UNITA positions at Silva Porto. Within days they had overrun considerable territory and captured several strategic settlements. The SADF's advance was so rapid that it often succeeding in driving FAPLA out of two or three towns in a single day. Eventually the South African expeditionary force split into three separate columns of motorised infantry and armoured cars to cover more ground. Pretoria intended for the SADF to help the FNLA and UNITA win the civil war before Angola's formal independence date, which the Portuguese had set for 11 November, then withdraw quietly. By early November the three SADF columns had captured eighteen major towns and cities, including several provincial capitals, and penetrated over five hundred kilometres into Angola. Upon receiving intelligence reports that the SADF had openly intervened on the side of the FNLA and UNITA, the Soviet Union began preparations for a massive airlift of arms to FAPLA. Cuba responds with Operation Carlota On 3 November, a South African unit advancing towards Benguela, Angola paused to attack a FAPLA base which housed a substantial training contingent of Cuban advisers. When reports reached Cuban president Fidel Castro that the advisers had been engaged by what appeared to be SADF regulars, he decided to approve a request from the MPLA leadership for direct military assistance. Castro declared that he would send all \\"the men and weapons necessary to win that struggle\\", in the spirit of proletarian internationalism and solidarity with the MPLA. Castro named this mission Operation Carlota after an African woman who had organised a slave revolt on Cuba. The first Cuban combat troops began departing for Angola on 7 November, and were drawn from a special paramilitary battalion of the Cuban Ministry of Interior. These were followed closely by one mechanised and one artillery battalion of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, which set off by ship and would not reach Luanda until 27 November. They were kept supplied by a massive airlift carried out with Soviet aircraft. The Soviet Union also deployed a small naval contingent and about 400 military advisers to Luanda. Heavy weapons were flown and transported by sea directly from various Warsaw Pact member states to Angola for the arriving Cubans, including tanks, helicopters, armoured cars, and even 10 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 fighter aircraft, which were assembled by Cuban and Soviet technicians in Luanda. By the end of the year there were 12,000 Cuban soldiers inside Angola, nearly the size of the entire SADF presence in South West Africa. The FNLA suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Quifangondo when it attempted to take Luanda on 10 November, and the capital remained in FAPLA hands by independence. Cuban-manned PT-76 tank in the streets of Luanda, 1976. Throughout late November and early December the Cubans focused on fighting the FNLA in the north, and stopping an abortive incursion by Zaire on behalf of that movement. Thereafter they refocused on putting an end to the SADF advances in the south. The South African and Cuban forces engaged in a series of bloody, but inconclusive skirmishes and battles throughout late December. However, by this point word of the SADF's involvement had been leaked to the international press, and photographs of SADF armour behind UNITA lines were appearing in several European newspapers. This proved to be a major political setback for the South African government, which was almost universally condemned for its interference in a black African country. Moreover, it spurred influential African states such as Nigeria and Tanzania to recognise the MPLA as the sole legitimate government of Angola, as that movement's struggle against an apparent act of South African aggression gave it legitimacy at the OAU. South Africa appealed to the United States for more direct support, but when the CIA's role in arming the FNLA also became public the US Congress terminated and disavowed the programme. In the face of regional and international condemnation, the SADF made the decision around Christmas of 1975 to begin withdrawing from Angola. The withdrawal commenced in February 1976 and formally ended a month later. As the FNLA and UNITA lost their logistical backing from the CIA and the direct military support of the SADF, they were forced to abandon much of their territory to a renewed FAPLA offensive. The FNLA was almost completely wiped out, but UNITA succeeded in retreating deep into the country's wooded highlands, where it continued to mount a determined insurgency. Operation Savannah was widely regarded as a strategic failure. South Africa and the US had committed resources and manpower to the initial objective of preventing a FAPLA victory prior to Angolan independence, which was achieved. But the early successes of Savannah provided the MPLA politburo with a reason to increase the deployment of Cuban troops and Soviet advisers exponentially. The CIA correctly predicted that Cuba and the Soviet Union would continue to support FAPLA at whatever level was necessary to prevail, while South Africa was inclined to withdraw its forces rather than risk incurring heavy casualties. The SADF had suffered between 28 and 35 killed in action. An additional 100 were wounded. Seven South Africans were captured and displayed at Angolan press briefings as living proof of the SADF's involvement. Cuban casualties were known to be much higher; several hundred were killed in engagements with the SADF or UNITA. Twenty Cubans were taken prisoner: 17 by UNITA, and 3 by the South Africans. South Africa's National Party suffered some domestic fallout as a result of Savannah, as Prime Minister Vorster had concealed the operation from the public for fear of alarming the families of national servicemen deployed on Angolan soil. The South African public was shocked to learn of the details, and attempts by the government to cover up the debacle were slated in the local press. =The Shipanga Affair and PLAN's exit to Angola= In the aftermath of the MPLA's political and military victory, it was recognised as the official government of the new People's Republic of Angola by the European Economic Community and the UN General Assembly. Around May 1976 the MPLA concluded several new agreements with Moscow for broad Soviet-Angolan cooperation in the diplomatic, economic, and military spheres; simultaneously both countries also issued a joint expression of solidarity with the Namibian struggle for independence. Cuba, the Soviet Union, and other Warsaw Pact member states specifically justified their involvement with the Angolan Civil War as a form of proletarian internationalism. This theory placed an emphasis on socialist solidarity between all left-wing revolutionary struggles, and suggested that one purpose of a successful revolution was to likewise ensure the success of another elsewhere. Cuba in particular had thoroughly embraced the concept of internationalism, and one of its foreign policy objectives in Angola was to further the process of national liberation in southern Africa by overthrowing colonial or white minority regimes. Cuban policies with regards to Angola and the conflict in South West Africa thus became inexorably linked. As Cuban military personnel had begun to make their appearance in Angola in increasing numbers, they also arrived in Zambia to help train PLAN. South Africa's defence establishment perceived this aspect of Cuban and to a lesser extent Soviet policy through the prism of the domino theory: if Havana and Moscow succeeded in installing a communist regime in Angola, it was only a matter of time before they attempted the same in South West Africa. Soviet training instructors with PLAN recruits, late 1970s. Operation Savannah accelerated the shift of SWAPO's alliances among the Angolan nationalist movements. Until August 1975, SWAPO was theoretically aligned with the MPLA, but in reality PLAN had enjoyed a close working relationship with UNITA during the Angolan War of Independence. In September 1975, SWAPO issued a public statement declaring its intention to remain neutral in the Angolan Civil War and refrain from supporting any single political faction or party. With the South African withdrawal in March, Sam Nujoma retracted his movement's earlier position and endorsed the MPLA as the \\"authentic representative of the Angolan people\\". During the same month, Cuba began flying in small numbers of PLAN recruits from Zambia to Angola to commence guerrilla training. PLAN shared intelligence with the Cubans and FAPLA, and from April 1976 even fought alongside them against UNITA. FAPLA often used PLAN cadres to garrison strategic sites while freeing up more of its own personnel for deployments elsewhere. The emerging MPLA-SWAPO alliance took on special significance after the latter movement was wracked by factionalism and a series of PLAN mutinies in Western Province, Zambia between March and April 1976, known as the Shipanga Affair. Relations between SWAPO and the Zambian government were already troubled due to the fact that the growing intensity of PLAN attacks on the Caprivi often provoked South African retaliation against Zambia. When SWAPO's executive committee proved unable to suppress the PLAN revolt, the Zambian National Defence Force (ZNDF) mobilised several army battalions and drove the dissidents out of their bases in South West African refugee camps, capturing an estimated 1,800. SWAPO's Secretary for Information, Andreas Shipanga, was later held responsible for the revolt. Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda deported Shipanga and several other high-ranking dissidents to Tanzania, while incarcerating the others at remote army facilities. Sam Nujoma accused them of being South African agents and carried out a purge of the surviving political leadership and PLAN ranks. Forty mutineers were sentenced to death by a PLAN tribunal in Lusaka, while hundreds of others disappeared. The heightened tension between Kaunda's government and PLAN began to have repercussions in the ZNDF. Zambian officers and enlisted men confiscated PLAN arms and harassed loyal insurgents, straining relations and eroding morale. The crisis in Zambia prompted PLAN to relocate its headquarters from Lusaka to Lubango, Angola, at the invitation of the MPLA. It was joined shortly afterwards by SWAPO's political wing, which relocated to Luanda. SWAPO's closer affiliation and proximity to the MPLA may have influenced its concurrent slide to the left; the party adopted a more overtly Marxist discourse, such as a commitment to a classless society based on the ideals and principles of scientific socialism. From 1976 onward SWAPO considered itself the ideological as well as the military ally of the MPLA. In 1977 Cuba and the Soviet Union established dozens of new training camps in Angola to accommodate PLAN and two other guerrilla movements in the region, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) and Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). The Cubans provided instructors and specialist officers, while the Soviets provided more hardware for the guerrillas. This convergence of interests between the Cuban and Soviet military missions in Angola proved successful as it drew on each partner's comparative strengths. The Soviet Union's strength lay in its vast military‚Äìindustrial complex, which furbished the raw material for bolstering FAPLA and its allies. Cuba's strength lay in its manpower and troop commitment to Angola, which included technical advisers who were familiar with the sophisticated weaponry supplied by the Soviets and possessed combat experience. In order to reduce the likelihood of a South African attack, the training camps were sited near Cuban or FAPLA military installations, with the added advantage of being able to rely on the logistical and communications infrastructure of PLAN's allies. External South African operations, 1978‚Äì1984 32 Battalion uniform patterned after those issued to FAPLA. Members of this unit often wore ubiquitous uniforms to avoid scrutiny while operating in AngolaAccess to Angola provided PLAN with limitless opportunities to train its forces in secure sanctuaries and infiltrate insurgents and supplies across South West Africa's northern border. The guerrillas gained a great deal of leeway to manage their logistical operations through Angola's Mo√ß√¢medes District, using the ports, roads, and railways from the sea to supply their forward operating bases. Soviet vessels offloaded arms at the port of Mo√ß√¢medes, which were then transshipped by rail to Lubango and from there through a chain of PLAN supply routes snaking their way south toward the border. \\"Our geographic isolation was over,\\" Nujoma commented in his memoirs. \\"It was as if a locked door had suddenly swung open...we could at last make direct attacks across our northern frontier and send in our forces and weapons on a large scale.\\" In the territories of Ovamboland, Kaokoland, Kavangoland and East Caprivi after 1976, the SADF installed fixed defences against infiltration, employing two parallel electrified fences and motion sensors. The system was backed by roving patrols drawn from Eland armoured car squadrons, motorised infantry, canine units, horsemen and scrambler motorcycles for mobility and speed over rough terrain; local San trackers, Ovambo paramilitaries, and South African special forces. PLAN attempted hit and run raids across the border but, in what was characterised as the \\"corporal's war\\", SADF sections largely intercepted them in the Cutline before they could get any further into South West Africa itself. The brunt of the fighting was shouldered by small, mobile rapid reaction forces, whose role was to track and eliminate the insurgents after a PLAN presence was detected. These reaction forces were attached on the battalion level and maintained at maximum readiness on individual bases. The SADF carried out mostly reconnaissance operations inside Angola, although its forces in South West Africa could fire and manoeuvre across the border in self-defence if attacked from the Angolan side. Once they reached the Cutline, a reaction force sought permission either to enter Angola or abort the pursuit. South Africa also set up a specialist unit, 32 Battalion, which concerned itself with reconnoitring infiltration routes from Angola. 32 Battalion regularly sent teams recruited from ex-FNLA militants and led by white South African personnel into an authorised zone up to fifty kilometres deep in Angola; it could also dispatch platoon-sized reaction forces of similar composition to attack vulnerable PLAN targets. As their operations had to be clandestine and covert, with no link to South African forces, 32 Battalion teams wore FAPLA or PLAN uniforms and carried Soviet weapons. Climate shaped the activities of both sides. Seasonal variations during the summer passage of the Intertropical Convergence Zone resulted in an annual period of heavy rains over northern South West Africa between February and April. The rainy season made military operations difficult. Thickening foliage provided the insurgents with concealment from South African patrols, and their tracks were obliterated by the rain. At the end of April or early May, PLAN cadres returned to Angola to escape renewed SADF search and destroy efforts and retrain for the following year. Another significant factor of the physical environment was South West Africa's limited road network. The main arteries for SADF bases on the border were two highways leading west to Ruacana and north to Oshikango, and a third which stretched from Grootfontein through Kavangoland to Rundu. Much of this vital road infrastructure was vulnerable to guerrilla sabotage: innumerable road culverts and bridges were blown up and rebuilt multiple times over the course of the war. After their destruction PLAN saboteurs sowed the surrounding area with land mines to catch the South African engineers sent to repair them. One of the most routine tasks for local sector troops was a morning patrol along their assigned stretch of highway to check for mines or overnight sabotage. Despite their efforts it was nearly impossible to guard or patrol the almost limitless number of vulnerable points on the road network, and losses from mines mounted steadily; for instance in 1977 the SADF suffered 16 deaths due to mined roads. Aside from road sabotage, the SADF was also forced to contend with regular ambushes of both military and civilian traffic throughout Ovamboland. Movement between towns was by escorted convoy, and the roads in the north were closed to civilian traffic between six in the evening and half past seven in the morning. White civilians and administrators from Oshakati, Ondangwa, and Rundu began routinely carrying arms, and never ventured far from their fortified neighbourhoods. South African troops on patrol near the border, early 1980s. Unharried by major South African offensives, PLAN was free to consolidate its military organisation in Angola. PLAN's leadership under Dimo Hamaambo concentrated on improving its communications and control throughout that country, demarcating the Angolan front into three military zones, in which guerrilla activities were coordinated by a single operational headquarters. The Western Command was headquartered in western Hu√≠la Province and responsible for PLAN operations in Kaokoland and western Ovamboland. The Central Command was headquartered in central Hu√≠la Province and responsible for PLAN operations in central Ovamboland. The Eastern Command was headquartered in northern Hu√≠la Province and responsible for PLAN operations in eastern Ovamboland and Kavangoland. The three PLAN regional headquarters each developed their own forces which resembled standing armies with regard to the division of military labour, incorporating various specialties such as counter-intelligence, air defence, reconnaissance, combat engineering, sabotage, and artillery. The Eastern Command also created an elite force in 1978, known as \\"Volcano\\" and subsequently, \\"Typhoon\\", which carried out unconventional operations south of Ovamboland. South Africa's defence chiefs requested an end to restrictions on air and ground operations north of the Cutline. Citing the accelerated pace of PLAN infiltration, P.W. Botha recommended that the SADF be permitted, as it had been prior to March 1976, to send large numbers of troops into southern Angola. Vorster, unwilling to risk incurring the same international and domestic political fallout associated with Operation Savannah, repeatedly rejected Botha's proposals. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence and the SADF continued advocating air and ground attacks on PLAN's Angolan sanctuaries. =Operation Reindeer= On 27 October 1977 a group of insurgents attacked an SADF patrol in the Cutline, killing 5 South African soldiers and mortally wounding a sixth. As military historian Willem Steenkamp records, \\"while not a large clash by World War II or Vietnam standards, it was a milestone in what was then...a low intensity conflict\\". Three months later, insurgents fired on patrols in the Cutline again, killing 6 more soldiers. The growing number of ambushes and infiltrations were timed to coincide with assassination attempts on prominent South West African tribal officials. Perhaps the most high profile assassination of a tribal leader during this time was that of Herero chief Clemens Kapuuo, which South Africa blamed on PLAN. Vorster finally acquiesced to Botha's requests for retaliatory strikes against PLAN in Angola, and the SADF launched Operation Reindeer in May 1978. One controversial development of Operation Reindeer helped sour the international community on the South African Border War. On 4 May 1978, a battalion-sized task force of the 44 Parachute Brigade conducted a sweep through the Angolan mining town of Cassinga, searching for what it believed was a PLAN administrative centre. Lieutenant General Constand Viljoen, the chief of the South African Army, had told the task force commanders and his immediate superior General Johannes Geldenhuys that Cassinga was a PLAN \\"planning headquarters\\" which also functioned as the \\"principal medical centre for the treatment of seriously injured guerrillas, as well as the concentration point for guerrilla recruits being dispatched to training centres in Lubango and Luanda and to operational bases in east and west Cunene.\\" The task force was made up of older Citizen Force reservists, many of whom had already served tours on the border, led by experienced professional officers. The task force of about 370 paratroops entered Cassinga, which was known as Objective Moscow to the SADF, in the wake of an intense aerial bombardment. From this point onward, there are two differing accounts of the Cassinga incident. While both concur that an airborne South African unit entered Cassinga on 4 May and that the paratroopers destroyed a large camp complex, they diverge on the characteristics of the site and the casualties inflicted. The SWAPO and Cuban narrative presented Cassinga as a refugee camp, and the South African government's narrative presented Cassinga as a guerrilla base. The first account claimed that Cassinga was housing a large population of civilians who had fled the escalating violence in northern South West Africa and were merely dependent on PLAN for their sustenance and protection. According to this narrative, South African paratroopers opened fire on the refugees, mostly women and children; those not immediately killed were systematically rounded up into groups and bayoneted or shot. The alleged result was the massacre of at least 612 South West African civilians, almost all elderly men, women, and children. The SADF narrative concurred with a death toll of approximately 600 but claimed that most of the dead were insurgents killed defending a series of trenches around the camp. South African sources identified Cassinga as a PLAN installation on the basis of aerial reconnaissance photographs, which depicted a network of trenches as well as a military parade ground. Additionally, photographs of the parade ground taken by a Swedish reporter just prior to the raid depicted children and women in civilian clothing, but also uniformed PLAN guerrillas and large numbers of young men of military age. SWAPO maintained that it ordered the trenches around Cassinga dug to shelter the otherwise defenceless refugees in the event of an SADF raid, and only after camp staff had noted spotter planes overhead several weeks prior. It justified the construction of a parade ground as part of a programme to instill a sense of discipline and unity. Western journalists and Angolan officials counted 582 corpses on site a few hours after the SADF's departure. The SADF suffered 3 dead and 1 missing in action. Members of 44 Parachute Brigade in training. An adjacent Cuban mechanised infantry battalion stationed sixteen kilometres to the south advanced to confront the paratroops during the attack, but suffered several delays due to strafing runs by South African Dassault Mirage III and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. In the first known engagement between South African and Cuban forces since the termination of Operation Savannah, five Cuban tanks and some infantry in BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers reached Cassinga while the paratroopers were being airlifted out by helicopter. This led to a protracted firefight in which Cuba acknowledged 16 dead and over 80 wounded. The Cassinga event was given special significance by Cuban historians such as Jorge Risquet, who noted that it marked the first time that \\"Cubans and Namibians shed their blood together fighting the South African [military].\\" While Cassinga was in the process of being destroyed, a South African armoured column attacked a network of guerrilla transit camps at Chetequera, code named \\"Objective Vietnam\\", which was only about thirty kilometres from the Cutline. Chetequera was much more heavily fortified than Cassinga and the SADF encountered fierce resistance. Unlike the latter, it had also been scouted thoroughly by South African reconnaissance assets on the ground, and they were able to verify the absence of civilians with ample photographic and documentary evidence. The SADF suffered another 3 dead at Chetequera, in addition to 30 wounded. PLAN lost 248 dead and 200 taken prisoner. On 6 May 1978, Operation Reindeer was condemned by United Nations Security Council Resolution 428, which described it as a violation of Angola's territorial integrity and threatened punitive measures should the SADF attempt another incursion on Angolan soil. The resolution attracted almost unanimous support worldwide, and was endorsed not only by the Soviet Union, but by major Western powers such as the US, the UK, France, Canada, and West Germany. As the Cassinga incident received publicity, American and European attitudes became one of intense criticism of South African purpose as well as the process by which it carried out the war. Notably, Western pressure at the UN to recognise South Africa as an equal partner in any future Namibian peace settlement evaporated. Cassinga was a major political breakthrough for SWAPO, which had portrayed the casualties there as martyrs of a Namibian nation in the making. The movement received unprecedented support in the form of humanitarian aid sent to its remaining refugee camps and offers from foreign governments to educate refugees in their countries. =Botha's escalation= Vorster's failing health and his preoccupation with domestic issues such as the looming Muldergate Scandal diverted his attention from South West Africa from May to September 1978, and no more major operations were undertaken by the SADF during that period. However, his absence from military affairs meant he was no longer in a position to counter the hawkish position of P.W. Botha and the defence establishment. When Vorster voluntarily stepped down late that year, he was succeeded by Botha as prime minister. His final act in office was to reject a proposal drafted by UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim for a ceasefire and transition to Namibian independence. Geopolitical situation, 1978‚Äì79. Defence chiefs such as General Magnus Malan welcomed Botha's ascension, blaming previous battlefield reversals‚Äînamely, Operation Savannah‚Äîon Vorster's indecisive and \\"lackluster\\" leadership. Botha had generated a reputation for being a tenacious, uncompromising leader who would use South Africa's position of military strength to strike hard at its foreign enemies, particularly to retaliate against any form of armed provocation. He criticised the West and the US in particular as being unwilling to stand up to Soviet expansionism, and declared that if South Africa could no longer look to the \\"free world\\" for support, then it would prevent further communist inroads into the region itself. Within the first three months of his premiership, the length of military service for white conscripts was doubled, and construction began on several new SADF bases near the border. Although little in the tactical situation had changed when Botha assumed office, patrols now crossed into Angola much more frequently to intercept and destroy PLAN cadres along their known infiltration routes. PLAN was attempting to rebuild its forward operating bases after the loss of Chetequera. The insurgents had also been incensed by the Cassinga raid and publicly threatened retribution. \\"Strike a hard blow which Pretoria will not forget in a long time,\\" deputy PLAN commander Solomon Huwala stated in a written directive to his staff. \\"We have been concentrating on attacking military targets and their forces, but they have decided to kill women and children. Cassinga must be revenged.\\" It was from this communique that the name of the next major PLAN offensive was derived: Operation Revenge. After some deliberation, Huwala chose Katima Mulilo as his target and dispatched several PLAN reconnaissance teams to obtain data on firing positions and potential artillery observation posts. On 23 August 1978, PLAN bombarded Katima Mulilo with mortars and rocket fire, killing 10 SADF personnel. The next day, General Viljoen, General Geldenhuys and the Administrator-General of South West Africa flew out to Katima Mulilo to inspect the damage. All three narrowly escaped death when their SA.321 Super Frelon helicopter took ground fire from PLAN anti-aircraft positions at Sesheke. The SADF responded by bombarding Sesheke with its own artillery and making a sweep for PLAN insurgents up to a hundred kilometers north of the Cutline. On 6 March 1979 Prime Minister Botha ordered retaliatory strikes on selected targets in Angola and Zambia. The respective code names for the operations were Rekstok and Saffraan. Heliborne South African troops landed in the vicinity of four Angolan settlements: Heque, Mongua, Oncocua, Henhombe, and Muongo, which they canvassed for guerrillas. The SADF remained in Zambia for a significantly longer period, carrying out a series of uneventful combat patrols and ambushes for five weeks. While Operations Rekstok and Saffraan were unsuccessful in terms of tactical results, they did interrupt PLAN's attempts to rebuild its base camps near the border. Most of the insurgents apparently concealed their arms and vanished into the local population. This proved less successful in Zambia, where the civilians in Sesheke District were irritated by the constant presence of South African patrols and reconnaissance aircraft; they demanded their government remove the remaining PLAN fighters. President Kaunda subsequently bowed to pressure and ordered PLAN to close its rear base facilities in Zambia, resulting in the collapse of its Caprivian insurgency. On 16 March, Angola lodged a formal complaint with the UN Security Council concerning the violation of its borders and airspace as a result of Operation Rekstok. United Nations Security Council Resolution 447 was passed in response. The resolution \\"condemned strongly the racist regime of South Africa for its premeditated, persistent, and sustained armed invasions of the People's Republic of Angola, which constitute a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country as well as a serious threat to international peace and security\\". A UN commission of inquiry logged 415 border violations by the SADF in 1979, an increase of 419% since the previous year. It also made note of 89 other incidents, which were mostly airspace violations or artillery bombardments that struck targets on Angolan soil. PLAN guerrillas on the march. US‚ÄìSouth African relations took an unexpected turn with Ronald Reagan's electoral victory in the 1980 US presidential elections. Reagan's tough anti-communist record and rhetoric was greeted with cautious optimism by Pretoria; during his election campaign he'd described the geopolitical situation in southern Africa as \\"a Russian weapon\\" aimed at the US. President Reagan and his Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Chester Crocker adopted a policy of constructive engagement with the Botha government, restored military attach√©s to the US embassy in South Africa, and permitted SADF officers to receive technical training in the US. They believed that pressure tactics against South Africa would be contrary to US regional goals, namely countering Soviet and Cuban influence. In a private memo addressed to the South African foreign minister, Crocker and his supervisor Alexander Haig declared that \\"we [the US] share your view that Namibia must not be turned over to the Soviets and their allies. A Russian flag in Windhoek is as unacceptable to us as it is to you\\". Washington also ended its condemnation of SADF cross-border raids, which was perceived as tacit support for the latter's actions in Angola and elsewhere. This had the effect of encouraging Botha to proceed with larger and increasingly more ambitious operations against PLAN. Between 1980 and 1982 South African ground forces invaded Angola three times to destroy the well-entrenched PLAN logistical infrastructure near the border region. The incursions were designated Operation Sceptic, Operation Protea, and Operation Daisy, respectively. While Operation Rekstok was underway in March 1979, PLAN cadres retreated further into Angola and regrouped. Upon the SADF's departure, they had returned to their border sanctuaries, resuming raids, ambushes, and infiltration attempts. South African outposts in Ovamboland were subjected to constant mortar and rocket attacks. A year after Rekstok's conclusion, PLAN attacked the South African Air Force base at Ondangwa, destroying several aircraft and inflicting casualties. FAPLA continued to open its arsenals and training camps to Nujoma's army, and with Cuban assistance PLAN established its first conventional heavy weapons units, including a mechanised brigade. The insurgents also reorganised a segment of eastern Ovamboland into \\"semi- liberated\\" zones, where PLAN's political and military authorities effectively controlled the countryside. Ovambo peasants in the semi-liberated zones received impromptu weapons instruction before being smuggled back to Angola for more specialised training. Operation Protea Between 1979 and 1980 the pace of infiltration had accelerated so greatly that the SADF was forced to mobilise its reserves and deploy another 8,000 troops to South West Africa. The deeper South African raids struck into Angola, the more the war spread, and by mid-1980 the fighting had extended to a much larger geographic area than before. Operation Sceptic, then the largest combined arms offensive undertaken by South Africa since World War II, was launched in June against a PLAN base at Chifufua, over a hundred and eighty kilometres inside Angola. Chifufua, codenamed Objective Smokeshell, was divided into a dozen well fortified complexes ringed with trenches, defensive bunkers, and anti-aircraft positions. The SADF killed over 200 insurgents and captured several hundred tonnes of PLAN munitions and weaponry at the cost of 17 dead. Operation Protea was mounted on an even larger scale and inflicted heavier PLAN casualties; unlike Sceptic it was to involve significant FAPLA losses as well as the seizure of substantial amounts of Angolan military hardware and supplies. Protea was planned when the SADF first became aware of PLAN's evolving conventional capabilities in August 1981. Its targets were suspected PLAN bases sited outside major FAPLA installations at Ondjiva and Xangongo. Attacking either settlement was considered especially risky due to the presence of Soviet advisers and a comprehensive local FAPLA air defence network. Since the first formal cooperation treaties between Angola and the Soviet Union in 1976, the military sphere had constituted the pivot of Angolan-Soviet relations. The Soviet Navy benefited from its use of Angolan ports to stage exercises throughout the southern Atlantic and even negotiated with FAPLA for the construction of permanent bases. Luanda was named the regional headquarters for the 30th Operation Squadron of the Soviet Navy's Northern Fleet, which comprised eleven warships, three of which were in the port at any given time. From January 1976 onward it also replaced Conakry as the primary base for Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 reconnaissance flights along Africa's western coast. Article 16 of the Angolan constitution banned the construction of foreign military bases, but exceptions could be made if base rights were considered essential to the country's national defence. The Soviet Union justified its continued air and naval presence as necessary measures to protect Angola from a South African invasion. One senior Soviet military official, General Valery Belyaev, remarked that the 30th Operational Squadron was, \\"by the very fact of its presence...restraining the South African aggression against Angola.\\" In exchange for granting base rights, FAPLA became the beneficiary of more sophisticated Soviet arms. After Operation Sceptic the Soviet Union transferred over five hundred million dollars' worth of military equipment to FAPLA, the bulk of it apparently concentrated on air defence. This made South African raids costlier in terms of the need to provide heavier air cover and likely casualties. With the adoption of more advanced weaponry, the contribution by Soviet technical and advisory support to FAPLA's operational capabilities also became increasingly crucial. Totalling between 1,600 and 1,850 advisers by 1981, the Soviet military mission to Angola was deployed within all branches of the Angolan armed forces. FAPLA T-34-85 tank captured by the SADF during Operation Protea. A few weeks prior to Operation Protea, SADF General Charles Lloyd warned Botha that the introduction of early warning radar and 2K12 Kub \\"SA-6\\" missiles in southern Angola was making it difficult to provide air support to ground operations there. Lloyd mentioned that FAPLA's buildup of modern Soviet arms was making a conventional war more likely. The objectives of Operation Protea shifted accordingly: aside from the PLAN camps, the SADF was ordered to neutralise several Angolan radar and missile sites and command posts. Eight days of bloody fighting occurred before two South African armoured columns were able to overrun Ondjiva and Xangongo. The SADF destroyed all of FAPLA's 2K12 missile sites and captured an estimated 3,000 tonnes of Soviet-manufactured equipment, including a dozen T-34-85 and PT-76 tanks, 200 trucks and other wheeled vehicles, and 110 9K32 Strela-2 missile launchers. The SADF acknowledged 14 dead. Combined FAPLA and PLAN losses were over 1,000 dead and 38 taken prisoner. The Soviet military mission suffered 2 dead and 1 taken prisoner. Operation Protea led to the effective occupation of forty thousand square kilometres of Cunene Province by the SADF. On 31 August, the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution condemning the incursion and demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the SADF from Angola. Intelligence gained during Protea led to Operation Daisy in November 1981, the deepest SADF incursion into Angola since Operation Savannah. This time, South African ground forces struck three hundred kilometres north of the border to eliminate PLAN training camps at Bambi and Cheraquera. On that occasion the SADF killed 70 PLAN insurgents and destroyed several small caches of arms. PLAN learned of the attack in advance and had nearly completed its withdrawal when the SADF arrived; the insurgents fought a brief delaying action rather than attempt to defend their bases. The air war over Angola expanded with the ground fighting. FAPLA's modest air force, consisting of a handful of transports and a few MiG-21s, maintained a large base at Menongue. During Protea and Daisy the SADF scrambled its own fighters to overfly the base during ground operations and prevent the FAPLA aircraft from taking off. The Soviets had begun training Angolan MiG pilots, but in the meantime Cubans shouldered the burden of the air war in Angola, flying in support of both FAPLA and PLAN. In November 1981 a MiG-21MF with a Cuban pilot was shot down by South African Mirage F1CZs over the Cunene River. The Mirages downed a second MiG in October 1982. The expulsion of FAPLA from most of Cunene Province marked a revival of fortunes for Jonas Savimbi and his rump UNITA movement, which was able to seize undefended towns and settlements abandoned in the wake of Operations Protea and Daisy. Savimbi focused on rebuilding his power base throughout southeastern Angola while FAPLA and its Cuban allies were otherwise preoccupied fighting the SADF. For its part, the SADF allowed UNITA's armed wing to operate freely behind its lines; by early 1983 Savimbi's insurgents controlled most of the country south of Benguela Province. =Cuban linkage and \\"Namibianisation\\"= During his final years in office, Vorster had recognised that growing international pressure would eventually force South Africa to grant some form of autonomy or independence to South West Africa. He made token acknowledgements of the UN's role in deciding the territory's future and his administration had publicly renounced the notion of annexation. As Vorster's successor, Botha felt bound by this commitment‚Äîat least in principle‚Äîto an autonomous South West Africa. His strategy was to cultivate a viable political alternative to SWAPO, preferably moderate and anti-communist in nature, which was committed to close military and security links with South Africa. In the meantime Botha forestalled further discussions on an internal settlement by demanding the withdrawal of the Cuban armed forces from Angola as a precondition of Namibian independence. Botha argued that the Cuban presence in Angola constituted a legitimate security concern for South West Africa, so it was not unreasonable that independence be contingent on a prior Cuban withdrawal. This initiative was supported by the US, which wanted a Namibian settlement consistent with Western interests, namely a region free of what Chester Crocker termed \\"Soviet-Cuban military adventurism\\". Crocker endorsed the linkage since it was related to South West Africa's security situation, which needed to be stabilised prior to independence. Botha's precondition was denounced by SWAPO for arbitrarily tying South West Africa's fate to the resolution of another regional conflict. Some Western powers also disapproved of Cuban linkage; for example, the French government issued the statement that it was inappropriate \\"the Namibian people should serve as hostages\\" to broader US foreign policy goals. The Cuban government interpreted linkage as further proof that South Africa was a foreign policy pawn of the US, and believed it to be part of a wider diplomatic and military offensive by the Reagan administration against Cuban interests worldwide. Botha called on other African states and Western nations to back his demands: \\"say to the Cubans 'go home' and say to the Russians 'go home', and the minute this happens I will be prepared to settle all our military forces inside South Africa\\". Botha also assured the UN that he would take steps to prepare South West Africa for independence \\"as long as there are realistic prospects of bringing about the genuine withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola\\". The linkage of Namibian independence to the Cuban presence in Angola proved controversial, but it did involve the two Cold War superpowers‚Äîthe US and the Soviet Union‚Äî in a joint mediation process for resolving the South African Border War at the highest level. In September 1982 Crocker met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Leonid Ilichev for talks on the issue of Cuban-Namibian linkage. His deputy, Frank G. Wisner, held a series of parallel discussions with the Angolan government. Wisner promised that the US would normalise diplomatic and economic relations with Angola in the event of a Cuban withdrawal. To demonstrate South African commitment to Namibian independence, Botha permitted a moderate, multi-party coalition to create a South West African interim government in August 1983, known as the Multi-Party Conference and subsequently as the Transitional Government of National Unity. Provision was made for an executive and legislative assembly, and the new government was bestowed with all the powers formerly held by the territory's Administrator-General. The rise of an interim government was accompanied by a defence policy dubbed \\"Namibianisation\\", a reference to the Vietnamization programme the US had pursued during the Vietnam War. Increasingly the South African war effort rested on what limited white manpower could be raised in South West Africa itself, and local black units drawn from the San, Ovambo, Kavango, and East Caprivian (Lozi) ethnic groups. The main objectives of Namibianisation were to establish a self-sufficient military infrastructure in South West Africa, reduce casualty rates among South African personnel, and reinforce the perception of a domestic civil conflict rather than an independence struggle. The SADF had started recruiting black South West Africans in 1974 and established segregated military and paramilitary units for semi-autonomous tribal entities such as Ovamboland two years later. PLAN had previously benefited from the deployment of white South African conscripts, reservists, and policemen unfamiliar with the terrain or environment; indigenous recruits were perceived as a means of mitigating this disadvantage. In April 1980, Administrator-General Gerrit Viljoen announced that transfer of some control over military and police forces to South West Africans would occur once the necessary structures were implemented. Through its defence headquarters in Windhoek, the SADF had exercised final authority on all military resources and counter-insurgency efforts. In theory, these arrangements were modified by the establishment of the South West African Territorial Force (SWATF) and the South West African Police (SWAPOL), since both of these forces were placed under the control of the interim government; the latter was also empowered to implement and oversee conscription as it saw fit. However, the SADF retained functional command of all military units; the senior general officer of the SADF in South West Africa also doubled as commander of the SWATF. By the mid 1980s the SWATF numbered about 21,000 personnel and accounted for 61% of all combat troops deployed along the Cutline. Both the SWATF and the Government of National Unity remained dependent on massive SADF military support. =Operation Askari= Operation Protea had exposed a glaring lack of professionalism on the part of FAPLA units, which had relied too heavily on their Soviet advisers and were almost immediately routed once they had to leave their fortified bases. In terms of training, morale, organisation, and professional competence‚Äîincluding the ability to operate its own equipment with effectiveness‚Äîthe Angolan army had proved decidedly vulnerable. Protea indicated that it was in no condition to repel or even inflict serious losses on the South African expeditionary troops, resulting in a ratio of casualties almost overwhelmingly in the SADF's favour. That debacle led to a greater FAPLA dependency on augmented Cuban forces and another large arms deal, valued in excess of one billion dollars, being signed with the Soviet Union. Defence expenditures increased to consume 50% of Angola's state budget by the end of 1982. FAPLA embarked on a massive recruiting drive, purchased new T-54/55 and T-62 tanks from the Soviet Union, and took delivery of about thirty new combat aircraft, including twelve Sukhoi Su-20 strike fighters. It also ordered more air search radars and surface-to- air missiles to replace those destroyed in Protea. While Namibianisation altered the tactical realities of the war on the Cutline, the SADF was planning a fourth operation modelled after Sceptic, Protea, and Daisy. In April 1982, PLAN insurgents killed 9 South African soldiers near Tsumeb, over 200 kilometres south of the border. South Africa claimed 152 security-related incidents involving PLAN occurred in South West Africa that year, and acknowledged the combat deaths of 77 SADF and SWATF personnel. In July 1983 PLAN carried out its first major act of urban sabotage, detonating a bomb in the centre of Windhoek, which caused extensive property damage but no civilian injuries. Infiltration of Ovamboland and Kavangoland increased dramatically at around the same time, with 700 insurgents entering both regions. The SADF claimed to have killed or captured just under half the insurgents by May, but was unable to prevent the others from making their way further south. These developments indicated that PLAN had not lost its will to persevere despite the enormous materiel losses sustained during Protea, and the infiltration of men and supplies into South West Africa continued apace. Their confidence buoyed by the previous successful incursions into FAPLA-held territory, which had achieved marked success at only minimal cost in lives and materiel, Botha and his defence chiefs scheduled Operation Askari for December 1983. Like Protea, Askari was a major combined arms assault on PLAN base areas and supply lines in Angola; it also targeted nearby FAPLA air defence installations and brigade headquarters. According to General Georg Meiring, commander of the SADF in South West Africa, Askari would serve the purpose of a preemptive strike aimed at eliminating the large numbers of PLAN insurgents and stockpiles of weapons being amassed for the annual rainy season infiltration. Soviet military advisers planning FAPLA operations in southern Angola. The buildup of South African armour and artillery on the border did not go unnoticed; by late November the Soviet Union had enough satellite reconnaissance photographs and other intelligence to deduce that the SADF was preparing for another major incursion into Angola. During a private meeting arranged at the Algonquin Hotel by UN Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar at Moscow's request, Soviet diplomats informed their South African counterparts that further aggression towards FAPLA would not be tolerated. The Soviets threatened unspecified retaliation if FAPLA's grip on Angola disintegrated further as a result of Askari. Simultaneously, in a direct show of force, a Soviet aircraft carrier and three surface ships called at Luanda before rounding the Cape of Good Hope. This constituted the most powerful Soviet naval detachment which had ever approached within striking distance of South African waters. Botha was unmoved, and Askari proceeded as scheduled on 9 December. Its targets were several large PLAN training camps, all of which were located no more than five kilometres from an adjacent FAPLA brigade headquarters. The four local FAPLA brigades represented one-seventh of the entire Angolan army, and three had substantial Soviet advisory contingents. Soviet General Valentin Varennikov, who was instrumental in directing the Angolan defence, was confident that \\"given their numerical strength and armament, the brigades...[would] be able to repel any South African attack\\". FAPLA's Cuban allies were less optimistic: they noted that the brigades were isolated, incapable of reinforcing each other quickly, and possessed insufficient mobile anti-aircraft weapons to protect them outside their bases. The Soviets recommended a static defence, appealing directly to Angolan president Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos, while the Cubans urged a withdrawal. Caught between two conflicting recommendations, dos Santos hesitated, and the brigades were ultimately annihilated piecemeal by the advancing South African armoured columns. Amid the confusion, a number of Angolan troops managed to break out of the South African encirclement and move north to link up with Cuban units, but a total of 471 FAPLA/PLAN personnel were killed or captured. Despite achieving their objectives during Operation Askari, the South African forces had encountered unexpectedly determined resistance from PLAN and FAPLA. The SADF acknowledged 25 killed in action and 94 wounded, the highest number of casualties suffered in any single operation since Operation Savannah. FAPLA also claimed to have shot down 4 South African aircraft. =Lusaka Accords= On 6 January 1984, United Nations Security Council Resolution 546 was adopted with thirteen votes in favour and two abstentions, by the US and UK. The resolution condemned Operation Askari and demanded South Africa's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Angola. An earlier draft of the same text imposing mandatory trade sanctions on South Africa until it ceased cross- border raids was abandoned under American pressure. The Soviet Union announced that it had reached yet another, more comprehensive agreement with Angola to bolster FAPLA's defence capabilities, and delivered the public warning to South Africa that \\"further aggression cannot be left unpunished\\". FAPLA 9K31 Strela-1 air defence system captured by the SADF during Operation Askari. Askari had shaken the South African government's confidence in its ability to retain the military advantage indefinitely in Angola. Heavier and more sophisticated weapons were being used, the rate of casualties had increased, and the air superiority that had accounted for many of the SADF's previous successes was diminishing. Nor was Botha and his cabinet certain of continued political and diplomatic support from the US, which had chosen to abstain rather than exercise its veto with regard to UN Security Council Resolution 546. The Reagan administration perceived that both Angola and South Africa had grown weary of the war and were more susceptible to pressure for a ceasefire and mutual disengagement. American diplomats offered to mediate peace talks accordingly, and on 13 February South African and Angolan officials met for the first time in Lusaka. Three days later, South Africa announced that it would withdraw its expeditionary forces from Cunene Province by the end of March, provided the Angolans agreed to prevent PLAN from taking advantage of the situation to infiltrate South West Africa. The Angolan government pledged to restrain PLAN and MK, and to prohibit any movement of Cuban troops southward towards the border. These respective commitments were formalised as the Lusaka Accords. FAPLA and the SADF agreed to set up a Joint Monitoring Commission (JMC) to police the disengagement. Under the JMC, joint South African and Angolan patrols were carried out along six hundred kilometres of the border. Cuba and the Soviet Union were not consulted on the Lusaka Accords until after they had been signed. In a heated exchange with President dos Santos, Fidel Castro complained, \\"the final decision was yours, not ours, but at least we could have talked beforehand, and we, as well as the Soviets, could have expressed our disagreement beforehand...both the Soviets and us, your two main allies, the two who support Angola, who have been making immense efforts on your behalf, we were faced with a fait accompli\\". UNITA denounced the Lusaka Accords, insisting that any peace effort which excluded it would fail. PLAN also routinely violated the disengagement area, prompting the SADF to delay and later cancel its withdrawal. In July 1984 South Africa formally announced that it would not withdraw from Angola, citing widespread PLAN activity in the border region. =Operation Argon= The truce between South Africa and Angola survived only about fifteen months. Negotiations for completing the SADF withdrawal were stalled due to intransigence on both sides concerning the linkage policy, with the two governments clashing over timetables for the withdrawal of Cuban troops and Namibian independence, respectively. While the Soviet Union and Cuba did nothing to impede the dialogue, they feared that Luanda might sacrifice PLAN and MK by agreeing to expel them from the country. Castro confided to Soviet officials that he had no intention of authorising a withdrawal of Cuban forces if the Angolan government signed a non-aggression pact with South Africa similar to the Nkomati Accord. As a last resort, the Cuban presence in Angola would be maintained unilaterally for the purpose of aiding PLAN, with or without Luanda's approval. In October 1984, dos Santos blamed South Africa for stalling the implementation of the Lusaka Accords and called for the US to resolve the impasse by exerting pressure on Botha. On 17 November, dos Santos proposed a five-point peace plan on the following terms: a complete SADF withdrawal from Angola, a renewed ceasefire agreement, a formal pledge by the South African government to begin implementing Namibian independence under the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, a formal pledge by the Angolan government to begin implementing a three year phased withdrawal of all but 5,000 Cuban troops, and recognition of SWAPO and Cuba as an equal party in negotiations. Botha wanted all the Cuban military personnel to be withdrawn, and over a period of twelve months rather than three years. He also countered that the Namibian independence process could only take place once the Cuban withdrawal was initiated. The Lusaka Accords were abandoned in the wake of Operation Argon, a failed sabotage mission carried out by South African special forces in Angola's oil-rich Cabinda exclave. Four years of military escalation and massive defence expenditures had a drastic impact on Angola's state finances, which were only being balanced by petroleum revenue. The largest oil refinery in the country was located on the Cabindan coast and operated by a US firm, Gulf Oil, under the auspices of the Cabina-Gulf Oil National Petroleum Company of Angola (SONAGOL). By 1984 Gulf had invested over 1.3 billion dollars in its Cabinda operation, which was exporting 165,495 barrels of oil per day. At the time, the revenue from the Gulf refinery generated 90% of Angola's foreign exchange. The Reagan administration separated its political positions on Angola from its position on SONAGOL, with Crocker hoping that American multinational companies in general, and Gulf in particular, would be a moderating force on the Marxist government. South Africa had noted the critical importance of the refinery's contribution to the FAPLA war effort and had begun investigating ways to disrupt it without incurring the ire of the US, which would have to react if American commercial interests were threatened. The SADF believed that a covert sabotage operation was possible, as long as the destruction was not attributable to South Africa and a credible cover story could be used to link the attack to a domestic Angolan movement such as UNITA or the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC). An attack on the oil platforms was ruled out, as this was beyond the capabilities of either UNITA or FLEC, so the SADF opted to infiltrate the refinery's oil storage facilities and mine the fuel tanks. The damage incurred would cripple Angola's ability to finance its military operations and give it greater economic incentive to accede to South African demands in the ongoing negotiations rather than risk returning to war. The sabotage mission received the codename Operation Argon, and 15 South African special forces operators deployed to Cabinda by sea in May 1985. They were discovered by a FAPLA patrol during the infiltration attempt, and two of the raiders were shot dead with a third, Captain Wynand Petrus du Toit, being captured. Under interrogation, du Toit confessed that the objective of Argon was to sabotage the storage tanks at Cabinda Gulf. The South African government disavowed du Toit and denied responsibility, but General Viljoen later confirmed the SADF's role in the operation. Consequently, the ceasefire imposed as a result of the Lusaka Accords collapsed, and further peace talks were abandoned. The diplomatic repercussions of Operation Argon's failure were immense. Castro believed the failed raid indicated that the US and South Africa were not truly committed to peace, and had been dishonest during the ceasefire negotiations. Angola announced it was no longer willing to consider a line of dialogue with South Africa on the Cuban withdrawal. The US condemned Operation Argon as an \\"unfriendly act by a supposedly friendly government\\". Drawdown in Angola, 1985‚Äì1988 UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi. In early 1984, just after South Africa and Angola had agreed to the principles of a peace settlement, UNITA had seized the opportunity to issue its own demanding conditions under which it would also accept the terms of a ceasefire. Savimbi requested a government of national unity with the MPLA in which he was granted a part, and threatened to begin attacking major cities if he was ignored. In this manner Savimbi sought to interlace conditionality over an SADF and FAPLA disengagement with his own conflict of interests with the Angolan regime. Although Botha approved of UNITA as an ostensibly anti-communist movement, he did nothing to impress Savimbi's demands on dos Santos. UNITA responded by raiding Sumbe, a settlement two hundred and sixty kilometres to the south of Luanda. That June, UNITA sabotaged the oil pipeline in Cabinda, kidnapping 16 British expatriate workers and a Portuguese technician. Six months later the insurgents raided Cafunfo, killing 100 FAPLA personnel. Most of these attacks were planned and executed from Jamba, a town in Cuando Cubango Province, which Savimbi had proclaimed UNITA's new national headquarters. Jamba had no prior strategic significance, possessed no agricultural base, and had limited access to fresh water, but it was located as far away from FAPLA bases as possible and within easy reach of SADF bases in Ovamboland and the Caprivi Strip. FAPLA had deserted the region for precisely this reason, withdrawing north after Operation Protea, but in the process left behind a power vacuum which Savimbi was quick to exploit. Savimbi used Jamba to augment UNITA's public image, investing heavily in local infrastructure. He opened the settlement to American and South African journalists, honed his public relations skills in frequent press conferences denouncing the MPLA, and lobbied for Western aid. Under the Reagan Doctrine, the US government opened covert channels to provide military assistance to UNITA. It repealed the Clark Amendment, which explicitly barred further CIA support for the UNITA and the FNLA, allowing the agency to resume Angolan operations. The Angolan government asserted this was \\"proof of the complicity there has always been between the US executive and the retrograde racist Pretoria regime\\" and it had \\"no alternative but to suspend the contacts it has had with US government envoys\\". In 1986, Savimbi visited Washington, where he met with American officials and was promised military hardware valued at about ten million dollars, including FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missiles and BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles. The US also pledged to continue its support for UNITA even if it lost the umbrella of protection conferred by the SADF presence in southern Angola. At the US government's request, South Africa began lending UNITA a greater degree of material assistance, and aided the CIA in the acquisition of untraceable arms for the Angolan insurgents. The CIA was interested in acquiring Soviet and Eastern European arms for UNITA, as they could be easily passed off as weapons individual partisans had captured from FAPLA. South Africa possessed a vast stockpile of Soviet arms seized during Operations Sceptic, Protea, and Askari, and was persuaded to transfer some of it to UNITA. =The regional arms race= After Operation Savannah had failed to prevent the ascension of the MPLA in Angola, the South African political leadership generally accepted that reversing that verdict by force was unrealistic. At the same time, Vorster and Botha had recognised that a total military defeat of PLAN was elusive without the impossible corollary of a victory over the combined FAPLA-PLAN alliance in Angola. Some hardliners in their respective administrations wanted South Africa's full military weight behind Savimbi to help him extinguish the MPLA government, while others favoured simply using it to wage a limited containment exercise against PLAN. An offensive strategy which offered the chance to aggressively attack Angola by land, sea, and air and focus directly on the MPLA's centres of power was never discussed and became more remote as time went on. In its place, therefore, the other popular option was promulgated, which was to focus chiefly on fighting PLAN, the primary threat within the geographical limits of South West Africa proper, and attempting to intimidate Angola in the form of punitive cross-border raids, thus assuming an essentially defensive posture. While Botha never seriously considered the overthrow of the MPLA as a viable objective, he endorsed increasing aid to UNITA for several reasons: it would mend diplomatic relations with the US, especially after the debacle of Operation Argon, UNITA could be molded into a proxy to harass PLAN, and donating captured weapons to Savimbi was cost- effective and deniable. South African Atlas Cheetah fighter; this was developed as a direct response to Angola's adoption of more sophisticated Soviet combat aircraft. US and South African justification for arming UNITA lay partly in the increased supply by the Soviet Union of more sophisticated weapons to FAPLA, as well as the increased number of Cuban troops in Angola, which had rapidly swelled from 25,000 to 31,000 by the end of 1985. While the Lusaka Accords were still in force, the Cuban and Soviet military delegations had urged dos Santos to take advantage of the ceasefire with the SADF to eliminate UNITA. There was a considerable increase in Soviet military assistance to Angola during this period, with the transfer of another billion dollars' worth of arms to FAPLA, including about 200 new T-55 and T-62 tanks. Moscow trained more Angolan pilots and delivered more advanced fighter aircraft to Luanda, particularly Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23s. Over a three year period Angola had become the second largest importer of arms on the African continent. FAPLA's arsenal expanded so exponentially that the SADF became convinced that the Soviet-sponsored arms buildup was intended for deployment elsewhere. General Malan gave a speech in which he expressed alarm at the \\"flood\\" of Soviet military equipment and its sophisticated nature, claiming that it was much more than needed to cope with the SADF's limited expeditionary forces and UNITA. Malan theorised that \\"the Russians want to develop a strong, stabilised base in Angola and then use the equipment and personnel positioned there wherever necessary in the subcontinent\\". South Africa gradually became locked in a conventional arms race with Angola; each side argued that it had to match the increased force available to the other. To counter the appearance of advanced MiG-23 and Sukhoi fighters in Angola, for instance, South Africa began development on two sophisticated fighter aircraft of its own, the Atlas Cheetah and the Atlas Carver. Both programmes would consume billions of rand. =Battle of Cuito Cuanavale= Lomba River campaign Intending to wrest back the initiative, sever UNITA's logistics lifelines to South West Africa and Zaire, and forestall any future insurgent offensives, FAPLA launched Operation Saluting October in mid-1987. The impetus for Saluting October likely originated with the Soviet military mission, which pressed the idea of a major conventional thrust to destroy UNITA's southeastern front as early as 1983. It had received a new commander that year, Lieutenant General Petr Gusev, former deputy commander of the Carpathian Military District. In light of the war's length, its cost, the rising death toll, and looming cuts in the Soviet military expenditure which would limit future efforts to support FAPLA's war effort, Gusev wanted a decisive multi-divisional offensive to crush UNITA once and for all. Operation Saluting October was a two-pronged offensive aimed at retaking three major settlements from UNITA, Cangamba, Cassamba, and Mavinga. The FAPLA command staff intended the attack on Cangamba and Cassamba as a feint, hoping to draw UNITA forces there and away from Mavinga. Once Mavinga was in government hands, FAPLA could expel the remaining insurgents from Moxico Province and pave the way for a final assault on Savimbi's headquarters at Jamba. Between 4 and 9 Soviet advisers were to be attached on the battalion level, albeit with strict orders not to participate in the fighting and withdraw from the front as necessary to avoid contact with UNITA. They were accompanied by a small number of Cuban advisers and East German technical personnel serving in a variety of support roles. Gusev and his staff appealed to Moscow for more aid to FAPLA, particularly strike aircraft, for another offensive; this request was granted. In what had become an annual practice, an estimated billion dollars' worth of arms was flown into Luanda by Soviet Antonov An-24 flights, as many as 12 per day for a six month period. The equipment was offloaded in the capital and transferred to Angolan Ilyushin Il-76s, which in turn flew them directly to the front. To FAPLA, the experience of planning and executing an operation of such massive proportions was relatively new, but the Soviet military mission was convinced that a decade of exhaustive training on its part had created an army capable of undertaking a complex multi-divisional offensive. The Angolan brigade commanders had repeatedly expressed reservations about splitting the force and fighting on two fronts, arguing that a single assault on Mavinga would be more linear and sufficient. FAPLA's Cuban advisers objected on the grounds that South Africa might intervene on behalf of its erstwhile ally. \\"Don't get into such wasting, costly, and finally pointless offensives,\\" Castro had vented to Gusev's staff. \\"And count us out if you do.\\" General Arnaldo Ochoa, the senior Cuban military officer in Angola, also protested that the tactics FAPLA were being forced to adopt were more applicable to combat operations in central Europe than an offensive against an irregular fighting force on the broken African terrain. Ronnie Kasrils, MK's intelligence chief, warned the Soviet mission that if Saluting October proceeded an SADF counteroffensive was imminent. Gusev overruled the Cuban and MK concerns, and the operation commenced without contingency plans for a South African intervention. The preliminary phase of the new offensive began in August 1987. Eight FAPLA brigades deployed to Tumpo, a region to the east of Cuito Cuanavale in early August, where on Soviet advice they temporarily paused for more supplies and reinforcements. This would prove to be a fatal error. On 14 August, having lost days of precious time, FAPLA resumed its efforts to advance; by then South Africa had launched Operation Moduler to halt the offensive. The bloody campaign that followed entailed a series of engagements known collectively as the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale. Signal bell used by FAPLA's 47 Infantry Brigade at the Lomba River. Prior to 1987, the South African government was reluctant to become directly involved with its UNITA's internal struggle with Luanda, other than providing that movement with arms and some limited air and artillery support. Nevertheless, Botha recognised that if Jamba fell, the buffer provided by UNITA's presence in southern Angola would collapse with it, and FAPLA would allow PLAN to gain direct access to its territory continguous to the border. This would make PLAN infiltration of northern South West Africa almost impossible to check, especially in the Caprivi Strip and Kavangoland. As Cuban and MK sources had predicted, the commitment of regular ground troops alongside UNITA was authorised, albeit on the condition that strict control would be exercised over combat operations at the highest level of government to ensure that political and diplomatic requirements meshed with the military ones. The SADF took advantage of FAPLA's numerous delays to assemble a blocking force strong enough to stop the FAPLA drive on Mavinga. By the end of August, South Africa's expeditionary forces near Mavinga had built up to include 32 Battalion, 101 Battalion of the SWATF, and its elite 61 Mechanised Battalion Group. There were three major rivers and nine tributaries between Cuito Cuanavale and Mavinga. Although none of the rivers were especially large, all the prospective crossing points were adjacent to vast expanses of swamps and waterlogged flood plains. These stalled the FAPLA advance and permitted the SADF to create effective choke points which further hampered FAPLA's progress. The South African general staff judged correctly that if these narrow entry points were seriously contested they had the potential to bottleneck the FAPLA brigades. They opted to launch a counteroffensive at the Lomba River, which was the last of the three rivers FAPLA had to cross before reaching Mavinga. The success of the South African counteroffensive was ensured by the rapid collapse of FAPLA's 47 Infantry Brigade, which was tasked with establishing a bridgehead on the Lomba's southern bank. In conventional terms, the FAPLA brigades theoretically possessed more than enough strength and firepower to dislodge UNITA and the SADF from the Lomba River. But they were inadequately trained or experienced to counter the South African blocking force, which was composed of units selected for their experience in mobile bush warfare, and were outmanoeuvred in the thick foliage cover. The Lomba's swampy environment also hampered coordinated actions and allowed the SADF to isolate and route each brigade in piecemeal engagements. Between September and October 1987 FAPLA suffered almost 2,000 casualties during several failed river crossings. With much of its bridging equipment destroyed, FAPLA abandoned the offensive and ordered its remaining brigades back to Cuito Cuanavale. The Soviet military mission had suffered 1 seriously wounded. The SADF had suffered 17 dead and 41 wounded, as well as the loss of 5 armoured vehicles. During Operation Moduler, Cuban combat troops had remained well north of the Lomba River and declined to participate in the fighting, per Castro's instructions. In Luanda, President dos Santos summoned General Gusev and the senior Cuban general officer, Gustavo Fleitas Ramirez, for an urgent conference to discuss the worsening military situation and the failure of Operation Saluting October. Ramirez reminded dos Santos that Cuba had been opposed to the offensive from the beginning. Gusev lamented in his memoirs that \\"I informed [chief of the Soviet general staff] Akhromeyev about the result of the operation, but the most difficult task, in moral terms, was to inform the president of Angola, whom I had assured that the operation would succeed and that Savimbi would be crushed\\". On 25 November 1987, United Nations Security Council Resolution 602 was passed, condemning Operation Moduler as an illegal violation of Angolan sovereignty. The resolution expressed dismay at the continued presence of SADF troops in Angola and called for their unconditional withdrawal. South African foreign minister Pik Botha flatly dismissed the resolution out of hand, citing the unaddressed issue of Cuban linkage. He promised that the SADF would depart Angola once FAPLA's Cuban and Soviet advisers had likewise been withdrawn, or when their presence no longer threatened South African interests. Tumpo Triangle campaign On 29 September P.W. Botha added a third objective to Operation Moduler: the destruction of all FAPLA units east of Cuito Cuanavale. The reasons for this shift in objectives once FAPLA had abandoned its offensive were not apparent to everybody in the South African government. Pik Botha and his senior colleagues in the foreign ministry cautioned against a major offensive north of the Lomba, citing potential diplomatic repercussions. But confidence in the SADF had been buoyed by its effective defence of the Lomba, and members of the South African general staff successfully agitated for a renewed offensive towards Cuito Cuanavale. It is unclear whether they interpreted their new objective as veiled permission to seize Cuito Cuanavale itself, although the option was discussed. Per Botha's new directive, the SADF commenced Operation Hooper with the goal of encircling the retreating Angolan brigades and preparing for operations further east of the Cuito River. The decision to commence Hooper towards the end of the 1987 calendar year created problems for the SADF, since a number of white conscripts involved in the Lomba River engagements were nearing the end of their national service. This led to a delay of several weeks while the existing troops were gradually withdrawn from Angola and replaced with a new intake. The SADF had dispatched a second mechanised battalion, 4 South African Infantry, to Angola, as well as a squadron of Olifant Mk1A tanks and a battery of G5 and G6 howitzers. Between January and March 1988, the SADF and UNITA launched several bloody offensives just east of Cuito Cuanavale to destroy the shattered Angolan units that had succeeded in establishing a new defensive line there, an initiative which became known as Operation Packer. They managed to drive FAPLA deeper into a shrinking perimeter between the Cuito, Tumpo, and Dala rivers known as the \\"Tumpo Triangle\\". The Cubans and Soviets concurred with FAPLA's decision to withdraw to Cuito Cuanavale, with Castro pointing out that a strong defensive stand could plausibly be made there if the brigades managed to reach it. He also suggested that the only way to defeat the South African expeditionary forces in the long term was to outflank them and apply pressure to the South West African border. This would entail opening up yet another military front, in southwestern Angola, well south of Cuito Cuanavale. On 15 November, dos Santos had written a letter to Castro requesting direct Cuban military assistance against the SADF. Castro agreed on the condition that he and General Arnaldo Ochoa receive command of all FAPLA forces on the front. The Soviet military mission was notably excluded from all future operational planning. Shortly afterwards, the Cuban government authorised the deployment of an armoured brigade and several air defence units‚Äîabout 3,000 personnel‚Äîto Cuito Cuanavale. Castro suspected that the South Africans would not be content with eliminating FAPLA east of the town and that they intended to take control of Cuito Cuanavale's strategic airfield as well. His strategy was to strengthen the defence of that settlement while dispatching a few more brigades to Lobito, near the South West African border. The FAPLA and Cuban defenders now ringed their defensive positions with minefields and interlocking fields of fire from dug-in tanks and field guns, into which they channelled SADF assaults. On multiple occasions the combined UNITA and SADF forces launched unsuccessful offensives which became bogged down in minefields along narrow avenues of approach and were abandoned when the attackers came under heavy fire from the Cuban and FAPLA artillerymen west of the Cuito River. The defenders' artillery was sited just beyond the maximum range of the South African artillery and on high ground which gave them a commanding view of the battlefield. This advantage, coupled with the proliferation of minefields, and heavily reinforced FAPLA-Cuban defensive positions rendered further attacks by the South African troops futile. Operations Hooper and Packer were terminated after the SADF had killed almost 700 FAPLA troops and destroyed about half of the Angolan brigades' remaining tanks and armoured vehicles. Cuba had suffered 42 dead and the loss of 6 tanks. South African casualties were relatively light: 13 dead and several dozen severely wounded. Three SADF tanks were also abandoned in a minefield, while most of the others were damaged beyond immediate repair or rendered unserviceable due to mechanical problems. UNITA suffered thousands of casualties, prompting accusations that its troops had been used as \\"cannon fodder\\" by the SADF. Cuban post-action reports claimed that UNITA insurgents had been sent through the minefields at gunpoint to clear the way for the South African armour. SADF Mirage F1s in close formation. The great distances they had to fly to reach the operational area would prove to be a handicap during Operations Hooper and Packer. The Tumpo Triangle campaign exposed several flaws in the planning of the South African defence chiefs and general staff. They had estimated quite accurately that their forces would be able to inflict a crushing defeat on FAPLA in the flood plains and open terrain south of Cuito Cuanavale. But they had not anticipated so many Angolan units would survive and establish strong defensive lines in the Tumpo Triangle, or that the addition of Cuban troops there would stiffen the resistance considerably. Further South African miscalculations appeared in the latter phases of the campaign. One was the assumption that the small and highly mobile but lightly armed SADF expeditionary force was suited to mounting frontal attacks on well-prepared defenders supported by dug in artillery west of Cuito. The use of battalions trained and organised for mobile warfare in this manner was in violation of the SADF's own mechanised doctrine. The defending Angolans had ample armour, anti-tank weapons, and the benefit of air cover: the Soviet Union's increased willingness to supply FAPLA with advanced fighter aircraft and even Soviet pilots on loan posed a serious threat to South African air operations over Cuito Cuanavale. As Soviet involvement grew, and the number of air battles increased, South Africa's air force began encountering MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighters flown by well-trained Soviet pilots. Furthermore, Angolan pilots newly trained under Soviet supervision at Lubango were proving more capable of challenging South African fighters. For the first time the SADF began losing aircraft in numbers, indicating the contested extent of the Angolan skies. The SADF's declining air superiority forced a number of operational changes. South African pilots exercised a standoff bombing capacity of twenty kilometres and timed their raids so they were out of range before FAPLA MiGs could be scrambled to intercept them. The necessity of avoiding prolonged aerial contact was partly dictated by fuel considerations: the SADF Mirage F1AZ and F1CZ fighters launched from distant bases in South West Africa, which meant they had barely enough fuel for three minutes of combat once they reached Cuito Cuanavale. The impact on ground operations was more consequential. FAPLA MiGs flew reconnaissance missions in search of the G5 and G6 howitzers, forcing the South African artillery crews to resort to increasingly elaborate camouflage and take the precaution of carrying out their bombardments after dark. Owing to the increase in losses and damage due to UNITA's US-supplied Stinger missiles, however, MiG pilots had to adopt contingencies of their own to reduce the vulnerability of their aircraft. Cuban and Angolan warplanes were forced to drop bombs from higher altitudes, greatly reducing their accuracy. FAPLA airfields were also monitored by South African forward artillery observers, who called in bombardments to destroy aircraft while they were exposed on the runway and preparing to take off. =Final Cuban offensive= Although the SADF and UNITA counteroffensive had been checked, FAPLA remained heavily strained and more dependent than before on its Cuban allies and Soviet materiel. This gave dos Santos an incentive to ease the military dilemma with negotiations and he reopened the possibility of reaching a new ceasefire and disengagement agreement with South Africa. As early as January 1987, Chester Crocker had responded to positive signals from Luanda, especially when President Denis Sassou Nguesso of the People's Republic of the Congo offered to mediate peace talks between the rival states. Yet preliminary discussions in Brazzaville throughout late 1987 and early 1988 remained stymied by the Angolan government's refusal to compromise on the timetable for a proposed Cuban withdrawal. The Cuban government had not been consulted on the Brazzaville talks in advance and resented what it perceived as a discourtesy on the part of dos Santos. This factor had the effect of persuading Castro to make an authoritative bid to join the Angolan-US peace talks. He was determined that Cuba no longer be excluded from negotiations concerning its own military, and the results of any future settlement on the withdrawal process leave Cuba's image untarnished. Cuban S-125 \\"SA-3 Goa\\" missile systems on parade. Many were shipped to Angola in 1988 to provide air cover for Castro's offensive. While Operation Hooper was underway in late January 1988, Crocker relented to pressure and accepted Cuba as an equal partner in further peace talks. Castro agreed that he would not introduce extraneous issues to the agenda, such as Cuba‚ÄìUS relations, and that discussion of a phased troop withdrawal would extend to all Cuban military personnel stationed in Angola, including combat troops, logistical staff, and advisers. With Cuba's entry into the Brazzaville talks, its desire to shift its military involvement in Angola from a passive, defensive role to an offensive one intensified. Castro opted to escalate ground operations against the SADF, since he considered diplomatic progress impossible as long as South Africa still clung to the likelihood of a tactical victory. He retained a solely defensive posture at Cuito Cuanavale, keeping the SADF fixed in place, while carrying out his longstanding proposal to launch a flanking manoeuvre towards the South West African border. It was a risky operation, beginning with a movement of Cuban troops in divisional strength west of the Cunene River, which had the potential to expand into an invasion of South West Africa. On 9 March, Castro sent the Cuban forces massed at Lobito, which had grown to about 40,000 men, southwards. He likened their movement to \\"a boxer who with his left hand blocks the blow [at Cuito Cuanavale] and with his right ‚Äì strikes [in the west]\\". \\"That way,\\" Castro recounted on another occasion, \\"while the South African troops were being bled slowly dry in Cuito Cuanavale, down in the southwest...40,000 Cuban soldiers...backed by about 600 tanks, hundreds of artillery pieces, 1,000 anti-aircraft weapons, and the daring MiG-23 units that took over the skies, advanced towards the Namibian border, ready to sweep away the South African forces\\". As the Cuban brigades advanced, they accumulated thousands of PLAN insurgents, who departed their bases to join the offensive. The presence of so many Cuban troops effectively resuscitated PLAN's sagging fortunes, as it curtailed new South African military initiatives against the insurgents not only in Angola but South West Africa as well. Firstly, the region being occupied by the Cubans just north of the border was the same territory the SADF had monitored and patrolled for almost a decade in order to prevent PLAN infiltration into Ovamboland. Secondly, all South African units near the border had ceased routine counter- insurgency operations while they were being mobilised to resist a potential Cuban invasion. Matters were complicated further when the Cubans formed three joint battalions with PLAN fighters, each with its own artillery and armoured contingents. Due to the integration of the insurgents with Cuban personnel at the battalion level, South African patrols found it impossible to engage PLAN in Angola without risking a much larger confrontation involving aggressive and well-armed Cuban troops. The limited SADF troops available near the border could not halt the continued progress of the Cuban army or reduce the threat to South West Africa. There were simply too few men to hold the broad defensive positions along the Cutline against a conventional force in divisional strength. When South African officials warned against an invasion of South West Africa, Castro retorted that they were \\"in no position to demand anything\\". Havana also issued an ambiguous statement which read, \\"we are not saying we will not go into Namibia\\". The South African government responded by mobilising 140,000 reservists‚Äîa figure almost unprecedented in SADF history‚Äîand threatening severe repercussions on any Cuban unit which crossed the border. =1988 Tripartite Accord= Despite taking the necessary countermeasures on the battlefield, the South African government discerned it had reached the political limits of further escalation in Angola. The casualties sustained during the Cuito Cuanavale campaign had been sufficient to cause public alarm and provoke difficult questions about the tactical situation on the border and why South African soldiers were dying there. There was little reason to believe yet another bloody campaign would be successful in expelling the Soviets and Cuba from the region; on the contrary, as in the past, it could lead to an increase in the amount of Soviet weapons and Cuban troops. The conflict had also evolved from a low-intensity struggle against lightly armed insurgents into protracted battles between armies backed by all the paraphernalia of modern conventional warfare, with the accompanying rise in human and material costs. This contributed to a sense of war weariness and increased the growing skepticism and sensitivity in civilian circles toward the SADF's Angolan operations. The failure of the Soviet-supervised Operation Saluting October, along with the consequent destruction of hundreds of millions of dollars' of FAPLA's Soviet-supplied arms, had the effect of moderating Moscow's stance on Angola. In a notable departure from its previous foreign policy stance, the Soviet Union disclosed it too was weary of the Angolan and South West African conflicts and was prepared to assist in a peace process‚Äîeven one conducted on the basis of Cuban linkage. Reformist premier Mikhail Gorbachev also wished to reduce defence expenditures, including the enormous open-ended commitment of military aid to FAPLA, and was more open to a political settlement accordingly. Chester Crocker, US diplomat. Crocker's influence and mediation was instrumental in talks which established the Tripartite Accord. For South Africa and the Soviet Union‚Äîthe two parties which had previously refrained from joining the US-mediated talks‚Äîthe point had now been reached where the costs of continuing the war exceeded its anticipated benefits. This necessitated a change in perceptions in both nations, which began warming to the possibility of a negotiated peace. The Soviet government agreed to jointly sponsor with the US a series of renewed peace talks on 3 and 4 May 1988. For its part, South Africa made its first bid to join the tripartite negotiations and agreed to send a delegation of diplomats, intelligence chiefs, and senior SADF officers. The Soviet and US diplomats in attendance, including Crocker, made it clear to the South Africans that they wanted peace in Angola and a political settlement in South West Africa. They were also agreed on the need to bring pressure on their respective allies to bring about a solution. South Africa would be expected to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, in exchange for the complete withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The Cuban and Angolan delegations had already assented to a complete Cuban withdrawal, and under US pressure produced an extremely precise timetable which extended this process over three to four years. South Africa found this unacceptable but conceded that the withdrawal could be timed to certain benchmarks in the Namibian independence process. According to Crocker, the US decision to use Security Council Resolution 435 as the basis and pivot for a regional settlement provided leverage over the discussions. The proposed formation of a UN \\"verification mission\\" to monitor Cuba's adherence to a withdrawal settlement proved instrumental in persuading the South African government that it would receive a balanced agreement. The talks began progressing more smoothly after July 1988, when Carlos Aldana Escalante was appointed head of the Cuban delegation. Aldana was chief of ideological affairs and international relations for the Communist Party of Cuba; he was far better informed of foreign developments, particularly in the Soviet bloc, than many of his contemporaries. In light of Gorbachev's reforms, political developments in Eastern Europe, and the reduction of tensions between the superpowers, Aldana believed that Cuba needed to work swiftly towards normalising relations with the US. Cooperation vis-√†-vis Southern Africa was seen as a natural prerequisite to better relations with Washington and possibly, a permanent bilateral dialogue. Between May and September 1988 the parties met for several rounds of talks in Cairo, New York, Geneva, and Brazzaville, but remained deadlocked on the nuances of the withdrawal timetable. The fact that there were two objectives‚ÄîNamibian independence and a Cuban withdrawal‚Äîdoubly aggravated the issue of timing and deadlines. In August, the Angolan, Cuban, and South African delegations signed the Geneva Protocol, which established the principles for a peace settlement in South West Africa and committed the SADF to a withdrawal from that territory. As a direct result of the Geneva Protocol, PLAN declared a ceasefire effective from 10 August. The 1988 US presidential elections lent new urgency to the negotiations, which had recently stalled after six consecutive rounds of talks in Brazzaville. Angola and Cuba had gambled heavily on a victory for Michael Dukakis and the Democratic Party during the US elections, hoping that this would spell the end of US aid to UNITA and a harder line on South Africa. At the time of the Geneva Protocol, dos Santos had commented that \\"if the Democrats had won the elections, there would be a readjustment in US policy, particularly on Southern Africa\\". The election of Republican candidate George H. W. Bush had the effect of persuading the Angolan and Cuban delegations to be more flexible. Crocker reiterated on several occasions that a new US administration meant changes in personnel and basic policy review, and pressed them not to waste months of effort. Three days after the US election results were released, the parties reconvened in Geneva and within the week had agreed to a phased Cuban withdrawal over the course of twenty seven months. In exchange, South Africa pledged to begin bestowing independence on South West Africa by 1 November 1989. On 13 December, South Africa, Angola, and Cuba signed the Brazzaville Protocol, which affirmed their commitment to these conditions and set up a Joint Military Monitoring Commission (JMMC) to supervise the disengagement in Angola. The JMMC was to include Soviet and US observers. All hostilities between the belligerents, including PLAN, were to formally cease by 1 April 1989. On 22 December, the Brazzaville Protocol was enshrined in the Tripartite Accord, which required the SADF to withdraw from Angola and reduce its troop levels in South West Africa to a token force of 1,500 within twelve weeks. Simultaneously, all Cuban brigades would be withdrawn from the border to an area north of the 15th parallel. At least 3,000 Cuban military personnel would depart Angola by April 1989, with another 25,000 leaving within the next six months. The remaining troops would depart at a date not later than 1 July 1991. An additional condition was that South Africa would cease all support for UNITA, and Angola likewise for PLAN and MK. On 20 December, United Nations Security Council Resolution 626 was passed, creating the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) to verify the redeployment northwards and subsequent withdrawal of the Cuban forces from Angola. UNAVEM included observers from Western as well as non-aligned and communist nations. In February 1989 the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) was formed to monitor the South West African peace process. Namibian independence The initial terms of the Geneva Protocol and Security Council Resolution 435 provided the foundation from which a political settlement in South West Africa could proceed: holding of elections for a constitutional assembly, confinement of both PLAN and the SADF to their respective bases, the subsequent phased withdrawal of all but 1,500 SADF troops, demobilisation of all paramilitary forces that belonged to neither the SADF nor to the police, and the return of refugees via designated entry points to participate in elections. Responsibility for implementing these terms rested with UNTAG, which would assist in the SADF withdrawal, monitor the borders, and supervise the demobilisation of paramilitary units. UNTAG checkpoint at Ondangwa, June 1989. Controversy soon arose over the size of UNTAG's military component, as the member states of the Security Council expected to cover the majority of the costs were irritated by its relatively large size. However, Angola, Zambia, and other states sympathetic to PLAN insisted that a larger force was necessary to ensure that South Africa did not interfere with independence proceedings. Against their objections UNTAG's force levels were reduced from the proposed 7,500 to three battalions of 4,650 troops. This slashed projected expenses by nearly three hundred million dollars, but the Security Council did not approve the revised budget until 1 March 1989. The inevitable delay in UNTAG's full deployment ensured there were insufficient personnel prepared to monitor the movement of PLAN and the SADF or their confinement to bases on 1 April, when the permanent cessation in hostilities was to take effect. Secretary-General de Cu√©llar urged restraint in the interim on both sides to avoid jeopardising the de facto ceasefire maintained since August 1988 or the 1 April implementation schedule. Nevertheless, PLAN took advantage of the political uncertainty in the weeks following the UNTAG budget debate to begin moving its forces in Angola closer to the border. Since the early 1980s PLAN had consistently stated its intention to establish camps inside South West Africa during any future political transition, a notion rejected with equal consistency by the South African government. Compounding this fact was that PLAN insurgents also identified themselves as refugees without making any distinction between their civilian or military background, and the UN had explicitly invited refugees to return home. Indeed, PLAN did not possess many regular standing units and by the late 1980s many of its personnel followed cyclical patterns of fighting as insurgents before returning to refugee camps as civilians. On 31 March, Pik Botha complained to the JMMC that PLAN troops had advanced south of the 16th parallel and were massing less than eight kilometres from the border. He promptly intercepted UN Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari and UNTAG commander Dewan Prem Chand that evening and gave them the same information. On the morning of 1 April, the first PLAN cadres crossed into Ovamboland, unhindered by UNTAG, which had failed to monitor their activity in Angola due to the delays in its deployment. Ahtisaari immediately contacted SWAPO, ordering it to rein in PLAN, to little avail. The South African foreign ministry also contacted the Secretary-General, who in turn relayed the same message to SWAPO officials in New York. At the end of the day, with no signs of the PLAN advance abating, Ahtisaari lifted all restrictions confining the SADF to its bases. Local police mobilised and fought off the invaders in a delaying action until regular SADF forces were able to deploy with six battalions. After the first two days the insurgents lost their offensive initiative, and the combined South African forces drove PLAN back across the border in a counteroffensive codenamed Operation Merlyn. Between 1 April ‚Äì 9 April 273 PLAN insurgents were killed in the fighting. The SADF and police suffered 23 dead. On 8 April, the JMMC had issued the Mount Etjo Declaration, which reiterated that the Tripartite Accord was still in effect and that South Africa, Angola, and Cuba remained committed to peace. It also ordered all PLAN insurgents remaining in Ovamboland to surrender at UNTAG-supervised assembly points. Sam Nujoma denied any incursion had taken place on 1 April, claiming that he had only ordered PLAN insurgents already inside South West Africa to begin establishing base camps. He also pointed out that SWAPO had never been a signatory to the Tripartite Accord, and therefore the cessation of hostilities as dictated by its terms was non-binding. This drew some ire from Angola, which had given guarantees to the UN that PLAN would remain north of the 16th parallel. The SADF was re-confined to its bases on 26 April, then released into Ovamboland again to verify that the insurgents had departed. By May, all PLAN insurgents had been relocated north of the 16th parallel under JMMC supervision, effectively ending the South African Border War. General elections under a universal franchise were held in South West Africa between 7 and 11 November 1989, returning 57% of the popular vote for SWAPO. This gave SWAPO 41 seats in the territory's Constituent Assembly, but not a two-thirds majority which would have enabled it to unilaterally draft a constitution without the other parties represented. South West Africa formally obtained independence as the Republic of Namibia on 21 March 1990.

AFL career A highly skillful and strongly built wingman, Darren Millane was one of Collingwood's greatest footballers before a fatal car accident ended his career in 1991 at the age of 26. Millane was considered by Sydney and St Kilda, but Hawthorn won the chance, with Millane training at Glenferrie with the Hawks, but did not like the atmosphere and went back to captain Dandenong in the Victorian Football Association. Collingwood snapped him up and Millane liked what he saw, and his football career came along nicely, debuting in 1984, aged 19. In 1987, Millane won the best and fairest award. He found his place on the wing and was a footballer known for his toughness and attitude towards the game. He was most likely the recipient on the end of the kick-outs because of his strength. Although his skills were occasionally poor, at his best he found and used the football well, and became a favourite to fans at Victoria Park. In 1990, the premiership drought breaking year for the Magpies, Millane was at his peak. He won the AFL Players Association MVP Award, now known as the Leigh Matthews Trophy; was selected in the AFL Team of the Year for the first time; and came second in Collingwood's best and fairest; but it was his finals campaign that was recognised. He broke his thumb just before the series, but continued to play with pain-killers during the campaign. In the Grand Final, against Essendon, he had 24 touches, and ended up throwing the ball up in the air as the siren went at 5:11 pm to end Collingwood's thirty-two year drought on 6 October. =Career highlights= *Collingwood best and fairest 1987 *Collingwood 2nd best and fairest 1990 *AFL Team of the Year 1990 *Leigh Matthews Trophy 1990 *Collingwood premiership side 1990 *Collingwood Team of the Century member Death On 7 October 1991, Millane was killed in a car crash while intoxicated. On the early morning of the day, he was driving on Queens Road, near Albert Park Lake, before he clipped a semi-trailer and rolled his car, being killed instantly. The autopsy revealed his blood alcohol content was 0.322 -- almost six-and-a-half times the legal driving limit of 0.05. He was on his way to his Noble Park home and that day was set to join 19 other members of the 1990 premiership side. The reunion did not go ahead as players, officials and supporters went instead to mourn Millane's death at Victoria Park. Millane's funeral was held at the Dandenong Town Hall, where more than 5000 people attended, while the large crowd outside heard the service on a loud-speaker. Millane's guernsey with No. 42 on it was laid on the coffin, while the 1990 flag hung in the background at half-mast. The No. 42 guernsey has since been retired from the club. In 2011 there were discussions to bring it back to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Millane's death.

It ensures that the device starts operating in a known state.  PoR generator  In VLSI devices, the power-on reset (PoR) is an electronic device incorporated into the integrated circuit that detects the power applied to the chip and generates a reset impulse that goes to the entire circuit placing it into a known state. A simple PoR uses the charging of a capacitor, in series with a resistor, to measure a time period during which the rest of the circuit is held in a reset state. A Schmitt trigger may be used to deassert the reset signal cleanly, once the rising voltage of the RC network passes the threshold voltage of the Schmitt trigger. The resistor and capacitor values should be determined so that the charging of the RC network takes long enough that the supply voltage will have stabilised by the time the threshold is reached. One of the issues with using RC network to generate PoR pulse is the sensitivity of the R and C values to the power-supply ramp characteristics. When the power supply ramp is rapid, the R and C values can be calculated so that the time to reach the switching threshold of the schmitt trigger is enough to apply a long enough reset pulse. When the power supply ramp itself is slow, the RC network tends to get charged up along with the power-supply ramp up. So when the input schmitt stage is all powered up and ready, the input voltage from the RC network would already have crossed the schmitt trigger point. This means that there might not be a reset pulse supplied to the core of the VLSI.

At present, it has 12 members who represent all five Catholic dioceses and all two territorial prelatures in the Nordic countries. It is unusual for bishops' conferences to be organised across several countries, but this reflects the fact that there are fewer than half a million Catholics in these countries. The Conference states as its tasks: * to further the common pastoral work in the region * to enable the bishops to consult with one another * to coordinate the work of the Church in the dioceses * to make possible common decisions on the regional level * to facilitate contacts with the Catholic Church in Europe and in the whole world The most important decision-making organ is the plenary session. This meets twice a year at different places in the Nordic dioceses and sometimes outside of Northern Europe. Besides that there is the Permanent Council which also meets twice a year to plan the plenary sessions and to decide on urgent matters. Between meetings it is the secretary general, currently Sister Anna Mirijam Kaschner, CPS, who coordinates the work and the contacts between the bishops. History of the Scandinavian Bishops Conference The first known episcopal encounter took place in May 1923 in Gothenburg. The Vicars Apostolic of Sweden (Mgr. Johannes E. M√ºller: 1877-1965), Denmark (Mgr. Josef Brems: 1870-1958), and Norway (Mgr. Jan O. Smit: 1883-1972) discussed themes of common interest such as the best way of dealing with the congregations of women religious, how to foster the spiritual life of their priests, but above all how to prepare for the announced Scandinavian tour of the Cardinal Prefect of the Roman Congregation Propaganda Fide, Willem Marinus van Rossum, the first such dignitary to enter Scandinavia since the Reformation. The next encounter took place in two stages: first in Stockholm on August 12, 1923, when Bishop M√ºller played host to Bishops Brems and Smit en route to Helsinki. During a festive reunion Bishop M√ºller launched a warm appeal for increased Nordic Catholic collaboration and announced that an important Scandinavian Catholic congress probably would soon be arranged in Copenhagen. Nine years, however, were to pass before this became a reality. The second stage was celebrated in Helsinki on August 15, 1923, when Bishop M. J. Buckx, S.C.I. (1881-1946) received the episcopal consecration at the hands of Cardinal van Rossum. The only recorded subject for discussion during the following day's meeting was the Cardinal Prefect's earnest call for the founding of a minor seminary in Scandinavia, a matter which the bishops decided to take very seriously in spite of the obvious difficulties involved. The third meeting took place in Copenhagen in February 1924 where, in addition to the above-mentioned prelates, the Local Ordinary of the newly erected Prefecture Apostolic of Iceland, Rev. Marteinn Meulenberg, S.M., completed the Nordic representation. The discussions, referred to as being \\"private and of an informative character,\\" seem to have been a continuation of the agenda from the previous encounters. A further meeting was held in Stockholm in 1927 without, unfortunately, leaving anything for the record. In August 1932 the announced Internordic Catholic rally finally took place in Copenhagen in the form of a Eucharistic Congress. All five countries were represented. Bishop Smit, who had resigned in 1927, was replaced by Bishop-elect Mgr. Jacques Mangers, S.M. (1889-1972), Vicar of South Norway, that country having in 1931 been divided into three jurisdictions. Among the many foreign dignitaries present for the occasion we find, once more, Cardinal van Rossum (who died only some weeks later) and Cardinal August Hlond of Gniezno and Pozna≈Ñ. It stands to reason that the busy programme of a Eucharistic Congress did not allow time for a formal Conference meeting. More is known of the next encounter in Stockholm in April 1936, when Bishop M√ºller chaired a two-day meeting including bishops Brems, Mangers, and William Cobben, S.C.I., Finland's new Vicar Apostolic (1897-1985). Iceland was unrepresented. The matters discussed were to re-emerge during later Conference Plenaries: the fostering of vocations both to the priesthood and the religious life, as well as the spiritual and material well-being of candidates; the image of the Roman Catholic Church in the mass media of the day; basic principles for pastoral care; the production of fitting literature for Catholics, etc. In the compte-rendu consequently sent to the Propaganda Fide Congregation in Rome, three salient points were made: # the necessity of adapting Roman Catholic institutions to the high level of culture in the North; # the urgent necessity of establishing a minor seminary; # the fact that nothing damages Catholicism more than immoral behaviour and scandal within the Church itself. Very soon after, the same ordinaries assembled again, this time in Copenhagen (July 1936) at the direct behest of the Propaganda Fide Congregation, in order to continue their deliberations. Alas, nothing came of the ambitious plan to establish a minor seminary. The project, however, has continued to haunt the Nordic bishops' meetings over the years. A further conference was not convened until after the Second World War, when Bishop M√ºller in June 1946 chaired a meeting in Stockholm. Participants were the aforementioned bishops, except for Denmark where Bishop Theodor Suhr, O.S.B. (b. 1896) had replaced Bishop Brems. In addition, the Apostolic Prefects of Middle Norway, Antonius Deutsch, SS.CC. (1896-1980) and North Norway, Johannes Wember, M.S.F. (1900-1980) were also present. Only Iceland was missing. Several points of interest were brought up: especially marriage questions seemed to have been a matter in need of clarification. A final meeting took place in Oslo in September 1951, where marriage questions were again on the agenda. Various items were discussed, amongst others the growing conviction that the time had now come for the Apostolic Vicariates to become fully fledged dioceses. It was decided that a request to this effect be forwarded to Rome. As we now know, this was soon to be granted. The prehistory of this informal conference activity came to a close when in 1959 Pope John XXIII decided to send a permanent Apostolic Visitor to the five Nordic Countries (Archbishop M.H. Lucas), an arrangement which was soon to end in the formal establishment of the Apostolic Delegation to Scandinavia on March 1, 1960, with Mgr. Lucas in charge. The establishment of the Scandinavian Episcopal Conference followed only two months after that of the Apostolic Delegation. Convoked by the Apostolic Delegate, the entire hierarchy of the five countries met in Bergen (South Norway) on May 1, 1960, with the prime purpose of founding a proper bishops' conference. Some participants were still the same as in 1951 (Bishops Cobben, Mangers, Suhr, and Wember). Newcomers were Bishops Ansgar Nelson, O.S.B., of Stockholm (b. 1906), Johannes Gunnarson, S.M.M., of Iceland (1897-1972), and Johannes R√ºth, SS.CC., of Central Norway (1899 - 1978). After some days of preliminary clarifications, the \\"Conventus Ordinariorum Scandiae\\" was formally established on May 4. After a secret vote, Bishops Suhr and Nelson were elected chairman and vice-chairman respectively. The meeting, which lasted a full week, bore most of the marks of proper Episcopal Conferences developed as a result of the Second Vatican Council. Agreement was reached on several issues, such as common days of fasting and abstinence, clerical clothing, Internordic jurisdiction for hearing confessions, a common Catholic Directory, the canonical form for marriage, altar boys' societies, a yearly vocations Sunday, and other items of mutual interest and uncertainty. The erection of episcopal conferences was as yet by no means obligatory. This, then, was a freely agreed-upon instrument of mutual help and cooperation. And as such it was in advance of most European Conferences, which were only established in connection with the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Rome, though praising the Scandinavian initiative by sending a high-level congratulatory telegram, did not formally recognise this or any of the existing conferences. Nor did the Holy See as yet use them as consultative bodies, but all this was to come. The necessities arising from Vatican II brought about the change. The Second Vatican Council assembled approximately 2500 major prelates from all five continents. It soon became clear that a dividing up of this large body was necessary. But how to go about carrying out this division? The answer was by resorting to the already partly existing structures, i.e., the Bishops' Conferences. These would normally coincide with national boundaries, as had long been the case with the German Episcopal Conferences which had existed for over 100 years. A hurried establishment of such entities, willed by the Holy See to be ad hoc, was effected for the sole purpose of facilitating the working out of common stands on the Council documents. Any bishop who presented a paper in the Council aula in the name of such a conference was granted priority. The Council itself decided that episcopal conferences were practical and useful bodies which should carry on in an institutionalised way. It was also clear that the Holy See, which traditionally had had to deal with individual dioceses, liked the idea of sharing some of the burden of labour and responsibility with these much larger units. After long discussions and several attempts at formulating practical guidelines, the Council could finally lay down a framework for such conferences in its Decree Christus Dominus (about the Pastoral Responsibility of Bishops), promulgated on October 28, 1965. This framework was followed by a more detailed set of rulings in the Papal motu proprio Ecclesiae Sanctae of August 6, 1966. Although there was now a set of guidelines common to all bishops' conferences, each is obliged to work out its own statutes, which, however, need the subsequent approval of the Holy See. The Nordic Episcopal Conference had its statutes already worked out and approved by its members in 1962. When the Vatican Council institutionalised and imposed conferences generally, new statutes had to be elaborated ‚Äì a task which, starting with the first revision over four conference sessions in 1965, has continued at regular intervals. This is because Rome prefers to approve such rulings for a maximum period of five years, ad experimentum as the formula goes. When the new body of Canon Law became effective on the first Sunday of Advent 1983, most of these statutes had to undergo at least revisory touches. And so the newly updated statutes of the Nordic Episcopal Conference, approved by the bishops in its Plenary Session in Stella Maris near Helsinki on September 27, 1984, were duly transmitted to Rome and received unqualified approbation on January 19, 1985.

It extended the terms that had been achieved under the Kilmainham Treaty. It set up a ¬£5 million fund and any tenant who wanted to buy land could do so. One could take a loan from the government and would pay it back in monthly installments. The Act was effected by, and informally named for, Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne, the then Lord Chancellor of Ireland. The loans would be paid back over 48 years and the rate of interest would be fixed at 4% per annum. This made the loan repayments affordable, and more people could benefit from the Act as they would now be able to buy their own land. It strengthened the original Irish Land Acts as they had enabled tenants to buy land in restricted circumstances. The Ashbourne Act formally gave this right to the tenants and funded the Land Commission It has been argued that the Act was passed to win the support of Charles Stewart Parnell. Salisbury knew that his government would not last long as the Liberal Party had an overall majority. Salisbury realised that he would need Irish Party support to maintain power. Therefore, the Ashbourne act was a way to win over Parnell while keeping William Ewart Gladstone on the backbenches. This failed, as Gladstone came into government soon after and introduced the Government of Ireland Bill 1886; which however also failed. The Ashbourne Act was extended in 1889.

The townsite was located just inland from Strathcona Sound, about east of the community of Arctic Bay in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. There is a port and dock about north of the former mine site which was used for shipping concentrate from the site, and receiving supplies (). It is currently used by the Canadian Coast Guard for training. Nanisivik Airport located south was used as the main airport for Arctic Bay until 2010 when the lengthened Arctic Bay Airport took over. The airport is about directly southeast of Arctic Bay but the road between them is .Arctic Bay and Nanisivik Geology The ore deposit resides within dolomite from the Society Cliffs Formation covered with dolomitic shale from the Victor Bay Formation, which together form the Uluksan Group and reside on top of silty shale. The ore is believed to have formed when hot saline water bearing the metal ions of sodium, calcium, chlorine, and sulfate mixed with cooler carbonate-rich brine in the presence of natural gas or methane, which produced hydrogen sulfide through reducing the sulfate. The hydrogen sulfide then reacted with the metals to form the sulfides of marcasite (FeS2), pyrite (FeS2), sphalerite ((Zn,Fe)S), and galena (PbS). The Nanisivik deposit once contained 60 million metric tons of pyrite and 12 million tons of lead-zinc ore.Gait, Robert I., George W. Robinson, Karen Bailey, and Doug Dumka.

Mineralogy The Nanisivik mine is known for its diversity of unusual pyrite pseudomorphs after marcasite and pyrrhotite. Nanisivik Pyrite is a pseudomorph unique to this location.  History  =Discovery= Arthur English was a prospector on the CGS Arctic, the steamship of Captain Joseph-Elz√©ar Bernier, as part of the Canadian Geological Survey in 1910. They wintered the 1910-11 winter in Arctic Bay ( south-east of Nanisivik). In 1911 Arthur English published his discovery of a \\"very large body of ore\\" at Nanisivik. =Development= J.F. Tibbitt and F. McInnes travelled from Churchill, Manitoba to Nanisivik by dog sled () and staked their claims in 1937, but were unable to develop them. In 1956 R. G. Blackadar and R. R. H. Lemon published maps of the region for another Geological Survey of Canada. Soon thereafter Texas Gulf Sulfur Company (later Texasgulf Inc., now broken up into bits such as Intrepid Potash) evaluated the region and staked 15 claims. Extensive drilling and exploration over the next decade led to the procurement of heavy equipment in 1970 and bulk metallurgical testing. Mineral Resources International of Calgary, Alberta traded the rights to a sulfur deposit in Mexico for a long term option on the Strathcona Sound property, which eventually translated into 54% ownership of Nanisivik Mines Limited. Strathcona Mineral Services Limited was hired to run the mine as an independent manager and successfully initiated production. =Operation= The mine opened in 1976 and yielded primarily zinc, however silver and lead were collected as by-products. It is located in thick permafrost, north of the Arctic Circle and operated year-round through accumulating ore during the winter and shipping in the summer (July-November). Annual production totalled 125,000 tons of ore, which was sold to European smelters via Belgium. Conwest Exploration Company Ltd. eventually acquired the mine. = Mine closure = One of three signposts in Nanisivik showing directions to various cities and towns Since the closure of the mine in 2002, reclamation has been ongoing and the town is abandoned. Residents of Arctic Bay had hoped that the Government of Nunavut would be able to find a new use for the former town site, potentially a trades training centre. They had also hoped to be able to move some of the buildings and equipment to their community. Due to heavy lead-zinc contamination, this was not possible and the homes have been demolished. Local telephone service was discontinued on February 19, 2007 on approval from CRTC. As of the 2006 census the population was 0, a drop from the 2001 census with a population of 77. = Conversion to naval station = On August 8, 2007, CBC News reported that Canadian Forces documents showed plans to convert the site into a naval station. The plan, which would turn the former mine's existing port into a deepwater facility, would cost $60 million and it was expected that Prime Minister Stephen Harper would make an announcement during his stop in Resolute.> On August 10, 2007, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced construction of a new docking and refuelling facility in Nanisivik for the Canadian Forces, in an effort to maintain a Canadian presence in Arctic waters during the navigable season (June‚ÄìOctober). The choice for Nanisivik as a site was partially based on its location within the eastern entrance to the Northwest Passage, and the existence of a deep-water berthing facility at the site, as well as a \\"jet- capable\\" airstrip nearby. Detailed planning for the project began in August 2007, with environmental studies and assessments being carried out in the summer of 2008. Construction at the site was originally expected to begin in the summer of 2010, with early operating capability available in 2012. The facility was planned to be fully operational by 2015. Once completed, the naval station will likely be home to the proposed Arctic Off-Shore Patrol Ships under the Harper government plan. These ships will have ice-breaking capability and help the current government's goal to enforce Canada's sovereignty over the region. These ships will likely allow the Victoria-class submarines to travel in the Arctic regions. The facility was to have an initial operational capability in 2012, and be fully complete in 2015 but is behind schedule. Development is being delayed because environmental cleanup has been delayed as much as possible by Breakwater Resources Ltd., owned by Nyrstar N.V. In 2011 and 2012, the government started backing down on the Nanisivik conversion plans, explaining that construction in the far north is too expensive. The station will be primarily used for refuelling Arctic patrol and other government vessels, and construction was expected to begin in 2013, with the station operational by 2016. After repeated delays, construction on the site finally commenced in 2015. The station had been expected to be operational in summer 2019.However, in July 2020 it was confirmed that the station would not now be fully operational until 2022. https://www.miragenews.com/canada-receives-first-new-arctic-and-offshore- patrol-ship/  Geography  = Climate =  Demographics  In the 2011 Census, Statistics Canada originally reported that Nanisivik had a population of 10 living in 4 of its 4 total dwellings, an increase from its 2006 population of 0. Statistics Canada subsequently amended the 2011 census results to a population of 0 living in 0 of its 4 total dwellings. It has a land area of .

The ard, ard plough, or scratch plough is a simple light plough without a mouldboard. It is symmetrical on either side of its line of draft and is fitted with a symmetrical share that traces a shallow furrow but does not invert the soil. It began to be replaced in China by the heavy carruca turnplough in the 1st century,Francesca Bray (1984), Biology and Biological Technology - Agriculture in Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization in China, vol. 6, part 2. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, pg. 138. and in most of Europe from the 7th century. In its simplest form it resembles a hoe, consisting of a draft-pole (either composite or a single piece) pierced with a nearly vertical, wooden, spiked head (or stock) which is dragged through the soil by draft animals and very rarely by people. The ard-head is at one end a stilt (handle) for steering and at the other a share (cutting blade) which gouges the surface ground. More sophisticated models have a composite pole, where the section attached to the head is called the draft-beam, and the share may be made of stone or iron. Some have a cross-bar for handles or two separate stilts for handles (two-handled ard). The share comes in two basic forms: a socket share slipped over the nose of the ard-head; and the tang share fitted into a groove where it is held with a clamp on the wooden head. Additionally, a slender protruding chisel (foreshare) can be fitted over the top of the mainshare. Use Rather than cutting and turning the soil to produce ridged furrows, the ard breaks up a narrow strip of soil and cuts a shallow furrow (or drill), leaving intervening strips undisturbed. The ard is not suited for clearing new land, so grass and undergrowth are usually removed with hoes or mattocks. Cross-ploughing is often necessary to break the soil up better, where the soil is tilled twice at right angles to the original direction (lengthwise and across). This usually results in square or diamond-shaped fields and is effective at clearing annual weeds. The ard's shallow furrows are ideal for most cereals, and if the seed is sown broadcast, the ard can be used to cover the seed in rows. In fact, the ard may have been invented in the Near East to cover seed rather than till. That would explain why in Mesopotamia seed drills were used together with ards. The ard is most useful on light soils such as loams or sands, or in mountain fields where the soil is thin, and can be safely used in areas where deep ploughing would turn up hardpan or would cause salination or erosion. Ards may be drawn by oxen, water buffalo, donkeys, camels, or other animals. Church of Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Nieva, Segovia province, Spain. Types Ards come in a number of varieties.See the discussion in K. D. White, Agricultural Implements of the Roman World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 126-128. Based on use, there are two kinds: the tilth ard, for cutting furrows in cleared land, and the rip ard, or sod buster, which has a hooked share that gouges deeper into the soil and more effectively clears virgin or fallow land. The two were in early times used in conjunction with each other. Third is the seed drill ard, used specifically in Mesopotamia, which added a funnel for dropping seed in the furrows as the ard cut them. Basic ard types: 1 - bow ard 2 - body ard 3 - sole ardAndr√©-G. Haudricourt & Jean Brunhes-Delamarre, L'homme et la charrue √† travers le monde, Paris: Gallimard, 1955. The earliest and most basic tilth ards are the two-piece models: * bow ard (or beam ard), made of a bow-shaped draft-pole (or beam) originally pierced by a spear-like head (stilt & share), later developing a composite body with a separate head and stilt inserted in the pole; * body ard, where the draft-pole is inserted into the thicker upward-inclined head which tapers into a handle. The bow ard is the weaker, narrower, and probably earlier of the two. It is used for shallow tillage, normally with a tang share, in dry, stony soils. It is restricted mainly to the Mediterranean (Spain, Tunisia, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon), Ethiopia, Iran, and eastern India and Sumatra. The more widespread body ard, sturdier and heavier for deeper tillage (in soils with enough moisture), usually has a socket share which is sometimes laterally extended or has serrated wings (Balkans, Morocco, Portugal, Spain) for better mixing of soil and cutting of weeds. It had a short portion of the body which was first made to slide on the furrow bottom and gradually developed into a horizontal body. The body ard dominates in Portugal, western Spain, the Balkans, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, and most of Latin America. The bow ard favored the development of a long horizontal sole body (slade) sliding on the ground. This led to the sole ard, first attested in Bronze Age Cyprus, being single-handled and consisting of a flat sole (or slade) into which were set the draft-pole and stilt, meaning there were three separate pieces. Their use in Ancient Greek agriculture was described by Hesiod.Signe Isager and Jens E. Skydsgaard, Ancient Greek Agriculture: An Introduction, Routledge, 1995 () p.46 In northern Europe the single-handled crook ard was favored, consisting of a stilt inserted into a pole with a crook-shaft, i.e., the pole had a curved shape and had a natural crook tip that served as a share.Paul Halstead, \\"Plough and Pastoralism: Aspects of the Secondary Products Revolution\\", Pattern of the Past: Studies in Honour of David Clarke (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1981), 267. Quadrangular ard Later variations of the sole ard come in two types: the triangular and quadrangular ards. The triangular ard has a horizontal sole body holding the beam and stilt which cross each other, forming a triangle at the base. The quadrangular ard has a horizontal sole body connected to a straight, nearly parallel beam by a stilt and a brace. History Egyptian ard, heb, with braces, c. 1300 BC. Single-handled ox- drawn ard; Bronze Age rock carving, Bohusl√§n, Sweden. Evidence of its use in prehistory is sometimes found at archaeological sites where the long, shallow scratches (ard marks) it makes can be seen cutting into the subsoil. The ard first appears in the mid-Neolithic and is closely related to the domestication of cattle. It probably spread with animal traction in general across the cereal-growing cultures of the Neolithic Old World. Its exact point of origin is unknown, but it spread quickly throughout West Asia, South Asia and Europe in the late Neolithic and early Chalcolithic. Evidence appears in the Near East in the 6th millennium . Iron versions appeared both in Assyria and 3rd- dynasty Egypt. In Europe, the earliest known wooden ard (at Lavagone in Italy) dates from around 2300-2000 , but the earliest scratch marks date from 3500-3000 .J.P. Mallory & D.Q. Adams, eds., Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, s.v. \\"Plough\\" (London: Fitzroy-Dearborn, 1997), 435. All of these were bow ards, also depicted in the rock drawings of Bohusl√§n, Sweden, and Fontanalba, France. The first bow ards were likely adapted from hoes and like instruments and therefore suffered from poor balance due to their narrow bodies with only one point in the soil. This restricted their use to obstacle- free soils such as along irrigated canals. The stress between body and pole was neutralized by adding a brace consisting of a fibre or leather strap between the low end of the pole and the body. The brace was later made out of wood and became important, not only on bow ards but also body ards. Today, a wooden brace between the draft-pole and upper stilt is a particular feature of body ards in Syria, central Iraq, Turkestan, and Gansu (China). The bow ard arrived in China as early as 3000 , possibly along with wheat, barley, and hemp during the Lungshanoid period. Today, the bow ard is confined to minority tribes and mountainous regions, but in earlier times was widely disseminated until ousted by the carruca turnplough beginning around 100.Needham, 165. The body ard made its way east as far as northwest China via Xinjiang, but then underwent radical changes. A long-pole body ard with a knee-like brace is still found in some parts of China. In some parts of Europe with moist soils, the body ard's path was cleared by a ristle, a coulter-like implement used to reach greater depth. In Spain and Portugal this remains a separate tool, but elsewhere it was the precursor to the coulter.

Biography  = Early years = Mark Krasnosel'skii was born in the town of Starokostiantyniv in Ukraine on the 27 April 1920 where his father worked as a construction engineer and his mother taught in an elementary school. In 1932 the Krasnosel'skii family moved to Berdyansk and in 1938 Mark entered the physico-mathematical faculty of Kiev University, which was evacuated at the beginning of World War II to Kazakhstan where it became known as the Joint Ukrainian University. He graduated in 1942, in the middle of the war, served four years in the Soviet Army, became Candidate in Science in 1948, with a dissertation on self-adjoint extensions of operators with nondense domains, before getting the title of Doctor in Science in 1950, with a thesis on investigations in Nonlinear Functional analysis. = Scientific career = From 1946 till 1952, Mark was a Research Fellow at the Mathematical Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Science in Kiev. From 1952 till 1967, he was Professor at Voronezh State University. He then moved to Moscow as a Senior Scientific Fellow (1967-74) and then a Head of a Laboratory (1974-90) at the Institute of Control Sciences of the USSR Academy of Science in Moscow. From 1990, he worked at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems of the same Academy. = Family = When Mark was 18 he married Sarra Belotserkovskaya (10.09.1921-31.01.2009), they had 3 children (Veniamin, 1939; Alexandra (Alla), 1945; Alexander (Sasha), 1955). Now there are 7 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren. = Distinctions = * Andronov Prize of the Soviet Academy of Science, * Humboldt Prize * Docteur {honoris causa} of the University of Rouen in France, 1996.  Scientific achievements  Mark Krasnosel'skii's has authored or co-authored some three hundred papers and fourteen monographs. Nonlinear techniques are roughly classified into analytical, topological and variational methods. Mark Krasnosel'skii has contributed to all three aspects in a significant way, as well as to their application to many types of integral, differential and functional equations coming from mechanics, engineering, and control theory. Mark Krasnosel'skii was the first to investigate the functional analytical properties of fractional powers of operators, at first for self-adjoint operators and then for more general situations. His theorem on the interpolation of complete continuity of such fractional power operators has been a basic tool in the theory of partial differential equations. Of comparable importance in applications is his extensive collection of works on the theory of positive operators, in particular results in which spectral gaps were estimated. His work on integral operators and superposition operators has also found many theoretical and practical applications. A major reason for this was his desire to always find readily verifiable conditions and estimates for whatever functional properties were under consideration. This is perhaps best seen in his work on topological methods in nonlinear analysis which he developed into a universal method for finding answers to such qualitative problems such as evaluating the number of solutions, describing the structure of a solution set and conditions for the connectedness of this set, convergence of Galerkin type approximations, the bifurcation of solutions in nonlinear systems, and so on. Krasnosel'skii also presented many new general principles on solvability of a large variety of nonlinear equations, including one-sided estimates, cone stretching and contractions, fixed-point theorems for monotone operators and a combination of the Schauder fixed point and contraction mapping theorems that was the genesis of condensing operators. He suggested a new general method for investigating degenerate extremals in variational problems and developed qualitative methods for studying critical and bifurcation parameter values based on restricted information of nonlinear equations. such as the properties of equations linearized at zero or at infinity, which have been very useful in determining the existence of bounded or periodic solutions. After he moved to Moscow he turned his attention increasingly to discontinuous processes and operators, in connection firstly with nonlinear control systems and then with a mathematically rigorous formulation of hysteresis which encompasses most classical models of hysteresis and is now standard. He also became actively involved with the analysis of desynchronized systems and the justification of the harmonic balance method commonly used by engineers.

Up until the 15th century Old Frisian was a language widely spoken and written in what are now the Netherlands and Germany, but from 1500 onwards it became an almost exclusively oral language, mainly used in rural areas. This was in part due to the occupation of its stronghold, the Dutch province of Friesland (Frysl√¢n), in 1498 - when Duke Albert III, Duke of Saxony, replaced Frisian as the language of government with Dutch. As late as 1599, the London dramatist Thomas Dekker could introduce whole scenes in the mixed Frisian-Dutch argot of the coast in The Shoemaker's Holiday, in confidence that his English-speaking audience could follow it.H. R. Loyn, Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest, 2nd ed. 1991:88. Afterwards this practice was continued under the Habsburg rulers of the Netherlands (the German Emperor Charles V and his son, the Spanish King Philip II), and even when the Netherlands became independent, in 1585, Frisian did not regain its former status. The reason for this was the rise of Holland as the dominant part of the Netherlands, and its language, Dutch, as the dominant language in judicial, administrative and religious affairs. In this period the great Frisian poet Gysbert Japix (1603‚Äì1666), a schoolmaster and cantor from the city of Boalsert, seen as the father of modern West Frisian literature and spelling, was an exception to the trend. His example was not followed until the 19th century, when new generations of West Frisian authors and poets appeared. This coincided with the introduction of the so-called newer breaking system, a prominent grammatical feature in almost all West Frisian dialects, with the notable exception of S√∫dwesthoeksk. Therefore, the Modern Frisian period is considered to have begun at this point in time, around 1820.

It also holds a 40% stake in the Spanish company Sidenor. Currently, Gerdau has an installed capacity of 26 million metric tons of steel per year and offers steel for the civil construction, automobile, industrial, agricultural and various sectors. Gerdau is also the world‚Äôs 30th largest steelmaker. It has 337 industrial and commercial units and more than 30,000 employees across 10 countries. History Residence and company Estate Society Jo√£o Gerdau, 1885 Gerdau was founded by Johannes Heinrich Kaspar Gerdau, also known as Jo√£o Gerdau, a German migrant who left the port of Hamburg for Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, in 1869 in search of new business opportunities. He arrived at the port of Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul and, at only 20 years of age, established himself in Col√¥nia de Santo √Çngelo (now the town of Agudo), where he invested in trade, transport and the subdivision of land. He moved to the town of Cachoeira do Sul in 1884, where he founded an important General Store. Always seeking new opportunities, Jo√£o Gerdau moved again, this time to Porto Alegre, with his wife Alvine Gerdau and his three children, Hugo, Walter and Bertha. There he went into industry, buying the Pontas de Paris Nail Factory in 1901 marking the entry into steel industry. Curt Johannpeter's entry into the Gerdau family marked the beginning of a new direction for the company. Born in Germany in 1899, Curt Johannpeter made his career in finance. In 1922 he began to work for the German Transatlantic Bank, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. In 1930 he became the branch inspector for Portugal, Spain and Latin America, and in the same year was introduced to the young Helda Gerdau during a trip to Brazil. They married and had four sons: Germano, Klaus, Jorge and Frederico. In 1946, Johannpeter took the wheel of the Gerdau company and oversaw a critical phase in its expansion. See history of Gerdau Today Gerdau's core business is to transform steel scrap and iron ore into steel products. Gerdau is a leading producer of long steel in the Americas and one of the largest suppliers of special steel in the world. It is the largest recycler in Latin America and around the world it transforms, each year, millions of metric tons of scrap into steel, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development in the regions where it operates. With more than 140,000 shareholders, the Company is listed on the stock exchanges of S√£o Paulo, New York and Madrid. Its operations are based on the integrated regional market mill concept by which raw materials are bought from nearby suppliers and products are primarily sold in the same region. This brand of by-product synergy led to the acquisition of Chaparral Steel in 2007, a company which has been noted for creating interchange between head management and workers and deliberately employs a maximum of 1000 people (the size of a village). Gerdau operates through three different processes: *Mini mills *Integrated mills *Direct reduced iron plant Products and services Gerdau produces long carbon steel, long special steel, flat steel and forged and cast parts. These products are used in different sectors, such as industry, metallurgy, farming and livestock, civil construction, automotive industries, petrochemicals, railway and naval sectors, in addition to orthodontic, medical and food areas. Gerdau is also the main supplier of specialty steel for the international automotive network. Internationalization of the Gerdau Group Long before its possibilities of expansion on the Brazilian market were exhausted, Gerdau had established strategies for external expansion, starting at the end of the 1970s. Their fundamental objectives were to conquer the U.S. market. Based on limited international experience managing a mini mill plant in Uruguay for almost a decade, the group first aimed at the North American market for long steel, starting with Canada. Later, after a decade of experience in conditions that were radically different than those existing in Uruguay (the location of its first foreign venture), Gerdau entered the U.S. market. Entry into North America was complemented by other ventures in all of Latin America, from Chile and Argentina to Mexico and the Caribbean. The North American experience, like the Brazilian, demonstrated the strategic necessity to enter new markets such as Europe (with special steels) and Asia (with long steel and final structures of special steel) Business operations Gerdau is spread globally across 13 countries with its integrated and semi-integrated steel mills. Apart from steel mills, Gerdau also has downstream processing facilities. Offices: Gerdau has its major offices at Porto Alegre, S√£o Paulo, Tampa, Whitby, Polanco, Lima, Caracas, Bogota, Jackson and Bangalore. Brazil Business Division: Gerdau has two Brazil business divisions divided as Mining Americas and Steel Brazil Special Steel Business Division: Gerdau produces specialty steel especially for the automotive industry through its special steel divisions, Special Steel North America, Special Steel Brazil, and Special Steel India.

Established in 1918 as Hazelhurst Aviation Field #2, the facility was renamed later that year as Mitchel Field in honor of former New York City Mayor John Purroy Mitchel, who was killed while training for the Air Service in Louisiana. Decommissioned in 1961, Mitchel Field became a multi-use complex that is home to the Cradle of Aviation Museum, Nassau Coliseum, Mitchel Athletic Complex, Nassau Community College, Hofstra University, and Lockheed. In 2018 the surviving buildings and facilities were recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History =Origins= During the American Revolutionary War it was known as the Hempstead Plains and used as an Army enlistment center. In the War of 1812 and in the Mexican War, it was a training center for Infantry units. During the American Civil War, it was the location of Camp Winfield Scott. In 1898, in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Mitchel's site was known as Camp Black.Office of Information Services Headquarters Continental Air Command, Mitchel Air Force Base, New York, 26 October 1955 Fact Sheet =World War I= In 1917, Hazelhurst Field #2 was established south of and adjacent to Hazelhurst Field to serve as an additional training and storage base, part of the massive Air Service Aviation Concentration Center. Curtiss JN-4 Jennies became a common sight over Long Island in 1917 and 1918. Hundreds of aviators were trained for war at these training fields, two of the largest in the United States. Numerous new wooden buildings and tents were erected on Roosevelt Field and Field #2 in 1918 in order to meet this rapid expansion.The History of Mitchel Field, The Cradle of Aviation Museum =Between the Wars= Mitchel Field continued to grow after World War I and between 1929 and 1932. An extensive building program was undertaken after the war to turn the temporary wartime facilities into a permanent Army post, with new barracks, warehouses, hangar space, and administrative buildings. Much of this construction still exists today, being used for non-military purposes. In the 1920s and 1930s, various observation, fighter, and bomber units were stationed at the airfield. It became a major aerodrome for both the Air Corps as well as various civilian activity. The 1920s was considered the golden age of air racing and on 27 November 1920, the Pulitzer Trophy Race was held at Mitchel Field. The race consisted of four laps of a course. 38 pilots entered and took off individually. The winner was Capt. Corliss Moseley, flying a Verville-Packard VCP-R racer, a cleaned-up version of the Army's VCP-1 pursuit plane, at .Pulitzer Trophy Air Races In October 1923, Mitchel Field was the scene of the first airplane jumping contest in the nation. During the same year, two world's airplane speed records were established there. In 1924, the airmail service had its inception in experimental flights begun at the airfield. In September 1929, Lt.

Doolittle, then a Lieutenant, made the world's first blind flight.USAFHRA Document 00489043 In 1938, Mitchel was the starting point for the first nonstop transcontinental bomber flight, made by Army B-18 Bolo bombers.Brodsky, Robert (July 30, 2018). \\"Mitchel Field Air Base added to National Register of Historic Places\\" (subscription required). Newsday. newsday.com. Retrieved 2018-07-30. Mitchel Field also served as a base from which the first demonstration of long-range aerial reconnaissance was made. In May 1939, three B-17s, with Lt. Curtis LeMay navigating, flew out to sea and intercepted the Italian ocean liner SS Rex. This was a striking example of the range, mobility, and accuracy of modern aviation at the time.Mitchel Field History DocumentJohn T. Correll, Rendezvous With the Rex, Air Force Magazine, December 2008 Vol 91 No. 12 On September 21 of that year the base was struck by the \\"Long Island Express\\" hurricane. Flooding produced water that was over knee-deep, numerous trees were toppled and the glass was smashed atop the traffic control tower.Streets become Canals in Hurricane: Tide Razes Boardwalk, Piers Brooklyn Daily Eagle September 22, 1938 =World War II= In 1940 Mitchel Field was the location of the Air Defense Command, a command charged with the mission of developing the air defense for cities, vital industrial areas, continental bases, and military facilities in the United States (also known as the \\"Zone of the Interior\\"). Later, First Air Force, was given the responsibility for air defense planning and organization along the eastern seaboard. Under its supervision an aircraft patrol system along the coast for observing shipping was placed into operation. During 1943, Mitchel AAF became a staging area for Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers and their crews before being sent overseas.USAFHRA Document 00175652 Mitchel Field was a major source of supply in initial garrisoning and defense of North Atlantic air bases in Newfoundland, Greenland, and Iceland. From the airfield the planning for the air defense of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was conducted. Antisubmarine patrol missions along the Atlantic coast were carried out in 1942 by the United States Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command aircraft based at Mitchel. Under the direction of the First Air Force, Mitchel Army Airfield became a command and control base for both I Fighter and I Bomber Command. Tactical fighter groups and squadrons were formed at Mitchel to be trained at AAF Training Command bases (mostly in the east and southeast) before being deployed to the various overseas wartime theaters. Additionally, thousands of Army Air Force personnel were processed through the base for overseas combat duty. With the end of World War II, returning GIs were processed for separation at Mitchel. Mitchel aircraft crashes included a P-47 that struck Hofstra University's Barnard Hall on 23 March 1943.Associated Press, \\"College Building Set Afire by Crash of Army Airplane\\", The Roanoke World-News, Roanoke, Virginia, Tuesday afternoon, 23 March 1943, Volume 81, Number 70, page 3. In March 1946, the headquarters of Air Defense Command was established at Mitchel Army Airfield. 514th Troop Carrier Wing was the main operational flying organization at Mitchel AFB (Curtiss C-46 Commando were replaced in 1954 with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars.) 2d Fighter Squadron (All Weather) Northrop P-61Bs on parking apron at Mitchel AFB in October 1948 =United States Air Force= With the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate service in 1947, Mitchel AAF was redesignated as Mitchel Air Force Base. In December 1948, ADC's responsibilities were temporarily assumed by the Continental Air Command, (ConAC), also located at Mitchel AFB. ConAC also was responsible for the reorganization of the Air Force Reserve after World War II. In 1949, the reserve mission was assigned to First Air Force, which was also headquartered at Mitchel AFB. First Air Force became the command and control organization for supervising the training of the air reserve in 15 eastern states and the District of Columbia. By 1949, due to the problems associated with operating tactical aircraft in the urban area - the noise, the small size of the field, and safety concerns - Mitchel AFB was relieved of the responsibility for defending New York's air space. Army Anti- Aircraft Command moved to Mitchel AFB on 1 November 1950. After Air Defense Command was re-established on January 1, 1951; the 1945 U.S. Air Defense Plan recommendation for \\"... moving ADC Headquarters from Mitchel Field to a more central location ... in a protected command center\\" was completed to Ent Air Force Base, Colorado, on 8 January 1951.compiled by On November 29, 1952, President-elect Dwight D.

New York: Doubleday, p. 77. Colonel W. Millikan's transcontinental speed record flight of 4 hours, 8 minutes set in a North American F-86 Sabre on 2 January 1954 ended at Mitchel AFB. In April 1961 flying was halted and the unit reassigned to McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. With the reassignment of the 514th, Mitchel AFB was subsequently closed on 25 June 1961. The property was turned over to Nassau County for redevelopment.USAFHRA Document 00489094USAFHRA Organizational Records Branch, 514th Air Mobility Wing The facility still has military housing, a commissary, and exchange facilities to support military families and activities in the area.

G. Schmidt's gravestone Anna Maria Geertruida \\"Annie\\" Schmidt (20 May 1911 ‚Äì 21 May 1995) was a Dutch writer. She is called the mother of the Dutch theatrical song, and the queen of Dutch children's literature, praised for her \\"delicious Dutch idiom,\\" and considered one of the greatest Dutch writers. An ultimate honour was extended to her posthumously, in 2007, when a group of Dutch historians compiled the \\"Canon of Dutch History\\" and included Schmidt, alongside national icons such as Vincent van Gogh and Anne Frank. Although Schmidt wrote poetry, songs, books, plays, musicals, and radio and television drama for adults, she is known best for children's books. Her best-known work for children may be the series Jip and Janneke. Many of her books, such as Pluk van de Petteflet, were illustrated by Fiep Westendorp. Schmidt received the 1988 Hans Christian Andersen Medal for her lasting contribution as a children's writer. The biennial award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. By the time she died in 1995 (of heart failure caused by euthanasia), she was an icon of the Dutch literary world, and even her death‚Äîpeaceful, in the company of her friends and family‚Äîcontinues to be referenced in the Dutch media and played an important role in discussions of euthanasia.  Early life  Anna Maria Geertruida \\"Annie\\" Schmidt was born on 20 May 1911 in Kapelle, Zeeland in the Netherlands. She was the daughter of Dutch Reformed minister Johannes Daniel Schmidt (1871‚Äì1951) and school teacher Geertruida Maria Bouhuijs. She had an elder brother Wim and two older sisters also named Anna M. G. who both died young and before she was born. She was called Zus () by her family.

She was a solitary child wearing heavy glasses, who found an escape in writing poetry and fiction, even though she once received a grade of 2 (on a scale of 1 to 10) in Dutch class‚Äîshe would later brag about the report card. Her mother encouraged her and sent some of her poetry to Willem Kloos. After secondary school in Goes and working as an au pair in Germany, she began to study for a job as a librarian, an occupation she held until 1946. Career In 1947, she embarked upon her literary career while writing for the Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool, and shortly after started writing songs and sketches for such luminaries as Wim Sonneveld and Wim Kan. Her literary career took off in the early 1950s, and included song- and playwriting for the theatre, scripts for radio and television shows, columns for newspapers, and children's books. In 1964 she won the literary award Staatsprijs voor kinder- en jeugdliteratuur. Her final book, Wat Ik Nog Weet, a book of childhood memories, appeared in 1992. She used euthanasia a day after her 84th birthday (with a combination of pills and alcohol) and was buried in Amsterdam. By the time she died in 1995 (of heart failure caused by euthanasia), she was an icon of the Dutch literary world, and even her death‚Äîpeaceful, in the company of her friends and family‚Äîcontinues to be referenced in the Dutch media and played an important role in discussions of euthanasia.\\"In de media wordt vooral aandacht besteed aan opmerkelijke en ingewikkelde sterfgevallen, maar sterven verloopt meestal heel mooi, als je dat zo kunt zeggen.

The stories were illustrated by Fiep Westendorp. The first was published 13 September 1952, the last 7 September 1957; a total of eight book collections were published between 1953 and 1960.

In 2001, a movie version was directed by Vincent Bal based on a script by Burny Bos; it became one of the most popular Dutch children's movies abroad. Winning two Golden Calves, Minoes was the best-selling Dutch children's movie to date, and the DVD was certified platinum in 2002. More than 815,000 people saw it in the theatre, making it the highest-selling Dutch movie of the year, beating Costa! and The Discovery of Heaven. The movie won first prize at the 2002 Chicago International Children's Film Festival. The book Minoes has been translated into English as Minnie (1992) and as The Cat Who Came In off the Roof (2014). Radio and television Decor for Ja Zuster Nee Zuster In 1952 Schmidt began writing a radio show, the immensely popular De Familie Doorsnee, which ran until 1958. In 1957 she began writing Pension Hommeles, a musical comedy on VARA television. =Ja Zuster, Nee Zuster or Yes matron!

Howell's musical career began in the late 1960s working with John Ferdinando in various psychedelic folk bands including Agincourt and Ithaca. His psychedelic folk work also included a musical version of Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking- Glass and a comedy musical entitled Tomorrow Come Someday. Howell and Ferdinando recorded five albums before Howell became a member of the Radiophonic Workshop. In 1970 he became a studio manager at the BBC and in 1974 he joined the Radiophonic Workshop with which he would remain associated until 1997. Doctor Who His work on Doctor Who began in 1975 when he provided some accompanying incidental music for Revenge of the Cybermen and special sound for Planet of Evil. When John Nathan-Turner became producer of Doctor Who in 1980, he decided that the music needed to be updated and commissioned Howell to provide a new arrangement of the Doctor Who theme to accompany a new title sequence. Whereas the original arrangement of the theme (written by Ron Grainer) had been realised by Delia Derbyshire (and, originally, assisted by Dick Mills) using musique concr√®te techniques, Howell arranged Grainer's theme on analogue synthesisers - primarily using a Yamaha CS-80, an ARP Odyssey Mk3 and a Roland Jupiter-4. Howell's new arrangement first appeared in 1980 on The Leisure Hive, for which Howell had also recorded the incidental score, and was used throughout Tom Baker's final season on the programme as well as Peter Davison's tenure as the Doctor. For Colin Baker's first season in 1984, however, there was a problem in transferring the music so the theme was slightly lower in pitch. This version continued to be used until Colin Baker's 1985 story, Revelation of the Daleks. Between 1980 and 1985 Howell also provided incidental music for ten stories of Doctor Who, as well as the incidental score for K9 and Company (for which he also provided an arrangement of the theme tune). In 1986, Nathan-Turner commissioned a new theme arrangement by Dominic Glynn, ending Howell's association with Doctor Who on television. He had not finished with Doctor Who yet, however. He provided the music for the radio series The Paradise of Death and The Ghosts of N-Space in the late 1990s, and his arrangement of the Doctor Who theme has continued to be used in the Big Finish audio dramas. In 2013 he joined fellow BBC Radiophonic Workshop member Dick Mills, Workshop archivist Mark Ayres and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales at the Doctor Who Prom, where he assisted with the performance of several pieces of music from the original Doctor Who series. Howell‚Äôs arrangement of the show‚Äôs theme was used on a majority of the DVD releases of the show‚Äôs episodes (from 1963 to 1989) on the DVD menu introduction screen. Other work Aside from Doctor Who, Howell's Radiophonic Workshop work includes an album of original recordings in 1978 entitled Through A Glass Darkly (credited to Peter Howell & The Radiophonic Workshop) and \\"Greenwich Chorus\\", a piece which accompanied an episode of Jonathan Miller's popular The Body in Question which was controversial at the time for its use of the vocoder. Howell composed the theme tunes to The Machine that Changed the World (1992)/The Dream Machine (UK), a 5-part television series on the history of the electronic digital computer, to Robert Hughes' 1979-80 8-part series on Modern art (The Shock of the New), and to the Badger Girl and Spywatch series of the long-running BBC schools' programme, Look and Read.

Behind him, the Duke of Saxony with his marshall's staff and the Margrave of Brandenburg bringing a bowl of warm water, as a valet. Below, the new king in front of the great men of the empire (Heidelberg Sachsenspiegel, around 1300) The Sachsenspiegel (, literally ‚ÄúSaxon Mirror‚Äù; Middle Low German: '; ) is the most important law book and custumal of the Holy Roman Empire. Originating between 1220 and 1235 as a record of existing customary law, it was used in places until as late as 1900. It is important not only for its lasting effect on later German law but also as an early example of written prose in a German language. The Sachsenspiegel is the first comprehensive law book not in Latin, but in Middle Low German language. A Latin edition is known to have existed, but only fragmented chapters remain. History The Sachsenspiegel was one of the first prose works written in the Middle Low German language. The original title is Sassen Speyghel, Sachsenspiegel being a later Standard German translation. It is believed to have been compiled and translated from Latin by the Saxon administrator Eike of Repgow at the behest of his liege lord Count Hoyer of Falkenstein in the years 1220 to 1235.Some sources give the period during which the Sachsenspiegel was written as 1220 to 1230, but 1220 to 1235 is given by others, such as sources at the Library of Congress (), the European Court of Human Rights () and Tufts University () Where the original was compiled is unclear. It was thought to have been written at Burg Falkenstein, but Peter Landau, an expert in medieval canon law, recently suggested that it may have been written at the monastery of Altzelle (now Altzella).The suggestion that the Sachsenspiegel was written at Altzelle was made in a paper given by Professor Landau at the Deutscher Rechtshistorikertag 2004 and later published in an article (Landau, Peter: Die Entstehungsgeschichte des Sachsenspiegels: Eike von Repgow, Altzelle und die anglo-normannische Kanonistik; Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Deutsches Archiv f√ºr Erforschung des Mittelalters 2005, Vol 61, No. 1, pp 73‚Äì101), cited at the German Wikipedia article on Kloster Altzella and http://www.rechtsbuchforschung.de . During the 14th century, Johannes Klenkok opposed the Sachsenspiegel with a writing known as the Decadicon because he considered several articles of the law book to contradict the Corpus Juris Canonici., pp 51 ff. Following a written debate, Klenkok turned to his former disciple, French canonist, and cardinal of the Curia in Avignon, Pierre de la Vergne.Ocker, pp 52‚Äì63. In the end, Pope Gregory XI condemned 14 articles with his papal bull Salvator Humani Generis that was issued in 1374, but this did not reduce the success of the Sachsenspiegel.Ocker, pp 66‚Äì69 and Lars Rentmeister, Staat und Kirche im sp√§ten Mittelalter ‚Äì Der Schriftwechsel zwischen Johannes Klenkok und Herbord von Spangenberg √ºber den Sachsenspiegel, tredition (2016), . The Sachsenspiegel served as a model for law books in German (Middle High German) like the Augsburger Sachsenspiegel, the Deutschenspiegel, and the Schwabenspiegel. Its influence extended into Eastern Europe, the Netherlands, and the Baltic States. In Prussia, the Sachsenspiegel was used until the introduction of the Allgemeines Landrecht f√ºr die preu√üischen Staaten in 1794. In Saxony, it was used until the introduction of the Saxon Civil Code in 1865. In Anhalt and Thuringia, the Sachsenspiegel was not replaced until the introduction of the German Civil Code in 1900. Its precedents continued to be cited as pertinent case law as recently as 1932 by the Reichsgericht (Supreme Court of the Reich) (RGZ 137, 373). The influence of the Sachsenspiegel, or at least parallels with it, can still be found in modern German law, for instance in inheritance law and the law of neighborly relations (Nachbarrecht; e.g., nuisance, party walls, etc.). The Sachsenspiegel contains two branches of law: common law and feudal law. Saxon custom Saxon customary law, or Landrecht, was the law of free people including the peasant sokemanry. It contains important rules and regulations concerning property rights, inheritance, marriage, the delivery of goods, and certain torts (e.g. trespass, nuisance). It also treats criminal law and the composition of courts. In other words, it deals with criminal and civil law. Feudal law Feudal law, or Lehnrecht, determined the relationship between different states and rulers, for example the election of emperors and kings, feudal rights, etc. Though it has no modern equivalent, it encompasses what one would call today public law. The Sachsenspiegel acquired special significance through its exposition of the seven Heerschilde or \\"shields of knighthood\\": #King #Ecclesiastical princes #Lay princes #Free lords (freie Herren) #Sch√∂ffenbarfreie, vassals (Lehnsm√§nner) of free lords, ministeriales #Vassals of Sch√∂ffenbarfreie etc. #Unnamed. Manorial tenants and burgesses (inhabitants of a borough) were not mentioned. Extant copies Eike of Repgow, from the Oldenburg Sachsenspiegel Four (of the original seven) illuminated manuscripts copies are still extant. They are named after their present locations: Heidelberg, Oldenburg, Dresden, and Wolfenb√ºttel, and date from 1295 to 1371. In total, over 400 versions of the manuscript exist today. The Dresden manuscript has been described as the \\"most artistically valuable\\" by the World Digital Library. It is located in the collection of the Saxon State Library and was created between 1295 and 1363 around Meissen, Germany. This version has 924 illustrations on 92 pages. The illustrations depict about 4,000 people. It suffered water damage after the Bombing of Dresden in World War II and underwent restoration in the 1990s. An early printed edition of the Sachsenspeigel was produced by Anna R√ºgerin in Augsburg, dated 22 June 1484. It is the first documented evidence of a woman working as a typographer. Proverbs Some German proverbs date from the Sachsenspiegel: *\\"Wer zuerst kommt, mahlt zuerst\\" (First come, first served, literally: \\"Who comes first, grinds first\\"), which is a rule for the order for grinding of corn by a miller. *\\"Wo der Esel sich w√§lzt, da muss er Haare lassen\\", lit: \\"Where the donkey rolls, there it sheds hair.\\" This is a rule for the jurisdiction of courts.

The pigs (later named Butch and Sundance after Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) were on the run for more than a week, and the search for them caused a huge media sensation, as well as immense public interest, both in Britain and abroad. Events Butch (a sow) and Sundance (a boar) were sister and brother Tamworth pigs. Both were five months old when their owner took them by lorry to V & G Newman's Abattoir in Malmesbury on 8 January 1998. Just after they were unloaded from the truck, the two pigs escaped by squeezing through a fence and swimming across the River Avon, escaping into nearby gardens. The two pigs spent most of their week of freedom in a dense thicket near Tetbury Hill. As the story of their escape broke, media interest in the escaped pigs soared across the country, the press dubbing the pair \\"Butch and Sundance\\" after the American outlaws. The American NBC network and several Japanese media outlets were among the international media to show a great interest in the story and to send reporters to cover the tale. The BBC reported on 16 January 1998: \\"Among nearly 100 journalists on the trail of the bolshy porker was NBC reporter Donatella Lorch, filming for Friday night's American news [who said]: ‚ÄòThese pigs have become celebrities [‚Ä¶] The British reaction to the whole thing is what has caught our attention and after all, we are the makers of Babe‚Äô\\". The pigs were estimated to be worth ¬£40‚Äì50 each, and their owner, Arnoldo Dijulio, a council road sweeper, stated that he still intended to send the pair to slaughter should they be recaptured. After making this statement, Dijulio was offered large sums of money by media outlets and animal lovers to save the pigs from the dinner table. Eventually, the Daily Mail newspaper bought the pigs from Dijulio in return for exclusive rights to their story. Butch was eventually captured on the evening of 15 January, when she and Sundance were spotted foraging in the garden of a local couple, Harold and Mary Clarke. Sundance escaped into the thicket once again, but he was flushed out the next day by two springer spaniels and tranquilised with a dart gun. RSPCA Inspector Mike Harley said, \\"He had a very thick skin and two darts bounced off him\\". Sundance was taken to a veterinary surgery where the vet who examined him, Fran Baird, said: \\"He is a little bit shaky but doesn't appear to be any the worse for it. I am quite confident he will make a full recovery.\\" He also said that Sundance would be spending the weekend at the surgery but that precautions had been taken to ensure he did not escape once more: \\"There are padlocks on the doors, which are more than six feet high and chained together. He's obviously quite bright. He's foxed a number of people for a number of days. I don't want to spend another day chasing around Malmesbury\\". Afterwards, it was discovered that Sundance was a crossbreed and that one of his parents had been a wild boar, possibly explaining his rebellious temperament. The Tamworth Two even attracted observations in Parliament: ex-opposition Environment spokesman George Howarth compared the pair‚Äôs flight with that of the Conservative Party.Hansard (16 January 1998). House of Commons debate: Referendum (English Parliament) Bill, col. 655. accessdate=2 March 2015 In June 2004, a campaign was launched to create a statue in Malmesbury to commemorate the Tamworth Two, together with a sculpture trail along the River Avon. The two pigs lived ‚Äì courtesy of the Daily Mail ‚Äì at the Rare Breeds Centre, an animal sanctuary near Ashford in Kent. In 2009, readers of Press Gazette voted the Daily Mail‚Äôs coverage of the Tamworth Two 25th in a list of \\"the best British journalism scoops of all time\\". In March 2004, The Guardian reported a former Daily Mail executive as saying: \\"It may seem like a fun animal story, but at the time it was deadly serious. It was the most important story of the week ‚Äì by far\\". The same report added: \\"It had become impossible to avoid the story. A contributor to Radio 4's Thought for the Day mused over them; the editor of The Independent, Andrew Marr, wrote about them in his letter to the readers. They even featured in an editorial in The Guardian\\". The story of the Tamworth Two has been retold in media coverage of other animal escapes, including in December 2001 when a turkey escaped from a farm and walked three miles to a bird sanctuary and April 2009, when 180 pigs escaped from the lorry taking them to the Malton Bacon Factory in York after it was involved in an accident. Deaths Butch died aged 13 on 8 October 2010, euthanised after becoming seriously ill. Davy McColm, manager of the centre's farm, put Butch‚Äôs demise down to old age. He added: > \\"Sundance seems to be quite happy with life at the moment. He's got a bit > more space in the bed at night. He will be missing her. They were litter > brother and sister, they've been together all their lives. He's an old > fellow, he's a little bit arthritic and a bit slower than he used to be ‚Äì > thank goodness ‚Äì but he's still pottering along\\". At the time of Butch‚Äôs death, the centre was still receiving enquiries about the Tamworth Two. Seven months later, Sundance, aged 14, suffering from arthritis, and \\"much quieter\\" after his sister's death, was euthanised on 23 May 2011. Commenting on Sundance‚Äôs death, Nikki Sara from the Rare Breeds Centre said: \\"He was getting old and was having trouble getting in and out of his bed. He was on the maximum dosage of pain killers and the farm manager decided that it wasn't fair on him\\". Talking about the Tamworth Two, she said: \\"They've been a great attraction here for the last 13 years, a real draw. We still get people coming in asking where they are\\". Staff at the Rare Breeds Centre in Woodchurch near Ashford, Kent, are considering putting up a plaque in memory of Butch and Sundance. Television movie Filming of The Legend of the Tamworth Two In 2003, the BBC produced and broadcast a 60-minute drama The Legend of the Tamworth Two where contrary to the truth, \\"Butch\\" was male, \\"Sundance\\", female. Executive producer Sally Woodward told the BBC: > \\"The film tells how the story of Butch and Sundance became a legend, of how > Britain once again took the underdog to their hearts ‚Äì or in this instance, > the under-pig ‚Äì and in the process briefly made them the most famous > fugitives in the world. It also shows how contrary human beings are in their > relationship with animals ‚Äì how we are only too happy to tuck in to a pork > chop, but are outraged when we want to capture a pig that has stolen our > heart\\".

Today the term GI typically refers to essentially pure zinc (>99%) continuously hot dip coated steel, as opposed to batch dip processes. PPGI refers to factory pre-painted zinc coated steel, where the steel is painted before forming, as opposed to post painting which occurs after forming. The hot dip metallic coating process is also used to manufacture steel sheet and coil with coatings of aluminium, or alloy coatings of zinc/aluminium, zinc/iron and zinc/aluminium/magnesium which may also be factory pre-painted. While GI may sometimes be used as a collective term for various hot dip metallic coated steels, it more precisely refers only to zinc coated steel. Similarly, PPGI may sometimes be used as a general term for a range of metallic coated steels that have been pre-painted, but more often refers more precisely to pre-painted zinc coated steel. Zinc coated steel substrate for PPGI is typically produced on a continuous galvanizing line (CGL). The CGL may include a painting section after the hot dip galvanising section, or more commonly the metallic coated substrate in coil form is processed on a separate continuous paint line (CPL). Metallic coated steel is cleaned, pre-treated, applied with various layers of organic coatings which can be paints, vinyl dispersions, or laminates. The continuous process used to apply these coatings is often referred to as Coil Coating. The steel thus produced in this process is a prepainted, prefinished and ready for further processing into finished products or components. to use material.

It is used as a treatment, like electroconvulsive therapy and TENS. In the technical working of medical electrolysis the most minute precautions are required. The solution of the drug must be made with as pure water as possible, recently distilled. The spongy substance forming the electrode must be free from any trace of electrolytic substances. Hence all materials used must be washed in distilled water. Absorbent cotton answers all requirements and is easily procured. The area of introduction can be exactly circumscribed by cutting a hole in a sheet of adhesive plaster which is applied to the skin and on which the electrolytic electrodes are pressed. The great advantage of electrolytic methods is that it enables general treatment to be replaced by a strictly local treatment, and the cells can be saturated exactly to the degree and depth required. Strong antiseptics and materials that coagulate albumen cannot be introduced locally by ordinary methods, as the skin is impermeable to them, but by electrolysis they can be introduced to the exact depth required. The local effects of the ions depend on the dosage; thus a feeble dose of the ions of zinc stimulates the growth of hair, but a stronger dose produces the death of the tissue. Naturally the different ions produce different effects. Electrolysis can also be used for extracting from the body such ions as are injurious, as uric and oxalic acid from a patient suffering from gout.

He had worked at the University of Cambridge, the British Museum, and the Institute of Archaeology of University of London, before ending his career as Professor of Human Palaeoecology at the University of York. He has been described as \\"one of the pioneers in the field of archaeological science\\". Early life and education Brothwell was born in 1933 in Nottingham, England. He began his involvement in archaeology as a teenager; this included analysing finds from a local gravel works, and excavating Anglo-Saxon skeletons at a local quarry with some school friends. He was involved in his first official archaeological excavation in Thurgarton, Nottinghamshire, where they excavated and recorded a number of medieval burials. Having finished secondary school, he enrolled in art college with the aim of becoming a teacher. However, after a year he returned to school to study for A-Levels in geology, biology, and chemistry. Having earned three A-Levels, Brothwell was offered a place at University College London to study anthropology. However, as he had completed his A-Levels a year later than most, at 19, he was immediately called up to serve his National Service. With his interests in Quakerism and knowledge of his father's experience of World War I, he became a conscientious objector. He was prosecuted and ordered to pay a large fine (for which his father provided the money), but was called up for a second time after settling with the court. This time his refusal resulted in a prison sentence which he served at HM Prison Lincoln. He continued his interest in archaeology while imprisoned, including excavating a bulldog skull that he found in the yard during his daily exercise. Brothwell only served two months of a one-year sentence and was released in time to take up his place at University College London. From 1952 to 1956, while based in the Department of Anthropology, he studied a wide range of courses; these were mainly anthropology or archaeology related, but he also studied geology, zoology, and genetics. He graduated in 1956 with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree. He then began a doctorate in physical anthropology, but he left without completing it after two years of research to take up his first academic position. Academic career In 1958, Brothwell joined the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Cambridge as a demonstrator. He duties involved teaching biological anthropology, and his research was focused on physical anthropology, palaeopathology, human origins, and teeth. His research during this time led to him editing a volume with his colleague Eric Higgs, Science and Archaeology (1963), and a text book for archaeologists, Digging up Bones (1963). The demonstratorship was a time- limited appointment and after three to five years he would have to look for a new job. In 1961, Brothwell moved to the British Museum as Principal Scientific Officer and Head of Anthropology. This was a new sub-department of the museum but it grew quickly with donations of human skeletons from the Royal College of Surgeons and the Department of Anatomy, University of Oxford. During his twelve years at the British Museum, he held the \\"only funded professional position studying archaeological human skeletal remains in the United Kingdom\\". In 1974, Brothwell moved to the Institute of Archaeology, University of London, having been appointed a senior lecturer in zooarchaeology. His research during this period extended from human remains to animal skeletons; this was very varied and included animal diseases, guinea pig domestication, and domestic pests. He was also interested in bog bodies, and led a diverse team to investigate the Lindow Man in the 1980s. Perhaps because of his diverse research interests, he was never made a professor but he was promoted to reader. Brothwell left the Institute of Archaeology in 1993 having originally intended to take early retirement. However, that year he was offered and accepted the appointment of Professor of Human Palaeoecology in the Department of Archaeology at the University of York. He retired in 1999 and was appointed Emeritus Professor. In 1974, Brothwell founded the Journal of Archaeological Science; from 1974 to 1993, he served as its Joint-Editor. From 1984 to 2004, he served as Editor of the Cambridge Manuals in Archaeology. Later life After he retired, Brothwell continued with research projects including an investigation of mummies in Yemen. As Emeritus Professor at University of York he continued to teach and supervise postgraduates. From 2006 until his death, he was also an Honorary Research Fellow at Durham University, where he taught on its master's degree in palaeopathology. Brothwell died on 26 September 2016, aged 83. On 7 October, his burial took place and a celebration of his life was held at the King's Manor in York (the main building of the University of York's Department of Archaeology). Honours In 1999, the year of Brothwell's retirement, a conference was held in his honour at the University of York. A number of papers from that conference were published as a Festschrift in 2002. It was titled Bones and the Man: Studies in Honour of Don Brothwell, and contributors included Graeme Barker and Chris Stringer. Selected works *With A. T. Sandison (eds.) 1967.

History Ancient Egyptian art depicting a worker filling a grain silo Ancient Roman grainThe grain trade is probably nearly as old as grain growing, going back the Neolithic Revolution (around 11,500 BCE). Wherever there is a scarcity of land (e.g. cities), people must bring in food from outside to sustain themselves, either by force or by trade. However, many farmers throughout history (and today) have operated at the subsistence level, meaning they produce for household needs and have little leftover to trade. The goal for such farmers in not to specialize in one crop and grow a surplus of it, but rather to produce everything his family needs and become self-sufficient. Only in places and eras where production is geared towards producing a surplus for trade (commercial agriculture), does a major grain trade become possible. Early trade was most likely by barter, and because hauling large amounts of grain around was difficult with ancient technology, the trade was probably quite limited in terms of the volume traded and the distance that grain was transported. The development of the money economy and the wheel would have facilitated a much more expansive trade. In the ancient world, grain regularly flowed from the hinterlands to the cores of great empires: maize in ancient Mexico, rice in ancient China, and wheat and barley in the ancient Near East. With this came improving technologies for storing and transporting grains; the Hebrew Bible makes frequent mention of ancient Egypt's massive grain silos. During the classical age, the unification of China and the pacification of the Mediterranean basin by the Roman Empire created vast regional markets in commodities at either end of Eurasia. The grain supply to the city of Rome was considered by be of the utmost strategic importance to Roman generals and politicians. In Europe, with the collapse of the Roman system and the rise of feudalism, many farmers were reduced to a subsistence level, producing only enough to fulfill their obligation to their lord and the Church, with little for themselves, and even less for trading. The little that was traded was moved around locally at regular fairs. A massive expansion in the grain trade occurred when Europeans were able to bring millions of square kilometers of new land under cultivation in the Americas, Russia, and Australia, an expansion starting in the fifteenth and lasting into the twentieth century. In addition, the consolidation of farmland in Britain and Eastern Europe, and the development of railways and the steamship shifted trade from local to more international patterns. During this time, debate over tariffs and free trade in grain was fierce. Poor industrial workers relied on cheap bread for sustenance, but farmers wanted their government to create a higher local price to protect them from cheap foreign imports, with Britain's Corn Laws being an example. A grain elevator in Indiana, United StatesAs Britain and other European countries industrialized and urbanized, they became net importers of grain from the various breadbaskets of the world. In many parts of Europe, as serfdom was abolished, great estates were accompanied by many inefficient smallholdings, but in the newly colonized regions massive operations were available to not only great nobles, but also to the average farmer. In the United States and Canada, the Homestead Act and the Dominion Lands Act allowed pioneers on the western plains to gain tracts of (1/4 of a square mile) or more for little or no fee. This moved grain growing, and hence trading, to a much more massive scale. Huge grain elevators were built to take in farmers' produce and move it out via the railways to port. Transportation costs were a major concern for farmers in remote regions, however, and any technology that allowed the easier movement of grain was of great assistance; meanwhile, farmers in Europe struggled to remain competitive while operating on a much smaller scale. From the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: > The farmers of the United States have met a greatly increased output from > Canada, the cost of transport from that country to England being much the > same as from the United States in the 20th century. So much improved is the > position of the farmer in North America compared with what it was about > 1870, that the transport companies in 1901 carried 17 bushels of his grain > to the seaboard in exchange for the value of one bushel, whereas in 1867 he > had to give up one bushel in every six in return for the service. As regards > the British farmer, it does not appear as if he had improved his position; > for he has to send his wheat to greater distances, owing to the collapse of > many country millers or their removal to the seaboard, while railway rates > have fallen only to a very small extent; again the farmers wheat is worth > only half of what it was formerly; it may be said that the British farmer > has to give up one bushel in nine to the railway company for the purpose of > transportation, whereas in the seventies he gave up one in eighteen only. > Enough has been said to prove that the advantage of position claimed for the > British farmer by Caird was somewhat illusory. Speaking broadly, the Kansas > or Minnesota farmers wheat does not have to pay for carriage to Liverpool > more than 2s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per ton in excess of the rate paid by a > Yorkshire farmer; this, it will be admitted, does not go very far towards > enabling the latter to pay rent, tithes and rates and taxes. Bidders at the Minneapolis Grain Exchange in 1939 In the 1920s and 1930s, farmers in Australia and Canada reacted against the pricing power of the large grain-handling and shipping companies. Their governments created the Australian Wheat Board and the Canadian Wheat Board as monopsony marketing boards, buying all the wheat in those countries for export. Together, those two boards controlled a large percentage of the world's grain trade in the mid-20th century. Additionally, farmers' cooperatives such the wheat pools became a popular alternative to the major grain companies. At the same time in the Soviet Union and soon after in China, disastrous collectivization programs effectively turned the world's largest farming nations into net importers of grain. By the second half of the 20th century, the grain trade was divided between a few state-owned and privately owned giants. The state giants were Exportkhleb of the Soviet Union, the Canadian Wheat Board, the Australian Wheat Board, the Australian Barley Board, and so on. The largest private companies, known as the \\"big five\\", were Cargill, Continental, Louis Dreyfus, Bunge, and Andre, an older European company not to be confused with the more recent Andr√© Maggi Group from Brazil. In 1972, the Soviet Union's wheat crop failed. To prevent shortages in their country, Soviet authorities were able to buy most of the surplus American harvest through private companies without the knowledge of the United States government. This drove up prices across the world, and was dubbed the \\"great grain robbery\\" by critics, leading to greater public attention being paid by Americans to the large trading companies. By contrast, in 1980, the US government attempted to use its food power to punish the Soviet Union for its invasion of Afghanistan with an embargo on grain exports. This was seen as a failure in terms of foreign policy (the Soviets made up the deficit on the international market), and negatively impacted American farmers. Modern trade bulk in huge ships like this. Since the Second World War, the trend in North America has been toward further consolidation of already vast farms. Transportation infrastructure has also promoted more economies of scale. Railways have switched from coal to diesel fuel, and introduced hopper car to carry more mass with less effort. The old wooden grain elevators have been replaced by massive concrete inland terminals, and rail transportation has retreated in the face of ever larger trucks. Farmers in the European Union, United States and Japan are protected by agricultural subsidies. The European Union's programs are organized under the Common Agricultural Policy. The agricultural policy of the United States is demonstrated through the \\"farm bill\\", while rice production in Japan is also protected and subsidized. Farmers in other countries has attempted to have these policies disallowed by the World Trade Organization, or attempted to negotiate them away though the Cairns Group, at the same time the wheat boards have been reformed and many tariffs have been greatly reduced, leading to a further globalization of the industry. For example, in 2008 Mexico was required by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to remove its tariffs on US and Canadian maize. Hopper-bottomed railcars, such are this one from Japan, have made moving grain much faster and less labour-intensive. Modern issues affecting the grain trade include food security concerns, the increasing use of biofuels, the controversy over how to properly store and separate genetically modified and organic crops, the local food movement, the desire of developing countries to achieve market access in industrialized economies, climate change and drought shifting agricultural patterns, and the development of new crops. \\"Price volatility is a life-and-death issue for many people around the world\\" warned ICTSD Senior Fellow Sergio Marchi. \\"Trade policies need to incentivise investment in developing country agriculture, so that poor farmers can build resistance to future price shocks\\".Food price spikes put the spotlight on the need for sustained commitment to agriculture, International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development, 1 June 2010.

A familiar example of logarithmic growth is a number, N, in positional notation, which grows as logb (N), where b is the base of the number system used, e.g. 10 for decimal arithmetic.. In more advanced mathematics, the partial sums of the harmonic series :1+\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{3}+\\\\frac{1}{4}+\\\\frac{1}{5}+\\\\cdots grow logarithmically.. In the design of computer algorithms, logarithmic growth, and related variants, such as log-linear, or linearithmic, growth are very desirable indications of efficiency, and occur in the time complexity analysis of algorithms such as binary search. Logarithmic growth can lead to apparent paradoxes, as in the martingale roulette system, where the potential winnings before bankruptcy grow as the logarithm of the gambler's bankroll.. It also plays a role in the St. Petersburg paradox.. In microbiology, the rapidly growing exponential growth phase of a cell culture is sometimes called logarithmic growth.

All of the members develop superhuman powers--in Marc's case some of these are the result of his alien heritage being fully activated. Team 7 finish their final mission and then go AWOL, but Marc makes a deal with their boss, brokering his services (and those of John Lynch and Michael Cray) in return for the rest of the squad and their families being left alone. =Stormwatch= Backlash is then assigned to join and spy on StormWatch, the U.N.'s crisis-intervention superteam. He works as the group's field leader and instructor until he loses several members of the first team (later dubbed Stormwatch Prime) during a mission in Kuwait. After this tragedy he switches to being the full-time instructor. When a Daemonite called S'ryn puts Marc's girlfriend Major Diane LaSalle into a coma, he deserts StormWatch to track her down, breaking Cabal agent Taboo out of prison to help him on his quest. While he eventually catches his prey and revives Diane, he and Taboo become lovers, and both become fugitives. Subsequent to this, Marc discovers he had fathered twin children--a girl named Jodi Morinaka and a boy known only as Aries--by an old girlfriend from Japan. He learns of Jodi when she tracks him down after her mother's death. Like her father, Jodi's alien genes give her superhuman powers, and she takes the identity of Crimson so she can adventure with him. Backlash and Taboo arrange a pardon for their crimes in return for working for the United States' Department of Paranormal Science Investigations (PSI). Taboo's initial approach by the government results in a multi-super-powers fight throughout the house as several of the FBI agents lose their cool and employ violence. \\"Backlash\\" #21. In the same issue, Marc is dealing with emotions over Ares, he has recently learned not only that he has a son, but Ares is a cold-blooded, brain-washed assassin. Marc makes friends with the animal-faced adventurer Dingo, who helps him out on more than one case. It is around this point Marc finally learns of his Kherubim ancestry--for reasons best known to himself, Ferrian had never told Marc. Marc is placed in charge of forming a team of superpowered operatives codenamed Wildcore for Department PSI. Around this time Marc battles several of Dingo's associates, a race of animal-people that call themselves The Kindred. =More Tragedy= In an issue of WILDC.A.T.s, the long-lived Savant attempts to recruit Marc for a new version of the team. He turns her down. He works with Wildcore until most of this team are killed trying to stop a breakout at the Purgatory Max facility, as seen in the Gen-Active series. Marc survives thanks to the assistance of former DV8 member Evo who had been imprisoned for the murder of an NYPD officer. Marc loses a leg, has it replaced with an artificial one and returns to duty. According to his daughter, Marc gives up the name \\"Backlash\\"; seeking, as she put it, to keep it in the family, Jodi uses it herself. Marc Slayton appears in Sleeper as a plainclothes agent of Department PSI with the rank of Commander. =Re-Emergence= In a back-up story that ran through four different Wildstorm titles, Marc was featured in a story called \\"Slayton: Gauntlet\\" in which he must escape from the mutated experiments held within International Operations Research and Containment Facility #42 in New Mexico. Throughout the story, Slayton is required to use his powers in order to survive, revealing that he retains the ability to turn into mist, as well as use his psi-whips. At the conclusion of the arc, Marc laments not having his costume and plans to seek out some of his former Team 7 cohorts, indicating a possible return to his more active role in the Wildstorm universe. =Team 7 Returns= In Wild C.A.T.S issue 14, Lynch approaches the Wild C.A.T.S. with Team 7 in order to team up with them and face the god-like Tao, who is consolidating his power in hopes of reigning over the post-Armageddon world. While severely outmatched, the C.A.T.S. and Team 7 get assistance from Max Faraday, who downloaded God-like abilities from the internet and has saved scores of people in pocket universes that he's kept hidden from super heroes and villains alike. However, Tao wants Max's power, and lures him into battle, leaving Slayton and other Team 7 members to battle Tao's cronies. Slayton is seen leaping into battle and using his psi-whips to lift and incapacitate Blackwolf while Ladytron blasts him with a sonic beam from her mouth. Alternate version In one alternate universe, Marc Slayton works as team leader for Stormwatch, headed by Jack Hawksmoor.A Finer World (collects Stormwatch Volume 2 #4-9, 144 pages, July 1999, Titan Books, , Wildstorm, ) The Wild Storm In the 2017 reboot of the WildStorm line, The Wild Storm, Marc Slayton is one of the members of Project: Thunderbook, an Internal Operations project run by former director John Lynch. In Thunderbook, Slayton and others had their DNA spliced with that of alien(Kherubim/Khera) descent, giving him extraordinary powers as a part of his 'implant.' However, after Lynch was forced out of I/O, Project: Thunderbook was shut down, and the subjects given cover identities. Over the years, Slayton's implant became sentient and aware of its descent, allying itself with the Khera on earth. As the implant began to communicate with Slayton, his mental state began to deteriorate, as he began to murder people to feed the implant, which he calls the \\"Carer,\\" a misheard version of Khera. When I/O began to look into Project: Thunderbook, John Lynch began to track down the previous subjects, starting with Slayton. However, when Lynch found out about his loss of sanity, Slayton attempted to murder him. After Lynch escaped, Slayton began to hunt him down, along with other Gen:Active subjects created by I/O rival Skywatch's Dr. Helspont after the deterioration of Thunderbook. Along the way, Slayton murdered one other Skywatch implanted agent, and attempted to attack Midnighter and Apollo, but fled as soon as it was clear he could not take them. Slayton eventually found Lynch after he warned all of the other members of Thunderbook, but was convinced by him to instead go to New York to take out I/O, as it would be beneficial to the 'Carer.' Powers and abilities Thanks to his Kherubim genes, Marc is virtually immortal and has accrued three thousand years of combat experience. He is an expert martial artist and trained in the use of most weapons. His agility is superhuman. Exposure to the Gen-Factor released several latent powers, including the ability to generate psychic energy whips out the backs of his hands. He can use these whips for various purposes; in combat he uses them to constrict his opponents, shocking them with the energy running through the whips or to cut through objects. He can use the energy whips as grappling hooks. The whips are very durable, but beings of great strength can break them, causing painful psionic feedback. He can also transform his body and clothes into mist - as well as being useful for infiltration and defense, this also allows him to swiftly heal most injuries, which tend to vanish after transforming to mist and back. While he could at first use this ability at will, when the Gen-Factor was flushed from his system, his ability to use this power was restricted to only once or twice a day. However, his energy whips had doubled in power as a result. When first exposed to the Gen-Factor, Marc had extensive psionic powers including telepathy and telekinesis, but these powers waned over the years and even completely disappeared together with the Gen-Factor removed from his system. It is possible that his telekinetic powers contributed to the strengthening of his psionic whips, which are in actuality just a visible mental projection that allow Marc to manipulate matter with his mind. For instance, if one did not see the whips, it would appear that Marc was picking up an object, or slicing an object in half with telekinetic abilities, so it can be argued that Marc's stronger psi-whips are due to his telekinetic powers becoming part and parcel of his psychic energy whips. Although he had not been seen using his abilities since the loss of his leg during the Wildcore tragedy, based on events in recent stories, it is apparent that Marc Slayton retains his powers in some form. He still has the ability to turn into mist, though he can only do it once a day, for a limited time, and can only 'take along' things very close to his skin, i.e. a costume, since his loose shirt, pants, and cybernetic leg remained behind when he used this ability to escape to safety while being attacked by a monstrous creature. This is a serious denigration of this ability, as Backlash was once capable of turning several people into mist along with him. He also uses his psi-whips, which now appear to have reverted to their purple hue (they were originally pink, then purple, and finally yellow after the Gen-Factor was flushed from his system, when they took on a more erratic, \\"energetic\\" appearance along with the shift to being yellow.) After not using them for some time, during Slayton: Gauntlet, he used them in the final scene, explaining that he is \\"never unarmed.\\" The whips maintained their previous \\"high energy\\" appearance, unlike the more \\"flaming tendril\\" look that they had prior to the Gen-Factor leaving his body. In recent issues of Wild C.A.T.S. Slayton uses the whips in much the same way he did as far back as The Kindred, lifting and incapacitating a large enemy, in this case, Blackwolf. The whips are not represented as coming from the backs of his hands as has been traditionally depicted, but rather, from anywhere in the erratic sphere of energy surrounding Slayton's fists.

Silica is the most abundant compound in the earth's crust (59%) and the main component of almost every rock (>95%). Lithogenic Silica in Marine Systems LSi can either be accumulated \\"directly\\" in marine sediments as clastic particles or be transferred into dissolved silica (DSi) in the water column. Within living marine systems, DSi is the most important form of silica Forms of DSi, such as silicic acid (Si(OH)4), are utilized by silicoflagellates and radiolarians to create their mineral skeletons, and by diatoms to develop their frustules (external shells). These structures are vitally important, as they can protect, amplify light for photosynthesis, and even help keep these organisms afloat in the water column. DSi more readily forms from biogenic silica (BSi) than from LSi, as the latter is less soluble in water. However, LSi is still an important supply to the silica cycle, due to it being a primary supplier of silica to the water column.Schutte, C. A., Ahmerkamp, S., Wu, C. S., Seidel, M., de Beer, D., Cook, P. L. M., & Joye, S. B. (2019). Biogeochemical Dynamics of Coastal Tidal Flats. Coastal Wetlands, 407‚Äì440. doi:10.1016/b978-0-444-63893-9.00012-5 =Sources= Rivers are one of the major suppliers of LSi to marine environments. As they flow, rivers pick up fine particles, such as clays, silts, and sand, through physical weathering. Lithogenic silicic acid forms through chemical weathering, as CO2-rich water comes into contact with silicate and aluminosilicate minerals from terrestrial rocks. The silicic acid is then transported to the river via runoff or groundwater flow before being transported to the ocean. Estimates of combined flux (both lithogenic and biogenic) report that about 6.2 ¬± 1.8 Tmol Si year‚àí1 and 147 ¬® ¬± 44 Tmol Si year‚àí1 of dissolved and particulate silica, respectively, enter estuaries. Eolian transport occurs when wind picks up weathered particles, primarily lithogenic, and transports them into the atmosphere, from which they subsequently fall into the ocean. The solubility of the silica within such sediments depends on both the origin and composition of the material. For example, studies of Saharan sediment, which is mostly made of quartz, found a solubility range of 0.02%-1.1%, while some feldspar- rich sediment was estimated to have a solubility of about 10%. Eolian LSi can also accumulate in the atmosphere and fall as rain dust, a phenomenon in which raindrops contain macroscopic amounts of sediment.Colored Rains Often Begin with Dust. (2013, May 29). Retrieved September 30, 2020, from https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/81276/colored-rains-often-begin-with- dust Dry deposition of LSi ranges from 2.8 to 4.6 Tmol Si year‚àí1, with about 0.5 ¬± 0.5 Tmol Si year‚àí1 being transferred to DSi. Seafloor inputs, including hydrothermal vents and low-temperature dissolution of basalt and other terrigenous marine sediments, represent considerable sources of lithogenic DSi. High-temperature fluids leach silicon from the oceanic crust as they rise toward the seafloor, accumulating great amounts of DSi. Hydrothermal inputs are divided into 2 categories: ridge axis, which originate directly from the mid-ocean ridges (350‚ó¶C ¬± 30‚ó¶C), and ridge flank, which are diffuse inputs away from the ridge (<75‚ó¶C). The latter loses much of its DSi to precipitation (as clays) as it cools. As a result, ridge flank dissolved LSi only enters the ocean at 0.07 ¬± 0.07 Tmol Si year‚àí1, compared to 0.5 ¬± 0.3 Tmol Si year‚àí1 from ridge axis systems. In low temperature (<2‚ó¶C) conditions, seafloor basalt and lithogenic sediments can leach LSi directly into the seawater. Previous estimates that addressed seafloor basalt alone calculate a DSi flux of 0.4 ¬± 0.3 Tmol Si year-1. More recent experiments adding lithogenic sediments (including clay, shale, basalt, and sand) to the calculation gave values of 1.9 ¬± 0.7 Tmol Si year-1. A 2019 study proposed that, in the surf zone of beaches, wave action disturbed abiotic sand grains and dissolved them over time.Fabre, S., Jeandel, C., Zambardi, T., Roustan, M., & Almar, R. (2019). An Overlooked Silica Source of the Modern Oceans: Are Sandy Beaches the Key? Frontiers in Earth Science, 7. doi:10.3389/feart.2019.00231 To test this, the researchers placed sand samples in closed containers with different kinds of water and rotated the containers to simulate wave action. They discovered that the higher the rock/water ratio within the container, and the faster the container spun, the more silica dissolved into solution. After analyzing and upscaling their results, they estimated that anywhere from 3.2 ¬± 1.0 ‚Äì 5.0 ¬± 2.0 Tmol Si yr-1 of lithogenic DSi could enter the ocean from sandy beaches, a massive increase from a previous estimate of 0.3 Tmol Si yr-1.Wollast, R., & Mackenzie, F.T. (1983). Global Cycle of Silica. In S.R. Aston (Ed.), Silicon Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry (pp. 39-76). Academic Press.

The black boubou is found in Somalia and northern Kenya. Description The adult has glossy blue-black except for white spots on the rump, visible when the wings are spread and the rump feathers are erected. The underparts are white with a buffy or pinkish tinge on the breast and flanks. The bill is black; the eyes are dark reddish brown. The wings have white median coverts. The juvenile is similar but duller, with a greyish-brown bill, the upperparts mottled by yellowish-ochre to tawny feather tips, and dusky-barred flanks.

Apparently for the first time for a modern bird description, no specimen (either the bird or a part of it) was kept as a type; the bird was released back into the wild in 1990 because the scientists who caught it felt that the species was very rare. The blood and feather samples were destroyed in the process of sequencing. The epithet liberatus (\\"the liberated one\\") was given because of this. It was not found during searches in 1989 and 1990. It resembles the red-naped bushshrike L. ruficeps but has no red nape, is black, not grey, on the mantle, and is washed buffy- yellow on throat and breast. This presumed species was considered critically endangered by Birdlife International.Erik Hirschfeld (2007): The Rare Birds Yearbook 2008, MagDig Media Ltd., Shrewsbury In 2008, a new review of the molecular sequence data revealed the identity of the Bulo Burti boubou as a colour morph of Laniarius nigerrimus (traditionally considered a subspecies of tropical boubou).

Since 2007 it has been part of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the government body charged with overseeing health and safety in all workplaces. AALA inspect and issue licences to providers. These licences give an assurance that, so far as is reasonably practicable, participants and employees can be 'safe'.  Creation  The AALA was created following the Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy in March, 1993 which involved a commercial organisation assuming responsibility for children's safety. A group of eight pupils and their teacher were accompanied by two instructors from an outdoor centre on the south coast of England. As a result of a series of errors, four of the teenagers drowned. The subsequent trial resulted in the prosecution of the parent company and the centre manager. The government initially resisted changing legislation until David Jamieson, the Member of Parliament for Plymouth Devonport, who represented the parents of the children who died, introduced a Private Member's Bill which in January 1995 became the Activity Centres (Young Persons‚Äô Safety) Act 1995. In January 1995 an independent licensing authority, the AALA, was created to bring the act into reality.  Scope  The activities within the scope of the licensing scheme are: * caving (except in caves principally used as show-places open to the public) * climbing (climbing, traversing, abseiling and scrambling activities except on purpose- built climbing walls or abseiling towers) * trekking (walking, running, pony trekking, mountain biking, off-piste skiing and related activities when done in moor- or mountain-country above 600 metres and which is remote, i.e. over 30 minutes travelling time from the nearest road or refuge) * watersports (canoeing, rafting, sailing and related activities when done on the sea, tidal waters or larger non-placid inland waters).

The series is based on a short story by Gil Grant and Jeannine Renshaw. The pilot episode and two other episodes were edited into the film Alien Tracker. Plot synopsis Tracker is the story of Daggon, an alien life form who lands on Earth from the planet Cirron in a bid to capture 218 prisoners who had escaped from the planet SAR TOP in the Migar Solar System in the form of \\"life forces\\" then took over various human identities. He lands in an abandoned field in the outskirts of Chicago where he takes on the form of an underwear model and takes the name \\"Cole\\" from the underwear ad he sees on a billboard. He later meets Mel Porter, a Chicago bar owner who has an outgoing British bartender that she inherited along with her grandmother's police bar. Though she is suspicious at first, she gradually comes to accept Cole and lets him stay, offering him some of her ex- boyfriend's clothes. He has a device to capture the life forces and contain them in spheres, and once his mission is over, he has to take them back to SAR TOP. A brilliant scientist named Zin engineers the jailbreak from SAR-TOP prison, located a hundred light years away from Earth. Zin creates a wormhole, which allows almost instantaneous travel from the Migar solar system to Earth. The wormhole ends in Chicago, where Zin and the escapees have taken over the bodies of human beings and blended into society, but still retain some of their alien otherworldly abilities. With an army of escaped alien convicts, Zin creates a criminal empire, not unlike the mafia, which he can rule over as Godfather supreme. However, as Cole will discover, Zin may have a larger agenda in mind than running illegal enterprises for profit, an agenda that might carry interplanetary implications. Cole must find the fugitives and stop them before they can carry out their plans, using Mel's help and constant guidance to do so.

Cirronians have the abilities to move at hyperspeed, which weakens them if used more than once a day; manipulate energy; heal; and telekinesis. They are weakened by the cold, prolonged exposure can be fatal. Their strength is increased by heat. ;Desserians :The Desserians evolved on a desert world in the Migar System. Apparently, not descended from predators, they were forced to develop extreme blending abilities, not unlike the Earth chameleon. As such, Desserians are extremely difficult to spot in a crowd, as they can also blend into social groups with ease. Much of the plant life on their home planet is poisonous. As a result, Desserian taste buds act as portable chemical laboratories to spot poisons before they enter the bloodstream. :Although there have been several minor Desserian characters such as Zareth and Suudor, the only main Desserian character was Nestov, a good- natured fugitive con-artist. When he was first admitted to the prison planet, Nestov falsified his records to pass himself off as a Nodulian, a more aggressive species. ;Enixians :Enixians have preternaturally heightened senses of smell, hearing and taste, which is both a blessing and a curse on planets such as Earth which has odors, sounds and flavors that Enixians are not familiar with on their own planet. :Although there have been several minor Enixian characters such as Kaden and Trof there was never a main or recurring Enixian character. ;Nodulians :On their planet, Nodulians spend most of their lives under water, on Earth they need to regularly submerge in water with a high level of zinc in it to survive. They are also weakened by heat which would merely irritate a human. ;Orsusians :The Orsusians are born in pairs and are telepathic by nature. They are identified by a metal collar worn around the neck, used to focus their telepathic ability. They also have the ability to move underground. ;Vardians :The Vardians are the most aggressive of the six alien species, they are super strong and have some telekinetic ability; Zin is the only Vardian seen to be able to manipulate energy like the Cirronians (Cole/Dagon) do.

The controversy arises from several sources: * Most Islamic traditions forbid representations of Muhammad. * The satirical nature of some of the drawings was not considered respectful, especially one that shows Muhammad with a bomb in his turban, thereby reinforcing the stereotypical association of Islam with terrorism.https://web.archive.org/web/20051028123639/http://www.secularislam.org/articles/call.htm * The drawings upset the Muslim community in Denmark at a time when relations between Muslims and Western society are strained. =Criticism= The Denmark- based Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network said \\"the cartoons among things identified Islam with terrorism, (this) can only increase the xenophobia and racism that these populations are already victims of in Europe. Furthermore, this kind of image contributes to discrediting entire countries and their populations.\\" Former Danish minister of foreign affairs and ex-chairman of Venstre Uffe Ellemann-Jensen has openly criticized Jyllands-Posten for publishing the drawings. Referring to the cartoons as a \\"pubertal demonstration\\", Elleman-Jensen argues that editor-in-chief Carsten Juste has acted irresponsibly and implies that Juste is an incompetent editor. Ellemann- Jensen also argues that Juste should retire from his position as editor of the newspaper. =Cartoon editor's statement= The editor who originally approved the cartoons, Carsten Juste, later declared that the opponents of free speech had \\"won\\" because the furor would almost undoubtedly deter future editors from printing anything similar. He thought it unlikely that anyone would print a caricature of Muhammad within a generation. He also said that, had he known exactly what the consequences would be, that is death threats, boycotts, and terror threats, he would not have printed the cartoons. =The cartoonists= In early February 2006, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter published an article that focused not on the cartoons but the cartoonists (who were not named). It was based on interviews with a few of the cartoonists, several of whom regretted creating the pictures. Dagens Nyheter also noted that although the cartoons have received worldwide attention and have been published several times, the cartoonists have only earned the initial few hundred Danish kroner each for their work. =Reaction to government actions= Many people in Denmark have criticized the government's handling of the affair, particularly the prime minister's decision not to meet with the ambassadors from Muslim majority countries in October 2005. On December 20, 2005, twenty-two former Danish ambassadors sent an open letter to the prime minister criticizing his decision not to open a dialogue with the international representatives. =Criticism of Danish media in general= A 2004 report by the immigrant rights lobbyist organization, the European Network Against Racism (ENAR), claimed that the Danish media devoted an excessive proportion of their time to the problems posed by immigrants, and most often Islamic immigrants, while often ignoring the problems that these immigrants face. Over the 3-month period studied, from September 1 to November 20, 19 out of the 24 Jyllands- Posten's editorials on \\"ethnic issues\\" were negative, while 88 out of 120 op. ed. pieces on \\"ethnics\\" were negative, and 121 out of 148 letters to the editor on \\"ethnics\\" were negative. In Denmark, ENAR is represented by Bashy Quraishy, who is a former member of Socialistisk Folkeparti and is known for his apologetic attitude with regards to the 9/11 attacks and for referring to the focus on Islamic fundamentalism during the following investigations as \\"crusades\\". The other representative for ENAR in Denmark is Mona Sheikh, who failed to gain a seat in Folketinget representing Det Radikale Venstre when it was discovered that she (even though she doesn't wear a headscarf) was a member of the Minhaj-ul-Quran network. =Danish Muslims= While generally offended by the cartoons, most members of the Danish Muslim community condemn the violence that the drawings have sparked off in the Middle East, arguing that the state of Denmark is not to be held responsible for the drawings published by Jyllands-Posten. On February 7, 2006, 300 Danish Muslims and ethnic Danes marched through Gjellerupparken near √Örhus carrying torches to a demonstration for an increased understanding between the Danish Muslim community and Danish mainstream community. Rabih Azad-Ahmad who organized the demonstration appealed for friendly and open interaction between the Muslim and mainstream Danish communities. =Reconciliation= The Islamic Society in Denmark proposed that a three-day celebration of Muhammad should be held in Denmark, putting a focus on Muhammad's life. They further proposed that this be coordinated in part by the Islamic Society, Jyllands-Posten, and at least some of the five universities in Denmark. This was declined by the universities, as they do not take part in religious activities. =Opinion of the Queen of Denmark= In April 2005 the British newspaper, The Daily Telegraph published an article which quoted Queen Margrethe II of Denmark as saying that the Danes have \\"to show our opposition to Islam\\". The comment is from the book Margrethe (2005) . The statement was however somewhat mistranslated and taken from the following context: [page 197] > There is, as said, something moving about people, whom to this degree > surrender to a faith. However there is also something frightening about such > a totality, which also is a side of Islam. There must be shown counter-play > [interplay of an alternative / sparring], and once in a while you have to > run the risk of getting a less flattering label stuck upon you. Because > there is certain things before which one should not be tolerant. The passage as it appeared in The Daily Telegraph was reprinted by the pan- Arabic news paper Al-Hayat, as evidence of Islamophobia in Denmark. Opinions of Muslims Some Muslims were angered by the publication of what they considered offensive images. Although the artists have denied representing Muhammad as a terrorist, many Muslims felt that a bomb in a turban, with a lit fuse and the Islamic creed written on the bomb suggested a connection between Muhammad and terrorism. Some Liberal Muslims, mainly in Europe, have supported the republication of the images so that individual Muslims can make up their own minds and welcomed the debate on the issues that the cartoons have raised. It has also been pointed out that cartoons in the Arab and Islamic press \\"demonizing\\" Jews and Israelis are common. Louay M. Safi, scholar and Muslim American leaders argued that the cartoons were an exercise in hate, rather than free, speech. Dr. Safi accused Jyllands-Poten editors of hiding behind free speech to promote anti-Muslim feelings and demonize the small but growing Danish Muslim community. He distinguished between free speech that aims at engaging an important issue, and hate speech whose goal is to marginalize and intimidate, and argued that Jyllands-Posten was evidently guilty of the latter. =Double standard?= Other Arabs and Muslims have expressed their condemnation of the cartoons: \\"In [the West] it is considered freedom of speech if they insult Islam and Muslims,\\" columnist Mohammed al-Shaibani wrote in Kuwait's Al-Qabas daily on January 30, 2006, \\"But such freedom becomes racism and a breach of human rights and anti-Semitism if Arabs and Muslims criticize their religion and religious laws.\\" A number of Muslim commentators, including Ehsan Ahrari of the Asia Times, have pointed at laws in Germany, France, Austria, and seven other countries in Europe which explicitly regard the denial of the Holocaust as a crime, free speech considerations notwithstanding. They maintain that offensive imagery regarding the Jewish religion and the Jewish people is largely prohibited in the media in post- Holocaust Europe. The media in general practices self-restraint in this matter; therefore many Muslims say that a different set of standards applies for the Islamic faith. =BBC debate= The issue was debated in a BBC news programme by Asghar Bukhari, a founding member of MPACUK, a political movement; and by Roger Koeppel, an editor of Die Welt, a German newspaper that published the cartoons. Bukhari suggested to Koeppel that a German paper would be particularly mindful of the effect of such imagery, considering the lengthy history of anti-Semitic propaganda and demonization of Jews in German media prior to the Holocaust, when caricatures of Jews as rich financiers or evil Bolsheviks were commonplace. Koeppel replied that he did not consider the caricatures of Muhammad in the same vein. =Islamic governments and NGOs= The public anger was accompanied by a condemnation from Arabic and Islamic governments as well as Islamic non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The Justice and Islamic Affairs Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed Al Dhaheri, called it \\"cultural terrorism, not freedom of expression\\", according to the official WAM news agency. \\"The repercussions of such irresponsible acts will have adverse impact on international relations.\\" In Tunisia, Abdulaziz Othman Altwaijri, president of the Islamic Organization for Education, Science and Culture (ISESCO, the Islamic world's counterpart to UNESCO) called the drawings a form of racism and discrimination that one must counter by all available means. He said, \\"It's regrettable to state today, as we are calling for dialogue, that other parties feed animosity and hate and attack sacred symbols of Muslims and of their prophet\\". Jordan's largest circulation daily, government-run Al-Rai, said the Danish government must apologize. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on February 6, 2006, that a \\"Zionist conspiracy\\" was to blame for the row over the cartoons, in his first reaction to the controversy: \\"The reason for the Zionist action is because of the loss they suffered by Hamas winning\\". Khamenai was referring to Hamas victory in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, which took place in January, several months after the publication of the cartoons. The condemnations have also come from the General Secretariat of the Organization of Islamic Conference, saying: > It is evident that the intention of Jylland Posten was motivated to incite > hatred and violence against Muslims. By exposing the level of understanding > of Islamic religion and its symbols the dailies have seriously damaged their > credibility in the eyes of Muslim world and harmed democracy, freedom of the > press, violated decency and civilized norms. The Muslim World League called on UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to activate international laws against insolence toward religion. =Holocaust contest= Hamshahri, Iran's largest newspaper has announced that it will be holding an \\"international cartoon contest about the Holocaust\\" in reaction to the images. The paper's graphics editor said, \\"The Western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression, so let's see if they mean what they say and also print these Holocaust cartoons\\". =\\"Muslims not blameless\\"= However, not all Muslims placed blame entirely on the West. In Iraq, the country's top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, decried the drawings but did not call for protests. Al-Sistani suggested that militant Muslims were partly to blame for distorting Islam's image. In the United Arab Emirates, the periodical Al-Ittihad published an opinion piece which argued that, > The world has come to believe that Islam is what is practiced by Bin Laden, > Zawahiri, Zarqawi, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Salafis, and others who have > presented a distorted image of Islam. We must be honest with ourselves and > admit that we are the reason for these drawings. Former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami, who is also the theorist of Dialogue Among Civilizations, strongly criticized the Danish cartoons for \\"spreading hatred\\", but added that the Muslim world is not entirely blameless either: =Bewilderment= Certain secular Muslims have expressed bewilderment at the reaction these cartoons have provoked. A Danish member of parliament, Muslim Naser Khader stated, \\"My impression from different Arabic media is that the dominant position ‚Äì perhaps surprising for some ‚Äì can be summarised as follows: We cannot as Muslims dictate that non-Muslims comply with the allegedly prohibited depiction of the prophet.\\" One Arab journalist based in Brussels wrote that \\"It is perplexing that a few crude cartoons can spark an international crisis overshadowing war, political oppression and economic and social injustice. It has hurt the image of Muslims and reflects poorly on their tolerance.\\" =Support for free speech= Khaled Diab argues that Muslims cannot impose their own values on people of other faiths. Freedom of expression should permit people to express whatever opinions they have, even if they are offensive, he argues. Yet responsibility, respect, and sensitivity should lead mainstream media outlets to assess the effect the material they plan to publish will have on their readers and society at large. While condemning the Muslim reaction, Diab also points to \\"the uglier face of western prejudice\\" that these cartoons reveal and cautions against smugness in the west. \\"But people in Europe shouldn't take a holier-than-thou attitude. They would do well to remember that their own record of defending freedom of expression when the views being expressed run contrary to their own has been patchy at best.\\" He refers to Jyllands-Posten's own refusal to publish a cartoon that lampooned Jesus and the continued attempts by various western governments to gag Arab media channels, foremost among the Al Jazeera. International opinion According to one analyst, the controversy over the cartoons has resulted in bridging some of the divides that both sides of the \\"West vs Jihadist\\" conflict have historically exploited: The rift between the United States and Europe on one side, and the rift between Sunnis and Shiites on the other side. According to this view, the reaction of the Muslims to the cartoons unifies the factions on either side of the global conflict. (premium subscription needed) Some Muslims have stated in interviews that much of the reaction is because it was unexpected and that many Muslims consider Europe, and especially the Scandinavian countries, as more friendly towards the Arab world than the USA, for example. =United Kingdom= Tariq Ramadan, a member of Tony Blair's committee to combat Islamic extremism, claims to see an \\"unholy alliance\\" between the anti-immigrant right wing in Europe and the dictatorial regimes in the Middle East. As the reasoning goes, some seek to portray Muslims as enemies of Western values and incapable of integration in European society. At the same time various dictatorial regimes in the Islamic world seek to unite their populations behind them by creating external enemies, which they claim are attacking Islam. By polarizing the issue, these two groups have increased the division between Islamic and Western society. British newspapers took an unusually similar editorial line on the issue, agreeing with the government's assessment of the issue. Even those considered on the 'right' criticized the intellectual justifications given by Continental titles. =Vatican City= The Vatican City released a statement on Offending Religious Sentiments, \\"The right to freedom of thought and expression, sanctioned by the Declaration of the Rights of Man, cannot imply the right to offend the religious sentiment of believers.\\"...\\"Coexistence Calls for a Climate of Mutual Respect\\" Zenit News Agency 2006-02-03 It is also mentioned how government law protects secular symbols (national flags) but ignores respect of religious symbols.\\"Vatican cardinal criticizes cartoons satirizing prophet Mohammed \\" Catholic Online 2006-02-03 =UN= On February 13, 2006 Mr. Doudou Di√®ne, United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance, reported:E/CN.4/2006/17 , United Nations, February 13, 2006 > Legally, the Government of every State party to the International Covenant > on Civil and Political Rights is bound by three articles dealing with the > relationship between freedom of religion and freedom of opinion and > expression, namely article 18, which protects freedom of religion, subject > to such limitations as are necessary to protect public safety and order or > the fundamental rights and freedoms of others (art. 18, para. 3); article > 19, which protects freedom of expression and opinion, subject to certain > restrictions such as \\"respect of the rights or reputations of others\\" (art. > 19, para. 3 (a)); and article 20, which states that any advocacy of > national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to > discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law. On February 7, 2006 UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the OIC Ekmeleddin ƒ∞hsanoƒülu, and the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU Javier Solana issued a joint statement:Joint UN, EU, OIC statement shares ‚Äòanguish‚Äô of muslim world at mohammed caricatures, but condemns violent response , United Nations, February 7, 2006 Criticism of Muslim reactions Commentators who characterize the Muslim reaction as hypocritical claim to several inconsistencies. First, the numerous anti- Semitic publications in Arab media. One website, Filibuster Cartoons, pointed out this criticism in a political cartoon. Also countries like Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Libya where demonstrations are tightly controlled, have been accused of allowing violent riots as a distraction. In the case of Syria, protests would not be inconvenient in light of the current Hariri investigation. Various commentators across the political spectrume.g.: * A critique in Al- Ahram: \\"Islam and Globanalisation\\" by the American scholar Hamid Dabashi.  * view the Muslim reaction to the cartoons, be it the actual violence or the non-violent justification for the violence, as evidence of what Samuel Huntington predicted in his 1993 book, The Clash of Civilizations, namely, \\"‚Ä¶the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic‚Ä¶the dominating source of conflict will be cultural‚Ä¶\\" Daniel Pipes argues that the pattern of events shows Muslim hypocrisy and supremacism: > ...will Westerners accede to a double standard by which Muslims are free to > insult Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism, while Muhammad, Islam, > and Muslims enjoy immunity from insults? Muslims routinely publish cartoons > far more offensive than the Danish ones... .... .... The deeper issue here, > however, is not Muslim hypocrisy but Islamic supremacism. George Friedman, the founder of Stratfor, questions why Muslims would threaten all members of a given nationality as a result of the actions of a few of its members or that of a small, private company. Friedman notes that according to that logic, not only would the entire Western world be held \\"hostage\\" to the strictures of Islam, but the entire Western world (or at least all Scandinavians) would bear the consequences for the actions of individuals they cannot control. Therefore, Westerners would have to conclude that violent clashes between the West and jihadist elements is both inevitable and uncontrollable. Mark Stein of the Jerusalem Post prefers to view the massively disproportionate Muslim response as simply a form of \\"arm flexing\\" or intimidation by violent Muslim factions. Some commentators also assert that there is an inconsistent reaction towards various countries whose media is guilty of the same thing. For example, the Egyptian newspaper El Fagr published 6 of the Muhammad cartoons during Ramadan with no apparent adverse reaction. In response to some of these criticisms, editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi Abd al-Bari Atwan on the BBC's Dateline London argued that most if not all of the 'anti-semitic' cartoons in the Arab press are of Israeli politicians not of Jewish prophets (as Jewish prophets are also prophets of Islam), or related to the occupation of Palestine and the Sabra and Shatila massacres. On the other hand, \\"anti-semitic\\" cartoons can be considered offensive to many within the Jewish community.

Biogenic silica (bSi), also referred to as opal, biogenic opal, or amorphous opaline silica, forms one of the most widespread biogenic minerals. For example, microscopic particles of silica called phytoliths can be found in grasses and other plants. Silica is an amorphous metal oxide formed by complex inorganic polymerization processes. This is opposed to the other major biogenic minerals, comprising carbonate and phosphate, which occur in nature as crystalline iono-covalent solids (e.g. salts) whose precipitation is dictated by solubility equilibria.Coradin, T., Lopez, P.J. (2003). \\"Biogenic Silica Patterning: Simple Chemistry or Subtle Biology?\\" ChemBioChem 3: 1-9. Chemically, bSi is hydrated silica (SiO2¬∑nH2O), which is essential to many plants and animals. Silica in marine environments Silicate, or silicic acid (H4SiO4), is an important nutrient in the ocean. Unlike the other major nutrients such as phosphate, nitrate, or ammonium, which are needed by almost all marine plankton, silicate is an essential chemical requirement for very specific biota, including diatoms, radiolaria, silicoflagellates, and siliceous sponges. These organisms extract dissolved silicate from open ocean surface waters for the buildup of their particulate silica (SiO2), or opaline, skeletal structures (i.e. the biota's hard parts).Boggs, S. (2005). \\"Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy (4th Edition)\\". Pearson Education, Inc, 662p.DeMaster, D.J. (1981).\\"The supply and accumulation of silica in the marine environment\\". Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 45: 1715-1732. Some of the most common siliceous structures observed at the cell surface of silica-secreting organisms include: spicules, scales, solid plates, granules, frustules, and other elaborate geometric forms, depending on the species considered.Ehrlich et al. (2010). \\"Modern Views on Desilicification: Biosilica and Abiotic Silica Dissolution in Natural and Artificial Environments \\". Chem. Rev. 110: 4656-4689. Five major sources of dissolved silica to the marine environment can be distinguished: * Riverine influx of dissolved silica to the oceans: 4.2 ¬± 0.8 √ó 1014 g SiO2 yr‚àí1 * Submarine volcanism and associated hydrothermal emanations: 1.9 ¬± 1.0 √ó 1014 g SiO2 yr‚àí1 * Glacial weathering: 2 √ó 1012 g SiO2 yr‚àí1 * Low temperature submarine weathering of oceanic basalts * Some silica may also escape from silica- enriched pore waters of pelagic sediments on the seafloor Once the organism has perished, part of the siliceous skeletal material dissolves, as it settles through the water column, enriching the deep waters with dissolved silica. Some of the siliceous scales can also be preserved over time as microfossils in deep-sea sediments, providing a window into modern and ancient plankton/protists communities. This biologic process has operated, since at least early Paleozoic time, to regulate the balance of silica in the ocean: Radiolarians (Cambrian/Ordovician-Holocene), diatoms (Cretaceous-Holocene), and silicoflagellates (Cretaceous-Holocene) form the ocean's main contributors to the global silica biogenic cycle throughout geologic time. Diatoms account for 43% of the ocean primary production, and are responsible for the bulk of silica extraction from ocean waters in the modern ocean, and during much of the past fifty million years. In contrast, oceans of Jurassic and older ages, were characterized by radiolarians as major silica-utilizing phyla. Nowadays, radiolarians are the second (after diatoms) major producers of suspended amorphous silica in ocean waters. Their distribution ranges from the Arctic to the Antarctic, being most abundant in the equatorial zone. In equatorial Pacific waters, for example, about 16,000 specimens per cubic meter can be observed. Silicate cycling gained increasingly in scientific attention the past decade because of following reasons. Firstly, the modern marine silica cycle is widely believed to be dominated by diatoms for the fixation and export of particulate matter (including organic carbon), from the euphotic zone to the deep ocean, via a process known as the biological pump. As a result, diatoms, and other silica-secreting organisms, play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, and have the ability to affect atmospheric CO2 concentrations on a variety of time scales, by sequestering CO2 in the ocean. This connection between biogenic silica and organic carbon, together with the significantly higher preservation potential of biogenic siliceous compounds, compared to organic carbon, makes opal accumulation records very interesting for paleoceanography and paleoclimatology. Secondly, biogenic silica accumulation on the sea floor contains lot of information about where in the ocean export production has occurred on time scales ranging from hundreds to millions of years. For this reason, opal deposition records provide valuable information regarding large-scale oceanographic reorganizations in the geological past, as well as paleoproductivity. And last, the mean oceanic residence time for silicate is approximately 10,000‚Äì15,000 yr. This relative short residence time, makes oceanic silicate concentrations and fluxes sensitive to glacial/interglacial perturbations, and thus an excellent proxy for evaluating climate changes.Cortese, G., Gersonde, R. (2004). \\"Opal sedimentation shifts in the World Ocean over the last 15 Myr\\". Earth and Planetary Science Letters 224: 509-527. The remains of diatoms and other silica-utilizing organisms are found, as opal sediments within pelagic deep- sea deposits. Pelagic sediments, containing significant quantities of siliceous biogenic remains, are commonly referred to as siliceous ooze. Siliceous ooze are particularly abundant in the modern ocean at high latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres. A striking feature of siliceous ooze distribution is a ca. 200 km wide belt stretching across the Southern Ocean. Some equatorial regions of upwelling, where nutrients are abundant and productivity is high, are also characterized by local siliceous ooze. Siliceous oozes are composed primarily of the remains of diatoms and radiolarians, but may also include other siliceous organisms, such as silicoflagellates and sponge spicules. Diatom ooze occurs mainly in high- latitude areas and along some continental margins, whereas radiolarian ooze are more characteristic of equatorial areas. Siliceous ooze are modified and transformed during burial into bedded cherts. Diatoms in both fresh and salt water extract silica from the water to use as a component of their cell walls. Likewise, some holoplanktonic protozoa (Radiolaria), some sponges, and some plants (leaf phytoliths) use silicon as a structural material. Silicon is known to be required by chicks and rats for growth and skeletal development. Silicon is in human connective tissues, bones, teeth, skin, eyes, glands and organs. BSi is silica that originates from the production out of dissolved silica. BSi can either be accumulated \\"directly\\" in marine sediments (via export) or be transferred back into dissolved silica in the water column. Increasingly, isotope ratios of oxygen (O18:O16) and silicon (Si30:Si28) are analysed from BSi preserved in lake and marine sediments to derive records of past climate change and nutrient cycling (De La Rocha, 2006; Leng and Barker, 2006). This is a particularly valuable approach considering the role of diatoms in global carbon cycling. In addition, isotope analyses from BSi are useful for tracing past climate changes in regions such as in the Southern Ocean, where few biogenic carbonates are preserved. = Marine biogenic silica budget = Rivers and submarine hydrothermal emanations supply 6.1 √ó 1014 g SiO2 yr‚àí1 to the marine environment. Approximately two-thirds of this silica input is stored in continental margin and deep-sea deposits. Siliceous deep- sea sediments located beneath the Antarctic Convergence (convergence zone) host some 25% of the silica supplied to the oceans (i.e. 1.6 √ó 1014 g SiO2 yr‚àí1) and consequently form one of Earth's major silica sinks. The highest biogenic silica accumulation rates in this area are observed in the South Atlantic, with values as large as 53 cm.kyr‚àí1 during the last 18,000 yr. Further, extensive biogenic silica accumulation has been recorded in the deep- sea sediments of the Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, and Subarctic North Pacific. Total biogenic silica accumulation rates in these regions amounts nearly 0.6 √ó 1014 g SiO2 yr‚àí1, which is equivalent to 10% of the dissolved silica input to the oceans. Continental margin upwelling areas, such as the Gulf of California, the Peru and Chile coast, are characteristic for some of the highest biogenic silica accumulation rates in the world. For example, biogenic silica accumulation rates of 69 g SiO2/cm2/kyr have been reported for the Gulf of California. Due to the laterally confined character of these rapid biogenic silica accumulation zones, upwelling areas solely account for approximately 5% of the dissolved silica supplied to the oceans. At last, extremely low biogenic silica accumulation rates have been observed in the extensive deep- sea deposits of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, rendering these oceans insignificant for the global marine silica budget.DeMaster, D.J. (2002). \\"The accumulation and cycling of biogenic silica in the Southern Ocean: revisiting the marine silica budget\\". Deep-Sea Research Part II 49: 3155-3167 = Major silica sinks in the modern oceans = Large-scale oceanic circulation has a direct impact on opal deposition. The Pacific (characterized by nutrient poor surface waters, and deep nutrient rich waters) and Atlantic Ocean circulations, are favoring the production/preservation of silica and carbonate, respectively. For instance, Si/N and Si/P ratios increase from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Southern Ocean, favoring opal versus carbonate producers. Consequently, the modern configuration of large-scale oceanic circulation resulted in the localization of major opal burial zones in the Equatorial Pacific, in the eastern boundary current upwelling systems, and by far the most important, the Southern Ocean. Waters from the modern Pacific and Southern ocean, typically observe an increase in Si/N ratio at intermediate depth, which results in an increase in opal export (~ increase in opal production). In the Southern Ocean and North Pacific, this relationship between opal export and Si/N ratio switches from linear to exponential for Si/N ratios greater than 2. This gradual increase in the importance of silicate (Si) relative to nitrogen (N) has tremendous consequences for the ocean biological production. The change in nutrient ratios contributes to select diatoms as main producers, compared to other (e.g., calcifying) organisms. For example, microcosm experiments have demonstrated that diatoms are DSi supercompetitors and dominate other producers above 2 ŒºM DSi. Consequently, opal vs. carbonate export will be favored, resulting in increasing opal production. The Southern Ocean and the North Pacific also display maximum biogenic silicate/Corganic flux ratios, and consist thus in an enrichment in biogenic silicate, compared to Corganic export flux. This combined increase in opal preservation and export makes the Southern Ocean the most important sink for DSi today. In the modern Pacific and Southern Ocean, intermediate and deep waters are characterized by a higher content in DSi, compared to the Atlantic Ocean. This interbasin difference in DSi has the effect of increasing the preservation potential of opal in the Pacific and Southern Ocean compared to their Atlantic counterparts. Atlantic DSi depleted waters tends to produce relatively less silicified organisms, which has a strong influence on the preservation of their frustules. This mechanism in best illustrated when comparing the Peru and northwest Africa upwelling systems. The dissolution/production ratio is much higher in the Atlantic upwelling than in the Pacific upwelling. This is due to the fact that coastal upwelling source waters are much richer in DSi off Peru, than off NW Africa. = Cycling and accumulation of biogenic silica in the Southern Ocean sediments = Southern Ocean sediments are a major sink for biogenic silica (50-75% of the oceanic total of 4.5 √ó 1014 g SiO2 yr‚àí1; DeMaster, 1981), but only a minor sink for organic carbon (<1% of the oceanic 2 √ó 1014 g of organic C yr‚àí1). These relatively high rates of biogenic silica accumulation in the Southern Ocean sediments (predominantly beneath the Polar Front) relative to organic carbon (60:1 on a weight basis) results from the preferential preservation of biogenic silica in the Antarctic water column. In contrast to what was previously thought, these high rates of biogenic silica accumulation are not the result from high rates of primary production. Biological production in the Southern Ocean is strongly limited due to the low levels of irradiance coupled with deep mixed layers and/or by limited amounts of micronutrients, such as iron.DeMaster, D. (1992).\\"Cycling and Accumulation of Biogenic Silica and Organic Matter in High-Latitude Environments: The Ross Sea\\". Oceanography 5(3): 147-153 This preferential preservation of biogenic silica relative to organic carbon is evident in the steadily increasing ratio of silica/organic C as function of depth in the water column. About thirty- five percent of the biogenic silica produced in the euphotic zone survives dissolution within the surface layer; whereas only 4% of the organic carbon escapes microbial degradation in these near-surface waters. Consequently, considerable decoupling of organic C and silica occurs during settling through the water column. The accumulation of biogenic silica in the seabed represents 12% of the surface production, whereas the seabed organic-carbon accumulation rate accounts for solely <0.5% of the surface production. As a result, polar sediments account for most of the ocean's biogenic silica accumulation, but only a small amount of the sedimentary organic-carbon flux. = BSi production = Diatomaceous earth as viewed under bright field illumination on a light microscope. Diatomaceous earth is made up of diatom cell walls, an example of biogenic silica. Silica is synthesised in the diatom cell by the polymerisation of silicic acid. This image of diatomaceous earth particles in water is at a scale of 6.236 pixels/Œºm, the entire image covers a region of approximately 1.13 by 0.69 mm. The mean daily BSi rate strongly depends on the region: * Coastal upwelling: 46 mmol.m‚àí2.d‚àí1 * Sub-arctic Pacific: 18 mmol.m‚àí2.d‚àí1 * Southern Ocean: 3-38 mmol.m‚àí2.d‚àí1 * mid-ocean gyres: 0.2-1.6 mmol.m‚àí2.d‚àí1 Likewise, the integrated annual BSi production strongly depends on the region: * Coastal upwelling: 3 √ó 1012 mol.yr‚àí1 * Subarctic Pacific: 8 √ó 1012 mol.yr‚àí1 * Southern Ocean: 17-37 √ó 1012 mol.yr‚àí1 * mid-ocean gyres: 26 √ó 1012 mol.yr‚àí1 BSi production is controlled by: * Dissolved silica availability, however, half saturation constant KŒº for silicon-limited growth is lower than Ks for silicon uptake. * Light availability: There is no direct light requirement; silicon uptake at 2x depth of photosynthesis; silicon uptake continues at night but cells must be actively growing. * Micronutrient availability. = BSi dissolution = BSi dissolution is controlled by: * Thermodynamics of solubility: Temperature (0 to 25 ¬∞C - 50x increase). * Sinking rate: Food web structure--grazers, fecal pellets, discarded feeding structures, Aggregation - rapid transport. * Bacterial degradation of organic matrix (Bidle and Azam, 1999). = BSi preservation = BSi preservation is measured by: * Sedimentation rates, mainly sediment traps (Honjo); * Benthic remineralization rates (\\"recycling\\"), benthic flux chamber (Berelson); * BSi concentration in sediments, chemical leaching in alkaline solution, site specific, need to differentiate lithogenic vs. biogenic Si, X-ray diffraction. BSi preservation is controlled by: * Sedimentation rate; * Porewater dissolved silica concentration: saturation at 1.100 Œºmol/L; * Surface coatings: dissolved Al modifies solubility of deposited biogenic silica particles, dissolved silica can also precipitate with Al as clay or Al-Si coatings. Opaline silica on Mars In the Gusev crater of Mars, the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit inadvertently discovered opaline silica. One of its wheels had earlier become immobilized and thus was effectively trenching the Martian regolith as it dragged behind the traversing rover. Later analysis showed that the silica was evidence for hydrothermal conditions. Ruff, S. W., et al.

With an ensemble cast led by Joe Morton, Maria del Mar, Alexandra Wilson, Brian McNamara, Salli Richardson, Julia Pennington, Gay Thomas, Jordan Lund, and Joe Spano, the series focuses on the doctors and nurses in a 23rd-century hospital space station located in deep space. The executive producers were Trey Callaway, Michael Katleman, Lee David Zlotoff, Joe Voci, and Scott Sanders. Callaway adapted Mercy Point from his original screenplay, \\"Nightingale One\\". It was picked up by Mandalay Television, and the concept was eventually revised as a television project and renamed Mercy Point; production on the film project had ended due to the poor commercial performance of the 1997 film Starship Troopers. The television show was part of a three-million-dollar deal between Mandalay and Columbia TriStar Television to produce 200 hours of material. It was filmed in Vancouver to reduce production costs, the hospital sets being constructed on a series of sound stages. Director Joe Napolitano has praised the show for its use of a complete set to allow for more intricate directing. Despite Callaway envisioning Mercy Point as a companion to Star Trek: Voyager, it was paired with Moesha and Clueless as its lead-in on Tuesday nights. Initially focused on ethical and medical cases, the show's storylines gradually shifted toward relating the characters' personal relationships, to better fit UPN's primarily teen demographic. Mercy Point was placed on hiatus after only three episodes were aired, and was replaced by the reality television series America's Greatest Pets and the sitcom Reunited. The show suffered from low ratings, with an average of two million viewers. The final four episodes of the series were broadcast in two 2-hour blocks on Thursday nights in July 1999. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. Critical response to Mercy Point was mixed; some commentators praised its characterization and use of science- fiction elements, while others found it to be uninteresting and unoriginal. Callaway stated that he had the potential story arcs for the full first season already planned before the show's cancellation. Premise Set in the year 2249, Mercy Point revolves around doctors and nurses working in a hospital space station in deep space.Brooks & Marsh (2009): p. 888 The \\"state-of-the- art hospital\\" is described as \\"the last stop for anything going out, the first stop for anything coming back\\" by one of the show's characters. It is noted for existing on the \\"fringes of the galaxy\\", on a colony called Jericho. The facility includes advanced medical equipment, such as \\"artificial wombs, holographic three-dimensional X-ray projections [and] zero-gravity operating tables\\". A talking computer known as Hippocrates, voiced by series co-creator Trey Callaway, is shown as the primary method to monitor a patient's status.Garcia & Phillips (2008): p. 150 The doctors and nurses work on both human and extraterrestrial patients over the course of the series. In the series, the medical staff is referred to as \\"med-nauts\\". Despite the futuristic setting, the characters' clothing and hairstyles adhere to 1990s fashion trends. In Frank Garcia and Mark Phillips' book Science Fiction Television Series, 1990‚Äì2004, they compared the concept behind the show to James White's Sector General series, Murray Leinster's stories about a doctor who travels to different planets, and G. Harry Stine's book Space Doctor.Garcia & Phillips (2008): p. 152 Mercy Point's setting and filming style also received comparisons to the television medical drama ER; the series itself was promoted as \\"ER in space\\". Characters According to a press release from UPN, the series features the characters' attempts to \\"balanc[e] complicated personal lives with the demands of working in a cutting-edge hospital\\". Each episode includes story arcs involving personal and professional problems, the staff's relationships gaining more prominence as the series progressed. Alien physiologist Grote Maxwell (Joe Morton) works as the facility's lead doctor and surgeon. Senior surgeon Haylen Breslauer (Maria del Mar) directs Maxwell's actions as his boss and best friend.Garcia & Phillips (2008): p. 149 Dru Breslaur (Alexandra Wilson) begins working at the hospital in the pilot episode, creating tension because of her strained relationship with her older sister Haylen, and her past romance with Dr. C. J. Jurado (Brian McNamara). Jurado is characterized through his high libido, with his story arc involving a love triangle with Dru and his current girlfriend Lieutenant Kim Salisaw (Salli Richardson). While working as a doctor, Rema Cooke (Gay Thomas) grows more concerned about her patients' rights. The android head nurse ANI (Julia Pennington) and the alien surgeon Dr. Batung (Jordan Lund) also help to combat the frequent medical emergencies at the hospital. ANI (Android Nursing Interface) is represented as \\"extremely efficient and attractive\\", the facility's other nurses disliking her as they feel that she sets an impossible standard for them to match. Throughout the series, ANI develops more emotions, such as crying and laughing, and tries to learn more about them. Batung, who is part of the slug-like species the Shenn, is portrayed as lacking bedside manners by acting insensitively toward his patients. His negative behavior is attributed to his lack of experience working with human co-workers and patients. The hospital is run by the Chief of Staff Harris DeMilla (Joe Spano), who is often tasked to handle its ethical issues. Production =Concept and development= alt=A man with short brown hair and purple-tinted glasses smiles towards the camera. Created by Trey Callaway, David Simkins, and Milo Frank, Mercy Point was originally developed as a concept for a feature film.Garcia & Phillips (2008): p. 147 Callaway drew his primary inspiration for the original screenplay from a concept by Frank, entitled \\"Nightingale One\\". And while pitching the idea to film executives, Callaway said in his closing comments that he could also envision it as the framework for a successful television series. \\"Nightingale One\\" was eventually purchased by Mandalay Entertainment, a production company headed by Peter Guber, but the film's production was stalled after the poor commercial performance of the 1997 film Starship Troopers. However, a producer who saw Callaway's original pitch to Mandalay Entertainment's executives decided to reformat \\"Nightingale One\\" as a television series based on Callaway's final remarks in the meeting. After the concept's approval for television, \\"Nightingale One\\" was renamed Mercy Point. During production, Callaway imagined the series as a \\"companion piece\\" to Star Trek: Voyager, with the hope that it would have a shared viewership. Even though elements of \\"Nightingale One\\" were kept, Callaway said that \\"[he] really started over again and reconceived it completely as a series from the ground up\\". Prior to the series being officially green-lit, Callaway collaborated with writer David Simkins to prepare a presentation of a \\"low-budgeted 30 minute\\" pilot. Simkins did not work on the series after his pilot, but his contributions earned him a credit as one of its co-creators. John de Lancie, who was noted for acting as Q in Star Trek: The Next Generation, had essayed the role of DeMilla, and Steve Johnson designed the non-humanoid aliens. The pilot presentation was filmed in Los Angeles, but the sets were completely renovated for the series' episodes. Three non-humanoid characters, including ANI and Batung, were added to the show following this presentation. UPN executives responded positively to the presentation, and ordered thirteen episodes of the series, which was considered a \\"half-season's worth\\". Mercy Point was one of four shows produced by Mandalay Television that appeared in the 1998‚Äì99 United States television schedule, alongside Cupid, Rude Awakening, and Oh Baby. The show's production was part of a three-million-dollar deal with Columbia TriStar Television to produce 200 hours of material; a majority of the content created from this agreement was commercially unsuccessful. =Casting and filming= Callaway carefully chose actors when casting each role. He focused on maintaining the series as a \\"character-driven plot\\", to always make \\"what is going on with people's hearts and minds\\" more important than special effects. Despite auditioning other actors to voice Hippocrates, Callway reprised the role from the pilot; he would later say that he had difficulty with the medical and technical vocabulary required for the character. Like The X-Files and Stargate SG-1, the show was filmed in Vancouver to take advantage of lower production costs. A majority of the crew had worked on The X-Files. The executive producers were: Trey Callaway, Michael Katleman, Lee David Zlotoff, Joe Voci, and Scott Sanders. Jon Ehrlich composed the show's theme. The entire series was shot on sound stages. Production designers Greg Loewen and Graemay Murray designed the medical facility as a \\"circular hub with offices and rooms radiating outward\\", and included a second floor in which DeMilla could oversee the entire hospital's operations. Director Joe Napolitano praised the sets while filming the episode \\"Last Resort\\", calling the show \\"a good candy store for a director\\" due to the functionality and size of the hospital. He explained that the set enabled him to direct long takes and walk and talk sequences without much difficulty. The series required extensive prosthetic work for Dr. Batung and the non-human patients. The application of Lund's prosthetic makeup required several hours each day that he was filmed. Napolitano said that he found this to be a challenge to the production schedule, explaining that there would be discussions about the amount of prosthetics necessary for Batung depending on the scene. Batung's prosthetic work included a tail that wrapped around his neck and shoulders; Lund was pushed around the set on a sled to mimic the character's movements as a slug. Napolitano also specified that the patients required a similar amount of time and work for their prosthetic makeup, such as a man who has gills under his chin.Garcia & Phillips (2008): p. 151 =Cancellation and unproduced episodes= Callaway said he was surprised by UPN's cancellation of Mercy Point because of their strong support of the show. He felt the decision was made in part because of the show's high production costs. He also concluded that the decision to broadcast the pilot at the same time as the World Series resulted in the loss of Mercy Points target audience. To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like Moesha over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode was in the middle of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale. In an interview about the series, Callaway said that he had developed complete story arcs for each character for the rest of the first season. Hayden would have continued to deal with feelings of \\"homesickness\\", which is defined as \\"a crippling interstellar condition unique to humans that ultimately linked their survival to returning to Earth\\" in the context of the show. Batung would have suffered consequences for rejecting \\"the protective fold of his species\\", and ANI would develop an antidote for a virus that spread from computers to humans in the pilot episode. Callaway described ANI's future character development as \\"the ultimate clash between the organic and technological worlds\\". The status of Grote's missing family would eventually be uncovered after he conducts a rescue mission with C. J. to the \\"Sahartic Divide\\". Dru would be confronted by her \\"old addictions\\" and Cooke would test her theory that the temporal lobe houses a human's soul and is connected with \\"homesickness\\". Episodes Reception =Broadcast history= Following the decision to expand its programming to Thursday and Friday nights, UPN picked up six original series. Mercy Point was one of two science fiction television shows picked up by UPN ‚Äì the second being the time travel-themed Seven Days. Scott D. Pierce of Deseret News described the network's choice of two science-fiction dramas and two 19th century programs (The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer and Legacy) as showing \\"a definite bent toward the unusual\\". Prior to its premiere, the show was promoted through its inclusion of Joe Morton in a starring role. Although Callaway envisioned Mercy Point as a companion to Star Trek: Voyager, UPN paired the Star Trek installment with Seven Days instead. Mercy Point was initially broadcast on Tuesday nights at 9 pm EST, following the sitcoms Moesha and Clueless. The Moesha and Clueless block was held over from the previous year. Entertainment Weekly's Dan Snierson noted that Mercy Point faced tough competition from other shows in the same time slot, primarily Just Shoot Me!, Spin City, and Felicity. The series carried a TV-PG parental rating, meaning that it was judged as \\"unsuitable for young children\\". UPN placed Mercy Point on hiatus on October 27, 1998, after the show averaged a rating of 1.5 million viewers. The announcement was made ten days after the series premiere; only three episodes had aired. It was replaced by the reality television series America's Greatest Pets and the sitcom Reunited. The show ranked number 157 based on the Nielsen Media Research's survey of programs airing from September 21, 1998, to May 26, 1999, with an average of two million viewers. It tied with America's Greatest Pets and The Love Boat: The Next Wave. Joal Ryan of E! News wrote that the network's decision was not a surprise given that most viewers were unaware of the show's existence. While reporting on the show's status, Ryan questioned the repeated failures of science-fiction medical dramas. In October 1998, media outlets were reporting that the series might still return to UPN's primetime schedule sometime in the future. The series' final four episodes were broadcast in two 2-hour blocks on Thursday nights in July 1999. Mercy Point was included on the list of failed medical shows by The Blade's Rob Owen, along with MDs and 3 lbs. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, nor been released on an online-streaming service. =Critical response= Mercy Point has received mixed critical feedback. Prior to the show's premiere, a writer from SouthCoastToday.com wrote that it would appeal to Star Trek fans through its use of \\"portentous dialogue and plenty of gross-out imagery\\". David Bianculli of The New York Daily News praised Mercy Point as an improvement over \\"UPN's watch-me-please gimmick shows\\", and commended the way the show focused on its characters and medical cases while it \\"relegat[ed] the futuristic elements to the background\\". The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Joanne Weintraub favorably compared the show to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, writing that \\"both series take their special effects seriously and their often tongue-in-cheek dialogue lightly\\". Variety's Laura Fries wrote that the series had potential if it adhered to its own rules and focused on real drama. Fries highlighted Michael Katleman's directing as \\"crisp\\" and praised the show's technical credits. Mercy Point also garnered negative reactions from television critics, with GamesRadar's Dave Golder including it on his list of the worst science fiction and fantasy television shows of all time for its \\"[t]rite, obvious and cheesy\\" storylines. The Los Angeles Times' Howard Rosenberg criticized the show's reliance on its science-fiction context and technology to distract the viewers from \\"its mustiness and lack of originality\\". Even though Rosenberg felt the show's concept had potential and found Batung to an intriguing character, he advised the audience to \\"change this bedpan fast\\". Lee Sandlin of The Chicago Reader included Mercy Point in his assessment of the worst television shows in the 1998‚Äì1999 season, criticizing its lack of originality and poor writing. The series was heavily panned by Kevin Wagner of the science-fiction online magazine The Sci-Fi Guys, who found the pilot's story arc to be uninteresting and the use of rubber gloves as a way for advanced containment to be unrealistic. The Sun-Sentinels Hal Boedeker cited Mercy Point and The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer as \\"misbegotten fare\\" that alienated its audience and lowered viewership by forty percent. Several media commentators made negative comparisons between Mercy Point and other television programs. The show was described as reminiscent of a Saturday Night Live skit \\"that sounded brighter on paper than it plays on the air\\" by The Sun-Sentinels Tom Jicha, who felt it served as a spoof of ER. Caryn James of The New York Times wrote that Mercy Point was the \\"oddball new series\\", saying it was not compelling either in a dramatic or campy manner. Editor Jason Snell criticized the show as a retread of Crisis Center and General Hospital, describing it as an \\"utter waste of an intriguing premise\\", and The Chicago Tribune's Steve Johnson called it the \\"ER-in-space mess\\". Both Snell and Johnson encouraged UPN to cancel the series following the announcement of its hiatus.

Established in 1890 by the original San Miguel Brewery (renamed San Miguel Corporation in 1964), it is the largest selling beer in the Philippines and Hong Kong. It is known in Chinese markets as ÁîüÂäõÂï§ÈÖí. San Miguel Beer was introduced in Spain by San Miguel Brewery in 1946. The Spanish rights were spun-off in 1953 by San Miguel Brewery and became an independent entity presently known as the Mahou-San Miguel Group. Varieties ;Branded as \\"San Miguel\\": * San Miguel Pale Pilsen (San Miguel Beer) (5% ABV) * San Miguel Premium All-Malt Beer (5% ABV) * San Miguel Super Dry (5% ABV) * San Miguel Flavored Beer (3% ABV) * Cerveza Negra (San Miguel Dark Beer) (5% ABV) * Red Horse (San Miguel strong beer) (7% ABV) ;Branded as \\"San Mig\\": * San Mig Light (5% ABV) * San Mig Strong Ice (6.3% ABV) * San Mig Zero (0% ABV) San Miguel Beer (Spain) = Background = As part of its overseas expansion, San Miguel moved into the Spanish market in 1953, setting up the company which would later become San Miguel Spain. Since 1946, there has been a company engaged in the production of malt for medicinal purposes known as La Segarra. In the early 1950s, its key shareholders Enrique Su√°rez Rezona, Ram√≥n Vidal and Jaime Mu√±iz made contact with Andr√©s Soriano, then president of San Miguel Brewery, to allow them to produce beer under the San Miguel name in Spain. In 1953, San Miguel Brewery, Inc. signed the ‚ÄúManila Agreement‚Äù, with the Philippine brewer setting up a new Spanish brewery, La Segarra, S.A. The company would later be renamed San Miguel Fabricas de Cerveza y Malta, S.A. in 1957, an affiliate of San Miguel Brewery, Inc. which initially held 20% equity share via its Hong Kong subsidiary. The company was acquired by Mahou, S.A. from Groupe Danone in 2000, combining to form Spain‚Äôs largest brewer, the Mahou-San Miguel Group.http://www.sanmiguel.com.ph/article/san-miguel-brewing- international-ltd-and-mahou-san-miguel-sign-a-cooperation-agreement San Miguel Brewing International Ltd. and Mahou-San Miguel sign a cooperation agreement On 26 February 2014, San Miguel and Mahou-San Miguel signed a co-operation agreement to promote jointly San Miguel Beer and expand its global footprint. = History = The history of San Miguel traces back to 1890, when a group of Spaniards decided to open the first brewery in Southeast Asia, specifically in Manila. The factory produced diverse types of beers and derivative products under the name ‚ÄúSan Miguel‚Äù. In the colonial capital no one knew beer until then. For this reason the inauguration of the brewery was a historic event and became known as ‚ÄúThe day of San Miguel‚Äù. = Expansion to Spain = In February 1946 the corporation La Segarra S.A. was formed in Lleida, Catalonia, with the purpose of making beer, although the bureaucratic process caused production to be delayed until 1953. So, in 1954 the Group returned to Spain in a vessel stocked with Asian yeasts that made a 45-day journey across the ocean. In 1957 the Manila Agreement was signed with the president of San Miguel Brewery, Andr√©s Soriano Sr., and San Miguel, Beers and Malts Factory S.A. was established, independent from the Manila company. From that moment on, the two companies have followed different paths. = Expansion to Africa and Europe = In 1965 San Miguel arrived in Africa, and by 1967 it spread to other capitals in Europe like London, Paris and Berlin. In 1970 it bought the Spanish- Dutch beer brand GULDER and its factory in Burgos. The three factories had a capacity of 600,000 hl, achieving a share of 7% of the national market. Thanks to the progressive opening in Spain and the work of the exports department, the 70s were a time of growth in exports of the beer both in Western and Eastern Europe and Northern Africa, reaching an annual figure of 125,000 hl. = Mahou-San Miguel Group = The formation of the Mahou-San Miguel Group traces its origin to Danone stocks. In 1994 the French multinational acquired 18% of San Miguel, Beers and Malts Factory. In 1997 Danone grew its share to 82% and also owned a large part of Mahou. In the following years, Danone lost interest in the company and therefore the beer maker took advantage of the synergy with Mahou, merging the two and becoming Mahou-San Miguel. Later on it also absorbed the beer maker Alhambra of Granada. The escudo The San Miguel escudo (seal) used as the brand logo of all San Miguel branded beer products is based on the original Spanish-era coat of arms of Manila. It is also the corporate logo of San Miguel Corporation and the San Miguel Brewery companies. The Mahou-San Miguel Group does not use this logo for its San Miguel branded beers. Instead, it uses an image of a galleon as its brand logo. San Miguel Beermen The San Miguel Beermen are a professional basketball team in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). The franchise is owned by the San Miguel Corporation (SMC) since 1975. It is one of three PBA ball clubs owned by the SMC group of companies along with the Magnolia Hotshots and Barangay Ginebra San Miguel. It is the only remaining original franchise in the PBA and leads the league with the most number of PBA titles - 23 to date. It is also the only team ever to have won at least one title in each of the five numerical decades of the PBA's existence so far.

Early life Williams was born in Baltimore, Maryland on March 17, 1948. She started playing the piano at age four, began music lessons with a private teacher at five, and at age seven was enrolled into the Peabody Preparatory. She studied classical music and ear training with Richard Aitken and George Bellows at the Peabody Conservatory of Music. Williams showed an ability to see each note's color as she heard it, consistent with synesthesia. She discussed how this inspired her early interest in the piano in a televised interview with the BBC. Williams also had the ability to play anything she heard. At age twelve she was listening to Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Charles Mingus. She knew she was destined to become a jazz pianist. Williams began performing jazz in her teens, playing with Richie Cole, Buck Hill, and Mickey Fields. In a rare radio interview with Marian McPartland on NPR's Piano Jazz, she states that her main influences were not pianists, but horn players, most notably Miles Davis and John Coltrane.  Musical career  In June 1976, Williams began performing regularly with the \\"Philly Joe\\" Jones band in New Jersey, and with Lex Humphries in Philadelphia and New York City, before moving to the West Coast in October 1976. In 1977, Williams moved to San Francisco, where she played in various house bands at the Keystone Korner. She played in the bands of Eddie Harris, Tony Williams, Stan Getz, Bobby Hutcherson, and Charlie Haden, eventually leading her own jazz trio, and recording prolifically for the next several decades. In 1997, Williams established her own record label, Red and Blue Recordings. She also started her publishing company, JJW Music/ASCAP, and an internet mail order business, jessicawilliams.com. Williams appeared at the 2004 and 2006 \\"Mary Lou Williams Women in Jazz Festivals\\" at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.. She also appeared in festivals and venues worldwide, including The Purcell Room in London, The Bern Jazz Festival, The Monterey Jazz Festival, The New Morning in Paris, Spivey Hall in Georgia, and hundreds of other venues. She was a guest on NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross, and Marian McPartland's acclaimed Piano Jazz Show on NPR, as well as being interviewed by the BBC in Brecon, Wales. In 2012, Williams had a spinal fusion with internal instrumentation at Swedish Hospital's Neurosurgery Unit in Seattle, WA, and subsequently lost her ability to perform. She lives with her husband in the Pacific Northwest, and no longer tours.

He was successful in converting and unifying a large part of the Kutama, leading them to the conquest of Ifriqiya in 902‚Äì909 and the overthrow of the Aghlabid dynasty. This allowed the establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate in Ifriqiya under the imam‚Äìcaliph Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah, but the latter quickly fell out with Abu Abdallah, and had him executed on 28 February 911. Early life Abu Abdallah al-Shi'i was born al-Husayn ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Zakariyya at Kufa in Iraq. Together with his older brother Abu'l-Abbas Muhammad, he joined the Isma'ili missionary network (da øwa) in the city around 891. According to the eastern Arabic sources, they were recruited by none other than Hamdan Qarmat, the leader of the da øwa at Kufa, who soon sent the brothers on mission to Egypt. From there, Abu Abdallah joined the annual Hajj caravans of pilgrims to Mecca, and thence followed the returning Yemeni caravans to Yemen. An active branch of the da øwa had been operating there since 881, under Ibn Hawshab in the west, near Sana'a, and Ali ibn al-Fadl al-Jayshani in the southern part of the country. Abu Abdallah arrived at Yemen in April 892 and joined Ibn Hawshab, but after barely a year, he was ordered to return to Mecca and thence try to establish a new da øwa among the Kutama Berbers in North Africa. Following usual practice, he was to be accompanied by another dƒÅ øƒ´, Abdallah ibn Abi'l-Malahif, but in the end the latter was replaced by Ibrahim ibn Ishaq al- Zabidi. Ibrahim became Abu Abdallah's lieutenant, becoming known as \\"the lesser lord\\" (al-sayyid al-·π£aghƒ´r) among the Kutama, and remained with him until the conquest of Ifriqiya in 909. Mission among the Kutama and conquest of Ifriqiya Map of the fall of the Aghlabid Emirate to the Kutama led by Abu Abdallah At Mecca, Abu Abdallah met some Kutama Berbers that boasted of their independence and autonomy from the Aghlabids. Abu 'Abdullah sensed a chance and decided to follow their invitation to the Maghrib, where he arrived in 280/893. After successfully preaching the Ismaili doctrine among the Kutama, he was able to form a powerful army consisting of Berber peasants. He began conquering the cities of Ifriqiya up to the point where he finally took over ar-Raqqada, the palace city of the Aghlabids near Kairuan, in 909. All this had been done by him to prepare for the appearance of Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah, the imam-caliph of the Fatimids. Al-Mahdi was rescued from a prison in Sijilmasa (present-day Morocco) and proclaimed as caliph, ruling from the former residence of the Aghlabids. Al-Shi'i had hoped that al-Mahdi would be a spiritual leader, and leave the administration of secular affairs to him, his brother al Hasan instigated him to overthrow Imam Al Mahdi Billah but he was unsuccessful. After disclosing the plot against al-Mahdi by the Kutama Berber commander Ghazwiyya, who then assassinated Abu abdallah on February 911.

Chirakkalkulam is located between Thayatheru and Kannur City. Chirakkalkulam's significance arises from the birth of the historic Arakkal Kingdom. Local legend Centuries back Kolathu Nadu (present Kannur district and near places) was ruled by Chirakkal Raja. While bathing in the Chirakkal kulam (pond), the daughter of the then ruler was drowned. Seeing this her friends cried and shouted. They were unable to rescue her. By the same time a Muslim boy walking nearby heard the shouting and went to see what was happening. He saw a girl was drowning in the pond. He knew it was the princess but at first he hesitated to save her because in that time there was untouchability practiced in Kerala. That means if a lower caste person touch a higher caste person it was considered as a sin and some times he may even lose his life. The boy anyway jumped in to the pond and saved her. Seeing that the girl was naked, the boy gave his mundu ‚Äî a long cloth used to cover the lower part of the body. When this news reached the ruler, he called both her daughter and the Muslim boy to him. The boy was so afraid that he thought he will lose his life. As per the custom in that days, if a man gives a \\"pudava\\" (a long cloth used for covering body) to an unmarried woman, it is considered as if he and she got married. The elders and religious people advised the ruler that, two thing happened here, one is that the king's daughter was touched by a Muslim the second thing was a boy gave pudava to his daughter (by giving boys mundu to the girl), meaning that the daughter cannot enter the palace anymore and also she got married by the Muslim boy. As per the custom the ruler had no other choice but give her daughter to the Muslim boy. The Raja was unhappy to give his daughter to a poor family, so he gave the boy some part of his country, and made him the ruler of that part. The area which was given to the boy was then onwards known as Arakkal and his family, Arakkal family. The ruler's daughter was known as the Arakkal Beebi.

History  = Qing dynasty = \\"Ruined Chinese gates in Suidun\\" (1882) Suiding () was built in 1762 during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor after the Revolt of the Altishahr Khojas was pacified. From 1762 to 1765 Suiding was the seat of the Governor General of Xinjiang, the General of Ili. In 1765 the General of Ili moved to the larger fortress of Huiyuan (). Huiyuan suffered severe damage during the Dungan Revolt of 1862‚Äì77 when the besieged General of Ili, Mingsioi, blew himself up in his palace rather than surrender to the rebels, and during the Russian occupation that followed between 1871-81. The Russians left pursuant to the 1881 Treaty of Saint Petersburg. From 1882 to 1894 the General of Ili resided at Suiding, while a new Huiyuan fortress was being rebuilt. In 1888 Suiding County (now Huocheng County and Khorgas) was established. Suiding was the county seat. The town's name was commonly transcribed in the West as Suidun. The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica described \\"Suidun\\" as \\"a military town, with provision stores, an arsenal and an arms workshop. Its walls are armed with steel guns.\\" Unlike the city of Yining, originally known as Ningyuan (), which has always remained the commercial center of the region, the 19th century Huiyuan/Suiding was mostly a fortress and an administrative town. It was known to the Russians as the New Kuldja, Chinese Kuldja, or Manchu Kuldja, to distinguish it from Yining (the Old Kuldja or the Taranchi Kuldja). This usage is no longer current. = People's Republic = With the creation of the Ili Prefecture () in 1950, the then existing Suiding County was included into the Area, as was the neighboring Huocheng County; in 1955, the Ili Special Area became Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. In 1965, the name Suiding () was replaced with more politically correct Shuiding (), with 'shui' ('water') replacing 'sui' (\\"to pacify\\"). The next year (1966), Shuiding County was merged into Huocheng County, and the Huocheng County county seat was transferred to Shuiding town.

He was a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada representing Shefford from 1867 to 1882. He also served as President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Postmaster General. He was born in Compton, Lower Canada in 1827. The families of his parents had come to the Eastern Townships from New England. He studied law with John Sewell Sanborn and was called to the bar in 1853. There was a surplus of lawyers at the time, so he became a merchant to provide himself with additional income. He also established a newspaper in Knowlton, later moving it to Waterloo after he was hired as secretary for a railroad company based there. He ran for the Shefford seat in the Legislative Assembly in 1860, but the election was not settled before parliament was dissolved; he was elected in the election that followed in 1861. In 1863, he was appointed solicitor general for Canada East. During the American Civil War, he profited from his ownership of a copper mine; later, the market in copper collapsed and so did Huntington's profits. In 1873, he exposed the Pacific Scandal which led to the fall of Sir John A. Macdonald's Conservatives. He then became part of a syndicate formed to continue construction of the railway. He intended to resign from his government post to enter this business venture, but was persuaded to remain in office when the Conservatives alleged wrongdoing in his sale of his interests in copper mines, since his resignation might be interpreted as a sign of guilt. In 1875, Huntington was heavily criticized for a speech where he advised English Protestants in Quebec to vote Liberal to protect their own interests versus those of French Catholics. He fell ill later in his parliamentary career and, after his defeat in 1882, moved to New York City to seek medical treatment. He died in New York in 1886.

The name is a pun on the TV and film term plot point. Description In most commercial RPGs, plot points represent the heroic quality of player characters, which separates them from other people in the game world, and as such are spent to increase a character's chance of success in combat or other actions. Examples include Fate points in FATE (also RPGs based on the FATE system), Edge in MechWarrior, Fortune dice in Feng Shui or Force points in the Star Wars role-playing games from West End Games (Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game) and Wizards of the Coast (the Star Wars Roleplaying Game). In some RPGs, mostly indie RPGs, plot points are rather a way of involving the player in the story. They can be spent to introduce something into the game, or to add a previously-unrevealed fact about a character. Examples include story tokens in Capes, the seven types of Narrative privileges (Privil√®ges narratifs) in the 2nd edition of The Last Chronicles of Erdor (Les Chroniques d'Erdor, in French) or backgrounds in Dogs in the Vineyard. In Steve Jackson Games's role-playing game Toon, plot points are used as experience points, awarded for completing in-game objectives and used to increase a player character's statistics. The first role-playing game to incorporate plot points was Top Secret by TSR, Inc. which gave each character between 1-10 luck points. Each luck point allowed a player to reverse the consequences of a single roll. Character creation in the Serenity Role Playing Game (2005) is point-based and players can use plot points to influence die rolls; this use of plot points has become standard for games based on dramatic licenses. In the Cortex System, players are encouraged to roleplay their disadvantages during play and are rewarded with plot points for doing so; though most of Cortex is a traditional RPG system, the interrelation of plot points and complications was a trend toward the indie side of game design. In the Smallville Roleplaying Game, plot points have become a central resource; they're not only available through the use of complications but they are also usable to power superpowers, meaning that PCs build up problems, then solve them when super powers come out, much like the TV show. Leverage: The Roleplaying Game also featured a plot-point economy, built on distinctions.

It ended with decisive Song victory. The Song used gunpowder weapons in their victory. Soldiers under the command of Wanyan Liang, the Jurchen emperor of the Jin dynasty, tried to cross the Yangzi River to attack the Southern Song dynasty. Chen Kangbo (ÈôàÂ∫∑‰ºØ), prime minister of the Song dynasty, was chief military strategist and commanded the navy. Yu Yunwen, a civil official, commanded the defending Song army. The paddle-wheel warships of the Song fleet, equipped with trebuchets that launched incendiary bombs made of gunpowder and lime, decisively defeated the light ships of the Jin navy.  Overview  Starting in 1125 the Jin had conquered former Song territories north of the Huai River. In 1142, a peace treaty settled the border between the two states, putting the Jin in control of northern China and the Song in control of the south. In 1150, Wanyan Liang became emperor and planned to unite northern and southern China under a single emperor. In 1158, he asserted that the Song had violated the 1142 treaty, a pretext for declaring war on the Song. He prepared for the war in the following year. He instituted a draft where all able-bodied men were required to enlist. The draft was unpopular, precipitating revolts that were later suppressed. The Jin army left the capital of Kaifeng on 1161 October 15 1161, and pushed through from the Huai to the Yangzi. The Song were fortified along the Yangzi front. Wanyan Liang planned to cross the river at Caishi, south of modern-day Nanjing. He embarked from the shore of the Yangzi on November 26, and clashed with Song forces led by Yu Yunwen and Chen Kangbo in a naval engagement. Wanyan Liang lost the battle and retreated to Yangzhou. Wanyan Liang was assassinated in a military camp by his own soldiers shortly after the Caishi battle. A military coup had taken place in the Jin court while Wanyan Liang was absent, enthroning Emperor Shizong as the new emperor. A peace treaty signed in 1165 ended the conflict between Song and Jin. At Caishi, the Song led an army of 18,000, whereas Wanyan Liang reportedly led an army of 600,000 Jin soldiers. Over the course of the battle, many Jin soldiers deserted‚Äìbringing down the total Jin force‚Äìas they realized their northern steppe cavalry was inadequate for naval battles on rivers and lakes. The Song won mainly through its superior navy, gunpowder, and firearms. The victory boosted the morale of the Song infantry and pushed back the southern advance of the Jin army.„ÄäÂÆãÂè≤„ÄãHistory of the Song dynasty Background = Jin-Liao- Song = Song (orange), Jin (gray), Xi Xia (aqua), Xi Liao (light green) were the major empires of China at the time, with Song and Jin occupying China's east The Song (960‚Äì1276) was a Han-led dynasty that ruled over Southeast China. To their north was the Jin dynasty, a Jurchen-Han mixed dynasty that ruled over Northeast China. The Jin were led by the Jurchens, a confederation of semi-agrarian tribes from Manchuria in northeast China. But many northern Han nobles were also part of the Jin. The Liao were a Khitan-led dynasty covering parts of Mongolia, West China, and Central Asia. Like the Jin, the Liao also adopted Han culture, spoke Chinese, and practiced Buddhism. The Song and Jin had once been military allies. However in 1114, the Jurchen, unified under the rule of Wanyan Aguda, plotted a revolt against their former overlords: the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. In 1115, Aguda established the Jin dynasty and adopted the title of emperor. The Jin negotiated a joint attack with the Song against the Khitans. They planned the attack for 1121 and then rescheduled to 1122. In 1122, the Jin captured the Khitan Supreme and Western Capitals. The Song tried to capture the Liao Southern Capital of Yan (modern Beijing), but it fell later that year to the Jin. Negotiations between the Song and Jin produced a treaty in 1123, but bilateral relations deteriorated because of territorial disputes over the Sixteen Prefectures. In 1125, the Jin invaded the Song. = Start of Jin-Song wars = By 1127, Jin had unified most of northern China and besieged the Song capital of Kaifeng twice. In the second siege of Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong of the Song was captured. The Jin took him and the Song royal family to Northeast China as hostages. Members of the Song court who had evaded capture fled south, where they established a temporary capital, first in the Song southern capital (modern Shangqiu), and then in Hangzhou in 1129. The move of the Song capital south to Hangzhou signaled the transition from the Northern Song era to the Southern Song. Qinzong's younger brother, Prince Zhao Gou, was enthroned as Qinzong's successor in the southern capital in 1127. Zhao is known posthumously as Emperor Song Gaozong. The Jin general Wuzhu crossed the Yangzi River in 1130 and tried to capture Gaozong, but the Emperor escaped. Wuzhu retreated north across the Yangzi, where he fought off a stronger Song fleet commanded by Han Shizhong. The Jin persisted with their advance into the remaining Song territories south of the Yangzi. They faced an insurgency of Song loyalists in the north, the deaths of some important leaders, and military offensives by Song generals like Yue Fei. The Jin created the puppet government of (Â§ßÈΩä) to serve as a buffer state between Song and Jin, but Qi failed to defeat the Song. The Jin abolished Qi in 1137. As the Jin gave up advancing south, diplomatic talks for a peace treaty resumed. Signed in 1142, the Treaty of Shaoxing established the boundary between the two states along the Huai River, which runs north of the Yangzi. The treaty forbade the Song from purchasing horses from the Jin, but smuggling continued in the border markets. The relations between the two states were mostly peaceful from 1142 to 1161, the year Wanyan Liang went to war. =Jin preparations for Caishi= alt=Jurchen warrior standing, carrying a bow Wanyan Liang was crowned Jin emperor in 1150 after killing his cousin and predecessor, Emperor Xizong, in a palace coup. Wanyan Liang considered himself more of a Han authoritarian emperor than a Jurchen leader who ruled through a tribal council. The History of Jin contends that Wanyan Liang told his officials that the three desires of his life were conquest, absolute power, and women. His ultimate ambition was to rule over all of China, not just the north. In his childhood, Wanyan Liang adopted Song practices like drinking tea by learning from Song emissaries, and once he had become emperor, he pursued a policy of sinicizing (Ê±âÂåñ) the state. His affinity for Song culture earned him the Jurchen nickname of 'Han imitator'. He moved the Supreme Capital of the Jin from Huining in the northeast to Beijing and promoted Kaifeng to his Southern Capital in 1157. He also moved government institutions south, tore down palaces of Jurchen chieftains in Manchuria, and constructed new palaces in Beijing and Kaifeng. He made plans to move the Jin capital further south to the center of China. Wanyan Liang's construction projects drained the Jin treasury. Plans for a war against the Southern Song began in 1158. That year, Wanyan Liang claimed that the Song had broken the 1142 treaty that banned them from acquiring horses. In 1159, he began building up his army in preparation for an invasion. He acquired weapons, which he stored in Beijing, as well as horses allegedly numbering 560,000. Wanyan Liang understood that an invasion of the Song would require a lot of men. He ensured that Han soldiers were drafted into the war effort alongside Jurchen soldiers. The recruitment drive lasted until 1161. Naval confrontations were likely because the Jin planned on traveling by river. Ships were seized for the war and 30,000 of the recruits were assigned to the Jin fleet. Wanyan Liang authorized the building of ships for the war in March 1159, under the auspices of the Ministry of War. Construction began in the Tong () prefecture near Beijing. Wanyan Liang appointed himself head of the army and took personal command of the Jin forces. The draft was unpopular. Several revolts erupted against it, many of them in the Jin provinces neighboring the Song. But Wanyan Liang allowed no dissent. He had his stepmother executed after hearing that she was critical of the war effort. In order to eliminate any challenge to his legitimacy as emperor of a united China, Wanyan Liang ordered the execution of all male members of the Song and Liao royal families residing in Jin territory. The execution of 130 members of the two royal clans in the span of a few months proved unpopular, and the Khitans soon revolted in Northeast China. They refused to be drafted into the army, maintaining that conscription would leave their homeland unprotected from rival tribes on the steppes. Wanyan Liang rebuffed their demands. The Khitan rebels then killed several Jurchen officials. The rebellion was fragmented, and there were separate plans either to spread the revolt further by operating from Shangjing, the former Liao capital, or to move the Khitan people from Northeast China to Central Asia, where the Western Liao empire had formed after the demise of Liao. Regardless, Wanyan Liang was forced to divert resources and men away from the war effort to suppress the rebellion. = Song preparations for Caishi = Diplomatic exchanges between the Song and Jin did not stop during the period preceding the war. The History of Song claims that the Song realized that the Jin were planning for an invasion when they noticed the discourtesy of one of the Jin diplomats. Some Song officials foresaw the impending war, but Emperor Gaozong hoped to maintain peaceful relations with the Jin. His reluctance to antagonize the Jin delayed the fortification of the Song border defenses. The Song quickly built just three military garrisons in 1161. Wanyan Liang departed from Kaifeng on 1161 October 15. The offensive comprised four armies, and Wanyan Liang personally led the army that entered Anhui. The Jin passed the Huai River boundary on October 28, advancing into Song territory. The Song resistance was minimal because they had fortified the southern shore of the Yangzi River and not the Huai. Chen Kangbo (ÈôàÂ∫∑‰ºØ), prime minister (ÂÆ∞Áõ∏) of the Song dynasty, commanded the Song navy and designed the anti-Jin offensive strategy. Yu Yunwen, a civil official, commanded the defending Song army. The paddle-wheel warships of the Song fleet, equipped with trebuchets that launched incendiary bombs made of gunpowder and lime, decisively defeated the light ships of the Jin navy. Naval battle of Caishi Wanyan Liang's army built its encampment near Yangzhou on the northern side of the Yangzi River. The Jin advance had been slowed by Song victories in the west, where the Song captured several prefectures from the Jin. Wanyan Liang commanded his forces to cross the Yangzi at Caishi, south of modern Nanjing. A naval battle between Jin and Song took place on November 26 and 27, 1161. The Song strategy was planned by Chen Kangbo (ÈôàÂ∫∑‰ºØ), prime minister and naval leader of the Song dynasty. Chen led a naval regiment of his own, dispatching general Yu Yunwen (a scholar-official), his lieutenants Dai Gao, Jian Kang, Shi Zhun, and others to lead the rest of the army. Yu, who was a Drafting Official of the Secretariat (), was at Caishi to distribute awards to Song soldiers who had been selected for their outstanding service. It was by chance that his visit coincided with Wanyan Liang's campaign. When Yu first arrived, there were various scattered Song forces at Caishi, so Yu took command and built a cohesive unit. The Jin performed a ritual sacrifice of horses a day before the battle (animal sacrifice). On November 26, Jin troops embarked from the shore of the Yangzi and engaged the Song fleet. Some of the ships they boarded were shoddily built. The Jin had lost several ships in Liangshan, where they were bogged down by the shallow depths of Liangshan Lake as they were being transported to the Grand Canal. Wanyan Liang had urgently requested the construction of more ships in 1161 to compensate for those still stuck in Liangshan. One account of the war contends that the Jin ships were constructed in a week with materials recycled from destroyed buildings. The shortage of vessels and the poor quality of those available prevented the Jin from ferrying more soldiers needed for fighting a naval battle with the Song. The Song military response was stronger than Wanyan Liang had anticipated. The paddle-wheel ships of the Song navy could move more rapidly and outmaneuver the slower Jin ships. The Song kept their fleet hidden behind the island of Qibao Shan. The ships were to depart the island once a scout on horseback announced the approach of the Jin ships by signaling a concealed flag atop the island's peak. Once the flag became visible, the Song fleet commenced their attack from both sides of the island. Song soldiers operated traction trebuchets that launched incendiary \\"thunderclap bombs\\" and other soft-cased explosives containing lime and sulphur, which created a noxious explosion when the casing broke. The Jin soldiers who managed to cross the river and reach the shore were assaulted by Song troops waiting on the other side. The Song won a decisive victory. Wanyan Liang was defeated again in a second engagement the next day. After burning his remaining ships, he retreated to Yangzhou, where he was assassinated before he could finish preparations for another crossing. Another account tells of General Chen Lugong (Chen Kangbo)„ÄåÈôàÈ≤ÅÂÖ¨ÔºàÈôàÂ∫∑‰ºØÔºâÈááÁü≥„Äçand how he also led naval regiments to defeat the Jin and defend the Song.ÔºªÂçóÂÆãÔºΩÁΩóÂ§ßÁªè Êí∞ÔºåÁéãÁëûÊù• ÁÇπÊ†°Ôºö„ÄäÈπ§ÊûóÁéâÈú≤„Äã„ÄäÊú±Â≠êËØ≠Á±ª„Äã  Casualties  Estimates for the number of soldiers and casualties at the battle vary widely. A Song source reports that there were 18,000 Song soldiers stationed in Caishi. One document claims that 400,000-600,000 Jin soldiers were present at the battle. Herbert Franke argues that the Song had only 120,000 soldiers fighting on the entire front and that the half million figure could have referred to the number of soldiers that the Jin army had before crossing the Huai River toward the Yangzi. The desertions and casualties from suppressing revolts while advancing southward would have shrunk that number by the time the Jin reached the Yangzi. The History of Jin, a document written from the perspective of the Jin, reports Jin casualties between one meng'an (ÁåõÊåâ Jurchen unit of a thousand soldiers) and a hundred men, and two meng'an and two hundred men. The History of Song reports Jin casualties numbering four thousand soldiers and two commanders of wanhu (‰∏áÊà∑ ten thousand men) rank. An account of the battle by a different Song source holds that 24,000 Jin soldiers died and that 500 combatants and five meng-an were taken as prisoners. A more conservative Song source estimates that the Jin only had 500 soldiers and 20 ships at Caishi. Military and naval technology The pili huoqiu incendiary bombs at Caishi contained mixtures of lime and gunpowder. This huoqiu is from the earlier Wujing Zongyao (1044). An account of the Song's technological capabilities is given in the Hai Qiu Fu („ÄäÊµ∑È≥ÖËµã„Äã\\"Rhapsodic Ode on the Sea Eel Paddle Wheel Warships\\"):„ÄäÊµ∑È≥ÖËµã„Äã > The men inside them paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided > forwards as though they were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The > enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a > thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled > with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs > came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a > noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case > rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded > the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then > went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so > that they were utterly defeated. There were up to 340 ships in the Song fleet during the battle of Caishi in 1161. The Song fleet used trebuchets to bombard the Jin ships with incendiary bombs (pili huoqiu or huopao ; \\"thunderclap fire balls\\") that contained a mixture of gunpowder, lime, scraps of iron, and a poison that was likely arsenic. Reports that the bomb produced a loud sound suggests that the nitrate content of the gunpowder mixture was high enough to create an explosion. The powdered lime in the bombs at Caishi generated a cloud of blinding smoke similar to tear gas. The huoqiu released the smoke once the casing of the bomb shattered. Fuses activated the bombs after launching. The Jin conscripted thousands of blacksmiths to build the armor and weaponry of the fleet, and workers to dig out the canal necessary for transporting the ships from Tong to the Grand Canal through the northern port of Zhigu (), modern Tianjin. The Jin armored their light ships with thick rhinoceros hides. The ships had two stories; on the lower deck were the oarsmen responsible for rowing the ship, while soldiers on the upper deck could fire missile weapons. Three different variations of the warships were constructed. Several of the ships became bogged down in Liangshan, and the ships built to replace them were of an inferior quality. The Jin fleet were unable to defeat the larger and faster warships of the Song. The battle is significant in the technological history of the Song navy. The technological advances of the Song navy ensured its access to the East China Sea, where they competed with the military forces of Jin and Mongol rivals. Although huopao launched by the ship-mounted trebuchets had been invented decades earlier, the bombs did not become mandatory on Song warships until 1129. Paddle-wheel ships operated with treadmills were constructed continuously in various sizes between 1132 and 1183. The engineer Gao Xuan devised a ship outfitted with up to eleven paddle wheels on each side, and Qin Shifu, another engineer, designed the iron plating for armoring the ships in 1203. All these advances supported a rapid increase in the size of the force; according to Joseph Needham, \\"From a total of 11 squadrons and 3,000 men [the Song navy] rose in one century to 20 squadrons totalling 52,000 men\\". Aftermath alt=Emperor Gaozong's portrait Traditional Chinese historiography celebrated the battle of Caishi as an important victory for the Song. Caishi was held in the same esteem as the Battle of Fei River in 383, when the Eastern Jin defeated the northern invaders of the Former Qin. It is portrayed as a victory against overwhelming odds, in which 18,000 Song soldiers overcame an army of nearly half a million men. Over the course of the battle, more and more Jin troops deserted in the face of the superior Song navy, thereby decreasing the total Jin force. The Song possessed multiple advantages. The Song had larger ships and ample time to prepare while the Jin army gathered supplies and ships for the crossing. It was also impossible for the Jin to use cavalry, the most important asset of the Jurchen military, during a naval engagement. The battle was not solely responsible for devastating Wanyan Liang's military campaign. His own failings also led to his downfall. Wanyan Liang's generals detested him, and his relationship with his men had deteriorated over the course of the war as the Jin were losing. There was a widespread disapproval of his reign in the empire, and Wanyan Liang's policies had alienated Jurchens, Khitans, and Han alike. Disaffected officers conspired to kill him, and he was assassinated on 1161 December 15. Emperor Shizong succeeded Wanyan Liang as ruler of the Jin. He had been enthroned weeks before the assassination, in a military coup that installed him as emperor while Wanyan Liang was absent from the court. Shizong eventually rescinded many of Wanyan Liang's policies. The victory boosted the morale of the Song soldiers, improving confidence in the government and bolstering Song stability. The Jin gave up their ambitions of pushing South and reunifying China. The Jin army withdrew in 1162, and diplomatic relations between the two states resumed. Song Gaozong retired nine months after the conclusion of the battle. The reasons for his abdication are complicated, but Gaozong's handling of the war with Wanyan Liang may have had a part in his decision to resign. He had ignored the warnings of a Jin attack, and his hopes for conciliation held back plans for strengthening the Song defenses. Military clashes continued in Huainan and Sichuan, but Jin incursions after Caishi had no intent of reaching the Yangzi. The Jin had discovered that southern China's many lakes and rivers impeded their cavalry. After losing the battle, they signed a peace treaty with the Song in 1165, ending hostilities. The Huai River border remained the same.

Specified in RFC 5775, it is an IETF proposed standard. The protocol is specifically designed to provide massive scalability using IP multicast as the underlying network service. Massive scalability in this context means the number of concurrent receivers for an object is potentially in the millions, the aggregate size of objects to be delivered in a session ranges from hundreds of kilobytes to hundreds of gigabytes, each receiver can initiate reception of an object asynchronously, the reception rate of each receiver in the session is the maximum fair bandwidth available between that receiver and the sender, and all of this can be supported using a single sender. Because ALC is focused on reliable content delivery, the goal is to deliver objects as quickly as possible to each receiver while at the same time remaining network friendly to competing traffic. Thus, the congestion control used in conjunction with ALC should strive to maximize use of available bandwidth between receivers and the sender while at the same time backing off aggressively in the face of competing traffic. The sender side of ALC consists of generating packets based on objects to be delivered within the session and sending the appropriately formatted packets at the appropriate rates to the channels associated with the session. The receiver side of ALC consists of joining appropriate channels associated with the session, performing congestion control by adjusting the set of joined channels associated with the session in response to detected congestion, and using the packets to reliably reconstruct objects. All information flow in an ALC session is in the form of data packets sent by a single sender to channels that receivers join to receive data. ALC does specify the Session Description needed by receivers before they join a session, but the mechanisms by which receivers obtain this required information is outside the scope of ALC. An application that uses ALC may require that receivers report statistics on their reception experience back to the sender, but the mechanisms by which receivers report back statistics is outside the scope of ALC. In general, ALC is designed to be a minimal protocol instantiation that provides reliable content delivery without unnecessary limitations to the scalability of the basic protocol.

Summary  The Fundamental Law of Education, as the name suggests, is a law concerning the foundation of Japanese education. Because it acts as the basis for the interpretation and application of various laws & ordinances regarding education, it is also known as https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1301.0~2012~Main%20Features~Government%20responsibilities%20in%20education~103and https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ja/university/information/charter/education-j/. MEXT translations into English entitle it the Basic Act on Education. The Fundamental Law of Education contains a preamble and 18 Articles. The law sets out the purposes and objectives of education and provides for equal opportunity in education, compulsory education, coeducation, social education, political education, religious education, educational administration, etc. According to the law, the purpose of education is . Article 1 states that the law :shall aim for the full development of personality and strive to nurture the citizens, sound in mind and body, who are imbued with the qualities necessary for those who form a peaceful and democratic state and society. The current Fundamental law was enacted on December 22, 2006, replacing the previous 11-article Act of March 31, 1947 (the 'old fundamental law of Education'). Original 1947 enactment The old law was created under the auspices of SCAP, enacted by the 90th session of the Imperial Japanese Diet, which would be the last Imperial Diet conducted under the Imperial Japanese Constitution. It is often said that the old Fundamental Law of Education was written in the spirit of the new Japanese Constitution, representing a radical means of education reform, and replacing the pre-World War II Imperial Rescript on Education, which was based on Imperialist and Confucianist thought. During the debate about constitutional reform, it was argued that provisions regarding education should be included in the national constitution itself. However, the Minister of Education at that time, K≈çtar≈ç Tanaka, proposed the creation of a separate law regarding education. The Ministry of Education then created an Educational Reform Committee, which deliberated over the contents of the Fundamental Law. The law was approved by the Imperial Diet as was written in the original draft, without revision.

Some suggested that ideas of patriotism and regard for Japanese traditions were lacking, and others maintained that such provisions could lead to renewed feelings of nationalism and subservience to the state. Such arguments have been brought up repeatedly since the law was first passed. On April 28, 2006, the Cabinet drafted a reformed version of the law which was submitted to the 164th ordinary session of the National Diet (sitting from January to June 2006). The draft is composed of a preamble and 18 articles. The new preamble does not include the phrase \\"the realization of the ideals laid forth in the constitution depend on the education of the people\\", as is stated in the current law, and includes some additions, such as the phrases \\"community spirit\\" and \\"the inheritance of tradition\\". In addition, the \\"purpose of education\\" has been divided into five items, containing such moral provisions as \\"to nurture an attitude[...]to love our country and our home\\". On May 2, 2006, the Ministry of Education announced that they had established a \\"Fundamental Law of Education Reform Promotion Headquarters\\" under the direction of Kenji Kosaka, the Minister of Education. The first meeting was scheduled for May 8, and a project team was established. The objective of this group is not only to regulate argument in the Diet, but also to assist in initiatives to explain the educational reforms to the public and decide on basic programs promoting education. On December 22, 2006 the complete revision of the Fundamental Law of Education passed and was implemented. It now contains 18 Articles. = Main points of contention = Opinion was divided on whether students should receive education \\"according to individual ability\\" or \\"equally\\". The new Law does not contain the word \\"equally\\" any longer. There was also debate about whether the absolution of school fees at public universities should be limited only to tuition costs, or should also include textbook fees, food costs, commutation costs, etc. There was debate concerning the topic of political neutrality, namely, what kind of political education should be forbidden, and how to harmonize this with the promotion of political interest amongst students. In 1954, the Japanese government, aiming to curb political activity by the Japan Teachers Union, passed a law designed to ensure \\"political neutrality\\" in Japanese public schools. In 2004, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi refused to accept a petition‚Äîwritten by Japanese high school students‚Äîagainst the deployment of the Japan Self-Defense Forces to Iraq , said to be due to the prohibition on political education. = Political Debate = On March 20, 2003, based on the discussions of the People's Educational Reform Council (a consultative body to the Prime Minister dissolved in Dec. 2000), the Central Education Council reported to Minister of Education Atsuko Toyama on the necessity of reform to the Fundamental Law. According to the report, the concepts expressed in the Fundamental Law should continue to be valued; however, in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century, the following reforms would be necessary. #the establishment of a trustworthy schooling system #promotion of university reform, to become leaders in the information age #to restore the educational ability of the family, and to promote a society in which the school, family, and local community cooperate #to foster attitudes to take part in community planning #to foster respect for Japanese traditions and culture, to encourage love for the homeland, and promote the spirit of membership in the international community #the realization of a society based on lifelong learning #to decide on a master plan to encourage education In April 2004, the ruling Liberal Democratic and Komei Parties reached an agreement on the meaning of the term \\"patriotism\\" (\\"to value customs and culture, and to love our country, from which they have developed\\") and submitted a reform proposal to the Diet, the first such proposal to be submitted to the Diet since the end of World War II. The proposed reforms reflect three influential lines of thinking. #Educational reform is necessary to nurture an educational elite and in order for Japan to continue to be a leader in developing cutting-edge technology. #Problem children responsible for the disintegration of Japanese society (including such problems as youth crime, bullying and truancy) can be dealt with through home discipline, the strengthening of moral education, and community service. #The expansion of the Ministry of Education's realm of authority is critical. The reformed law would give the Ministry of Education a virtually free hand with regards to educational administration.  Moral education  The extent and nature of moral education is a frequent point of debate in government and academia. The old Fundamental law did not contain provisions regarding moral education, although moral education features in the curriculum overseen by the Ministry of Education. Along with other provisions in order to \\"broaden\\" the scope of the law, there were added provisions regarding moral education. For example, the objective in Article 2(5) is designed to satisfy both conservative views on patriotism and progressive views on global integration and/or focus on individualism.

It was from this early colony that New Utrecht High School received its name. The school was established in 1915 as an offshoot of Bay Ridge High School, which up to that time had been coeducational. With the creation of New Utrecht High School, Bay Ridge became a school for girls only, while New Utrecht was an all-boys school. The first home of the school, which had a population of 350 boys, was a wooden building on 86th Street near 18th Avenue. Irving Hazen was its first principal, and the school colors, green and white, were selected as a compliment to Hazen's alma mater, Dartmouth College. Although the first graduating class had only sixteen boys, the growth in student population was rapid. In November 1924, the present building on 80th Street and 16th Avenue was opened, with a student body of about 2,300 and in February of the next year girls were admitted for the first time. Since then, three girls have been elected to the presidency of the student government. In the next few years, the school continued to grow, until it consisted of a main building and four annexes, comprising a total of nearly 11,000 boys and girls. This was the largest student body in the world. Activities =Student Government= New Utrecht has an active student government, which is elected every October. For close to a century the student government positions were mayor, deputy mayor, secretary, treasurer, and student representatives from each grade. The mayoral theme was a longstanding tradition that stemmed from the fact that New Utrecht (the neighborhood) was named by Dutch settlers after the city of Utrecht in the Netherlands. In 2015, the student government decided to change the name of the two major positions of mayor and deputy mayor to student body president and student body vice president. The New Utrecht High School Student Government is responsible for allocating funds to clubs, as well as organizing a School Spirit Week, a Thanksgiving Dinner, a Toy Drive, and other annual school-wide events. There is also a Senior Council composed of a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. The Senior Council is responsible for organizing Senior events, such as the Senior Class Brunch and Senior Trip, creating the Senior Class sweatshirts, voicing concerns of the Senior Class to the administration, and keeping the Senior Class informed. =School Leadership Team= The School Leadership Team (SLT) consists of representatives from the school administration, parents, teachers and students. The students are usually two active students, one junior and one senior, who voice the concerns of the student body. The SLT meets monthly to discuss and work on issues related to implementation of the school's mission and vision. A P.T.A. meeting follows immediately after. =Productions at New Utrecht High School= There are four productions held annually at New Utrecht: the Talent Show, the Chinese New Year Show, the Fashion Show, and the International Show. The Talent Show is open to anyone who has talent, whether it be singing, dancing, magic, comedy or any other form of entertainment. The sound crew, lighting crew, stage crew, construction crew and booklet crew are composed entirely of students. The show is usually held in December. The Chinese New Year Show is put on near the Chinese New Year. It has singing, dancing, acting and other forms of entertainment, revolving around Chinese culture. The Chinese Club at New Utrecht has a partnership with a non-profit organization called the Chinese-American Planning Council. The Fashion Show production at New Utrecht High School is student run and consists of students in the New Utrecht Fashion Society creating their own clothes and having their friends model them. The show is usually held in March or April. The International Show is held in April or May and, like the others, is completely student run. It is similar to the Talent Show but focuses on other countries around the world. =Clubs= New Utrecht offers clubs for students, including: * Student Organization * Arista Society * Art Club * Asian Club * Chinese Chess/Gaming Club * Chinese Debate Club * Chess & Game Club * Creative Problem Solving Club * Dance Club * Disc Jockey (DJ) Club * Glee Club * History Club * LGBTQ+ Student Association * Photography Club * Robotics Club * Sound Club (Audio/Visual) * Stock/Investigating Club Advanced Placement New Utrecht offers Advanced Placement courses, including: * AP Calculus AB * AP Calculus BC * AP World History/Human Geography * AP United States History * AP United States Government and Politics * AP Comparative Government and Politics * AP Micro-Economics * AP Macro-Economics * AP English Language and Composition * AP English Literature and Composition * AP Chemistry * AP Physics * AP Biology * AP Psychology * AP Computer Science A Academies There are several academies (programs that offer employment-oriented training in specialized fields) at New Utrecht, which include: * Academy of Business of Technology * Academy of Medical Professions and Health Careers * Academy of Legal Studies * Academy of Hospitality and Tourism * Academy of Art and Design * Honors Academy Some academies are associated with NAF, a non-profit organization originally known as the National Academy Foundation.

It is usually the last stage in metal production and is therefore preceded by pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical operations. The electrolysis can be done on a molten metal oxide (smelt electrolysis) which is used for example to produce aluminium from aluminium oxide via the Hall-H√©rault process. Electrolysis can be used as a final refining stage in pyrometallurgical metal production (electrorefining) and it is also used for reduction of a metal from an aqueous metal salt solution produced by hydrometallurgy (electrowinning).  Processes  Electrometallurgy is the field concerned with the processes of metal electrodeposition There are four categories of these processes: *Electrowinning, the extraction of metal from ores *Electrorefining, the purification of metals. Metal powder production by electrodeposition is included in this category, or sometimes electrowinning, or a separate category depending on application. *Electroplating, the deposition of a layer of one metal on another *Electroforming, the manufacture of, usually thin, metal parts through electroplating See also *Electropolishing, the removal of material from a metallic workpiece References Chemical processes Electrolysis Metallurgical processes ","title":"Electrometallurgy"},{"id":"4001521","text":"Atreyee D.

The similar Medici Vase retains its handles springing up from the heads. it stands on a spreading fluted stem with a cabled motif round its base, on a low octagonal plinth. The frieze depicts the thiasus, an ecstatic Bacchanalian procession accompanying Dionysus, draped with the panther skin and playing the aulos, and Ariadne. However, the accompanying figures often said to be satyrs have neither the common characteristics of cloven feet nor equine tails flowing to the floor as typically shown on Greek pottery; some references identify to the figures as sileni. The draped figures are often said to be Maenads but are clearly not: Maenads are females who accompany Dionysus but on the vase a draped male figure is depicted. One of the figures is shown being anointed, typically a symbolic act of divinity, leading to the interpretation of some of the figures as Apollo and Dionysus rescuing Silenus who is shown falling down reaching for a spilled flagon of wine. This scene on the vase corresponds to the saying \\"The Gods look after children and drunken men\\" which has been passed down orally through many generations. Many copies of the vase do not correctly depict the scene, replacing Dionysus with a female figure on the wrongful assumption that a sexual act is in progress. =Rediscovery= Vase in Borghese style at the gardens of Versailles The vase was rediscovered in a Roman garden that occupied part of the site of the gardens of SallustIn the garden of Carlo Muti, where it was found together with the Silenus with the Infant Bacchus, according to notes compiled by Flaminio Vacca in 1594, noted by Haskell and Penny. in 1566 and acquired by the Borghese family. Napoleon bought it from his brother-in-law Camillo Borghese in 1808, and it has been displayed in the Louvre since 1811. In his Capriccio, Hubert Robert embellished and enlarged the Borghese Vase for dramatic effect and set it, in atmospherically ruinous condition, on the Aventine overlooking the Colosseum, a position it never occupied. Robert also painted it in several other settings, including the gardens of Versailles (L'entr√©e du Tapis Vert) with Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI.Grasselli, Margaret Morgan, Yuriko Jackall, et al., Hubert Robert, The National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2016. Copies Capriccio: draughtsman sketching the Borghese Vase, red chalk, Hubert Robert, c. 1775 Often paired and rescaled to balance the slightly smaller Medici Vase, it is one of the most admired and influential marble vases from antiquity, forms that satisfied the Baroque and neoclassical approach to classical art alike. Three pairs were copied for the Bassin de Latone in the gardens of Versailles; alabaster pairs stand in the Great Hall at Houghton Hall, Norfolk; and bronze ones at Osterley Park, Middlesex. On a reduced scale, the vases made admirable wine coolers in silver, or in silver- gilt, as Paul Storr delivered them to the Prince Regent in 1808 (Haskell and Penny 1981:315.) John Flaxman based a bas-relief on the frieze of the Borghese Vase. (Sir John Soane's Museum, London).

Switzer, usually known as Bob Switzer, (19 May 1914 - 20 August 1997) was an American inventor, businessman and environmentalist. Bob was co- inventor of the first black light fluorescent paint along with his brother Joseph Switzer and the inventor of the Magnaglo process for nondestructive flaw-detection in machined parts. The brothers founded the Day-Glo Color Corp. in 1946 to develop and manufacture fluorescent paints, pigments and other products. Biography =Early life= Bob Switzer was born in Fromberg, Montana, to parents Maud (Slocum) and Emmet Switzer and was raised in Berkeley California. In 1932, he received a scholarship from the Scaife Scholarship Foundation of Oakland, California, so he attended the College of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, in hopes of becoming a physician. During the summer of 1933, while working to unload tomatoes from a freight car at a H. J. Heinz Company laboratory in Berkeley, California, Bob fell and suffered several serious injuries, including a skull fracture and severed optic nerve. Doctors told him to stay in a dark room until he recovered his eyesight, a period which lasted several months. =Career= While convalescing from his injuries, Bob and Joseph searched for fluorescent materials, which Joseph had read about and wished to use in his amateur magic shows. The brothers inspected various products from their father's pharmacy, using a black light to identify fluorescent compounds. After Bob's recovery, the brothers continued to experiment with these, mixing them with shellac and eventually succeeding in producing the first black light fluorescent paints. They founded the Fluor-S-Art Co. in 1934 to develop and market their products for advertising displays. The brothers moved their company to Cleveland, Ohio, to partner with Continental Lithograph, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers Pictures, that specialized in movie posters and advertisements. They developed and tested new applications for their fluorescent paints, including lithography, make-up, and fabric dyes. In 1938, Bob invented Zyglo and Magnaglo, two nondestructive testing processes that use fluorescent dyes to identify defects in machined parts. The dyes penetrate small defects and are seen when inspecting the parts under black light. During World War II, the company developed daylight fluorescent pigments, which are highly visible in daylight. Bob produced the first piece of high-visibility clothing by dyeing his wife's wedding dress. =Personal life and legacy= Bob Switzer married his wife Patricia (a Berkeley native) in 1936. The couple had three children. Bob died in 1997 at his home in Shaker Heights, Ohio from complications from Parkinson's disease. He was 83 years old When Day-Glo Color Corp. was sold to Nalco in 1985, Bob and his wife used the proceeds to establish the Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation to fund students working on applied environmental problem solving. In 2009, \\"The Day-Glo Brothers,\\" a children's book about Bob and Joseph Switzer's invention of fluorescent materials, was published by author Chris Barton and illustrator Tony Persiani.

The building, which still stands, was opened on 26 December 1877, with a large stage (13 meters in diameter) and stables (housing 150 horses). The architect was Vasily Kenel. The Italian circus performer Gaetano Ciniselli (1815-1881) first visited Saint Petersburg in 1847, as part of the troupe of Alessandro Guerra. He returned to Russia in 1869, this time working with Carl-Magnus Hinne, his brother-in-law, in his circuses in Moscow and Saint Petersbrug. Ciniselli settled in Russia, and inherited Hinne's circuses in 1875. The Ciniselli family managed the circus until 1921, when they emigrated. They would often lease the building to stage high-profile entertainment events, such as the World Wrestling Championship in 1898 and Max Reinhardt's production of Oedipus Rex which featured Alexander Moissi in 1911. In 1918, Iury Iurev revived the play using the original set. This was followed by the production of Macbeth featuring Maria Andreyeva and Feodor Chaliapin.

After law studies at the University of Trieste, Vidussoni joined the Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF) in May 1936. He was a volunteer soldier in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, and then on Francisco Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War; he lost an eye and an arm on the Santander front, and was awarded a gold medal for valor in combat. Aldo Vidussoni's reputation made him an asset with the Benito Mussolini r√©gime, and he became an important figure in the hierarchy of the Fascist university corporations - the Gruppi universitari fascisti (GUF). First a secretary of the GUF for the Province of Trieste (in 1938), he was (1940‚Äì1941) inspector for the GUF in Enna, and, in November‚ÄìDecember 1941, national secretary of the GUF. Fascist Party leadership On 26 December 1941, while still quite young, Vidussoni was appointed national secretary of the PNF, replacing Adelchi Serena by order of Mussolini. His scant political experience and the constant criticism of other leaders had made him ill-suited for the task: despite his initial appeal as a decorated soldier, he soon became widely regarded as ineffective, even \\"ridiculous\\". According to the diaries of the Foreign Minister and son-in-law of Mussolini, Count Galeazzo Ciano, Vidussoni came to see him on 5 January 1942 with 'savage plans for the Slovenes. He wants to kill them all. I take the liberty of observing there are a million of them. \\"That does not matter\\", he answers firmly; \\"we must imitate the Askari and exterminate them!\\" I hope he will calm down'.The Ciano Diaries 1939‚Äì1943: The Complete, Unabridged Diaries of Count Galeazzo Ciano, Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, 1936‚Äì1943 (2000) Vidussoni was abruptly replaced by the ruthless squadrista Carlo Scorza in early 1943. After the pro-Allied coup d'√©tat inside the Grand Council of Fascism in late July 1943 and the armistice signed by the Pietro Badoglio government in Cassibile, Vidussoni chose to side with the Nazi-backed Italian Social Republic (established and led by Mussolini in the north). He became a leading member of the refounded PNF, the Partito Fascista Repubblicano (Republican Fascist Party). After World War II, Aldo Vidussoni lived in Verona and then Cagliari.

The word in old Malayalam means Beautiful, Pretty, etc. The word \\"Thayyilale\\" is used to refer a beautiful girl in old Malayalam. Etymology Probably this lineage has started with Thayyil, a family in Kannur district of Kerala state, south India. It is a family name which has its origin in a Nair royal lady. Thayyil tharavadu is situated in Thalikave ward Kannur. It is believed that one of two sisters of a Nair family had to flee Vatakara due to riots that broke out there. One of them married Valli Karanavar of the Thayyil family and the other sister married into the Arakkal, a prominent Muslim family. Thayyil Tharawad The Thayyil family lineage is more than 900 years old and its branches are spread far and wide and those interested could trace its genealogy with one of the direct descending families living in Govinda Sadanam, Thalikave Road, Kannur. This family is also related to Onden Tharavad, Koroth Thravad, Vengilat, Palliyath etc.which are also Thiyya Tharavads. Temple Lineage The family is also closely associated with Lord Muthappan of Parassinikkadavu, through his grace and blessing. Tradition requires that the Annual Festival ('Ulsavam') of the Muthappan Temple at Parassinikkadavu is to be started by a procession led by a female member of the \\"Thayyil\\" clan of Thayyil, Kannur from the family home with Kalaripayattu and Chenda to the main altar of the temple, where she offers a 'Pooja' (prayer) to the God. There is a room inside the temple premises which is specifically for them to be used on the day of the \\"Ulsavam\\". After the Ulsavam is done, Lord Muthappan himself drops the members of the Thayyil family off until the gates of the temple. Thayyil Beach Also there is a place named Thayyil in the coastal area 3 kilometers away from Kannur town famous for a mosque called Thayyil Juma Masjid.

Summary Capra outlines and traces the history of science and economics, highlighting flaws in the Cartesian, Newtonian, and reductionist paradigms which have come to light in the context of contemporary empirical understanding of the physical sciences. He writes that these paradigms are now inadequate to guide human behavior and policy with regard to modern technology and ecology, then argues that society needs to develop the concepts and insights of holism and systems theory to solve its complex problems.

Size comparison to a DUKW It could carry up to 100 tons of cargo or 200 people, but a more typical load was 60 tons of cargo or 120 people. The vehicle was powered by four GMC diesel engines positioned in the sides of the hull, each of which drove one wheel on land. Pairs of engines were coupled to drive each of the two -diameter propellers, which propelled the vehicle in the water. Its top speed was on land, or afloat. The operator occupied a small cab on the port side at the aft end of the vehicle. The LARC-LX was used to transport wheeled and tracked vehicles, including beach preparation equipment and general cargo, from ship- to-shore or to inland transfer points. It was also capable of transporting shipping containers, which could be landed from the LARC either by crane, straddle carriers, or rollers. It was the only amphibious vehicle in U.S. Army service capable of landing on a beach through surf. Typically, the LARC-LX was carried as deck cargo on a commercial vessel or heavy lift ship to be transported overseas.

Description It is long and wide, and was created by glacial action during the last ice age. The loch is fed by the Megget Water, which flows in from the Megget Reservoir, and is the source of the Yarrow Water, which flows east from the loch to merge with the Ettrick Water above Selkirk. It connects by a short section of river to the Loch of the Lowes, immediately to the south. Between the two, connected by an old arched bridge, is Tibbie Shiel's Inn, an 18th-century coaching inn, which was frequented by the Border poet James Hogg (1770‚Äì1835). The inn now operates as a pub and hotel. A statue of James Hogg is located opposite the turning to the former inn. The loch takes its name from a church dedicated to St Mary which once stood on its northern shore, although only the burial ground is now visible. The loch is around 27 metres deep at its centre.Edinburgh and its Environs: Ward Lock Travel Guide 1939 As the loch is sheltered by steep hills on all sides it is often very still, providing excellent reflections in its waters. The Southern Upland Way and Sir Walter Scott Way long-distance walking routes both pass the shores of the loch. The small settlement of Cappercleuch is located at the north-west corner of the loch. Sport St Mary's Loch Sailing Club (StMLSC) is run from premises at the south end of the loch (east of Tibbie Shiels). It is affiliated to the Royal Yachting Association.

Caminada served with the police between 1868 and 1899, and has been called Manchester's Sherlock Holmes. In 1897 he became the city's first CID superintendent. His most famous case was the Manchester Cab Murder of 1889, in which he discovered and brought the initially unknown perpetrator to trial and conviction only three weeks after the murder. Life Caminada was born in Deansgate, Manchester in 1844, to an Irish mother and an Italian father. At that time, Deansgate consisted mostly of public houses, brothels, and poor quality housing for mill workers, and was the heart of Victorian Manchester's crime world. He began working as an engineer in the city, but in February 1868, he joined the Manchester City Police force, at the age of 24. In 1872 he was promoted to sergeant, and transferred to the newly formed detectives division, based in Manchester Town Hall. Over his thirty-one-year career, from 1868 until 1899, he earned the respect of colleagues, judges and criminals alike; he was often known as Detective Jerome to the local criminals, who struggled with pronouncing his last name. On 25 September 1880 Caminada led a police raid on a cross-dressing ball held in the Temperance Hall in Hulme, rounding up 47 suspects, about half of whom had been in drag and the other half in fancy dress. A blind accordionist had been hired to provide music. Rather than let the alleged evidence of male prostitution be brought to public trial, the magistrates' court bound over all the suspects for a year on two sureties of ¬£25 each.H. G. Cocks, Nameless Offences: Homosexual Desire in the 19th Century (London and New York, 2003), pp. 70‚Äì73. In 1888, Caminada's national reputation for policing ‚Äì he was reportedly responsible for the imprisonment of 1,225 criminals and for the closure of 400 public houses ‚Äì earned him promotion to inspector. Threats on his life were commonplace; Caminada often carried a Colt Lightning Revolver, and had cause to use it on more than one occasion. Bob Horridge, regarded as public enemy number one in 1880s Manchester, a Blacksmith in Angel Meadow by day and was a violent burglar and armed robber by night, and arch rival of Caminada. Caminada tracked Fenian dynamite conspiracy suspects. His policing style was eccentric by modern standards, and often involved dressing in disguise to gather evidence on suspects. He maintained a large network of informers, whom he would often meet on the back pew of St Mary's Church, known as the Hidden Gem. His methods were effective however, and he was soon made Detective Superintendent. Caminada retired in 1899, and became a private detective, an estate agent, and a Manchester city councillor for Openshaw between 1907 and 1910. He died in 1914 at his home in Moss Side at the age of 70, as a result of injuries he had received in a bus accident in North Wales the previous year. He is buried in Manchester's Southern Cemetery. Angela Buckley, a British historian and trustee of the Society of Genealogists, claims that the Victorian-era detective who featured in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels was based on Jerome Caminada's life. ‚ÄúCaminada became a national figure at just the time that Sherlock Holmes was being created. There are so many parallels that it is clear Doyle was using parts of this real character for his,\\" Buckley was quoted by the Telegraph as saying. Dubbed 'the Garibaldi of Detectives', Caminada rose to prominence in the mid-1880s, shortly before Doyle's debut Holmes novel, A Study in Scarlet, and during his time as an investigator is said to have helped imprison 1,225 criminals. The detective died in 1914 aged 69 ‚Äì the year the last Holmes book was published.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/147681301/jerome-caminada Writings Caminada wrote the first volume of his autobiography anonymously as Twenty-Five Years of Detective Life in 1895, dedicating the book to the then Chief Constable of the Manchester City Police. Following his retirement, he published a second volume under his own name in 1901.

Historically part of Lancashire, at the 2001 Census it had a population of 11,343. It gave its name to the wider borough when it was formed in 1974. The parish includes Knowsley Hall and Knowsley Safari Park. There are three main built-up areas in the parish: the village of Knowsley, the nearby business park in the north west, and in the south-west a suburban area including Stockbridge Village and the northern fringe of Huyton. To the west of Knowsley is the area of Woolfall Heath. General information Knowsley Village consists primarily of two residential areas: a council estate, and a private estate. There is a parade of shops on Sugar Lane that serve the local community. The village has one public house, The Derby Arms. A second pub, the Pipe and Gannex, was demolished in 2018. There are two public parks, The Rec, off Knowsley Lane, and Mill Lane, as well a woodland in the centre of the village, Syders Grove. Milbrook Manor, a prominent building on the village green, served as the Village school until the 1980s, when it was redeveloped as a restaurant. As of 2019, it was being converted into residential accommodation. The village has two churches, the Anglican St Mary's and the Roman Catholic St John Fisher. St Mary's is a grade II listed building built by the Stanley family in the late 19th century. History The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon Cƒìnwulfes lƒìah, meaning \\"Cƒìnwulf's meadow\\". When the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria overran the Celtic kingdom of Rheged, the village was likely taken over or founded by an Anglo-Saxon called Cƒìnwulf (which translates as Keen Wolf). The village of Knowsley is hundreds of years older than the neighbouring city of Liverpool. Its name occurs in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Chenulveslei in the ancient hundred of (West) Derby in South Lancashire,Open Domesday Online: Knowsley, accessed July 2018. and has been recorded as Knuvesle (1199); Knouselegh (1258); Knouleslee (1261); Knusele (1262); and Knouslegh (1346). There are a few notable entries in Knowsley's history: *King Henry VII visited in 1495. *Shakespeare is said to have performed in a play held in Knowsley in 1589. *Capability Brown is responsible for creating some of Knowsley's landscaped gardens in the 1770s. *Edward Lear wrote \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\" while staying at Knowsley Hall. From 1895 the area was part of Whiston Rural District in Lancashire. On 1 April 1974 the village became part of the newly formed Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley in the nascent county of Merseyside.

Overview Abbreviations are of three basic kinds: * Clippings, in which a shortened form of a word occurs. Common clippings in Singapore are: air-con (from \\"air-conditioner\\"), condo (from \\"condominium\\"), sabo (from \\"sabotage\\"),Brown, Singapore English in a Nutshell, above, p. 187. and cert (from \\"certificate\\"). * Acronyms, in which the initial letters are formed into a single word, such as scuba, which is derived from \\"self- contained underwater breathing apparatus\\". Creation of acronyms such as this is rare in Singapore English, though TIBS (, \\"Trans-Island Bus Service\\") and CISCO (, \\"Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation\\") are found.Brown, Singapore English in a Nutshell, above, p. 112. * Initialisms, in which the individual letters are spelled out. This is by far the most common category in Singapore, including PAP (\\"People's Action Party\\") and PIE (\\"Pan-Island Expressway\\"), which are pronounced and respectively and never and . Some analysts regard initialisms such as these as one kind of acronym,Low & Brown, English in Singapore, above, p. 70. but others prefer to distinguish between the two categories.Deterding, Singapore English, above, p. 77. Initialisms are extremely common in Singapore, and many have become better known and more widely used than the full form of the words they represent. One example is the Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital, which is more commonly referred to as KK. The most important category of Singapore initialisms are those for government departments and public institutions. Among the earliest examples are PUB (\\"Public Utilities Board\\") and HDB (\\"Housing Development Board\\"). Abbreviations such as these were especially important in the past when most Singaporeans were not educated in English, and their use facilitated communication in the public services where the main administrative language is English. Government departments have therefore promoted the use of these initialisms, so they occur even in non-English publications. Although the younger generation of Singaporeans are now all educated in English, abbreviations remain a major characteristic of Singapore English. There are efforts to maintain some consistency among the initialisms. Three letters are used for government institutions (PUB, HDB, CPF, MOH, CWO) and for expressways (AYE, PIE, KJE), while two letters are used for polytechnics (SP, RP). To maintain this consistency, some abbreviations are not direct initials; for example CTE is used for \\"Central Expressway\\" instead of *CE, and NP is used for \\"Ngee Ann Polytechnic\\" instead of *NAP. When the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) was established in 1991, the name was chosen instead of the alternative \\"Nanyang University of Technology\\" because the latter would have resulted in the unsuitable NUT. While Anderson Secondary School has shortened its name to ANDSS instead of ASS. Recently, there have emerged a number of unconventional abbreviations, such as A*STAR for Agency for Science, Technology and Research.) When SAFTI (Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute) was reorganised in 1995, it acquired the name SAFTI Military Institute, further abbreviated as SAFTI MI, which when fully expanded would form a rather awkward title Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute Military Institute.

It appears to be the first such system on any platform, predating Apple's own AppleLink, as well as other Mac-based BBS systems like FirstClass. In more recent years the product has added a complete suite of \\"sub-servers\\" for popular internet protocols. The TeleFinder software consists of 2 programs, the Server software (Macintosh only) and the GUI based client software (also called TeleFinder), which is available for both macintosh and Windows based PCs. The TeleFinder Server could also network with other TeleFinder Server BBS computers and share email and forum messages between themselves and also over FidoNet. The TeleFinder Server System Operator (SysOp) could also use ResEdit (a Macintosh resource editor software) to create and modify profiles to give their BBS a unique GUI. These profile files were distributed by each BBS for users to download and use with the client software, if they wished to see this GUI. Otherwise, a default GUI was used instead.

In 2007 he founded his own political association, √âgalit√© & R√©conciliation (Equality and Reconciliation). At the same time he also launched a publishing company, KontreKulture, which he uses to publish contemporary controversial authors and to reissue out of print public domain books, that he believes are of historical importance.  Life and career  Soral was born in Aix-les-Bains, Savoie and grew up in the suburbs of Annemasse (department of Haute-Savoie), where he attended a local primary school. When Soral was about 12, his family moved to Meudon la For√™t so that he could go to a private Catholic high school, the Coll√®ge Stanislas de Paris. ¬´ Du communisme au nationalisme : itin√©raire d‚Äôun intellectuel fran√ßais ¬ª , allocution prononc√©e √† V√©nissieux le vendredi 2 March 2007. Soral spent two years doing small jobs before being accepted into the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts at 20, where he studied for two years. Soral was then taken in by a family of academics, who encouraged him to enroll at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales, where he attended lectures given by Cornelius Castoriadis. Following his studies, and working with Hector Obalk and Alexandre Pasche, Soral wrote a book on the sociology of trendiness, Les mouvements de mode expliqu√©s aux parents, as well as a fictionalised autobiography, Le Jour et la nuit ou la vie d'un vaurien. The latter work sold badly, and this led Soral to turn away from writing for a time. Soral then focused on cinematic techniques, and after 2 promotional films, wrote and directed his first short film, Chouabadaballet, une dispute amoureuse entre deux essuie-glaces. After a stint as a reporter in Zimbabwe, Soral wrote and directed his second short film, Les Rameurs, mis√®re affective et culture physique √† Carri√®re-sur-Seine. Around that time, Soral had joined the French Communist Party. He became interested in the works of Karl Marx and other Marxist thinkers such as Georg Luk√°cs, Henri Wallon, Lucien Goldmann and Michel Clouscard. He published Sociologie du dragueur (\\"Sociology of the womaniser\\"), his most successful sociological essay to date. This book was later turned into a feature-length film, Confession d'un Dragueur in 2001 starring Said Taghmaoui, Thomas Dutronc, Catherine Lachens, Francois Levantal and Cloe Lambert Soral performed in Catherine Breillat's 1996 film Parfait Amour! in the role of Philippe. He then published another polemical essay, Vers la f√©minisation? ‚Äì D√©montage d'un complot antid√©mocratique (\\"Towards feminisation? ‚Äì Analysis of an antidemocratic plot\\"), and spent the following couple of years writing and directing his first full-length movie, Confession d'un dragueur (\\"Confessions of a womaniser\\"), which was a commercial and critical failure. Allocin√© - French movie database, 2.2/5 average press rating, 2.8/5 average public rating ‚Äì checked on 15 January 2015 Disgusted by what he called \\"a lynching\\", Soral gave up cinema altogether and returned to writing. He published Jusqu'o√π va-t-on descendre? ‚Äì Ab√©c√©daire de la b√™tise ambiante (\\"How far down are we going? ‚Äì ABC's of ambient stupidity\\"), followed by Socrate √† Saint-Tropez (2003) and Mis√®res du d√©sir (2004). In 2007 he became part of the central committee of Front National, trying to place social issues and even elements of marxist analysis in the program of the party (historically strongly opposed to Communism); but this proved to misfire as the score of candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen at the 2007 election turned out to be significantly inferior to his 2002 breakthrough as second round finalist. He left the party in 2009. His essay Comprendre l'Empire: Demain la gouvernance mondiale ou la R√©volte des nations (Understanding the Empire: Tomorrow global governance or an uprising of nations)http://www.comprendrelempire.fr was published in France on 10 February 2011. He has a dysfunctional relationship with his family. According to his sister, they had a tyrannical father and he hasn't spoken to his mother for 20 years after he said he wanted time to reconstruct himself. Views Besides the sociological Marxist analysis of the modern-day society, Soral's books tend to focus on seven main themes: * criticism of communitarianism * criticism of feminism * criticism of the media and the society of spectacle in general * criticism of consumerism, neoliberal capitalism and what he views as \\"US imperialism\\" * criticism of Zionism and Jewish lobbying *criticism of homosexual activism * criticism of mainstream vulgarity * the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict * the dismantling of Yugoslavia, and possibly of France * the dismantling of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Ukraine Notably, Soral has written: Soral's analysis of society focuses on what he terms \\"desire society\\",\\"'\\"; Alain Soral, Mis√®res du d√©sir. promoted by the media and the cult of celebrity. He has especially criticised monthly women's publications, which he believes alter the conscience and relegate women to the status of \\"objects\\" (femme-objet). As part of the debate on \\"la√Øcit√©\\" in French schools, Soral claimed to prefer the Muslim veil to thong underwear.in an article on oumma.com \\"je pr√©f√®re le voile au string\\" Soral defined himself as a Marxist, and was a member of the French Communist Party in the early 1990s. He left the PCF because of his opposition to the party's renunciation of revolutionary content. Soral supported left-wing dissident candidate Jean- Pierre Chev√®nement during the 2002 presidential election. In 2005, Soral turned to the far-right, joining the National Front's campaign committee; he was given responsibility for social issues and for the suburbs under the authority of Marine Le Pen. Soral's personal journey has led some to compare him with Jacques Doriot, one of the neo-socialists in the early 1930s and Collaborationist under P√©tain.Alain Soral: le sous-Marine du Front National , Amnistia.net, 4 December 2006 He supported the Bloc identitaire's distribution of food in January 2006. On 18 November 2007, Soral joined the central committee of the National Front, which he left in early 2009 because of some ideas he was in conflict with‚Äîespecially the \\"menace of Islam\\", which he does not believe to be a genuine threat. He considers that this supposed threat is instrumentalized by establishment's interests for the purpose of fostering animosity between social groups to manipulate them within the model of identity politics, possibly resulting in a \\"clash of civilizations\\", and of looting other countries‚ÄîIraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria; he argues that the fundamental values of moderate Islam are perfectly compatible with French moderate Catholic ones. In 2007, he founded the group √âgalit√© et R√©conciliation, a think tank led by the ideas he developed in his books and his numerous video interviews broadcast on the Internet, an innovative mix between social and economic ideas from the Left, and values like family, nation, morality from the Right. On 15 April 2019, after years of regular prosecutions and financial condemnations for his declarations, he was sentenced to a year in prison for Holocaust denial as a result of a drawing published on Egalit√© et R√©conciliation, a parody of a Charlie Hebdo cover which made fun of the Rwandan genocide. Arguing that he was not the author of the drawing, and that the drawing was merely showcasing strong black humor in the same vein as the satirical journal, without actually expressing negationist views, Soral stated that this was a demonstration of the double standard regarding the freedom of speech when it comes to the Jewish community, and of the persecution it entails, therefore validating the \\"serious\\" of his struggle, for it means that the powers that be are \\"taking [him] seriously.\\" Controversy =Alain Soral and \\"gay communitarianism\\"= Alain Soral has denounced communitarianism as a \\"poison\\".¬´ Alain Soral attaque les communautarismes √† l'oeuvre contre la R√©publique ¬ª, 5 May 2003. He has been especially critical of the rise of communitarianism in the gay community, a term that he has sharply criticised, arguing that many homosexuals have nothing to do with Gay Pride ideology. For Soral, Gay Pride involves promotion of the \\"Gorgeous Guy\\" model, youth, parties, drag queens, etc., and obscures homosexuality as experienced by older or working-class homosexuals. However, Soral is currently supporting the homosexual community Fistini√®re directed by French sociologists Brice and Alexis. The association Act Up rounded on his publisher, √âditions Blanche.¬´ Act Up et les √©ditions Blanche ¬ª, editorial by Victoire Patouillard, president of Act Up, published in L'Humanit√©, 21 April 2003. Act Up stated that through books like those of Alain Soral or √âric R√©m√®s (himself a homosexual activist and advocate of barebacking), √âditions Blanche spreads negative feelings and even hatred towards homosexuals. Act Up asked the director of publication at √âditions Blanche to stop publishing books by Soral and R√©m√®s, and vandalised √âditions Blanche's offices. The head of √âditions Blanche claimed that members of Act Up physically assaulted his executive assistant, and threatened to press charges. Act Up denied those accusations. No legal action has so far been pursued. =Alain Soral and feminism= In his book Vers la f√©minisation? D√©montage d'un complot antid√©mocratique, Alain Soral argues that women have always worked (in trade or agriculture, for example), and that housewives were mis-sold the idea of having their own careers by neoliberal capitalists. To him, feminism was invented by rich women and results in poor women working double \\"8 hours in the home and 8 hours at work\\" and would be better off just working in the home.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do5zrdTb-yI Soral distinguishes two types of feminism: that of the \\"flipp√©es\\" (\\"freaked-outs\\"), and that of the \\"p√©tasses\\" (\\"bitches\\"). Soral claims that the most problematic inequality is not between men and women, but between rich and poor, and that feminists, who generally come from the upper classes of society, attempt to distract attention from this struggle. =Accusations of anti-Semitism= In a report on the television program Compl√©ment d'enqu√™te, broadcast on the French television channel France 2 on 20 September 2004 (in its episode devoted to the French comedia Dieudonn√© M'bala M'bala following the beginning of his radicalization), being interrogated while Dieudonn√© is visible in the background, nodding in approval, Alain Soral said: These comments sparked much controversy, and Soral estranged himself from his showbusiness friends like Thierry Ardisson, a French TV host and producer, though they knew each other for more than 25 years. Soral defended his comments some days later on the website oumma.com, claiming that his words had been taken out of context. Anti-Semitism is the main subject of Soral's book CHUTe! √âloge de la disgr√¢ce (\\"HUSH! In praise of disgrace\\"), a semi-autobiographical novel. The title of the book is a play on words: chut means \\"hush\\" in French, while chute means \\"fall\\" or \\"downfall\\". In a 2005 interview given to the magazine VSD, Soral announced his intellectual support for the equally controversial Dieudonn√© M'bala M'bala, with whom he worked on the Euro-Palestine list for the European elections of 2004, before his withdrawal led Dieudonn√© to do likewise. On February 10, 2005 a criminal court in Paris sentenced Alain Sorrell to a fine of ‚Ç¨10,000 in respect of racist insults against the journalist Fr√©d√©ric Haziza, for a parody song he sang to the tune of Daniel Balavoine's L'Aziza. During the hearing, Haziza declared that he fell victim to threats and insults on Alain Soral's website after he refused to invite him to one of his television programs. In addition to the fine, the author was to pay 5,000 euros as compensation to Frederic Haziza, 3,000 euros for court expenses and ‚Ç¨1,000 for legal expenses to four racism combat organizations. =Break-up of Yugoslavia and France= Alain Soral argues that Yugoslavia was dismembered by the United States, which saw an opportunity to gain political ground and influence in South-Eastern Europe by arming Albanian separatist movements in the Serbian province of Kosovo. Soral further argues that communitarianism in France could have a similar effect, if the French Republic fails to apply 1905 Law of Separation of Church and State, which is enshrined in the French constitution.Soral Direct 8, 88 minutes 2008 According to a recent TV interview (Direct 8 / 88 minutes), Alain Soral stated: \\"Today, no one was surprised to see French presidents, prime ministers and other high French political figures meet elusively with the Jewish representing body every year in Paris, meetings that go against the laws of France and send mixed signals to the Republic.\\" Soral finished by stating that such a course could only push other minorities to form political religious movements in order to be heard. According to Soral, this would be a step likely to divide France into its various religious communities, which would then weaken the independence of the country.

He was best known for his long and bloody feud with Chicago Outfit boss Al Capone. Aiello masterminded several unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Capone, and fought against his former business partner Antonio Lombardo, a Capone ally, for control of the Chicago branch of the Unione Siciliana benevolent society. Aiello and his ally Bugs Moran are believed to have arranged the murder of Lombardo, which directly led Capone to organize the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in retaliation. Despite being forced to flee Chicago multiple times throughout the gang war, Aiello eventually took control of the Unione Siciliana in 1929, and ranked seventh among the Chicago Crime Commission's list of top \\"public enemies\\". Aiello was killed after Capone gunmen ambushed him as he exited a Chicago apartment building where he had been hiding out, shooting him 59 times. After his death the Chicago Tribune described Aiello as \\"the toughest gangster in Chicago, and one of the toughest in the country\\". Early life Aiello was born on September 27, 1890, in Bagheria, Sicily, to father Carlo Sr., Aiello was part of a large and impoverished family of at least nine other brothers and many cousins. His mother died when he was a child.. In July 1907, at the age of 17,. Aiello immigrated to the United States to join family members already residing there. After arriving in New York City by boat, he worked a series of menial jobs in Buffalo and Utica, New York, before connecting with his father, brothers and cousins in Chicago. The family set up several businesses in both New York and Chicago, including the financially successful Aiello Brothers Bakery, and they become importers of such groceries as olive oil, cheeses and sugar. Aiello was the co-owner of a cheese importing business with a fellow Sicilian, Antonio \\"Tony the Scourge\\" Lombardo, an ally of organized crime figure Al Capone.. Aiello was president of the company, which was called Antonio Lombardo & Co., and Capone was said to have lent both men $100,000 to start the enterprise. With the enactment of Prohibition and the start of bootlegging, the sugar import business brought Aiello into contact with organized crime, along with his brothers Dominick, Antonio, Andrew and Carlo. In Chicago they made a small fortune selling sugar and other home-cooked alcohol components to the Genna crime family, and Aiello earned enough money to buy a three-story mansion in Rogers Park. However, he craved recognition and prestige in addition to money, something he was gaining as he was becoming known as the top organized crime boss of Chicago. When the Genna family lost power in Chicago following gang wars, the Aiellos believed themselves the successors of their territory. Feud begins with Al Capone Joe Aiello made several unsuccessful attempts to assassinate his rival, Al Capone (pictured). In November 1925 Lombardo was named head of the Unione Siciliana, a Sicilian-American benevolent society that had been corrupted by gangsters. An infuriated Aiello, who had wanted the position himself, believed Capone was responsible for Lombardo's ascension and he resented the non-Sicilian's attempts to manipulate affairs within the Unione. Aiello severed all personal and business ties with Lombardo and entered into a feud with him and Capone,. essentially ending a Chicago gang peace treaty that had been in force since the 1926 murder of Capone rival Hymie Weiss. Aiello allied himself with several other Capone enemies, including Dean O'Banion, and the trio of Billy Skidmore, Barney Bertsche and Jack Zuta, who ran vice and gambling houses together, although they became less receptive to Aiello after Capone personally approached and threatened Skidmore. While newspapers falsely reported that Aiello had also entered into an active alliance with George \\"Bugs\\" Moran and his North Side Gang at this time, Moran in fact pledged no specific support to Aiello until later,. and instead privately supported Aiello from the sidelines without actively participating.. Aiello plotted to eliminate both Lombardo and Capone, and starting in the spring of 1927 made several attempts to assassinate Capone. On one occasion he offered money to the chef of Diamond Joe Esposito's Bella Napoli Caf√©, Capone's favorite restaurant, to put prussic acid in Capone's and Lombardo's soup; reports indicated he offered between $10,000 and $35,000. Instead, the chef exposed the plot to Capone, who responded by dispatching men to destroy one of Aiello's stores on West Division Street with machine-gun fire. More than 200 bullets were fired into the Aiello Brothers Bakery on May 28, 1927, wounding Joe's brother Antonio. During the summer and autumn of 1927 a number of hitmen Aiello hired to kill Capone were themselves slain. Among them were Anthony Russo and Vincent Spicuzza, each of whom had been offered $25,000 by Aiello to kill Capone and Lombardo. Aiello eventually offered a $50,000 reward to anyone who eliminated Capone. At least 10 gunmen tried to collect on Aiello's bounty, but ended up dead. Capone ally Ralph Sheldon attempted to kill both Capone and Lombardo for Aiello's reward, but Capone henchman Frank Nitti's intelligence network learned of the transaction and had Sheldon shot in front of a West Side hotel, although he didn't die.. Gang war with Capone escalates In November 1927 Aiello organized machine-gun ambushes across from Lombardo's home and a cigar store frequented by Capone, but those plans were foiled after an anonymous tip led police to raid several addresses and arrest Milwaukee gunman Angelo La Mantio and four other Aiello gunmen. After the police discovered receipts for the apartments in La Mantio's pockets, he confessed that Aiello had hired him to kill Capone and Lombardo, leading the police to arrest Aiello himself and bring him to the South Clark Street police station.. Upon learning of the arrest, Capone dispatched nearly two dozen gunmen to stand guard outside the station and await Aiello's release.. The men made no attempt to conceal their purpose there, and reporters and photographers rushed to the scene to observe Aiello's expected murder. Capone gunmen Frank Perry, Sam Marcus and Louis \\"Little New York\\" Campagna were arrested as they tried to enter the front of the station and placed in the cell next to Aiello, who Campagna told, \\"You're dead, friend, dead. You won't get up to the end of the street still walking\\". Aiello pleaded for mercy and promised to sell his possessions and leave Chicago with his family if they let him go, but Campagna refused the request. When released, Aiello was given a police escort out of the station to safety. He later failed to make a court appearance after his attorney claimed he suffered a nervous breakdown. Aiello disappeared with some family members to Trenton, NJ, from whence he continued his campaign against Capone and Lombardo. Aiello's brother Dominick returned to Chicago in January 1928 to attend to family matters while his brother remained in New Jersey. One day he received a telephone call warning him to leave town, after which the Aiello Brothers Bakery was shot up by gunmen. Aiello briefly allied himself with former Capone employer and friend Frankie Yale, meeting with him regularly in New York City and plotting Capone's overthrow, until Yale himself was murdered.. Aiello was said to have fled to Wisconsin under the protection of the Milwaukee crime family,. and also briefly took refuge in Buffalo with his ally there, crime family boss Stefano Magaddino. With Aiello still in hiding, Capone started targeting Aiello's men and killed several over the next few years,.. including his brother Dominick. Aiello returned to Chicago in the summer of 1928 and once again approached Moran, whose relationship with Capone had degenerated even further, making him much more receptive to an active alliance with Aiello.. They conspired to eliminate Lombardo, a task they assigned to hitmen Frank \\"Tight Lips\\" and Peter Gusenberg. Lombardo was shot to death on a busy Chicago street on September 7, 1928, and although never arrested, at least one of the Gusenberg brothers is believed to have been among the shooters.. After Lombardo's death, Aiello attempted to elevate his ally Peter Rizzito to the Unione Siciliana position, but Rizzito was killed by shotgun blasts outside his home.. Rise to Unione Siciliana leader Aiello was also believed to have masterminded the murder of Pasqualino \\"Patsy\\" Lolordo, Lombardo's successor as head of the Unione, who was killed in his home on January 8, 1929.. Police alleged that Aiello suggested a truce with Lolordo, and when Lolordo invited Aiello into his home for a toast of friendship, Aiello and two others shot him to death. When police later questioned Lolordo's widow, she screamed when she was shown a photo of Aiello, but refused to explain why she was afraid and would not answer questions about him. Capone retaliated against Moran by organizing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, a hit that wiped out the Gusenberg brothers, decimated Moran's forces and resulted in the loss of a significant amount of Aiello's support. Shortly afterwards Aiello persuaded Capone killers Albert Anselmi and John Scalise to betray their employer and convinced Joseph \\"Hop Toad\\" Giunta, the new head of the Unione Siciliana, to support Aiello in eliminating Capone and taking control of the North Side of Chicago following the departure of Bugs Moran. However, Capone learned of Aiello's plot in April 1929 and killed all three men... The violent retaliation against Aiello indirectly led him to finally become head of the Unione.. During a conference in Atlantic City, numerous mob bosses supported Aiello's promotion with the hopes of restoring order in Chicago, and Capone apparently accepted the decision, at least temporarily. Retired Chicago mob boss Johnny Torrio was said to have mediated a peace agreement among Capone, Aiello and Moran, in which they agreed to end the gang warfare and murders.. However, Aiello's accession coincided with Capone serving a year in prison for carrying a concealed weapon, which Aiello saw as an opportunity to take control of some of Capone's territory and scheme yet again for his assassination.. Aiello gained a measure of nationwide notoriety around this time after ranking seventh on Chicago Crime Commission Chairman Frank J. Loesch's \\"public enemies\\" list, released in April 1930, which identified the top 28 people he saw as corrupting Chicago.. Through his Mafia boss allies Magaddino and Gaspar Milazzo, Aiello arranged a meeting with Joe Masseria, the capo di tutti capi based in New York City, seeking support in Aiello's efforts against Capone. During the meeting Masseria offered to support Aiello in exchange for control of the east side of Chicago, which would allow Aiello to keep the city's west side. The offer infuriated Aiello, who threatened Masseria and ordered him to leave the city. In turn, Masseria spread false rumors that Aiello attempted to kill Masseria, giving him a pretext to support Capone in retaliation. Mafioso Joseph Bonanno later described as a key incident in starting the Castellammarese War in New York City. Masseria openly supported Capone, requiring a strong alliance with him following the death of Masseria ally Giuseppe Morello. He also offered territory to Milazzo if he betrayed Aiello, an offer Milazzo rebuffed and considered insulting. As a result, Aiello backed Salvatore Maranzano in the Castellammarese War, providing the Maranzano forces with $5,000 a week for their war chest.. During the early months of 1930 Aiello arranged several unsuccessful assassination attempts against Capone bodyguards, including Jack McGurn, Phil D'Andrea and Rocco De Grazia. Aiello hoped to leave Capone vulnerable by depleting his security, and Capone began to suspect Aiello had spies within the Chicago Outfit because he seemed to have inside knowledge about where his targets would be and when. In August 1930, two months before Aiello's death, the state's attorney conducted a raid on Aiello's home, obtaining records as part of a series of raids by the United States government to fight against gangland activities in Chicago. Death In 1930, upon learning of Aiello's continued plotting against him, Capone resolved to finally eliminate him. In the weeks before Aiello's death Capone's men tracked him to Rochester, New York, where he had connections through Magaddino, and plotted to kill him there, but Aiello returned to Chicago before the plot could be executed. Aiello, angst- ridden from the constant need to hide out and the killings of several of his men, set up residence in the Chicago apartment of Unione Siciliana treasurer Pasquale \\"Patsy Presto\\" Prestogiacomo at 205 N. Kolmar Ave. He moved in on October 13, 1930, and rarely left the apartment. However, his wife and child occasionally visited him, and Frank Nitti biographer Mars Eghigian Jr. theorized that Capone's forces located Aiello by tracking his family members.. Men who gave the names Morris Friend and Henry Jacobson rented rooms in an apartment across the street overlooking Prestogiacomo's apartment building and began observing Aiello. On October 23, Aiello made plans to permanently leave Chicago and apparently move to Mexico, although Prestogiacomo later told police Aiello was simply leaving the house for a barber's appointment. Upon exiting Prestogiacomo's building to enter a taxicab, a gunman in a second- floor window across the street started firing at Aiello with a submachine gun. Aiello was said to have been shot at least 13 times before he toppled off the building steps and moved around the corner, attempting to move out of the line of fire. Instead, he moved directly into the range of a second submachine gun positioned on the third floor of another apartment block, and was subsequently gunned down. After the ambush the two apparent shooters ran from the buildings and fled in a Ford sedan; the car was later discovered to have been set on fire and destroyed. Aiello's body was loaded into the taxicab and taken to Garfield Park Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The coroner eventually removed 59 bullets, weighing over a pound, from the body. He was shot more times than any single victim of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. A third machine gun position, which was ultimately not used, was later discovered by police in another nearby building, which had been rented a week before the murder by a man who gave the name Lon Celespe. Police, prosecutors and federal agents immediately and publicly speculated that Capone was behind the assassination, noting that the precision machine-gun ambush was typical of his attacks. However, at least one press story at the time speculated Moran could have been behind the hit. Prestogiacomo, fearful for his life, went into hiding for three days after Aiello's death before turning himself in to police. He was charged as an accessory before the fact of Aiello's murder, a charge also filed against John Sorce, an employee of Aiello's importing company. Detectives questioned whether Prestogiacomo provided Aiello's enemies with information about his whereabouts, something he vehemently denied. Police claimed Prestogiacomo was not cooperative and lied about his relationship with Aiello. The charges against Prestogiacomo went to a grand jury but were ultimately dropped. Frank Nitti was also wanted by police for questioning in connection with the murder.. Some historians later suggested Mafia forces outside Chicago may have been behind the hit as part of the Castellammarese War, but Virgil Peterson, an expert on Chicago organized crime, believed the murder was strictly related to city gang warfare. Aiello's family ordered an $11,000 coffin for him. Before eventually being placed in Riverside Cemetery in Rochester, New York, Aiello was originally buried in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Chicago on October 29, 1930, close to former friend-turned-rival Lombardo. Capone continued to hunt down Aiello's allies even after his death. One month after Aiello was killed, police discovered an abandoned machine gun nest, manned by alleged Capone gangsters, in a house opposite the home of four of Aiello's former henchmen. Aiello's nephew, Frank Aiello Jr., was fatally shot through a window while he was playing cards in his Milwaukee home on May 23, 1931. Authorities believed the killing was related to the Chicago feud, despite Frank's apparent lack of ties to organized crime. Aiello's death left Capone effectively unchallenged in his control over Chicago, and brought 70 years of peace to the city in terms of the Chicago Outfit leadership. Aiello was believed to have been responsible for the deaths of at least 24 people throughout his life, according to the Chicago Tribune, which described him as \\"the toughest gangster in Chicago, and one of the toughest in the country\\".

Species in the genus Breviceps are commonly known as rain frogs or short-headed frogs. They occur in arid to semiarid climates of East Africa and Southern Africa. Taxonomy The genus Breviceps consists of 19 species, of which most occur in southern Africa. There are five species found in the Western Cape, B. gibbosus, B. fuscus (black rain frog), B. rosei (Rose's rain frog), B. montanus (mountain rain frog) and B. acutirostris (strawberry rain frog). Two species are found in arid areas and other species are found in the eastern and northern parts of southern Africa. Description Species of the genus Breviceps are sexually dimorphic: males are much smaller than females. This prevents normal amplexus; instead, males and females produce an adhesive secretion from the skin that allows them to \\"stick\\" together during mating. Ecology and behaviour Species of the genus Breviceps spend most of the year underground; even when on the surface, they are inconspicuous because of their slow movements and cryptic colouration. They walk rather than hop. They are able to burrow rapidly, backwards, into the soil by using the enlarged, spade-like metatarsal tubercles on their feet. These frogs emerge after rain to feed on small arthropods such as ants, termites, beetles, moths, woodlice, amphipods, juvenile millipedes, and caterpillars. Reproduction also occurs during the rainy season. Choruses start immediately after heavy rains, although this may be delayed in colder areas. Eggs are laid in chambers below the surface of the soil, rocks, or fallen logs. After hatching, the movements of the tadpoles make the remains of the egg mass into a froth. The female remains close to the egg chamber until the tadpoles are fully developed.

Equally significant is the social responsibility of Vinmonopolet, to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors and visibly inebriated customers. Outlets, located across the country from cities to smaller communities, typically close business earlier than other shops, typically weekdays at 6 pm and Saturdays at 3 pm.*Vinmonopolet, stores & opening hours (Official website) In 2007 Vinmonopolet sold of alcoholic beverages. Foundation The former Vinmonopolet headquarters in Hasle, Oslo. Image believed to date from 1932. The institution was founded in 1922 as a government-owned company as the result of trade negotiations with wine exporters, mainly in France. The ban on alcohol was lifted, and sale was allowed through outlets run by Vinmonopolet. Since 1939 the state, initially through the Norwegian Ministry of Finance and later the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services, has been the sole owner, buying out the private shareholders while remaining a stock company. The company's import and production activities ceased in 1996 when the EFTA ruled that the monopoly was in violation of the EEA agreement, the company divided into the created company entity Arcus which continued all production, import and distribution activity of spirits, leaving Vinmonopolet as a sole retail monopoly. In 1999 the format of the outlets was restructured, making nearly all stores self service from the previous format of sales over the counter, and internet sales began in 2002. =Special shops= Initially, two Vinmonopolet outlets were launched in 2005-06 as \\"special stores\\" category A, located in Oslo (Briskeby, relocated to Vika in March 2010) and Bergen (Valkendorfsgaten), and a branch of smaller category B stores in were added during 2012-13 in Oslo west, Sandnes, Hamar, Sandefjord and Trondheim.B√∏, Merete, DN.no (September 13, 2012).

Vinmonopolets flaggskip til Aker Brygge The special stores arrange major launches of new products on six occasions annually, to supplement a special selection (of approximately 750 products at category A level) that is not available in the ordinary product list, of wines, fortified wines or beers, described to be \\"either innovative, of limited availability or of an exceptionally high quality\\". Each launch carries a theme, and while there may be changes from year to year, regular fixtures are the launch of wines from Bordeaux in December, wines from Burgundy in February, wines from Germany in April, Champagne and Chablis in May, and beer and U.S. wines in October.Om Vinmonopolet ‚Äì Plan for nyhetslanseringer i spesialbutikkene Smaller groups of products that fall outside the launch themes may appear at any other time during the year.

Instead the government can license private alcohol shops,Forskrift om alkoholordningen for Svalbard of which there is only one, \\"Nordpolet\\" in Longyearbyen. In addition mining companies can sell alcohol to employees. There are monthly sales quotas on Svalbard. The taxes and therefore prices are much lower on Svalbard than mainland Norway. =Wine auctions= In December 2008, Vinmonopolet announced plans to implement a system of arranging auctions of second-hand wine, similar to the model in use by Swedish Systembolaget. Under Norwegian law, it was illegal to sell alcohol by auction, until a resolution by Stortinget changed this law in April 2011, effective from 1 January 2012. While Vinmonopolet is to draw no profit from these activities, the process of selecting a collaborating auction house resulted in the tender eventually awarded to the auction house Blomqvist in Oslo, with the first wine auction of Norway held on 25 November 2013, and simultaneously an expanded Internet auction was arranged due to the unexpected scale of interest.Dannevig Kristiansen, Bendik, DN.no (November 25, 2013). Enorm interesse for historisk auksjon NRK.no (July 23, 2013), Polet med million- auksjon av vin Consumer relations Briskeby outlet In a 2008 survey by Norsk Kundebarometer, customers of the monopoly were 81.5% satisfied with the company, ranking it 4th in Norway,kundebarometer.com Customer poll, search criteria - satisfaction a figure that rose to 88% in 2009. There were critical voices such as Tom Marthinsen, then wine critic of Dagens N√¶ringsliv, that questioned the institution's selection process of allowing a small self- recruited group, termed \\"the taste bureaucracy\\", make the wine buying decisions on behalf of the entire Norwegian people. Surveys from the mid 90s, indicated a majority of the Norwegian population were in support of dissolving the monopoly arrangement, and allowing for the sale of wine by the private sector. Since the restructuring of 1996, the consumer satisfaction has increased. A 2013 TNS Gallup poll showed that 74% of the population wanted to keep the monopoly while 22% wanted to dissolve it.NTB (2 July 2013): Nordmenn er forn√∏yde med Vinmonopolet Verdens Gang, retrieved 21 August 2013 Economists have praised Vinmonopolet for being a well-working monopoly that offers good customer service.Anders Park Framstad (19 August 2013):Selv √∏konomene hyller det norske Vinmonoplet E24, retrieved 21 August 2013 Robert Lie, then sommelier of Bagatelle, has stated, \\"I am among the supporters. In recent years Vinmonopolet has had great impact on the wine interest of the average Norwegian. To my knowledge there are no wine stores in the world with an equal selection. There are also fairly good prices for more expensive wines. For highly coveted wines one must pay much more in London.\\" Torkjell Berulfsen, presenter of considerable TV programming with focus on alcoholic goods, has stated, \\"These days I praise Vimonopolet into the clouds. I bless it! I don't dare imagine some zitty, unmotivated 25-year-old 'red wine supervisor' at Rimi!\\" Arne Ronold MW has pointed to the formats of UK and Denmark as successful alternatives that offer good selections in supermarkets and specialty stores, while stating that the present situation offers a wide selection for consumers in certain areas but with considerably more limited options for some other areas, and while more costly wines may be less expensive in the Vinmonopolet format, this is a \\"positive side-effect of a market that doesn't work, being of little benefit to the average consumer\\". He acknowledges \\"a near-revolution in that at present there are more than 10,000 products available, which is wonderful\\", adding, \\"I have been among the most ardent critics but have mildened somewhat. I am adequately satisfied with Vinmonopolet as it is now. But they still have some way to go concerning aged wine and the second hand market. In this, access is poor.\\" Ronold's publication Vinforum which 1986 founding was motivated by the perceived poor performance of Vinmonopolet, whose Italian wine selection then totalled 14 labels including reds, whites and sparkling. By 2010 the category had risen past 2,000 labels, leading co-founder Ola Dybvik to declare, \\"we are living in paradise\\", continuing in context that the Norwegian population is comparative to a New York suburb, \\"in terms of selection, the store has moved into the definitive world elite\\". Exterior of Vinmonopolet in Briskeby In a Dagens N√¶ringsliv commentary, Tom Marthinsen also acknowledged the progress from the conditions of the 1990s, but was critical to the direction of applying new techniques from chain stores which led to standardization of the urban outlets, while contending that the rural stores have a \\"catastrophical selection\\", and these consumers from \\"the districts\\" would benefit from purchasing wine in their local food store. Marthinsen called upon the leadership to \\"set free the store buyers, reinstate the competitive element between the stores, in other words leave behind the chain store mentality and allow local creativity to flourish\\". The institution has not stayed clear of problems. In one instance in 2001, the published price list offered Ch√¢teau Latour at the incredibly priced NOK 555, where an estimate would normally be approximately NOK 2,600, causing the quickest three customers to order to buy up the entire inventory, with the intent to make a fast and considerable profit. The explanation was that the more modestly priced Ch√¢teau Latour √† Pomerol had its name listing edited down for brevity. In 2010 Vinmonopolet offered more than 12,000 products, next to 2009 figures from comparative retailers such as Systembolaget which offered ca. 9,000 products, Alko of Finland with ca. 3,000 products available, or British Waitrose with ca. 1,500 products available. By the end of 2016, the range of products had reached near 17,000 items. Corruption cases In what is known as Dysthesaken (the Dysthe case) in 1930 exposed flaws in the goods acquisition procedures of Vinmonopolet, and as a consequence changes were made to the procedures. The leadership were sentenced for combining company and personal interests, and the influence and power of individuals in purchasing decisions were reduced after the process. Following this, a law of 19 July 1931 (Vinmonopolloven, the wine monoploy law) came into effect.'' Ekjordsaken, (the Ekjord case) uncovered in 2005, brought new allegations of corruption against employees and leadership of Vinmonopolet. A probe led by Erling Grimstad exposed that the importer firm Ekjord A/S over the course of several years had sponsored outlet leaders by arranging luxury dining and accommodations as well as other gifts in order to influence purchases and placement of their products within the stores. Membership in this exclusive group was symbolized by the gift of a tastevin. Several Vinmonopolet leaders admitted to having received wines and other perks, which led to reprimands of 9 individuals, two of whom were dismissed. The initiating factor came when an employee who had been fired from Ekjord A/S, sued against wrongful dismissal. The scandal escalated as the media discovered the particulars of the lawsuit, with Lindin as the chief source of allegations that would result in wide consequences.Bakken, Laila; Steffensen, Christian, NRK.no (November 21, 2005). \\"Polbl√•ser\\" i retten During the trial the elaborate \\"grease culture\\" in the company Ekjord A/S was uncovered. Knut Gr√∏holt withdrew from the position of CEO of Vinmonopolet later that year, and in August 2006 was replaced by Kai G. Henriksen.Dalheim, Ulf, Adresseavisen (April 21, 2006). Polets nye direkt√∏r VG.no (April 21, 2008). Kai G. Henriksen ny sjef i Vinmonopolet Dn.no (April 21, 2006). Ny direkt√∏r i Vinmonopolet Vinbladet manservant James and Miss Sophie Having long planned to publish a magazine aimed at consumers as was already done by Systembolaget in Sweden, in 1988 Vinmonopolet launched Vinbladet (\\"The Wine Magazine\\" or \\"The Vine Leaf\\"), distributed to customers free of charge. The magazine's name had been used precisely 60 years previously for the internal publication which provided information to employees about the sold goods. The rationale was that as Vinmonopolet were in the business of selling culture, they wanted to do so with culture, making information available crucial. A professional editor was engaged, and the publication printed on glossy paper contained images of a commercial nature depicting the diverse nations' wine regions and wine production, and articles on various subjects connected to food, wine and spirits. The Norwegian temperance movement reacted negatively and responded with press declarations accusing Vinmonopolet of attempting to popularise alcohol use, rather than limit it. The criticism from the temperance movement also maintained that the alcohol in wine did not distinguish itself from the alcohol in hard spirits, that \\"fine dining\\" customs functioned as a gateway to alcohol problems, and that the cultural projects of Vinmonopolet could well lead to family tragedies, destroyed lives, fear and death. Notable past products =R√∏dvin= When the German occupation forces withdrew from Norway in 1945, there remained behind 400,000 litres of Bordeaux wine which became the foundation of the generic \\"R√∏dvin\\" (\\"Red wine\\"), the best selling wine in Norway over several decades, which is accredited as a cornerstone in \\"cultivating Norwegian drinking culture\\". Nicknamed \\"Ch√¢teau Hasle\\" (from the location name of the Vinmonopolet headquarters) and \\"Sekskroners\\" (\\"costing six kroner\\"), sales of the brand are estimated in excess of 120 million litres, it eventually ceased being the national top seller due to the arrival of inexpensive Chilean and Italian wines by 1998. The initial blends consisting of Bordeaux wines from the 1934 and 1937 vintages, along with simple German and Italian wine, were sold from 1 January 1946 for NOK total of 4.50, both R√∏dvin and Hvitvin (White wine), all sold out by 1947.Holt, Morten, Horecanytt (January 2, 2008). Folkevin i ny drakt As the successive imports of wine from Algeria, Tunisia and Chile marketed under other names failed to sell well, an initiative was made in 1949 to compose a new blended wine for the people, affordable and easily drinkable. Purchasing director Haakon Svensson was given a set budget and assigned to negotiate deals with wine producers, initially securing deals with winemakers from Le Midi, Valencia and Algeria, with an aim to produce a blended wine that could decrease the Norwegian people's vast consumption of liquor, at the time ten to one the ratio of the consumption of wine. On sale from 1 February 1950 at the total price of NOK 6 (NOK 4 + 50% tax), the price remained fixed until 1968, causing it to be widely known as \\"the six kroner wine\\". By 1970 it cost NOK 7, and by 1990 it had risen to NOK 43. Normally blended from 5 to 10 wines, from locations that later also included Cyprus and Turkey, R√∏dvin was in 1972 responsible for 40% of all wine sold in Norway, leading up to the peak of its popularity in the 1980s. In 1981 there was sold 3.8 million liter, while by 2000 R√∏dvin production had been transferred to Arcus and annual sales had decreased to 700,000 liters. In August 2014 it was announced that bottles of R√∏dvin would be removed from the standard Vinmonopolet shelf selection by the following October, following a run of 54 vintages, after this to be available by order under the altered name \\"Folkets Originale R√∏dvin\\" (the people's original red wine).N√¶r√∏, Tore Schultz, osloby.no (August 9, 2014).

It is the largest indoor shopping center in the Capital District, and the third largest in the State of New York. The mall's anchor stores are Macy's, Carhartt, Dick's Sporting Goods, Dave & Buster's, Burlington, Pottery Barn, JCPenney, Lord & Taylor (closing 2020), Best Buy, Regal Cinemas, and Forever 21.  History  =Pre-1970s= Crossgates Mall is built is within the Albany Pine Bush, one of the largest of the world's 20 inland pine barrens. It was formed thousands of years ago, following the drainage of Lake Albany. When Europeans arrived in the early 17th century, the Pine Bush was in use as hunting grounds and firewood supply of the Mohawk nation of the Haudenosaunee to the west along the Mohawk River, and the Mahican to the east, along the Hudson River. = Proposal, Opposition, and Construction= In the 1970s, Syracuse-based Pyramid Management Group, Inc. (Pyramid) began purchasing lands within the Pine Bush with the intent to develop a shopping mall, but it wasn't until 1978 that their plans were revealed to the public. The initial proposal called for a $50 million mall on a 175-acre lot with six anchor stores, 100 vendors, a food court, and direct access from the Adirondack Northway. Opposition from residents and environmentalists was rapid and widespread. The first public hearing on the project was attended by more than 300 speakers, the majority of whom opposed the projects on the grounds that it would destroy a large swath of the unique and ecologically sensitive Pine Bush, would contribute to the continuing urbanization of Guilderland, would cause traffic congestion, and would not provide the claimed economic benefits, among other objections. Despite widespread opposition, a petition from a citizen's group known as the Concerned Citizens Against Crossgates, and an embattled town board, the project was approved rapidly. In opposition, the town supervisor at the time stated: \\"Taking into consideration that the majority of the correspondence I got was opposed to the Crossgates, and (a) feeling that I have that, in the future that part of town will just be a conglomeration of traffic, I am forced to vote in the negative.\\" The decision was the cause of at least one town official's resignation. During the four years following the unveiling of the proposal, the town board only voted unanimously on one aspect of the project: that the town should receive its full share of the resulting tax revenue. =Early Years= The mall opened on March 4, 1984. Although Pyramid had initially planned for a 1.3 million square footprint with six anchors, at opening it occupied only 975,000 square feet and had four anchors: a Caldor, Jordan Marsh, Filene‚Äôs, and JCPenney. Of the roughly 170 smaller vendor spaces, 80 were occupied. It was the seventh enclosed shopping mall built by Pyramid, part of a nationwide boom in shopping center openings that peaked at 2,600 in 1985. The opening was attended by thousands of prospective customers from across the Capital District. The vast majority of these came by car, leading to backups and delays on Western Avenue, indicative of the transportation issues that would dominate discussions and negotiations between Pyramid, residents, and the town for years to come. Throughout the 1980s, Pyramid sought to expand the mall into the footprint originally envisioned, but were repeatedly rebuffed by the Town. In October 1988, while standing in Town Hall, the Guilderland Town Supervisor told a reporter with the Altamont Enterprise: > \\"Every once in a while a representative of Pyramid will come in here and > say, 'we want to expand'. And our response has always been, 'if you want to > expand, you've got to do something about the traffic on Route 20.' What > we're talking about is a direct connection between Crossgate's ring road and > the Northway, which is a multi-million dollar project.\\" =Expansion= In October 1994 the mall underwent an expansion nearly doubling its footprint to almost 1.7 million square feet and providing space for up to 250 stores. Following this expansion, Lord & Taylor, Regal Cinemas, and a new Filene‚Äôs store opened as anchors. The original Filene‚Äôs space was partially occupied by a Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods. This expansion has been cited as a contributing to the decline of other Capital District shopping centers in the 1990s. In 1996, anchor Jordan Marsh was replaced by Macy's when the Jordan Marsh brand was retired. In 1998, Pyramid attempted to double the mall footprint to 3.6 million square feet for a new recreation facility, and sought to raze a nearby residential neighborhood for an 8-story hotel. Following widespread citizen protests, the Guilderland Town Board rejected the required zoning changes. In 1999, Cohoes Fashions relocated their store from their historic location in downtown Cohoes, New York. In 2007 their parent company, Burlington Coat Factory, closed many of the Cohoes locations and branded those that remained as Burlington Coat Factory. Caldor went out of business the same year. Their space at the mall's center court was split between a Best Buy on the second floor and an H&M; on the first. =Diversification= Beginning in the early 2000s, brick-and-mortar stores had begun steadily ceding market share to online retailers. Department stores and smaller retailers were increasingly under fiscal strain. In 2003, the owner of the Lord & Taylor brand announced the closure of their anchor store, which had first opened following the 1994 expansion. The brand reopened at the mall in 2014, under a different parent company. In October 2019, Forever 21 announced the shuttering of the Crossgates location, as part of a bankruptcy-initiated closure of 170 locations across the country. In an effort to limit financial risk brought on by online retailers, in the 2010s Pyramid began to diversify the mall's interior tenants away from retail and toward live entertainment and restaurants. By 2017 they have shifted up to 20% of the vendor spaces to non- retail by opening such venues as a comedy club, an escape room, and concert halls. In August 2017 Pyramid announced a plan to construct a hotel in partnership with Hilton chain. The hotel opened in 2018, achieving a strategic goal Pyramid had held since at least the late 1990s. It opened under the Homewood Suites, aimed at long-term stays, and the Tru brand, focused on providing lower-priced rooms aimed at younger travelers. Both brands are owned by Hilton. On the heels of the hotel opening, Pyramid announced a plan to develop three sites adjacent to mall. Initially, this called for 222 residential units and a Costco. The latter was to be developed on a lot that would require demolition of a \\"ghost neighborhood\\", consisting of homes Pyramid had purchased in the preceding two decades. Within a month, local environmental watchdog group Save the Pine Bush, residents, and other groups sued Pyramid alleging that clearcutting of the Costco site had occurred in violation of the SEQRA and the 14th Amendment. The suit was later dismissed. =COVID-19 pandemic= In March 2020, Crossgates was one of several Capital District shopping centers whose owners reduced their hours amid the COVID-19 pandemic and then shuttered following a Governor mandate. Although some of the tenants were deemed \\"essential\\" and stayed open during the pandemic, such as Best Buy, the mall interior was dark for nearly three months. Crossgates reopened mid-July 2020, when the Capital District entered Phase 4. Lord & Taylor closed their anchor store in early August, after it and its parent company, Le Tote, declared bankruptcy. Seeking to cut costs and recoup losses, Pyramid sued the Town of Guilderland to halve their tax assessment, as well as seven tenants for back rent. Despite losses caused by COVID-19 and financial woes at their Syracuse properties, Pyramid maintained their plan to develop an adjacent complex and a Costco. On October 5, 2020, Cineworld announced it would close all Regal, Cineworld, and Picturehouse Cinemas locations in the US, UK, and Ireland indefinitely, beginning October 8. CEO Mooky Greidinger specifically cited that the continued reluctance of New York to allow cinemas to open was the main factor, as well as the lack of tentpole Hollywood films (referring to the delay of No Time to Die from November to April 2021 as being the \\"last straw\\") due to the high cost of operating a cinema without new releases. Mooky argued that the studios were holding off on new releases until New York cinemas reopen (accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being inflexible, despite having allowed other forms of indoor businesses to resume operations), and that the company only planned to reopen its cinemas once it is confident there is a \\"clear\\" and \\"solid\\" lineup of new releases.  Description  Crossgates Mall is a super-regional shopping mall located in the hamlet of Westmere, in the Albany, New York suburb of Guilderland. Vehicular access is available from Western Avenue, Washington Avenue Extension, and a ramp just south of Adirondack Northway terminus. There are 10-12 parking lots. Public transit is available via a major bus stop served by multiple Capital District Transportation Authority routes. Both Crossgates Mall and the nearby Crossgates Commons shopping plaza are owned and operated by the Pyramid Management Group, Inc. through multiple subsidiaries. The mall has a gross leasable area of and features 212 stores and restaurants as well as an 18-screen IMAX Regal Cinema theater. As of 2007, it was anchored by a Lord & Taylor, Macy's, and JCPenney. Other major tenancies include Burlington, Best Buy, Pottery Barn, Dick's Sporting Goods, Zara, Forever 21, and the Apple Store. Previous anchors and major tenants include Caldor, Jordan Marsh, Cohoes Fashions, and The Wiz. Design The mall's interior is typical of Pyramid Companies' mall developments in the mid 1980s and early 1990s. For example, the Silver City Galleria in Taunton, Massachusetts, also developed by Pyramid, opened in 1992 and shares similar interior elements.

The mill is still operational; the Shire of Toodyay protected the then dilapidated building in 1975 and established the Toodyay Tourist Centre. It is now one of the town's main tourist attractions. History The mill was built in 1870 by local builder George Hassel for Dan Connor, a store owner. It was the third built in the Toodyay district. The mill originally had a shingle roof, no turret and a slide from the first floor doorway to wagon height. This was used to slide bags of flour onto the wagons waiting below. Little is known about the internal workings of the mill. The original grind mill is seen on the lawn outside. The grindstone machine was originally from Newgain and donated by Langley Lefroy and initially owned by the Twines. The big wheel drive mechanism was originally from the mill at Northam. Toodyay Road Board Power Station circa 1920s During the 1880s Charles Marris leased and eventually bought the mill, operating it until the turn of the century. The flour produced was of very high quality, presenting the established Drummond and Monger mills with good competition. In 1870, flour from the mill won an award at an exhibition in Melbourne. In 1917, Charles Marris sold the mill to Charles Lukin, who reconditioned the building as a power station for the town. The first power generating engine was installed in a galvanized iron extension to the rear of the mill. In 1921, a major fire destroyed all machinery within the power house. The charred top floor roofing beams are still evident today. After the fire, engineer Mr N. Garvey installed a new Stockport gas engine in the annex to provide power to the town. This generator had a unique starting procedure. The operator would place a foot on a flywheel spoke, held onto the roof timbers and treadmill the belt. When sufficient momentum was obtained, the operator would jump off the wheel and turn the magneto on. In 1922 the Road Board assumed control of the power service. The generator provided lighting to the town from 4pm to midnight, seven nights a week. The Municipal Council ran the power station until 1955, when the electrical grid operated by the State Energy Commission was connected to Toodyay. The building was deserted from 1955 to 1975. Current use In 1975 the Shire of Toodyay established the Toodyay Tourist Centre in the mill building, following a restoration project which included the construction of a staircase to the upper floors. The engine was donated to the Shire in 1974 and ex industrial factory engineer Graham Jones helped move the engine to its present location. Due to the engine's size, bricks from around the front door had to be removed.

Born in Parma, after moving to Brescia as a young man, Turati worked on newspapers and became one of the editors at the liberal Provincia di Brescia; he attended law classes, but never graduated. An irredentist and advocate of Italy entering World War I, he volunteered for the front in 1915. In 1918, he returned to Brescia as head editor of the same newspaper. In 1920, he joined the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento - a year later, the National Fascist Party (Partito Nazionale Fascista, or PNF). Active in trade unionism for the r√©gime-backed corporatist enterprises, Turati was a secretary for the Brescia Fascio. In 1926-1930, he was secretary of the PNF, helping in the consolidation of Benito Mussolini's rule. He doubled this task with leadership positions in sports: a Federtennis president, a Federazione Italiana di Atletica Leggera one, and leader of the Italian National Olympic Committee (jobs held in 1928-1930). In 1930-1931, he was a member of the International Olympic Committee. Turati was also the inventor of a short-lived and supposedly uniquely Italian team sport which he called volata. Between 1924 and 1934, Turati served in the Italian Chamber of Deputies; in 1931-1932, he was the editor-in-chief of La Stampa. Accused of intrigues against other members of the PNF, Turati was demoted from official positions, and was confined on Rhodes (an Italian possession at the time) in 1933. Redeemed in 1937, he was released and assigned the task of carrying out a massive agricultural experiment in Ethiopia (part of Italian East Africa). He had to return to Italy after the project failed the next year. Turati moved away from the political scene, and worked as a legal consultant. He was however opposed to Italy's entry into World War II, as well as to the Nazi-protected Italian Social Republic; at the end of the war, he nevertheless faced trial, but was acquitted on all charges.

The Quebec Consumer Protection Act, which prohibited advertising to children through cartoons, was challenged by the Kellogg Company on the basis that it affected TV stations across the country. The Court held that the regulation of advertising is a matter within the authority of the province, and that the Act was valid law under the Property and Civil Rights power allocated to the province under section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Reasons of the court Justice Martland found that the pith and substance of the legislation was the regulation of advertising which he identified as a matter allocated to the provincial government under the property and civil rights power. He noted that the regulation of advertising and was also part of a larger provincial scheme of regulating business practices, all of which fell within the purview of the provincial government. The encroachment upon the regulation of broadcasting was found to only be incidental to the primary subject of advertising, and so was valid. Chief Justice Laskin, in dissent, disagreed with Martland and argued that the regulation must be read down to exclude the regulation of expression. He pointed out how in McKay v. The Queen (1965) the provincial law regulating signs was read down to exclude the regulation of federal voting signs. Likewise, in Johannesson v. West St. Paul (1952) a provincial law that regulated the zoning of aerodromes was not valid as it encroached on federal power to regulate air transportation. See also * Irwin Toy Ltd. v.

Retrieved 18 May 2013 He began his recording career around 1891 recording for the New England Phonograph Company. He became famous for his series of comedy sketches about an Irish character named Michael Casey. The recordings consisted of rapid-fire cross-talk between two characters, with Hunting taking all the parts.Sound of the Hound, Russell Hunting stories #1 1894: Mephistopheles in red tights haunts Fred Gaisberg, 14 June 2011 Retrieved 21 May 2013 From 1892 he recorded the Michael Casey skits for Columbia Records, as well as for other companies, and several of his recordings such as \\"Michael Casey at the Telephone\\" and \\"Michael Casey Taking the Census\\" (both 1892) became famous. In 1893, Hunting recorded the earliest version of the baseball poem \\"Casey at the Bat\\" (Columbia Graphophone Grand, #9649). After that, his popular \\"Casey\\" format was often imitated. In 1896 Hunting founded the first independent magazine for the recording industry, Phonoscope, and set up a phonograph shop in New York with his partner Charles M. Carlson. He also, about this time, recorded a series of indecent recordings, for saloons and amusement arcades on Coney Island, using pseudonyms such as Manly Tempest and Willy Fathand. Hunting was identified by his distinctive voice, and a detective working for Anthony Comstock, the founder of the newly formed New York Society for the Suppression of Vice arrested him for violating obscenity laws. Hunting was found guilty and spent three months in prison.Sound of the Hound, Russell Hunting stories #2 1896: obscenity, filth, lasciviousness; the record business discovers smut sells!, 15 June 2011.

In 1898, a cylinder record company called Leeds Talk-O-Phone had Hunting record a skit, \\"Cohen at the Telephone\\". He was paid $5 per \\"round\\", as pantographic duplication yielded about 100 acceptable duplicates of a cylinder. At the end of the fourth round (recording into 4 machines yielded 16 masters) he saw a man carting 24 recordings of his \\"Cohen at the Telephone\\" away at the end of the studio. Hunting accused Leeds Talk-O- Phone of attempting to defraud him. The company, according to Hunting, made good upon being threatened with exposure. Hunting traveled to England in 1898, and became recording director of Edison Bell Records. After the United Kingdom became involved in the Boer War in 1899, he recorded \\"The Departure of the Troop Ship\\", with the sounds of \\"crowds at the quayside, bands playing the troops up the gang-plank, bugles sounding 'All ashore', farewell cries of 'Don‚Äôt forget to write', troops singing \\"Home Sweet Home\\", which gradually receded in the distance, and the far-away mournful hoot of the steamer whistle.\\" According to Fred Gaisberg, Nellie Melba said that the record influenced her above anything else to make records.Sound of the Hound, Russell Hunting day #4: Patriotic recordings, 17 June 2011.

Then, in 1905, John Kaiser became the voice of \\"Casey\\" for Edison. Hunting also recorded skits for Zonophone in Britain. In 1904, Hunting and Louis Sterling formed the Sterling Record Company, which became the Russell Hunting Record Company Ltd., in London. The company produced Sterling cylinder records and Linguaphone language instruction records, but went out of business in 1908. Hunting then joined the Path√© company in Paris as director of recording, traveling the world on the company's behalf, and setting up its US arm before returning to Path√© to take charge of its European recording activities. He also maintained an occasional recording career, recording \\"The Departure of the First U.S. Troops for France\\", again with sound effects of bands and crowds, in New York in 1917.

The Court split four to four on whether the law was valid. Chief Justice Fauteux, held that the Act had an effect on inter-provincial trade and so it could not be upheld as a \\"matter of a local nature\\" under section 92 (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867.

The story portrays George Dane, a harried writer who dreams of escaping to a place where he can rest and recover before returning to the grind of his overloaded life. Dane gets his wish, at least in a memorable fantasy. Plot summary After a long night of unfinished work, the morning dawns for George Dane, a writer whose life has grown too busy with his career and relationships. An expected breakfast guest appears and suddenly Dane is transported to a new environment, the great good place of the title. James does not describe this place as an unreal paradise. Guests even have to pay for service. The place seems more like a retreat or getaway resort, where Dane eventually recovers his peace of mind. Dane spends three weeks at the place, and tells a Brother of his former life and the mysterious breakfast guest. Back in his usual world, Dane is eventually awakened by his servant after eight hours' sleep, and he realizes that his vision is gone. But the mysterious guest has straightened up his study, and Dane's life seems clearer and more manageable. Major themes The place that Dane visits in his dream --or his supernatural and time-expanding experience, as James cleverly doesn't specify--seems a combination of retreat house, convent, country home, hotel, spa, resort and club. It's a very worldly place, not at all an earthly paradise or a Dante-like afterlife or an achievement of nirvana. Dane does not become a different person or encounter strange beings. He just meets ordinary people like himself who need a break from the grind. Leon Edel even sniffed that the place seems rather \\"mundane and country-clubbish.\\" James might not have taken this as particularly hurtful criticism, because he seems to have intended the great good place as something not out of the realm of normal human experience. Rather it's a temporary rest-stop to recharge and refresh, an accessible and comforting place instead of a weird or frightening one. Critical evaluation When a book reviewer of The Morning Post criticized the story, James's friend H. G. Wells wrote to the paper's editor defending it: \\"His review cuts me the more keenly because 'The Great Good Place', concerning which story he uses this phrase, 'a succession of incoherent remarks and its drift quite unascertainable', has been a source of particular delight to me. I have read and re-read it many times. It seems to me to be just one of those happy, perfect things that come to reward the good artist for many laborious, not quite perfect days. And then‚Äîyour reviewer's voice is heard. I cannot imagine the lack of imagination that fails to see that restful place Mr James has so happily invented.\\" ‚ÄòTo the Editor of the Morning Post‚Äô, 12 October 1902; Smith (1998) Correspondence of H G Wells: Volume 1, 1880-1903, London: Pickering and Chatto, pp. 362-63. Many critics, such as Edward Wagenknecht and Clifton Fadiman, have praised the story as a parable about a necessary retreat from the overwhelming detail of an overstuffed life. Others, such as Edel and Pelham Edgar, have found James' great good place too routine or lazy or simply uninteresting. James himself turned coy about the story and its origins, refusing in his New York Edition preface to discuss it much at all. He spends exactly 58 words on the tale, and says little more than that it \\"embodies a calculated effect.\\" References * Introduction to Henry James: Stories of the Supernatural by Leon Edel (New York: Taplinger Publishing Company 1970) * The Tales of Henry James by Edward Wagenknecht (New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Co. 1984) * A Henry James Encyclopedia by Robert L.

It concerns the adventures of Oswald Bastable, an Edwardian era soldier stationed in India, and his adventures in an alternate universe, in his own future, wherein the First World War never happened. It is the first part of Moorcock's A Nomad of the Time Streams trilogy and, in its use of speculative technology (such as airships) juxtaposed against an Edwardian setting, it is widely considered to be one of the first steampunk novels. The novel was first published by Ace Books as part of their Ace Science Fiction Specials series. Plot summary The novel is transcribed by 'Michael Moorcock' (the author's fictional grandfather) in 1903. Holidaying at the remote Rowe Island, he befriends Oswald Bastable, an ex-soldier stowaway who seems confused and disoriented beyond what could be explained by his opium addiction, and who is tormented by great guilt from an action he performed in his past. Bastable agrees to tell Moorcock the story, and begins his narrative with his experiences in North East India in 1902, sent as part of a British expedition to deal with Sharan Kang, an Indian high priest at the temple of Teku Benga, a mysterious and seemingly supernaturally powerful region. After a confrontation with Kang and his men, Bastable finds himself lost and alone in the caves around the 'Temple of the Future Buddha', where he is assaulted by a mysterious force and knocked into unconsciousness. When he awakes, and escapes the caves, the Temple is in ruins, as if a great amount of time has passed. He is soon found and picked up by a massive airship, where he learns that it is in fact the year 1973, but not the one that the reader would recognise. In this alternate future, the First World War never happened, and the colonial powers continue to assert dominance over their empires‚Äîfor example, India remains a British territory, though Winston Churchill had been viceroy in this alternate future as well as in Bastable's own. At first, Bastable marvels at the wonders that await him in his 'future' ‚Äî London is a clean and peaceful city, and the world seems to be a utopia, held in balance by the great empires. Gaining employment amongst the great airship armadas, however, he soon comes into contact with a troop of anarchists ‚Äì among them a mysterious woman named Una Persson, and a Russian revolutionary named Ulianov. He initially maintains a patriotic resistance to their activities, but gradually discovers the truth: life is peaceful for the dominant empires but the seeming utopia of the empires' home countries is based on decades of unimpeded and unopposed colonial oppression, brutality and domination of their territories. As the First World War never happened to bankrupt the European colonial empires and begin the gradual liberalization and freedom of the colonies, imperialism remains unchecked and the world is greatly unfair and unjust. The United Kingdom, France, the Tsarist Russian Empire, the German Empire, Japan, the Italian Empire and the United States ruthlessly dominate this world and suppress anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist dissent. Bastable, a fair and honourable man, is outraged by the cruelty, injustice and horror revealed to him, and begins to fight for the oppressed peoples of the world (opposing, amongst others, his former friend in the airship service, Major Enoch Powell). Tragically, his actions result in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima at the hands of the anarchists. The atomic blast knocks him loose from the alternate 1973, sending him to a new 1903. Wracked with guilt over his part in the destruction of countless millions of innocent lives, and dreading the 'future' of science and imperialism gone mad, Bastable makes his way to the caves of Teku Benga and returns to 1903, but alas, not his own original time. His experiences have altered him too much to settle into life in this new alternate universe; both his experiences and this sense of dislocation have driven him to opium. The novel ends with Bastable disappearing mysteriously, much to the 1903 Moorcock's amazement; and a postscript from the modern author Moorcock, establishing his grandfather's death on the Western Front in 1916. Series connections * This book is followed by The Land Leviathan and The Steel Tsar. * As with many of Moorcock's other books, this book is connected to his larger 'Eternal Champion' multiverse series; as such, many frequently recurring characters / character names (including Una Persson, Major Nye and, in later editions, Count von Bek) appear in the novel. * Oswald Bastable is a character created by author E. Nesbit for her book The Story of the Treasure Seekers.  Genre elements  = Famous personages = As with most alternate history novels, a variety of famous figures are mentioned and raised as being part of the fabric of the alternative society. These include: *Winston Churchill as a former Viceroy of India; *Enoch Powell as an airship major; in some editions the character is named \\"Howell.\\" *Mick Jagger is a well-mannered junior army officer *Vladimir Lenin (using his real name Vladimir Ulyanov) as an aged revolutionary, the Russian Revolution having never happened; *Leon Trotsky is mentioned by Lenin as having abandoned his revolutionary ambitions and become a \\"respectable\\" businessman; *A Californian boy scout troop leader named Reagan (who claims to have powerful connections, partly through being a member of the Rough Riders) appears; this would seem to be a reference to then-California Governor Ronald Reagan. In early editions the character is named \\"Egan\\" *Prominent spokesperson of the left-wing German student movement, Rudi Dutschke, appears as the Prussian nobleman-turned anarchist Count Rudolf von Dutschke. He is close friends with his mentor figure Lenin, whom he fondly relates to as \\"Uncle Vladimir\\". *Joseph Conrad as the airship captain Joseph Korzeniowski (which was his real name). = Cultural allusions = One of the first ships Bastable flies on is called the Loch Ness. He makes a joke that it is a monster, although the term Loch Ness Monster was not coined until 1930s. = The British Empire and airships = The assumption that survival of the British Empire as a political entity would entail survival of the airship as the main or only way of travelling by air was taken up by various other alternate British Empires fiction narratives (otherwise considerably different from each other) after Moorcock's 1971 Warlord of the Air, most notably At the Narrow Passage (1973) by Richard C. Meredith, Great Work of Time (1989) by John Crowley, The Two Georges (1995) by Harry Turtledove and Richard Dreyfuss, and The Peshawar Lancers (2002) by S. M. Stirling.

It is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Description Standing 1.52 metres (approximately 5 feet) tall, with a gadrooned everted lip, it has a deep frieze carved with a mythological bas-relief that successfully defies secure identification: a half-draped female figure Iphigenia seated below a statue of a goddess on a high plinth, restored as Diana, with heroic warriors on either side, perhaps Agamemnon and either Achilles or Odysseus standing to either side. Two fluted loop handles rise from satyrs' heads on either side of the acanthus-leaf carved base, and it stands on a spreading gadrooned base on a low square plinth. History The vase reappeared in the 1598 inventory of the Villa Medici, Rome, but its origin is unknown.

It was released in the UK (Marble Arch LP-MAL 718) in September 1967. History In the mid-1960s Pye Records launched budget record label Marble Arch Records to release older material on inexpensive albums in the United Kingdom. Several of Donovan's 1965 recordings for Pye were selected for release in 1967 as Universal Soldier. Donovan's version of \\"Universal Soldier\\" was a hit EP in 1965, and that name recognition was intended to boost sales. Universal Soldier was a unique release because it collected the entire Universal Soldier EP, the b-side to \\"Catch the Wind\\", and the entire \\"Turquoise\\" single; all of which had appeared on LP format in the United Kingdom. The strategy of compiling non-album tracks paid off, and Universal Soldier reached No. 5 in the United Kingdom and remained on the charts for 18 weeks. Marble Arch would go on to release several more Donovan compilations to significantly less interest, including an edited What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid in 1968 and an edited Fairytale in 1969.

Parishioners would process around the parish once a year, bearing rushes. They would end up at the parish church and place the rushes on the floor of the church, to replace worn-out rushes. In modern times the ceremony is practised only in parts of northern England including Lancashire and Cumbria among others. History According to John Cutting, the earliest record of rushbearing is 1385 at Tavistock. The custom of strewing cut vegetation on the floors of churches began at an earlier date: the plants commonly used were hay, straw or rushes and together with strewing herbs they improved the comfort for those using the church. Before the Reformation churches served for many secular as well as religious purposes and seating was not usual until the early years of the 16th century. Renewal of the floor covering was usually carried out before major festivals such as Easter and the patronal festival. Since these were among the few times in the year available for merrymaking ceremonies grew up and were handed down by tradition.Gascoigne, Margaret (2002) Discovering English Customs and Traditions. Prince's Risborough: Shire ; pp. 8, 16, 18, 24, 35, 44, 66 As towns grew in size, the places where rushes still grew were further and further from the church itself. Also changes in the way churches were furnished such as box pews and in the 19th century more effective heating in churches made the ceremonies redundant. The ceremonies either lapsed, or became longer and larger. The earliest depictions of rushcarts are in Rush- Bearing (1891) by Burton. One illustration shows morris dancers and a rushcart at Failsworth Pole, near Manchester, about 1820. Another, from 1821, is a painting by Alexander Wilson of an event at Long Millgate, Manchester.Wilson, Alexander \\"Rush Bearing at Long Millgate, Manchester\\", 1821, Sphinx Fine Art. Retrieved on 2011-01-14. They now appear to be confined to the north west of England. At least 5 rushbearing ceremonies still occur in Cumbria where girls dressed in green process around the town. The Rushcart grew into a festival held on the annual wakes week or mill holidays. There would be music, dancing and other entertainments. Each village would try to outdo the others by building a bigger or more elaborate structure with the front covered by a sheet decorated with tinsel and artificial flowers and hung with polished copper, brass and silver household items. > Behold the rush-cart, and the throng > Of lads and lasses pass along: > Now, view the nimble morris-dancers, > The blithe, fantastic, antic prancers, > Bedeck'd in gaudiest profusion, > With ribbons in a sweet confusion > Of brilliant colours, richest dyes, > Like wings of moths and butterflies- > Waving white kerchiefs in the air, > And crossing here, re-crossing there, > And up and down, and everywhere: > Springing, bounding, gaily skipping, > Deftly, briskly, no one tripping: > All young fellows, blithe and hearty, > Thirty couples in the party ... > ‚Äî From The Village Festival by Droylsden poet Elijah Ridings. The coming of the railways led to a decline in interest in Rushcarts as the local population were able to travel further afield for their annual break. The Rushcarts eventually died out in the early 20th century. There is a curious similarity between this festival and the Hindu festival of the chariot of Jagannath. Didsbury France and Woodall in their A New History of Didsbury give the text of an anonymous account of the rushcart perhaps of the 1860s and entries in the churchwardens' accounts for 1733 and 1808 among other statements recorded by local people. It is uncertain when the rushbearing was ended in Didsbury, certainly not before 1870. The associated rowdyism was not thought desirable by the more sober parishioners of the time according to Alfred Burton in his Rushbearing.France, E.; Woodall, T. F. (1976) A New History of Didsbury. Manchester: E. J. Morten. pp. 54-58. However Fletcher Moss's Fifty Years of Public Work includes photographs of the Didsbury rushcarts of 1882 and 1911, the last occasion. (If the dates are genuine Burton is either mistaken or it was discontinued for some years and then revived.) In the nearby township of Chorlton cum Hardy, the ceremony took place on the eve of the last Sunday in July though very little is known about how long it continued to be observed.Lloyd, John M. (1972) The Township of Chorlton-cum-Hardy; p. 78. Manchester: E. J. Morten, Fallowfield An account of the Fallowfield Rushcart was given by Annie C. Williamson in her book about the township (1888). It was part of the Fallowfield Wakes celebrations and often included Robin Hood and Maid Marian seated on a pile of rushes heaped upon a farm cart. The cart was accompanied by the sound of pipes, penny whistles, clogs being used to beat time on the ground, and the shouts of the people.Sussex, Gay & Helm, Peter (1984) Looking Back at Rusholme & Fallowfield. Altrincham: Willow; p. 5  Gorton  The Gorton rushbearing ceremony was relaunched by the Gorton Morrismen in 1980 having last been celebrated in 1874. It ceased again in 1991 but was resurrected \\"one last time\\" in 2009 to celebrate the 100th year of Gorton becoming a part of Manchester.

The current building is a reconstruction of the original church, which was destroyed at the direction of then General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, in 1936. The original cathedral Upon recovering Moscow from the armies of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in 1612 at the close of the Time of Troubles, Prince Dmitry Pozharsky attributed his success to the divine help of the icon Theotokos of Kazan, to whom he had prayed on several occasions. From his private funds, he financed construction of a wooden church to the Virgin of Kazan on Red Square in Moscow, which was first mentioned in historical records in 1625. After the diminutive shrine was destroyed by a fire in 1632, Tsar Michael I, ordered it replaced with a brick church. The one-domed edifice, featuring several tiers of kokoshniki, a wide gallery, and a tented belfry, was consecrated in October 1636. Kazan Cathedral was considered one of the most important churches in Moscow. Annually on the anniversary of the liberation of Moscow from Poland-Lithuania, a solemn parade led by the Patriarch and the Tsar carried a processional cross from the Kremlin. By the end of the 17th century, the church building was expanded and received a bell tower and a redesigned entrance. Numerous other renovations of the cathedral were undertaken during the imperial period, notably during 1801, 1805, and 1865, and much of the original design was lost behind later additions. The history of the cathedral was tempestuous, as evidenced by the fact that its archpriest Avvakum led the party of religious dissenters, or Old Believers. The distinguished Russian restorer Peter Baranovsky supervised a complete reconstruction of the church's exterior to its original design in 1929‚Äì1932. Some specialists , however, have found the accuracy of this reconstruction lacking. In 1936, when Red Square was being prepared for holding the military parades of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin ordered the square cleared of churches. Although efforts were made by Baranovsky to save it, he could not prevent the Kazan Cathedral from being demolished (though Baranovsky did manage to save another of Red Square's cathedrals, Saint Basil's Cathedral, from destruction). In its place, initially a temporary building housing offices for the Communist International was erected. It was later used as a summer caf√©. A temporary chapel marking the original site of the church was built in 1990 as part of the church restoration project, shortly before the collapse of the USSR. The rebuilding After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Kazan Cathedral was the first church to be completely rebuilt after having been destroyed by the Communists.

(1950) Lapin sota. WSOY  Background  Though open fighting had erupted already in mid September at Gogland between the Finnish and German troops the relations between the two sides in northern Finland had remained fairly good. As per earlier planned Operation Birke Germans had been evacuating material and troops to safer positions further north in the Finland. The actual German interest in the Finnish Lapland was in keeping hold of the Petsamo area and its nickel mines. On the other hand, the German and Finnish troops had been fighting together for three years, and many personal friendships had been forged between the two armies. Thus, until now, there had been very few actual hostilities between the German and Finnish troops. Until the battle of Tornio Finnish and German troops had been performing 'autumn maneuvers' in which the pace of the German withdrawal was matched with pace of the following Finnish troops with mutual agreement thus avoiding open conflict between the two sides. The Finns, however, were forced by their peace agreement with the USSR to forcibly remove German troops from their territory. Thus the invasion of Tornio was planned and executed to surprise the Germans and open a front behind their backs along the Swedish border. Lieutenant-General Siilasvuo was the officer in charge of the operations in Lapland and planned an amphibious assault near Tornio in time with an overland attack towards Kemi; both operations had Oulu as their base. The Finns used three cargo vessels with an armament of single anti- aircraft machine gun in each ship. They had no air or naval support during the 80 mile sail from Oulu to Tornio.  Initial operations  = German strength = German forces at the direction of Kemi (and Tornio) were grouped under Division Kr√§utler. These were 1st battalion of 139th Mountain Jaeger Brigade (Gebirgsj√§ger-Brigade 139), 6th Jaeger Battalion (J√§ger-Bataillon 6), 6th SS Mountain Reconnaissance Battalion (SS-Gebirgs-Aufkl√§rungs-Abteilung 6), and 6th SS Infantry Battalion (SS-Sch√ºtzen-Bataillon \\"Nord\\" 6). Due to the Finnish pressure from the south only the 6th SS Mountain Reconnaissance Battalion could be moved towards Tornio while the rest were tied down against the advancing Finns.Hyv√∂nen (1991) pp. 32‚Äì33 = Uprising at Tornio = The Finns had managed to get German permission to stage a battalion worth of men known as 'Detachment Pennanen' (fi. Osasto Pennanen) behind their lines in the subterfuge of protecting the key industrial facilities at Kemi. In addition to this force the Finnish civic guard had planned an uprising to take place at border town of Tornio. Major Thure Larjo, utilizing Finnish soldiers at the time on leave at the location and a single company of air defence soldiers, managed to take control of the town of Tornio on the west bank of the Torne river and contain the few Germans who were at the site. However the planned attack on the large German supply depot near the railroad station of Tornio on the east bank of the river failed. However the Finns were able to send a train to assist the arriving landing force. Though the uprising was not as successful as had been hoped for it contributed to the confusion on the German side and also made it easier for the landing force to arrive undetected to the port of R√∂ytt√§, the outer port of Tornio. Actions of Detachment Pennanen at Kemi, namely capturing the port of Ajos, further mislead the initial German response to the landing operation into believing that the Finns would concentrate on Kemi instead of Tornio.Ahto (1980) pp. 161‚Äì162 = Landing at R√∂ytt√§ = The first elements of the Finnish 11th Infantry Regiment (JR 11) landed unopposed at the port of R√∂ytt√§ at 07:45 on 1 October and were welcomed by train which started transporting troops closer to the town. Lieutenant Colonel Halsti had planned to move his forces swiftly towards Kemi to secure the important bridges across the Kemi river ‚Äì however after learning from the Finnish forces which had secured the town that there could be a whole German battalion in the vicinity he chose more a cautious approach.Ahto (1980) pp. 157‚Äì160 Instead of moving towards Kemi JR 11 moved to secure the German supply depot located at Tornio railroad station. Arrival of Finnish battalions from R√∂ytt√§ took Germans by surprise since so far they had thought that they were dealing just with a local uprising. Both battalions of JR 11 which had moved towards the station got tied down into a battle where Germans showed near fanatical resistance. Still on 1 October the third battalion of JR 11 was cautiously moving towards Kemi when it encountered and interned a small German detachment sent to subdue the uprising at Tornio. The Germans were finally realizing the extent of the Finnish landing and uprising however they were not in a position to take action against the Finns at the time. The Torne river valley was essentially devoid of German forces and their forces at Kemi, under command of Division Kr√§utler, consisted of 4 battalions most of which had already been committed to delaying against the Finnish advance from the south along the coast.Ahto (1980) p. 165 = Response to landing = The Germans responded to the pleas for reinforcements by dispatching several units towards the area. One armored unit, the second company of Panzer Abteilung 211,Panzers in Finland, Kari Kuusala was sent from Rovaniemi towards Kemi over railroad with unit arriving already on morning of 2 October. Several infantry formations were detached from the groupings and rushed towards Tornio, these included one battalion from 379th Grenadier Regiment (Grenadier-Regiment 379), one from 206th Mountain Jaeger Regiment (Gebirgs-J√§ger-Regiment 206) as well as the whole of the Machine Gun Ski Brigade Finnland (MG-Ski-Brigade Finnland). Meanwhile, the Finns chose to further reinforce the landing instead of pushing hard from the south towards Kemi and started to ship more troops and equipment from Oulu to Tornio, the first of these to arrive was the 53rd Infantry Regiment (JR 53). The Finnish operation changed from a single regiment's diversionary attack into key operation involving several divisions.Ahto (1980) pp. 166‚Äì167, 177, 195 = 'Little-Berlin' = Very late in the evening of 1 October the Finnish troops of Infantry Regiment 11 captured a German supply depot ‚Äì which were colloquially known as 'little- Berlins' ‚Äì and found large stores of alcohol. Order and discipline disappeared from the 2nd battalion of and from most of 1st battalion as well. Later on even the newly arriving 2nd battalion of Infantry Regiment 53 was also accidentally directed to the same location with similar results. Events at 'little-Berlin' essentially meant that Finnish forces in the area lost a whole day and allowed Germans to marshal their forces. The Finns were starting to lose the initiative.Ahto (1980) pp. 173‚Äì174  Battle commences  = German attacks = On 3 October the forces the Germans had gathered together between Tornio and Kemi started moving towards Tornio. Two Finnish battalions from JR 11 and one from JR 53 faced three German battalions supported with armor and artillery. The initial German attempt in the morning was repulsed and several tanks were lost. Both sides now planned to attack which caused the flanking Finnish battalion to stumble into a German battalion which resulted in both getting tied down. This however did not prevent the German main attack from forcing the Finns to retreat who however managed to halt the German advance before the situation became too grave. Though the Finns had slight numerical superiority in infantry over the Germans the Finns had no artillery at all while the Germans could deploy several artillery batteries as well as several anti-tank guns. In the afternoon of 4 October the Germans attacked again this time managing to push the Finns to the Raumo river where the lines froze. Further German attempts to cross the Raumo river on 5 October were easily repulsed by the Finns.Ahto (1980) pp. 179‚Äì181, 186‚Äì188, 190‚Äì191 On the night preceding the 4 October German forces north of Tornio also attacked Finns who had advanced to Alavojakkala. Finns were forced to abandon the already surrounded fuel depot and withdraw further to the south. Later on 4 October the German forces north of Tornio consisting of 3 infantry battalions, more heavily armed than their Finnish counterparts, with artillery support faced 3 Finnish infantry battalions. Finns expected main German effort to be coming from direction of Kemi and were ill-prepared for strong German attack from the north which advanced rapidly forcing Finns to retreat several kilometers before forming new defensive line at Keropudas river.Ahto (1980) pp. 182, 185, 188‚Äì190Hyv√∂nen (1991) pp. 228‚Äì230 Lack of maps, low morale ‚Äì from fighting 'unnecessary war' ‚Äì and especially lack of heavy weapons contributed heavily to the Finnish failures. = Last attacks = On 6 October started the final German effort to drive Finns away from the Tornio and regain the transportation junction located there. They had deployed 6 infantry battalions with armor and artillery support for the operation, however instead of facing what two infantry regiments like they had expected Germans were on 6 October already facing 10 Finnish infantry battalions who had very limited armor (a company of T-26 tanks had been reactivated)http://www.jaegerplatoon.net/TANKS3.htm and artillery support. Again both sides choose to press on with attacks. Germans chose to attack simultaneously from north and east while Finns dispatched a full regiment to outflank the Germans to the north of Tornio. What resulted was some of the fiercest fighting during the Lapland War. German attack from the north managed to cross the Keropudas river but was stopped and tied down by resolute Finnish defence while attack from east failed to throw Finns from their positions.Ahto (1980) pp. 195‚Äì201Hyv√∂nen (1991) pp. 230‚Äì236, 256‚Äì269 Finnish 50th Infantry Regiment (JR 50) flanked the German Machine Gun Ski Brigade Finnland which had been tied down in its attack against defending JR 53 and reached the Torne river shore north of the German positions. On 7 October situation had grown bad to worse for the Germans, not only had their attacks been repulsed but attacking units had suffered heavy losses and the only reserve of the 20th Mountain Army, Brigade Finnland had been encircled north of Tornio just when the Soviet offensive in the Arctic started. However Germans were not the only ones in trouble, the Finnish JR 50 which had been rushed to the battle had left most of its equipment to R√∂ytt√§ and the supplies had to be carried by hand over swamps or marshy terrain. German attempts to relieve the encircled units did not succeed during 7 October. On 8 October Finns started to clean up the encirclement and attacked from all directions against surrounded Germans. Though many Germans were taken as POWs from the encirclement, many Germans managed to escape though they had suffered heavy casualties.Ahto (1980) pp. 201‚Äì207Hyv√∂nen (1991) pp. 269‚Äì276 = Later action at R√∂ytt√§ = Though Germans had been able to sortie their aircraft to R√∂ytt√§ even earlier the first serious attack as seen on 4 October when Germans were able to sortie a squadron of Stuka dive bombers to the port of R√∂ytt√§ while Finnish fighters assigned to provide air cover remained grounded due poor weather at their base further to the south. Dive bombers scored several hits to the Finnish transports unloading at the port sinking two of them, Bore IX and Maininki near the pier greatly hampering the unloading. Air raids at R√∂ytt√§ continued until the end of fighting at Tornio region.Ahto (1980) pp. 185‚Äì186Hyv√∂nen (1991) p. 252 Later on 6 October 1944 first small squadron from Finnish Navy consisting of gunboats H√§meenmaa and Uusimaa and patrol boats VMV 15 and VMV 16 arrived to the location to both provide anti-aircraft fire and to suppress German battery located at Laivaniemi within firing distance from the port which had kept harassing the Finnish effort to unload their transports. Auxiliary gunboat Aunus arrived later on. On the same day ‚Äì 6 October ‚Äì several Focke-Wulf Fw 200 bombers bombed Ry√∂tt√§ using Henschel Hs 293 glide bombs but without results.Hyv√∂nen (1991) pp. 253‚Äì254  Hostages  As a response to Finns landing at Tornio and capturing of German troops Germans started to take Finnish civilians as hostages, 132 from Kemi and further 130 from Rovaniemi, and attempted to trade these for the captured Germans. During fighting at Tornio a German negotiator arrived with the demand that Finns were required to release their prisoners and withdraw back to R√∂ytt√§ or otherwise Germans would execute the hostages. Finnish response was that such an action would result in immediate execution of all captured German POWs. German plan backfired since it had negligible impact of Finnish actions and only managed to further stain the German, especially Rendulic's, reputation in Finland. Hostage drama also offered Finnish media an excellent propaganda tool which could be worked against Germans. Germans realized their mistake and already on 12 October they abandoned the hostages to the advancing Finns at Jaatila.Ahto (1980) pp. 163, 172  Aftermath  While the fighting at Tornio still continued the German leadership made a decision to move from Operation Birke to Operation Nordlicht and abandon the most of northern Finland and Norway. Soviet offensive near Petsamo started soon after Germans had made their decision. Strict marching discipline enforced by Germans, German motorized units and effective demolition of transportation network meant that after battle of Tornio Finnish troops could effectively engage withdrawing Germans only at the time and place of Germans' choosing. The original Finnish plan had been to cut off the German troops around Kemi from all ways of retreat. However, the German troops were able to secure the road to Rovaniemi and retreat in an orderly fashion. On the other hand, the capture of Tornio effectively cut the German troops in Finland into two parts: one fighting in Tornio river valley, the other in Kemijoki river valley. Due to lack of roads, the supplies to the troops around Kemi would have to be routed through Rovaniemi. By October 8 the whole Kemi-Tornio area had been cleared. The German commander in the North, General Lothar Rendulic considered the capture of Tornio a betrayal by the Finns and ordered the scorched earth destruction of Lapland in retaliation. By attacking Tornio the Finnish government had proven to the Soviet Union that it was working actively to remove the German troops. In addition, the Finnish army had shown that it was capable and willing to turn its arms against the former cobelligerents.

The Medora Musical is a musical revue that produced each summer at the open-air Burning Hills Amphitheater near Medora, North Dakota. The musical is a look back at the \\"Wild West\\" days of the region and includes references to Theodore Roosevelt, who spent time in western North Dakota, including in the nearby Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The musical premiered at the amphitheatre in 1965 and is the successor to earlier shows about Roosevelt. Expected attendance for 2017 is estimated to be reach above 116,000. History The Burning Hills Amphitheater was built in 1958 one mile west of Medora, for the production of Old Four-Eyes, to help celebrate Theodore Roosevelt's 100th birthday. Thirty of the thirty-three performances were sold out. Due to waning interest in the following years after its first season Old Four-Eyes was closed in 1964. The show was replaced by Teddy Roosevelt Rides Again for the 1963 and 1964 seasons. In 1965 Harold Schafer, North Dakota businessman, president of the Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park and Badlands Association, purchased the amphitheater. After making some changes, including expanding the stage and the seating area, the Medora Musical opened with the help of Al Sheehan Productions in Minneapolis, which arranged an outdoor variety show. In 1986 the Schafer family and the Gold Seal company donated their share in Medora to the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation (TRMF). The foundation maintains the amphitheater and historical properties and other projects. In 1991, the amphitheatre received a $4.1 million facelift which enlarged the seating to 2,863, built new stage, installed escalators, and a wheelchair ramp. The new Burning Hills Amphitheater was completed in 1992 with the bolting in of the new seats. Additional construction was completed in 1997. In 2005 another renovation was made to the sets and the stage. Curt Wollan of StageWest Entertainment Inc. is the musical's longtime director and executive producer.  Burning Hills Amphitheater  The amphitheater was carved out of the side of the badlands in Burning Gulch by local volunteers, cast members and boys from the Home on the Range Ranch. The original theater seated between 1,000, and 1,200 people. It was constructed of wooden benches on the hillside with rustic buildings that formed a set around the stage. The natural acoustics of the hillside meant that no sound system would be needed.

He was previously known as Raja Sulaiman before being crowned Sultan. Sultan Sulaiman was knighted the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) by the United Kingdom in 1912 with the title Sir. The Sultan's rule was marked by Selangor joining the Federated Malay States, a federation of four protected states in the Malay Peninsula, including Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang, established by the British government in 1895, which lasted until 1946. It was during Sultan Sulaiman's reign that Istana Alam Shah was built in 1905. The Sultan went on to live in the palace for 35 years until his death in 1938. Succession dispute Sultan Sulaiman and his youngest son, circa 1900. Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah had many children, his first three sons in chronological order being Tengku Musa Eddin, Tengku Badar Shah and Tengku Alam Shah. The first two sons were children by his royal consort, Tengku Ampuan Maharum binti Tengku Dhiauddin of the royal house of Kedah. In 1903, Tengku Musa Eddin had been made Tengku Mahkota and was promoted to Raja Muda or heir apparent in 1920.Buyong Adil, 1971, Sejarah Selangor However, at the instigation of the British Resident, Theodore Samuel Adams (1885‚Äì1961; in office 1935 - 1937), Tengku Musa Eddin was dismissed as Raja Muda in 1934 for alleged \\"misbehaviour\\". Adams had accused Tengku Musa Eddin as a spendthrift and wastrel with a penchant for gambling. However, many Malays in Selangor believed the real reason for Tengku Musa Eddin's dismissal was his refusal to follow Adam's orders.Buyong Adil, op cit Although Sultan Sulaiman pleaded for the case of Tengku Musa Eddin (even petitioning the Secretary of State for the Colonies and discussing the issue directly with him in London), Tengku Alam Shah was instead proclaimed Raja Muda heir to the throne over the head of his other half-brother Tengku Badar.Willan, HC (7 October 1945) Interview with the Malay Rulers CAB 101/69, CAB/HIST/B/4/7 The appointment occurred on 20 July 1936.Buyong Adil, op cit Tengku Alam Shah was proclaimed Sultan on 4 April 1938, four days after the death of Sultan Sulaiman.

Upon his firing, West wrote the controversial Elvis: What Happened?, in which he exposed the singer's dangerous drug dependence in an attempt to save him. West was probably best known to American film audiences for his role as Red in Road House, alongside Patrick Swayze. West appeared to critical acclaim in the 2008 independent film Goodbye Solo as William. Early life West was born in Memphis, Tennessee, to Lois and Newton Thomas West. West was the cousin of actor 'Sonny' West. While attending high school in Tennessee, West and Sonny met with Elvis Presley. An excellent athlete and U.S. Marine, West played football for his high school and junior college at Jones County Junior College teams and was a boxer in the Golden Gloves championships. In 1961, West married his wife Pat Boyd. Together, they had two children. West and Presley =Songwriting career= West collaborated with Elvis Presley on several songs in 1961 and 1962, including \\"That's Someone You Never Forget\\" and \\"You'll Be Gone\\". \\"That's Someone You Never Forget\\" is the final track on the 1962 album Pot Luck. The song was released as a 45-rpm B-side single in 1967 and features on the Artist of the Century compilation. \\"You'll Be Gone\\" is a bonus track on the Girl Happy soundtrack LP. West co-wrote \\"If You Think I Don't Need You\\" with Joey Cooper for the motion picture Viva Las Vegas. He teamed up with Joey Cooper again on \\"I'm A Fool\\", which Ricky Nelson recorded, and which was later a hit for Dino, Desi and Billy (the partnership of Dean-Paul \\"Dino\\" Martin, Desi Arnaz Jr., and William \\"Billy\\" Hinsche). West co wrote the song \\"Separate Ways\\" with Richard Mainegra for Elvis in 1972, and \\"If You Talk in Your Sleep\\" with Johnny Christopher for Presley's 1975 album Promised Land. Red wrote \\"If Every Day Was Like Christmas\\", recorded by Presley in 1966. In addition to writing for Elvis, Red had songs recorded by Pat Boone, Rick Nelson, Johnny Burnette, Johnny Rivers, Dino, Desi & Billy, Petula Clark, Gary Puckett & The Union Gap, Andre Kostelanetz and His Orchestra, and Little Milton, amongst others. =Elvis' entourage and firing= In 1976, West was criticized in the media for his involvement in a series of heavy-handed incidents with aggressive fans in Las Vegas. He was also becoming vocal about Presley needing help for his drug problem. Elvis's father, Vernon Presley, who hated the members of his son's entourage, fired West, his cousin Sonny, and bodyguard David Hebler. The three subsequently wrote the book Elvis: What Happened?, claiming to be an attempt to warn and obtain help for Elvis. Some suspected it was a retaliatory money-making exercise, but with Elvis' death within weeks of publication the book's claims proved accurate. Presley had offered the publisher $1million to stop printing the book. Acting career When Presley was making films in the 1960s in Hollywood, Red West appeared in small roles in sixteen of the star's films. During this time, West became good friends with actor Nick Adams and his physical abilities got him hired on as a stuntman on Adams' television series, The Rebel. From there, West went on to do more stunt work in film as well as developing a career as an actor in a number of motion pictures and on television. He was often on screen as a henchman in the television series The Wild Wild West. West played the ornery, sometimes violent Master Sergeant Andy Micklin on Baa Baa Black Sheep. He guest starred twice on the CBS hit detective series Magnum, P.I. as different characters, as five different ones on The A-Team, the Knight Rider pilot episode \\"Knight of the Phoenix\\", on The Fall Guy, Simon & Simon and in \\"The Once and Future King\\", an episode of The Twilight Zone which concerned Presley. In 1989 West appeared in the action film Road House with Patrick Swayze as Red Webster, the auto parts store owner. West played the lead role in the 2008 independent film Goodbye Solo as William, an elderly depressed man who befriends a Senegalese man in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The film received positive reviews and critic Roger Ebert remarked that \\"West isn't playing himself, but he evokes his character so fully that he might as well be. West's face is a map of hard living\\". His last film role was in the 2013 film Safe Haven as Roger, an elderly store clerk in Southport, North Carolina. Death West died on July 18, 2017, aged 81, from an aortic aneurysm, at the Baptist Hospital in his native Memphis. His death occurred less than two months after the death of his cousin, actor Sonny West, in May 2017. His funeral and burial at Memorial Park Cemetery was held on July 24 in Memphis. In popular culture In John Carpenter's 1979 film Elvis, West was portrayed by Robert Gray. West was also portrayed by his son John Boyd West in the 2005 Golden Globe winning CBS mini-series Elvis.

She was constructed in Bremerhaven in 1960, and initially served as a commercial trawler as part of the Ross Group fleet, notably taking part in the Cod Wars of the 1970s. Following her decommissioning, she was purchased by Radio Caroline and outfitted as a radio ship, complete with antenna mast and transmitter. Her broadcasts began on 20 August 1983; her final pirate broadcast took place in November 1990. She ran aground on the Goodwin Sands in November 1991, bringing the era of offshore pirate radio in Europe to an end. She was, however, salvaged, and is now maintained by the Caroline Support Group, a group of supporters and enthusiasts.  Service as a trawler (1960‚Äì83)  Freyr was built in Bremerhaven, Germany by Seebeck for the Icelandic government. She was registered in Reykjavik and carried the registration RE 1. In August 1963 she was sold to Ross Trawlers and renamed Ross Revenge, registration GY 718 (home port Grimsby). In this capacity, the ship was involved in the Cod Wars of the 1970s. Ross Revenge holds the world record for the biggest catch. In 1976 she landed a catch of 3,000 kits (approximately 218 tonnes) of Icelandic cod at Grimsby, subsequently sold for a world record price of ¬£75,597. After serving as a diving support ship from 1979 to 1981, she was taken to the Cairnryan breakers' yard in Cairnryan, Wigtownshire, Dumfries and Galloway on the west coast of Scotland, not Rosyth in the Firth of Forth on the Scottish east coast.The MV Ross Revenge  Radio Caroline (1983‚Äì1991)  MV Ross Revenge as radio ship in 1984 While moored at the Cairnryan breakers' yard, Ross Revenge was found to be suitable for use in the Radio Caroline project. As a result, Ernst Kunz from Austria a director of Seamore Company, Liechtenstein purchased Ross Revenge for ¬£28,500. The ship was subsequently registered in Panama to Grothan Steamship Line, SA Panama. It is worth noting that both Seamore and Grothan were influenced heavily by Ronan O'Rahilly. In April 1981, Ross Revenge was towed from the Cairnryan breakers' yard, and arrived in Solares five days later. Come Autumn, work began on converting her into a functioning radio ship. Her transmitter mast, at above sea level, was the tallest mast ever fitted to a ship. Early in 1982, new investors were found for Radio Caroline. Of these, the principal investor, James Ryan, was later arrested for fraud. Chains he had placed on Ross Revenge would later be removed prior to her drydocking. On 23 September, she was registered as a pleasure craft in Panama with registry number 9625-POXT, and her callsign was HP-4344. In May 1983, Caroline Communications acquired full legal ownership of Ross Revenge, whereafter she was drydocked and given a protective coating. Insurance problems regarding the lifeboats would prevent Ross Revenge from setting sail until 4 August. = Ross Revenge sets sail = At 15:00 on 4 August, MV Ross Revenge set sail under the command of Captain Martin Eve. Problems with the engines forced the ship to be towed to its anchorage. On 8 August, Ross Revenge dropped anchor in the Kentish Knock. The next day, a test transmission was made on some time after which Ross Revenge shifted anchorage to the Knock John Deep. On 20 January 1984, Ross Revenge lost her anchor and drifted south onto a sand bank within British waters, and broadcasts were stopped. Broadcasts resumed two days later, at which time she had returned to her anchorage. On 3 March, a force twelve storm necessitated the dragging of the emergency anchor. A new anchor system was installed and operational two days later. On 10 June 1987, Radio Caroline closed down for \\"maintenance\\" at 07:00; in fact, Ross Revenge sailed to a new position near South Falls Head, in anticipation of the forthcoming Territorial Sea ActTerritorial Sea Act, 1987 that extended British territorial waters to (from ). This was announced when broadcasts resumed at 16:54 that day. On 20 November the same year, the ship started to list to 25¬∞ due to exceedingly rough weather. Five days later, force eight storms hit the ship; transmissions ceased abruptly at 02:51. The antenna mast had broken at its base and collapsed into the sea. Other than this, the ship sustained very little damage . The next day, parts were delivered for a makeshift aerial. By 27 January, a new mast had been built, but required adjustment. = Logistics = From Radio Caroline's inception, small vessels originating from the English coast brought newspapers, discs, crew, and DJs to Ross Revenge. Diesel was brought in weekly from Nieuwpoort via Zeemeeuw, hired in 1984. During and following the \\"Eurosiege\\" of 1985, in which the Dutch naval minesweeper was anchored near Ross Revenge, the skipper of Zeemeeuw deemed it too risky to continue ferrying fuel, and so Radio Monique acquired the use of Poolster, again operating from Nieuwpoort. In 1987, they changed to using the Bellatrix, operating out of Dunkirk. On 6 November 1988 two new aerial masts were taken out to the Ross Revenge. On 4 January 1989 were taken aboard to give the ship as much stability as possible while erecting the new transmitter masts. On 12 February the front mast had been rebuilt bar one section, and the shortwave aerial had been restored. The work on the two new masts continued until May. = Armed raid = On 19 August 1989 armed representatives of the Dutch Government boarded Ross Revenge. Volans, a Dutch Water Police tugboat, contained a boarding party of about 30 armed men, including Dutch, British, French and Belgian officials. The boarding party removed studio equipment, records and tapes. The aerial array was taken down, parts of the transmitter were removed, and other components were smashed with sledgehammers. The staff and DJs were determined to keep the station on the air despite the raid, and on 1 October the station reopened on low power, using a makeshift transmitter and new studio equipment. Broadcasts were initially on low power and the station suffered equipment failures and temporary blackouts, but over the next few months the technical hitches were ironed out and transmitter power was increased. = Abandonment and retaking = At the end of November 1990, Ross Revenge suffered a power failure, which resulted in the ship being unlit for several nights. Trinity House warned the station that the ship must be lit during the hours of darkness, to comply with maritime regulations. As Ross Revenge was low on fuel, and the main generators had failed due to disuse, a small petrol generator was being used to power the ship. During force nine storms on 10 December Ross Revenge suffered another power failure, the small petrol generator having been thrown around the deck, and the supplies of petrol having been washed over the side by waves. The crew called the station office, who in turn called the Dover Coast Guard. The coast guard contacted the ship, and a helicopter was sent out at 23:00. By 23:45 Ross Revenge was completely evacuated. The next day the crew from the Trinity House vessel Patricia boarded Ross Revenge, checked the stores and general condition of the ship and then left. By dawn the Dover Coast Guard were reporting that Ross Revenge was abandoned. North Foreland Radio and other coastal stations issued hourly reports warning shipping vessels that Ross Revenge was unmanned and unlit. On 14 December a successful boarding attempt was made, and at approximately 11:00 Peter Chicago (main engineer) regained control of Ross Revenge. He was joined by Tony Collis, who had advised Chicago of rumours of foreign tugs on their way to claim Ross Revenge for salvage.  Ross Revenge runs aground  On 19 November 1991, storms built up across Europe. Consequently, very high seas with north easterly winds were experienced by the crew of Ross Revenge. By the early hours of the next morning force ten storms were battering Ross Revenge, and eventually the main anchoring system failed. Dover Coast Guard asked other sea traffic to confirm that the ship they were tracking was the Ross Revenge . At 03:50 Ross Revenge grounded on the Goodwin Sands. The crew contacted Dover Coast Guard and a helicopter was sent from RAF Manston, and at 04:45 the Dover tug Dextrous was on her way. At 05:35 the crew of Ross Revenge made contact with the Ramsgate lifeboat, which had also been sent by the Dover Coast Guard. At 06:58 the lifeboat became stuck on the Goodwin Sands, but her crew managed to free her. At 06:57 hours RAF Manston Sea King helicopter 166 took the crew of Ross Revenge off the ship. On 21 November, Dextrous managed to get lines on Ross Revenge and successfully pulled the radio ship off the Goodwin Sands. Ross Revenge was then towed back to the Eastern Docks at Dover. Following the near shipwrecking, the ship has been maintained by an association of enthusiasts called the Caroline Support Group (formerly, the Ross Revenge Support Group). In October 1993 Ross Revenge was anchored off Bradwell-On-Sea in the Blackwater Estuary in Essex, within sight of the Bradwell nuclear power station. In August 1995 Ross Revenge was towed to Clacton-on-Sea. In September the vessel was moored near Southend-on- Sea and in the middle of that month it was moored at the end of Southend Pier. On 25 September Ross Revenge was towed from Southend to the Thames Quay, West India Docks in Docklands, London by the tugs Horton and Warrior. In February 1996 the ship was towed from South quay, Docklands towards Ailsa Perth Marine's shipyard at Chatham, Kent and put into dry dock. In August 1997 MV Ross Revenge was moved to Queenbourgh, Isle of Sheppey, by the tugs Lady Morag and Lady Brenda. On 21 June 1999 the ship was towed to Southend-on-Sea Pier. The ship left Southend on 28 September under tow from the tug Horton, and was moored on the River Medway in Kent at ship berth No. 24. On Christmas Eve 1999, MV Ross Revenge, still anchored in the River Medway, broke its moorings during high winds and ran aground on a sandbank. Two tugs were radioed by another ship moored nearby and managed to pull Ross Revenge off the bank and tow it into Sheerness harbour. The two people on board were both unhurt. Although the ship was not badly damaged, the salvage was extremely expensive. On 8 January 2000 the vessel was moved back onto the moorings at Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey. From July 2003 Ross Revenge was moored on the River Medway at Strood/Rochester, just downstream from Rochester Bridge.  Present day  Restoration work on Ross Revenge has been ongoing. In August 2004, the vessel was used for (legitimate) Radio Caroline broadcasts on while berthed on the River Thames at Tilbury. This was funded by the UK National Lottery organisation. As is usual with Restricted Service Licence broadcasts, transmission power was restricted to one watt. Following broadcasts, she remained berthed at Tilbury, and restoration work continued on the studio, which was completely reconstructed. General restoration and refitting of the ship took place during 2004‚Äì2006, including the fitting of a new central heating boiler, improvements to the electrical system, repainting of the ship, and refurbishment of the Mess Room and Crew Quarters. During 2013, a new transmitter mast was erected on MV Ross Revenge.see http://www.radiostructures.com/blog/erection-of-the-radio-caroline-mas/ Photos of this new mast can you see on http://www.woodleynet.co.uk/caroline/bwater- move.htm MV Ross Revenge left the River Thames at Tilbury on 31 July 2014. Her new mooring is on the Blackwater Estuary near Bradwell, Essex. From 2015, \\"Radio Caroline North\\" has broadcast 'live' from the Ross Revenge, usually on the last weekend of the calendar month and on offshore music-radio anniversary dates, courtesy of Manx Radio's AM transmitter on the Isle of Man. On 31 May 2017, MV Ross Revenge was included in the National Register of Historic Vessels.

It is part of the larger Pacific temperate rainforest ecoregion, which is the largest coastal temperate rainforest in the world. The Great Bear Rainforest was officially recognized by the Government of British Columbia in February 2016, when it announced an agreement to permanently protect 85% of the old-growth forested area from industrial logging. The forest was admitted to the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy in September of the same year. Geography The size of the Great Bear Rainforest, also called the North and Central Coast land use planning area or the Central and North Coast LRMP area, is roughly .http://www.harbourpublishing.com/title/TheGreatBearRainforest As part of the 2006 North and Central Coast Land Use Decision three new land use zones were created: Protected Areas; Biodiversity, Mining, and Tourism Areas (BMTAs); and Ecosystem-based Management Operating Areas (EBMs). As of 2009, approximately of the region has been designated as protected areas (in a form called conservancies), and as BMTAs. Commercial timber harvesting and commercial hydro-electric power projects are prohibited within BMTAs. The Great Bear Rainforest extends from the Discovery Islands in the south to the BC-Alaska boundary in the north, it includes all offshore islands within this range except Vancouver Island and the archipelago of Haida Gwaii. Its northern end reaches up Portland Canal to the vicinity of Stewart. To the south it includes Prince Rupert, most of Douglas Channel, half of Hawkesbury Island, and part of Gardner Canal. Kitimat is outside the region, to the east. Farther south, the region includes all of the coast west and south of the Fiordland Conservancy, Kitlope Heritage Conservancy Protected Area, Tweedsmuir North and Tweedsmuir South Provincial Parks‚Äîwhich includes Dean Channel, Burke Channel, Rivers Inlet, and the communities of Bella Bella, Bella Coola, and Hagensborg. The southern end of the region includes Knight Inlet and Bute Inlet. Ecology A Kermode bear from the Great Bear Rainforest The Great Bear Rainforest is one of the largest remaining tracts of unspoiled temperate rainforest left in the world. The area is home to species such as cougars, wolves, salmon, grizzly bears, and the Kermode (\\"spirit\\") bear, a unique subspecies of the black bear, in which one in ten cubs displays a recessive white coloured coat. The forest features 1,000-year-old western red cedar and 90-metre Sitka spruce. Coastal temperate rainforests are characterized by their proximity to both ocean and mountains. Abundant rainfall results when the atmospheric flow of moist air off the ocean collides with mountain ranges. Much of the Pacific coastline of North America shares this climate pattern, including portions of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. History =Campaign for protection= In the early 1990s environmentalists launched a large scale campaign to protect the Clayoquot Sound region of Vancouver Island. After years of conflict the British Columbia government announced a ban on clear-cutting in the Clayoquot rainforests and began a local planning process that incorporated First Nations of the area and independent scientists. The Clayoquot Sound campaign became the model for the Great Bear Rainforest campaign. Techniques used at Clayoquot Sound were further developed and new approaches adopted, such as international marketing campaigns, improved mapping technologies, and the use of large-scale holistic ecosystem- based management models. In 1997 the central and northern BC coastal region was renamed \\"Great Bear Rainforest\\" by a network of ENGOs (environmental nongovernmental organizations), including Greenpeace, Sierra Club BC, Pacific Wild, and Stand.earth, for the purpose of galvanizing an international campaign for its protection. The name, which was chosen without consulting local residents, was by 2005 being used by many organizations, including news media outlets. As Maureen Gail Reed writes, \\"the emotive significance of such a name cannot be underestimated\\". In May 2004, after years of conflict and negotiation, the various stakeholders agreed to recommend the BC government that about , about 33% of the Great Bear Rainforest, be put under some form of protection, and that new forms of ecosystem-based forestry be required throughout the rainforest. This fell short of the scientific recommendations, which had concluded that 44%‚Äì70% should be protected. The recommendation given to the BC government was a compromise solution agreed to by the many stakeholders after years of difficult negotiations. The stakeholders include provincial and local governments; many BC First Nations such as the Heiltsuk and Homalco; the ENGOs Greenpeace, ForestEthics, Rainforest Action Network, Pacific Wild, and Sierra Club BC; and forestry corporations such as Canadian Forest Products, Catalyst Paper Corporation, International Forest Products, Western Forest Products; and many others. On 7 February 2006 a comprehensive protection package was announced for the Great Bear Rainforest, which was defined to include the central and north coasts of BC and Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands). The Great Bear Rainforest Agreement included four key elements: rainforest protection, improved logging practices, the involvement of First Nations in decision making, and conservation financing to enable economic diversification. The final agreement banned logging in 33% of the Great Bear Rainforest and made a commitment to implement ecosystem-based forestry management for the entire Great Bear Rainforest by 2009. The 2006 agreement between the BC government and a wide coalition of conservationists, loggers, hunters, and First Nations established a series of conservancies stretching along the coast. The proposed protected areas will contain , and another that is to be run under a management plan that is expected to ensure sustainable forest management. The Canadian government announced on 21 January 2007 that it will spend CAD$30m for protection of this rainforest. This matches a pledge made previously by the British Columbia provincial government, as well as private donations of $60 million, making the total funding for the new reserve $120 million. In the autumn of 2008, Greenpeace, Sierra Club BC and ForestEthics (jointly known as Rainforest Solutions Project) launched an online campaign titled, \\"Keep the Promise,\\" to put public pressure on Gordon Campbell, then Premier of British Columbia, to honour the Great Bear Rainforest agreement in its entirety. The groups were concerned certain aspects of the agreement, including implementation of ecosystem-based management (EBM), would not materialize in time for the government's own final implementation deadline of March 31, 2009. =Government recognition and protection= On February 1, 2016, Premier Christy Clark announced an agreement had been reached between the province of British Columbia, First Nations, environmentalists and the forestry industry to protect 85% of the 6.4 million hectare Great Bear Rainforest from industrial logging. The remaining 15% would still be subject to logging under stringent conditions. The agreement also recognizes aboriginal rights to shared decision-making, and provides a greater economic share of timber rights and $15-million in funding to 26 First Nations in the area. The Great Bear Rainforest (Forest Management) Act was introduced by the government on March 1, 2016. In September, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, visited and unveiled a plaque in the forest acknowledging its admission into the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy. =Fuel spill= On 13 October 2016, a tugboat hauling an empty tanker barge ran aground on a reef just off the coast of Athlone Island in Seaforth Channel (). The reef was located in the traditional territorial waters of the Heiltsuk First Nation and within the larger Great Bear Rainforest. The tug leaked over 100,000 litres of diesel fuel and sank into the channel. By 26 October, the fuel tanks of the tug were emptied and about 101,131 litres of oily water was recovered. The fuel spill was the last major incident to occur in the region since BC Ferries' Queen of the North ran around and sank off the coast of Gill Island on 21 March 2006. Public outcry over the incident coupled with increased interest in preserving the ecological integrity of the rainforest helped to spur the passage of the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act on 21 June 2019, which prohibits any oil tanker from docking at any port along the North Coast of British Columbia.

It belonged to the Holford family from 1665 until 1926. The first house on the site was an Elizabethan manor house. The Holfords replaced it first with a Georgian house, and then Robert Stayner Holford, who inherited Westonbirt in 1839, replaced that house between 1863 and 1870 with the present mansion which was designed by Lewis Vulliamy. He also remodelled the gardens, diverted the main road and relocated the villagers. The house is constructed of high quality ashlar masonry on a grand scale. The exterior is in an Elizabethan style, with a symmetrical main block and asymmetric wings, one of them containing a conservatory. The interiors are in a sumptuous classical style. The house was fitted with the latest technology such as gas lighting, central heating, fireproof construction and iron roofs. It is now a Grade I listed building. Extensive formal terrace gardens were created around the house and of ornamental woodlands were planted in the 19th century. Since 1928, the house has been occupied by the girls' boarding school Westonbirt School, except during World War II when it was requisitioned by the Air Ministry. Westonbirt House is open to the public on certain days, and the gardens are open more frequently. The house is also licensed to hold civil ceremonies and is used as a wedding venue.Westonbirt House Robert Stayner Holford and Mary Anne Holford Robert Stayner Holford circa 1860 Robert was born in 1808 to George Peter Holford and Anne Holford who was the daughter of Reverend Averell Daniell of Lifford, County Donegal, Ireland.Lee, Rev. Alfred (1857) 'The history of the town and parish of Tetbury', John Henry and James Parker, London, pp. 219‚Äì20. George inherited a mansion at Westonbirt from his father; this was the original manor which had been erected in the reign of Elizabeth or the early part of the time of James I.'Jones views of the seats of noblemen and Gentlemen of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland', Jones and Company, 1829, London. This house was demolished by George in 1818 and a new house built in 1823.Register of Parks andGardens of Special Historic Interest, (1999) 'Westonbirt, Gloucestershire, Cotswold' Ref No 1426. In 1829 at the age of 21, Robert graduated from Oriel College, Oxford with a Bachelor of Arts Degree.Dod, Robert (1857) 'The Parliamentary Companion for 1857', Whittaker and Company, London, p. 208. In the same year the arboretum on the Westonbirt Estate was commenced and Robert played a significant role in this project. In 1838 he inherited his uncle's fortune of over one million pounds. In the following year his father died and he became the owner of Westonbirt House. He was a keen lover of art and literature and his enormous wealth now allowed him to indulge this interest. He began collecting paintings and books for what was to become the famous \\"Holford Collection\\". To accommodate this collection he built Dorchester House in Park Lane, London between 1851 and 1853 where he employed Lewis Vulliamy as the architect.Cancellor, E. B. (1908) 'The private Palaces of London: Past and Present', Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co., London, p. 250. During this time he became a Magistrate for Gloucester and Wilts and in 1843 was the High Sheriff of Wiltshire. In December 1854 he was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire East.Dod, Robert (1857), p. 208. In August 1854, at the age of 46, he married Mary Anne Lindsay who was the 25-year-old daughter of Lieutenant-General James Lindsay.Marquis of Ruvigny and Raineval,(1994) The Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal: The Clarence Volume, Genealogical Publishing Company, p. 248. Between 1863 and 1870, Robert built the present Westonbirt house, which was reputed to be one of the most expensive houses constructed in the Victorian era. Robert continued his work as a member of parliament until 1872 when he retired.The Bristol Mercury and Daily Post, 27 February 1892. He continued to collect plants for the garden at Westonbirt House and also for the arboretum. His son George also developed an interest in gardens and plants and assisted his father with this work. After Robert's retirement, the couple spent time at both Westonbirt and Dorchester House. In 1875 Charles Gayard, a French diplomat, visited Westonbirt and gave an account of his experience as follows. :This morning I have lost no time. Sometimes Mrs Holford, sometimes Evy, took me about the house, which surpasses in magnificence any that you know. There is a hall, a sort of conservatory three stories high, something like the great apartments of Louis XIV. The most original room in the house is the one painted by Mrs Holford, in a bizarre fanciful style, something between Delacroix landscape and Rouen pottery. :After luncheon my friends took me on a pony chaise, across the beauties of the park to the keeper's lodge. I saw conservatories without end, then a lake, a bit of a wild, heaps of rocks that it seems have been newly brought there. And the lake too is a thing of yesterday. The pheasants were so thick we fairly trod on them. At last we reached the Head-keepers's lodge, and saw a pack of thirty spaniels with legs short enough to make the rabbits dance for joy. The garden at Westonbirt House and the Arboretum continued to expand and in 1886 an extensive article was written about it in The Garden. This said that \\"Mr Holford's aim has been to create variety without confusion, informality and picturesqueness without losing sight of that polish in the vicinity of the mansion which must always be regarded as in accordance with correct taste.\\"Goldring, W., 'Westonbirt', The Garden: and Illustrated weekly journal of gardening in all its branches\\", 20 Feb 1886, p. 157. In February 1892, Robert died at Dorchester House. Sir George Holford and Lady Holford Sir George Holford circa 1910 Lady Holford circa 1890 George was the only son of Robert and Mary Holford. In 1873 he went to Eton and was there for four years. At the age of 20 in 1880 George obtained a commission with the 1st Life Guards, where he remained for almost 30 years. He was closely associated with royalty and court life, and from 1888 to 1892 he was equerry to Prince Albert, Duke of Clarence. When Robert Holford died in 1892, George inherited Westonbirt House and Aboretum. He also inherited Dorchester House in London and the art and book collection that were housed within it. He did not have his father's interest in art and books but he did have a passion for gardens and orchids so he devoted much of his time to his property at Westonbirt.Morris, L. A. 1988, \\"Rosenbach Abroad: In pursuit of Books in Private Collections\\", Rosenback Museum and Library, Philadelphia, p. 16. The Times made the following comment about him. > He was indeed, one of the most successful amateur gardeners of the time, and > though famous as a grower of orchids, amaryllids and Javanese rhododendrons, > his garden and estate show a wide catholicity of taste.

Although he was always considered an eligible bachelor, George did not marry until late in life and had no children. In 1912 he married the recently widowed Susannah Menzies, the eldest child of Arthur and Mary Wilson. The Wilsons were a wealthy family who had made their money from a shipping line.Attwood, G. M. 1988, p. 12.From the south-east In 1926 George Holford died, having suffered for some time with emphysema.Brown, A. C. 1987, p. 156. As he did not have any heirs his property passed to his blood relatives in accordance with the will of his father. The main part of the estate went to George's nephew the 4th Earl of Morley.UKForestry Commission, \\"History of the Collection\\" http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-6XDCU8 , (accessed 15 January 2010) However, Susannah was well provided for as George left her his personal goods such as jewellery and furniture and a large annuity of ¬£10,000 per annum.Brown, A. C. 1987, p. 157. Susannah remained at Westonbirt until it was sold in 1927, when she moved to London.Westonbirt House in 1905 Arboretum Robert Stayner Holford, the rebuilder of Westonbirt, also founded the Westonbirt Arboretum on former common downland across the road from the house, a mile away. The arboretum was developed over the next few decades by him and his son Sir George Lindsay Holford. Since the younger Holford did not have children, the house and arboretum passed to his eldest sister's son the 4th Earl of Morley, who sold the house by 1928. The family gave the arboretum to the nation in 1956.Christopher Stocks. \\"Gardens: Log On\\" , The Independent on Sunday, 22 May 2005.  The estate today  The gardens and surrounding parkland, together with the arboretum, were listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in 1986. Westonbirt School and its preparatory school are on the site. The school's leisure centre and golf course can be accessed by the public. Westonbirt Arboretum is managed by the Forestry Commission and is open to the public on a regular basis.

The name Heaton means high town, referring to the area \\"being situated on hills above the Ouseburn, a tributary of the River Tyne.\\"  History  In the 12th century Heaton became part of the Barony of Ellingham granted by Henry I to Nicholas de Grenville. King John stayed in the castle at Heaton (the remains of which can still be seen in Heaton Park) on a number of occasions. In the 17th century the Heaton estate was purchased by Henry Babington who was knighted at Heaton Hall by James I on 1 May 1617.John Nichols, Progresses of James the First, vol. 3 (London, 1828), p. 281. By the 18th century, Heaton was a coal mining areahttp://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/remember-when-heaton- road-newcastle-7935707 with many of its collieries owned by Matthew White and Richard Ridley. The Heaton estate was broken up in 1835 when the area became officially incorporated into Newcastle upon Tyne. Much of the land in Heaton in 1841 was owned by Armorer Donkin, who on his death in 1851 bequeathed the land to his business partner, the industrialist Sir William Armstrong. In 1879, the corporation acquired part of the Heaton Hall estate, which was then laid out as Heaton Park, and Sir William Armstrong donated Armstrong Park and Jesmond Dene to the city.http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/remember-when-heaton- road-newcastle-7935707 The three parks run into each other to form a green corridor through east Newcastle.  Governance  Heaton was divided into two electoral wards, North Heaton and South Heaton, each of which was represented by three councillors. However, boundary changes to all wards in Newcastle upon Tyne were implemented at the city council elections in May 2018, with the majority of Heaton falling in the Heaton ward. A small part of Heaton close to Shields Road is in the Ouseburn ward, with neighbouring High Heaton included in the Manor Park ward.  Demography  Towards the north of Chillingham Road Housing in Heaton Heaton is a mixed working class and middle class area. In recent years it has become a popular residence for many students attending the city's two universities, Newcastle University and Northumbria University. Rent and student letting is generally lower in price than in the neighbouring student areas of Jesmond and Sandyford.  Economy  During the 19th century, the building of the railways saw a line pass through Heaton, now the East Coast Main Line. Heaton also has a major rail depot. Heaton became the location of Sir Charles Parsons engineering works producing turbines which was founded in 1889.http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/tyneside- factory-ca-parsons-powered-1946718 Third Avenue was the birthplace of the Ringtons Tea business.https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/7069879.going- potty-tea-company-exhibition/ The main commercial street in Heaton is Chillingham Road which benefits from local amenities including two small supermarkets, a number of small shops and newsagents, hairdressers, takeaways, cafes, restaurants and public houses. In the Cochrane Park area of Heaton there is a famous landmark building, The Wills Building, which was built in 1946-50 as a cigarette factory and was redeveloped in 1999 as luxury apartments.  Transport  Heaton was originally served by Heaton railway station, which was on the main line from Newcastle to Edinburgh Waverley and also on the direct line from Newcastle to the coast. That station was closed on 11 August 1980, when the Tyne & Wear Metro system opened.http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/h/heaton/ Heaton is now served by Chillingham Road Metro station, but Byker Metro station is closer for some living in South Heaton. Heaton is also served by a variety of bus routes, including routes 1, 62 and 63, which link Heaton to Newcastle city centre and areas in the west of Newcastle.  Education  Heaton has a large secondary school, Heaton Manor School, although many children in Heaton attend Benfield School, located on the Heaton/Walkergate boundary.

Origins A flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement The BPP had its roots in the journal New Pioneer, edited by John Beckett and effectively the mouthpiece of the British Council Against European Commitments, a co- ordinating body involving the National Socialist League (NSL), English Array and League of Loyalists. The main crux of this publication was opposition to war with Nazi Germany, although it also endorsed fascism and anti-Semitism. The proprietor of this journal was Viscount Lymington, a strong opponent of war with Germany.D. Boothroyd, The History of British Political Parties, London: Politico's Publishing, 2001, p. 24 Others involved in its production included A. K. Chesterton and the anthropologist George Henry Lane-Fox Pitt- Rivers, whilst individual members, especially Lymington, were close to ruralist Rolf Gardiner. Policy and structure Beckett split from his NSL ally William Joyce in 1939 after Joyce intimated to the patriotic Beckett that were war to break out between Britain and Germany he would fight for the Nazis. This, along with a feeling that Joyce's virulent anti-Semitism was hamstringing the NSL, led Beckett to link up with Lord Tavistock, the heir to the Duke of Bedford, in founding the British People's Party in 1939. The new party supported an immediate end to the Second World War, and was vehemently opposed to usury, calling to mind some of the economic policies of Hilaire Belloc.M. Kenny, Germany Calling, Dublin: New Island, 2004, p. 149 The group also brought in elements of Social Credit, as Lord Tavistock had been a sometime activist in the Social Credit Party. The party was controlled by an executive committee consisting of Tavistock as Chairman, Beckett as secretary and ex-Labour Party candidate Ben Greene (a noted pacifist and member of the Peace Pledge Union) as treasurer, with Viscount Lymington and former left-wing journalist John Scanlon also added. Other early members of the party included Ronald Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brocket, Richard St. Barbe Baker, Sydney Arnold, 1st Baron Arnold, Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 8th Duke of Buccleuch and Walter Erskine, 12th Earl of Mar. Activities The party's activities were generally limited to meetings, the publication of a journal, The People's Post and the contesting of a single by-election in Hythe, Kent in 1939. The campaign for the 1939 Hythe by-election, in which former Labour Party member St. John Philby was the BPP candidate, was fought on an anti-war platform. Despite gaining the public support of the likes of Sir Barry Domvile, leader of The Link, the campaign was not a success and Philby was unable to retain his deposit. Philby claimed that he agreed with none of the BPP's views apart from their opposition to war. He was more disposed towards the Labour Party but felt they were becoming too pro-war. In Philby's mind, as well as popularly, the BPP were seen as more of a single issue anti-war party. During the war After the outbreak of the Second World War the BPP was involved in British Union of Fascists-led initiatives to forge closer links between the disparate groups on the far right, although in private Oswald Mosley had a low opinion of the BPP, dismissing Beckett as a \\"crook\\", Tavistock as \\"woolly headed\\" and Greene as \\"not very intelligent\\". Beckett's internment under Defence Regulation 18B in 1940 saw the party go into hibernation, although it was not subject to any government ban. The patronage of Lord Tavistock, who succeeded to the dukedom of Bedford in 1940, ensured that the BPP was exempted from proscription. The group was briefly involved in a clandestine alliance with A.K. Chesterton's National Front After Victory in 1944, a group that also attracted the interest of J.F.C. Fuller, Henry Williamson, Jeffrey Hamm, William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield and Lymington (who had succeeded his father as Earl of Portsmouth in the meantime) amongst others. However, the movement was scuppered when it was infiltrated by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who fed information to Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart, whose speech about the dangers of a revival of fascism led to a crackdown on such movements. Final years The BPP name was heard again in 1945 when the party organised an unsuccessful petition for clemency for Beckett's former ally William Joyce, who was executed for treason.G. Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, London: IB Tauris, 2007, p. 34 Before long the BPP returned to wider activity after the war when party policy focused on monetary reform and the promotion of agriculture. With the Union Movement not appearing until 1948 the BPP initially attracted some new members, including Colin Jordan, who was invited to join in 1946 and was associated with the group for a time before concentrating his efforts on the more hardline Arnold Leese. The party contested the Combined English Universities by-election on 18 March 1946 but received only 239 votes.By-election results The BPP officially disbanded in 1954.

Allied Airmen, in 1942, after Wittig's sculpture had been removed by the Germans. The Kotwica (Polish resistance \\"Anchor\\") was painted on the pedestal. Edward Wittig (September 20, 1879 - March 3, 1941) was a Polish sculptor and university professor, notable for designing many monuments in Warsaw. Born in Warsaw, Wittig went on to study art at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna under the tutelage of J. Tautenheim between 1897 and 1900. He then moved to Paris, where he graduated from the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. His tutor there was Madeleine Jouvray, a pupil of Auguste Rodin and Lucien Schnegg. One of his friends during this period was Magnus Enckell. In 1909 he returned to Poland and settled in Podolia, in a residence owned by friends. There he prepared a number of sculptures, some of which were presented at the Paris Salon. After 1903, he was invited to display his work at many top art galleries. His works were also featured at the Zachƒôta gallery in Warsaw (since 1900), at the Society of Friends of Fine Arts of Krak√≥w, and the Venice Biennale in 1920 and 1934. Between 1915 and 1920, he was one of the professors of the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, and was subsequently a professor at the Warsaw University of Science and Technology. Initially a student of Rodin, in the early 1900s Wittig developed his own style, with stronger contrasts and less symbolism. Finally, prior to World War I his style became heavily influenced by Aristide Maillol and the so-called New Classicism, which emphasised monumental, cubic, and rough silhouettes lacking detail. Among the first such sculptures is Eve of 1911, featured in both Trocad√©ro garden in Paris and the Park Ujazdowski in Warsaw. In the 1920s, Wittig's style became very popular in Poland and abroad, mostly due to its monumentalism, which was a leading trend in Polish architecture of the 1920s and 1930s. As a result of which he went on to create numerous monuments. Among the most notable is the monuments to Polish Military Organization in front of the Zachƒôta. It was destroyed by the Germans prior to the Warsaw Uprising, but reconstructed in 1999. Another notable work is the 1931 monument to World War I airmen. The Germans destroyed it by removing the sculpture from the top of its pedestal in 1940, but it was rebuilt in 1968 by Alfred Jesion. In 1932, Wittig also prepared the monument to Juliusz S≈Çowacki, which was not erected until 2001, well after his death in Warsaw in 1941, during the Nazi occupation of Poland.

She is the eighth DC Comics character depicted using the name Manhunter, and the first woman. The character first appears in Manhunter (vol. 3) #1 (October 2004) and was promoted by DC Comics as relevant to the popular Identity Crisis limited series. Kate Spencer appeared as a recurring character on the second season of The CW show Arrow, played by actress Chelah Horsdal. This version never became a vigilante and was the district attorney. Publication history Despite critical success, the first series repeatedly had trouble gaining larger readership. DC Comics announced in May 2006 that the series would be canceled and that issue #25 would be the last. Dan DiDio, DC's executive editor, soon followed with another announcement, that fan outcry convinced him to extend the series for five additional issues in order to improve sales. The new five-issue story arc dealt with a ramification of the Infinite Crisis, again tying the series into a popular event. DiDio also said that the storyline would lead into another big event in the DC Universe. The series came back with issue #31 in 2007, but was cancelled with issue #38 in 2008. Manhunter had a 10-page co-feature in Batman: Streets of Gotham which began in June 2009, and ended in issue #13, and was replaced with a Two-Face co-feature. A planned collection of the back-up series was cancelled by DC. In addition to her solo features, writer Gail Simone made Manhunter into one of the lead characters in her Birds of Prey series as part of a controversial revamp in issue #100, where Kate was brought in to serve as a replacement for Black Canary. Manhunter remained with the team until the book's cancellation with issue #127 in 2009, and was not part of the subsequent 2010 relaunch. Writer Marc Guggenheim announced that in 2011, Manhunter would begin appearing in his Justice Society of America series. Fictional character biography Kate Spencer is a federal prosecutor who grows increasingly tired of seeing guilty criminals evade punishment. Copperhead, a supervillain on trial for multiple murders and cannibalism, avoids a death sentence and escapes from custody after killing two guards. An angry Kate takes matters into her own hands, stealing equipment from an evidence room and killing Copperhead. Calling herself Manhunter, Kate blackmails a former weapons manufacturer for numerous villains named Dylan Battles ‚Äî who is in the Witness Protection Program ‚Äî into building, maintaining and upgrading her armor, weapons and gadgets. In addition to legal proceedings and fighting crime, Kate's life includes awkward relationships with her six-year-old son Ramsey and novelist ex-husband. Kate's secret life as Manhunter cuts into her career and family life, but her co-counsel Damon Matthews covers for her. Kate's father Walter Pratt spent time in prison for murdering her mother, and she comes to believe that her grandfather is superhero Al Pratt, the original Atom, a member of the Justice Society of America. Through her friendship with Department of Extranormal Operations Agent Cameron Chase, Kate works for the DEO under the direction of Mr. Bones. During the Infinite Crisis, Oracle calls Kate, along with a number of low-powered heroes to join the Battle of Metropolis, and she was invited to join the Birds of Prey after founding member Black Canary left to join the Justice League. =Iron Munro= The June 2006 issue of Manhunter revealed that Kate's true grandfather was not the original Atom, but actually Iron Munro and that her grandmother was Sandra Knight (Phantom Lady). When Munro was apparently unwilling to deal with his girlfriend's pregnancy, she was taken by Pratt to a home for unwed mothers and Pratt was mistakenly listed as the father on Walter Pratt's birth certificate. This makes her a second cousin once removed to Jack Knight, as Phantom Lady pointed out in the issue. =Wonder Woman= Kate was hired to be Wonder Woman's defense lawyer for the murder of Maxwell Lord. The case has taken an unexpected turn however, upon the recent arrival of a supposedly alive Blue Beetle, who claims he has no memory of the last 18 months. Wonder Woman has called in Batman to run an investigation on Blue Beetle, to see if it is really him. Meanwhile, Kate received aid from Checkmate, which proved that Diana's actions were justifiable. The \\"Blue Beetle\\" turned out to be the shapeshifting cannibal Everyman from Lex Luthor's Infinity, Inc. Following the events of Batman: RIP, Oracle disbanded the Birds of Prey.Birds ofPrey (vol. 1) #127 Kate was not invited to rejoin the team when it was subsequently reestablished the following year.Birds of Prey (vol. 2) #1 =Cancellation and future= Since the cancellation of her ongoing series, it has been announced by Dan DiDio that Kate Spencer would be moving to Gotham to serve as their D.A. and will be appearing in Streets of Gotham alongside Huntress and Misfit, her fellow Birds of Prey, and Batgirl. The series was eventually cancelled, and a planned collection was axed due to low pre-orders. Kate was recently seen being recruited by Jay Garrick for a yet unknown purpose, alongside Mon-El, Miss Martian, Mister America, and the Sea Devils.Justice League: Cry For Justice #4 Despite her recruitment, Kate does not appear alongside the other heroes in the finale of Justice League: Cry for Justice. Following this, Manhunter briefly appears alongside Batgirl, Batwoman, the Question and a host of other female heroes when Wonder Woman leads them against Professor Ivo's robot sirens.Wonder Woman #600 In 2011, it was confirmed that Manhunter would begin appearing in Justice Society of America. Kate makes her first appearance in issue #47, where she battles a group of gangbangers who are in the process of robbing a Gotham electronics store. After defeating the thugs, Kate sees a news report from the recently destroyed city of Monument Point, where Jay Garrick is shown telling reporters about the crime wave sweeping the remains of the city. Upon hearing about how there are not enough heroes and police officers to stem the tide of criminal activity, Kate is shown grinning, as if the statement has given her an idea. Shortly after this, Kate appears in Monument Point during a massive battle between the Justice Society and a villain named Doctor Chaos. She is shown leading a large team of superheroes including the JSA All-Stars, Jesse Quick, Liberty Belle and a new heroine resembling the Blue Beetle.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #48 After Chaos is defeated, Kate and the other heroes choose to stay in Monument Point and join the JSA.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #49 =DC Rebirth= Kate Spencer made her return in Green Arrow where she is currently acting as Oliver Queen's attorney.Green Arrow (vol. 7) #25  Powers and abilities  =Kate's equipment= When Kate pursues Copperhead, she sneaks into an evidence room to steal some items she can use against him. Manhunter #15 tells the origin of each of the three items she takes: * The Suit ‚Äì The suit comes from a member of the Darkstars who died in battle and fell to Earth to rot. A drifter found it and used it to defend himself against a group of attackers. Successfully defeating them, he robbed them and left the suit in a dumpster. The Controllers apparently programmed an instinctive hatred of Reach scarabs into the suits including the one currently worn by Kate Spencer. Her suit reacts adversely to the scarab currently bonded to Blue Beetle Jaime Reyes.Manhunter (vol. 3) #32 (Sept. 2008) * The Gauntlets ‚Äì A small-time crook found the gauntlets, originally worn by Azrael during his stint as Batman, in Gotham City. The crook used them in an unsuccessful burglary, but when the police arrived, the crook fell to his death, leaving the gauntlets embedded in the side of the building. * The Staff ‚Äì An attack on Eclipso ended with several heroes dead; among them was a man programmed to believe that he was Mark Shaw. The staff was recovered with the body and hidden in storage. Other characters have remarked that Kate displays slightly elevated strength and resilience to injury. If these are actual meta-human powers as a result of her lineage from Iron Munro or if Kate is simply tougher than average has not been clarified. In other media =Television= * Kate Spencer made her first appearance in live action on The CW television series Arrow, played by Chelah Horsdal. In \\"Damaged\\", District Attorney Kate tries to get Oliver Queen convicted after he is accused of being the Starling City vigilante but Laurel Lance arrives at the last minute to save him by having him confined to his home. Later, Kate tries to get Oliver to plead insane rather than take a lie detector test but Oliver still goes through with the test and gets out of it, subsequently managing to clear his name by having his associate John Diggle appear as the vigilante while he is confined. In \\"State V. Queen\\" after A.D.A. Adam Donner is abducted by Count Vertigo during the trial of Moira Queen, she, despite the concerns of Sebastian Blood, assigns Laurel as head of the case. In \\"Birds of Prey\\" Kate has Adam Donner fired when he uses the arrest and trial of Frank Bertinelli to draw out his vigilante daughter Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress which results in a hostage situation. Laurel is also briefly reappointed to her job without Kate's approval which she apologizes for; she initially states that nothing had changed, but Laurel blackmails Kate into giving her job back. In \\"The Man Under The Hood\\" when Laurel's father Quentin Lance is arrested for assisting the Arrow, Laurel once again blackmails Kate and she has the charges against Quentin dropped. However, as she walks away she warns Laurel to be careful of her. In \\"Streets of Fire\\", she is killed by one of Slade Wilson's soldiers, forcing Sebastian Blood to recognize that Wilson has no intention of carrying out their original deal of damaging Starling City so that Blood could rebuild it in the aftermath. In \\"The Calm\\", after Slade Wilson's defeat, Laurel keeps working under the new district attorney, who in \\"Green Arrow\\" is revealed to be named Susanna.

It belongs to the community of Miamou within the municipality of Gortyna. Origins of the name The name of Lentas possibly derives from the Greek word ŒõŒ≠ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ (in English, \\"lion\\"). It refers to the lion shaped cape that makes the small protected bay of Lentas. This cape is documented in medieval maps as Cape Liontas (Greek ŒëŒ∫œÅ. ŒõŒπœéŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ). Climate It belongs to an area where the climate consists of an exception in accordance to the climate on the island of Crete which is mediterranean. Lentas falls in the North African climatic zone and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures during the summer. Probably the best time to visit Lentas is spring and autumn.  History  Lentas has a rich past and there is evidence that it had been inhabited from the Neolithic and Early Minoan period (3rd millennium BC). Lentas (ancient Greek: Œõ·ºêŒ≤Œ∑ŒΩ(Leben)) is also known to be one of the two harbours of Gortys, which became the most prominent city of Crete after the fall of Knossos. In the late Classical period (beginning of the 4th century B.C.) the Gortynians established the sanctuary of Asklepios at the harbour. During the tremendous earthquake of 46 B.C. Lentas was destroyed and subsequently rebuilt. Gortys later was the Province's capital during the Roman era, which also comprised Cyrnaica (ancient Libya). In the early Christian and Byzantine periods, a small settlement developed and a basilica was erected. The small Byzantine church of St. John was built in the 14th century. The archaeological investigation of the site started after the first visit of the English captain H. Spratt, in the middle of the 19th century. Excavations were carried out by the Italian Archaeological School at Athens in 1900, 1910 and 1912‚Äì13, and revealed the sanctuary and other buildings. Since then no excavation had taken place in the ancient city until recent years, when the investigations of the Greek Archaeological Service brought to light the Minoan settlement and graves. Today in Lentas there is an archaeological site of the sanctuary of Asklepios (Greek ŒëœÉŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÄŒµŒπœåœÇ) and the Byzantine church of St John. It is believed that Levin during the Roman occupation became a sanitarium where sick wealthy Romans, mainly from North Africa, received treatment. The treatment consisted of a diet with mineral water from an ancient spring near the temple of Asklepios, which was believed to have therapeutic properties, and local fruits. Today Lentas is a popular tourist destination and has rural and stock farming activities.

OWL strives to be unbiased and teaches about heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual, and transgender sexual health. In addition to information on sex, OWL is intended to help children, youth, and adults to be emotionally healthy and responsible in terms of their sexuality. Program structure There are four OWL curricula designed for the American school grades of K‚Äì1, 4‚Äì6, 7‚Äì9, 10‚Äì12, plus one for young adults (18- to 35-year- olds) and one for adults. Each session of the Our Whole Lives curriculum can include the \\"Sexuality and Our Faith\\" companion, which comes in separate versions, one for the UUA and CUC communities and another one for the UCC community. Without \\"Sexuality and Our Faith,\\" the programs have no religious material and are thus appropriate for use in schools and other non-religious institutions. Program values Our Whole Lives is built upon three core values: #Respect #Relationships #Responsibility Participants are encouraged to use these values in decision-making concerning their own sexuality and relationships. Throughout the program, participants are encouraged to explore and learn to articulate their own values. Program leaders Our Whole Lives classes are led by teams of facilitators recruited from within their congregations. Before leading Our Whole Lives, facilitators must complete a training program led by certified trainers of trainers. Training is intensive and focused on building the facilitation skills demanded by Our Whole Lives. In addition to exploring the core values and pedagogical theory underlying Our Whole Lives, trainings include opportunities to peer-facilitate a session, giving future leaders hands-on experience. At the end of the training (which is approximately 20 hours of training over three days), facilitators must be certified by their trainers before leading Our Whole Lives in their congregations. Facilitators for Our Whole Lives work in teams of at least two ‚Äì one male and one female ‚Äì for each class. The gender balance allows participants to feel comfortable raising concerns, questions and issues with their trainers. For the middle school (grades 7-9) curriculum, some activities are done in gender segregated groups, otherwise all activities take place in mixed gender groups. Leaders for Our Whole Lives are expected to model the program values - treating participants with respect and honoring their moral agency. In Unitarian Universalist congregations the grades 7‚Äì9 OWL curriculum replaced the somewhat controversial About Your Sexuality, which went out of print in the 1990s.

His nephew Henry Alonzo House is also a noted early American inventor. Royal Earl House spent his childhood in Vermont experimenting, designing, and building, a habit which would earn him distinction as an adult. He once caught a toad, skinned it, placed a set of springs in the skin and made it hop. Around 1840, he went to Buffalo, New York to live with relatives and attend law school in that town. However, he read a work on electricity which so inspired him that he decided to give up law and study the science of electricity instead. He was also interested in mechanics, chemistry and magnetism. By 1846, the Morse telegraph service was operational between Washington, DC, and New York. Royal Earl House patented his printing telegraph that same year. He linked two 28-key piano-style keyboards by wire. Each piano key represented a letter of the alphabet and when pressed caused the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. A \\"shift\\" key gave each main key two optional values. A 56-character typewheel at the sending end was synchronised to coincide with a similar wheel at the receiving end. If the key corresponding to a particular character was pressed at the home station, it actuated the typewheel at the distant station just as the same character moved into the printing position, in a way similar to the daisy wheel printer. It was thus an example of a synchronous data transmission system. House's equipment could transmit around 40 instantly readable words per minute, but was difficult to manufacture in bulk. The printer could copy and print out up to 2,000 words per hour. This invention was first put in operation and exhibited at the Mechanics Institute in New York in 1844. In 1886 and 1887, when the Royal E. House telegraph company was producing the printing telegraph, the Morse Telegraph company tried to enjoin (legally prevent) them from infringing on the Morse patents. Morse claimed the sole right of transmitting intelligence by electricity, utilizing the Morse code. The courts decided the House Company did not infringe the Morse patent, as the messages using the House system were all printed on a slip of paper, without the use of Morse Code. Later the House Co. and the Morse Co. joined and formed the Great Western Telegraph Company.

According to vocalist Mark Hunter, as of 2003, the band has sold 44,000 copies of the album in the United States alone. Pass Out of Existence features an altogether different sound when compared to the band's later albums, leaning more towards nu metal rather than the groove metal style featured in later material.http://thenewfury.com/down- again-chimaira-expand-and-evolve-on-the-impossibility-of-reason/ Its heavy use of electronics has also been noted.

Produced by Betty Box, it is a remake of the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock film, loosely based on the 1915 novel The Thirty- Nine Steps by John Buchan. In the film, diplomat Richard Hannay returns home to London, only to become inadvertently embroiled in the death of a British spy investigating the head of an organisation planning to sell the secret of a British ballistic missile. Hannay thus travels to Scotland to escape the police, and attempts to complete the spy's work. It is the first colour version of the Buchan tale, and, unlike the mainly studio-bound original, features extensive location shooting. Several large set pieces (such as Hannay's escape from the train on the Forth Bridge and the music hall finale) and much of the dialogue are taken from the original film. As with the Hitchcock version, the scenario was contemporary rather than the pre-Great War setting of Buchan's original. Plot Coming to the assistance of a nanny who is almost killed during a bungled hit-and-run assassination attempt, Richard Hannay (More) is surprised to find that there is no baby in her pram. Curious, he meets her at the Palace Music Hall where she has gone to see the act of Mr Memory (James Hayter). Afterwards, she goes back to Hannay's flat with him, where she reveals that she is a spy working for British Intelligence following a group called \\"The Thirty-Nine Steps\\"; all they know about their elusive leader is that he is missing the tip of a finger. The Thirty-Nine Steps are in possession of a set of top-secret plans for \\"Boomerang\\", a British ballistic missile project that could tip the balance of power in Europe. She tells Hannay that she must leave for Scotland immediately, but while Hannay is out of the room, she is killed by two hitmen. Fearing he will be accused of her murder, Hannay decides to continue her mission and catches an ex LNER Class A4 hauled train to Scotland from King's Cross railway station, evading the hitmen outside his flat by adopting a cunning milkman disguise. During the journey, he has a chance encounter with Miss Fisher (Taina Elg), a netball coach at a boarding school for girls. He is forced to pretend they are lovers to avoid the police detectives who boarded at Edinburgh. However, Miss Fisher gives him away and Hannay jumps from the stationary train on the Forth Bridge. He then meets Percy Baker (Sid James), a helpful ex-convict lorry driver who advises him to stop at \\"The Gallows\\", an inn owned by Nelly Lumsden (Brenda De Banzie), who was once imprisoned for practising the occult. She helps him pass the police patrols by disguising him in a cycle party she is accommodating and creating a diversion with her husband. Hannay eventually finds the house of the man he thinks he is looking for, Professor Logan (Barry Jones), but finds out that he has been tricked; the man is actually the spy ring's leader. He escapes and informs the police, but is not believed and has to jump out of the police station window. Hannay escapes in the back of a passing sheep transporter. He then poses as a lecturer in a Highland girls' boarding school, coincidentally where Miss Fisher works, and ends up giving a bizarre lecture on \\"the woods and the wayside in August\\". Miss Fisher recognises him and he is again taken into custody, but this time by two assassins posing as detectives. After he shouts out to Miss Fisher to telephone Scotland Yard about Boomerang, the assassins are forced to take her with them. Hannay is handcuffed to Miss Fisher in a Ford Zephyr with the hitmen, who are taking them back to London. A burst tyre gives Hannay his chance to escape, but only having one hand to drive with, he crashes the car, forcing him to wander through the bleak Scottish Highlands handcuffed to Miss Fisher. Eventually, they chance upon a bed and breakfast run by Mrs MacDougal (Betty Henderson). Hannay hides their handcuffed condition and informs her that they are a runaway couple. While Hannay sleeps, Miss Fisher frees herself from the handcuffs, but then overhears their pursuers inquiring about them and about The Thirty-Nine Steps. She realises her error and goes back to help Hannay, telling him the final rendezvous for the conspirators. The finale is back in the Palace Music Hall where Hannay provokes Mr. Memory into telling him where \\"The Thirty-Nine Steps\\" are, just as the police arrest him. Mr Memory has used his formidable memory to memorise the Boomerang plans. However, before he can reveal the secret, Memory is shot by the ringleader and the secret is safe, as the main conspirators are either dead or in custody.

Director Ralph Thomas stated in an interview that to distance it from Hitchcock's pre-war thriller, he tried to produce the film with the feel of a comedy. Andrew Spicer notes that \\"Critics detected a reassuring period feel to the visual style, with More as the pipe-smoking, sporting gentleman in a flat cap.\\" He notes a contemporary review of Kenneth More \\"playing Hannay with a kind of tweedy casualness and dare-devil insouciance\\".Spicer, Andrew, Typical men: the representation of masculinity in popular British cinema, (I.B.Tauris, 2003) Sue Harper suggests that to distance it from the \\"intractable precedents\\" of Hitchcock's adaptation, \\"Minor and unsuccessful adjustments were made.\\"Harper, Sue, Women in British cinema: mad, bad, and dangerous to know (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000) p. 160 These include changing the scene at a crofter's cottage into a roadside cafe, changing Hannay's address of a political rally into giving a lecture at a girls' school and, in a nod to Buchan's novel, including several encounters with Scottish eccentrics. Production The film appears to have always been a vehicle for Kenneth More. More had carved himself a niche as a leading man of 1950s British cinema, having appeared in heroic roles in films such as Reach for the Sky and A Night to Remember. Kay Kendall was originally announced as the co- star. The casting of Finnish actress and dancer Taina Elg, meanwhile, was unpopular with contemporary critics, who felt her performance to be unconvincing, feeling that \\"her beauty is frozen by the uncertainties of ignorance, if not of neuroticism\\".Filmfacts, Volume 3, (Division of Cinema of the University of Southern California, 1960) p. 262 Other players were largely character actors with long associations with Pinewood Studios and producer Betty E. Box.Pettigrew, Terence, British film character actors: great names and memorable moments, Volume 1982, Part 2 (Rowman & Littlefield, 1982), p. 28 In addition to the primary cast, the film features a number of small appearances by British actors who were to become well known from their later work, for instance Joan Hickson as a teacher and Brenda De Banzie as a psychic. Bill Simpson and Andrew Cruickshank, both soon to appear together in Doctor Finlay's Casebook had small roles, in Simpson's case his only film appearance.Walker, Mark, Review at LoveFilm, Retrieved 1 October 2010 Peter Vaughan had his first screen appearance in the film, playing a policeman on the train. Sid James, familiar from his work in many other films, appears as a roguish lorry driver who helps Hannay. =Filming= Interior filming took place primarily at Pinewood Studios, with extensive location filming in Scotland, including North and South Queensferry, Dunblane, Balquhidder, Altskeith and at the Falls of Dochart in Killin, as well as other parts of Stirling and Perthshire such as Brig o' Turk and its 1930s wooden tearoom, which featured as \\"the Gallows\\" inn . The film also includes a large section at Waverley Station and at Princes Street Station, Edinburgh, on the Forth Bridge and on board a train hauled by an LNER Class A4.\\"Marsden, Richard\\" LNER The cinematography was by Ernest Steward, and it was filmed in Eastmancolor., Retrieved 1 October 2010 =Music= The music was by British film composer Clifton Parker, who composed prolifically for cinema and theatre in this period.Ades, David, Clifton Parker biography , Robert Farnon Society, Retrieved 1 October 2010 The score was conducted by Muir Mathieson. Many of the melodic themes throughout the film derive from pieces performed by the house orchestra during the early music hall scene, particularly the \\"Mr. Memory\\" motif. A review by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures also makes a comparison between the theatre and the film, noting \\"The score Clifton Parker has composed for the new version of The 39 Steps has a gay overture which also sets the right mood. It's short, not noisy, has musical wit, and promises comedy, not thrills.\\"Films in review, Volume 11, (National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, 1960) p. 110 Reception =Box office= The 39 Steps was the sixth most popular film at the British box office in 1959. =Critical= Critically, the film has often been regarded as inferior to Hitchcock's 1935 adaptation, and director Ralph Thomas stated it was not his favourite film. On being asked why he agreed to direct it he stated: > Well, Rank owned it, and I was under contract, and they asked me to do it. > So I asked Alfred [Hitchcock] about it, and he said \\"If you have the > chutzpah to do it, you go ahead, my son and do it. You won't do it as well > as I did it.\\" And of course he was right. His film was a wonderful picture. > I think mine was a piece of effrontery that didn't come off, and on the > whole I regretted it.Dixon, Wheeler W., Collected interviews: voices from > twentieth-century cinema, (SIU Press, 2001) p.112 A number of critics have pointed to the slow pacing of the film, noting a lack of suspense usually attributed to More's charming, but leisurely performance. Comparing it to Hitchcock's version A.H. Waiton writing in 1960 suggested: \\"the pace, as well as the execution is milder, more civilised and somehow less suspenseful than it seemed previously. Mr. Thomas's direction may be at the core of it all, but Kenneth More's polished performance seems lacking in urgency. He is a frowning, somewhat put-upon gent, but certainly not a citizen involved in a life-and-death matter.\\" Reviewing it more recently for LoveFilm, Mark Walker opined: \\"As a thriller it's hardly in the same league as North by Northwest, but as a window on life in England and Scotland in the 1950s, this 39 Steps has much to recommend it.\\" Release The film had its world premiere on 12 March 1959 at the Odeon Leicester Square and was released in the US on 10 October 1960. In home video formats, it is available in Region 2 PAL on Carlton International DVD, albeit in a zoomed 4x3 print of the original 1.75:1 ratio and with no extra features.

mosquito. =Biology= These insects feed on decaying organic matter and fungi. They are often found in greenhouses. Their larvae are up to 6 mm long, white, slender and legless, with a black head and smooth semi-transparent skin which reveals the contents of the digestive tract. Sex determination in Sciara is a different mechanism. Sciara basically has 4 pairs of chromosomes 3 pairs of autosomes and one pair of allosomes. Some special chromosomes called limited chromosomes are present in certain stages. The zygote has 3 pairs of autosomes a one or more limited chromosomes and 3 X chromosome (2 fathers‚Äô, 1 mother's). There are 2 stages in Sciara: the Germ line and the Somaline.Unique Biological Features of Sciara in Sciara Stock CenterSciara Genome in Sciara Stock Center Germ line The Germ line is the gametic line where the gamete formation takes place. The number of chromosomes during this line is different in males and females. In the formation sperms of males the 1st spermatocystic division is monocentric mitosis, the maternal and paternal homologous chromosomes are separated. Then few limited chromosomes are eliminated not all of them. After this one paternal X chromosome is also eliminated. Hence male germ line (spermatogonia) cells have 3 pairs of autosomes, 2 (one maternal and one paternal) X chromosomes and a few limited chromosomes. In the formation ova of the females the 1st ovarian division is monocentric mitosis, the maternal and paternal homologous chromosomes are separated. Then few limited chromosomes are eliminated not all of them. After this both 2 paternal X chromosome are also eliminated. Hence female germ line (oogonia) cells have 3 pairs of autosomes, 1 maternal X chromosomes and a few limited chromosomes. Soma line Soma line is the vegetative stage. During early cleavage stages of the embryo limited chromosomes are eliminated. The number of chromosomes during this line is different in males and females. In males during the 5th and 6th divisions of the embryo all the limited chromosomes are eliminated. Then paternal X chromosome is eliminated which are 2 in number. Hence male soma line cells have 3 pairs of autosomes and one maternal X chromosome. In the females during the 5th and 6th divisions of the embryo all the limited chromosomes are eliminated. In the next stage of cleavage one paternal X chromosome is eliminated. Hence female soma line cells have 3 pairs of autosomes and one maternal and one paternal X chromosome. Bibliography * Pettey, F.

The earliest reference to the Lyon, as such, dates to the reign of Robert the Bruce in 1318, although with respect to certain of his functions he is considered the successor of royal officials dating to ancient Celtic times.Dennis 1999, p. 5. The Lord Lyon exercises general jurisdiction over all matters armorial in Scotland and serves as a Judge of the Realm. He also decides on questions relating to family representation, pedigrees and genealogies. In addition, he supervises all state, royal and public ceremonies in Scotland.Burnett 1997, p. 59. The Lord Lyon also asserts the right to decide who is Head of the Clan or Chief of the Family or Name,Friar 1987, p. 305. although his authority to determine chiefships has been challenged. In carrying out his duties, he has been assisted, in recent times, by a staff of three heralds and pursuivants along with a Lyon Clerk and Keeper of the Records. The present Lyon Clerk, Elizabeth Roads MVO, who is also Snawdoun Herald, is the first woman ever to serve as an Officer of Arms in the United Kingdom.Burnett 1997, p. 60; see Pursuant to Chapter 47 of the Act of 1672, the Lord Lyon is empowered to grant arms to \\"vertuous [virtuous] and well deserving persons.\\"Innes of Learney 1978, p. 13, see p.46. According to Innes of Learney: \\"A [Scottish] coat of arms is the outward indication of nobility and arms are officially described as 'Ensigns of Nobility'. A patent of arms is . . . a Diploma of Nobility . . . .\\"Innes of Learney 1978, p. 13. Clarifying this statement, a later writer on Scottish heraldry has noted: \\"Technically, a grant of arms from the Lord Lyon is a patent of nobility; the grantee is thereby 'enrolled with all nobles in the noblesse of Scotland'. This does not constitute a peerage or any title. It is a social distinction, and has no legal privileges.\\"Burnett 1997, p. 42. Principles The principal function of heraldry, whether personal or corporate, is to symbolise the identity of the owner of the armorial bearings. In Scotland the Clan, the Family, and the Name have survived as significant entities in the social organization of Scottish society. In Scottish heraldry there is no such thing as a \\"family coat of arms\\". Junior members of a family are assigned specific and relevant differences to the armorial bearings of an ancestor. Scottish heraldry operates under the supposition that all those who share the same surname are related, however distantly. Consequently, where a coat of arms for the head of a family already exists, new grants of arms to individuals with the same surname will generally be variations on those arms.Burnett 1997, p. 41. \\"[T]he salient feature of Scottish heraldry is that, as compared with England and other countries, the basic coats of arms are relatively few in number, but numerous differenced versions of each basic shield exist. The basic, or simple undifferenced arms and crest, are the property, not of the 'family', but of the 'Chief' of each clan or house ‚Ä¶.\\"Innes of Learney 1978, p. 13‚Äì14. The strict adherence to cadency, or the need for cadets to difference their arms from the chief of the family, is due to the permanence of the old families. From an early period the leading families of England were extinguished in the male line. Some continue to exist in the male line, but are comparatively obscure, having sprung from untitled cadets of the ancient families. On the other hand, the Scoto-Norman barons were remarkable for their numerous progeny. Subinfeudation, which had been prohibited in England since the time of the Plantagenet kings, was largely practised in Scotland. Whole districts of Scotland have their predominant names, which are generally those of the old feudal families. Surnames were for a long time after their introduction, used only by the gentry; and when they began to be assumed by the lower orders, the clansman almost invariably took the name of his chief, considering himself a member of his family, at least by adoption, if not by blood. In England new men emerged, and founded new families; it was easier to adopt new arms rather than trace a connection with those who had died. Hence it came to pass that while in England the multitude of entirely distinct coats of arms is enormous, in Scotland the number of original coats is small.Woodward, J. A treatise on heraldry, British and foreign : with English and French glossaries, Vol. 2, p. 397-400 The earliest existing examples of Scots heraldry are Stewart coats of arms from seals of the last half of the 12th century and the first half of the 13th, and show the fess chequy, which is still a feature of 21st century Scots heraldry. The Lord Lyon King of Arms has a vital and continuing influence on the family organization in Scotland. Depending on the terms of the original grant, armorial bearings are succeeded to by the heir‚Äîwho may be the heir male, the heir female, or the heir by tailzie (an heir nominated within the blood relationship). Characteristics =Mottoes= One of the most obvious visual distinctions of Scottish heraldry from heraldic styles used elsewhere is that the scroll on which the motto is displayed is almost always positioned above the crest in Scottish bearings, as depicted in the illustration of the Royal Coat of Arms of Scotland above.Burnett 1997, p. 33; Innes of Learney 1978, p. 20. This difference is more than merely visual, however. In Scottish heraldry mottoes are considered a component of the grant of arms and can be altered only by re-matriculating the arms. In English heraldry, while a motto is usually illustrated in the patent of arms, with very rare exceptions, it is not included in the verbal grant of armorial bearings. Consequently, English mottoes may be changed at will.Brooke-Little 1970, p. 175. The Stodart system of differencing the coats of arms of cadet branches of a family =Cadency= Another difference between Scottish and English heraldry that may be discerned from the appearance of the shield itself lies in the systems employed to distinguish younger sons of an armiger, known as cadency. English heraldry uses a series of small symbols, termed brisures, to differentiate between the senior representative of an armigerous family and junior lines known as \\"cadet branches\\". In Scotland, except for the line of the immediate heir, this function is served by a series of bordures (borders) surrounding the shield of varying, specified colors and designs, named the \\"Stodart\\" system.Friar 1993, p. 184. In Scottish practice brisures function only as \\"temporary house marks of cadency used by children . . . without formal authority of the Lyon Office, until they establish houses of their own.\\" =Badges= Heraldic badges are treated differently in Scottish heraldic practice than in English armoury. A badge may be defined as \\"An armorial device, not part of the coat of arms, but . . . available to an armigerous person or corporation for the purpose of identification.\\"Friar 1987, p. 41. Badges may consist of no more than a charge from the shield of arms, but others were emblems adopted for their hidden meaning or in allusion to a name, title or office. In England, the granting of badges to armigers by the College of Arms has become \\"commonplace\\" in recent years.Slater 2002, p. 31. crest badge suitable for a member of Clan Maclachlan. In Scottish heraldry, however, the grant of badges is limited to those categories of individuals who may be expected to have a \\"numerous following\\", that is to say a significant body of adherents or supporters. Generally badges are awarded only to peers, the baronage, clan chiefs and chieftains and the older landed houses and only when the Lord Lyon is satisfied that the grant of a badge is warranted on practical grounds.Innes of Learney 1978, p. 23-24. Corporate bodies, such as local governments, schools, companies or sports clubs may also obtain badges as a means for their members to display their affiliation. Scottish heraldry, however, also recognizes a unique form of badge, the crest badge.See Innes of Learney 1978, p. 90-95. In the case of an armiger, this device is composed of his crest, encircled by a plain circle on which is inscribed the individual's motto. As a mark of allegiance to their chief, members of a clan are permitted to wear a clansmen's badge, consisting of their chief's crest surrounded by a strap and buckle device on which the chief's motto is inscribed.Burnett 1997, p. 32-33. =Crests= In English heraldic practice the crest, the device or emblem that appears above the helmet or chapeau in a full coat of arms, should not duplicate any crest previously granted. Just as each shield should be unique, so too should each crest.Fox-Davies 1985, p. 253. In Scotland, however, it is permissible, and not uncommon, for two or more different families to bear the same crest.Brooke-Little 1970, p. 162. As Scottish heraldry joins the crest and motto in the crest badge, however, the combination of crest and motto should, in each case, be unique. =Heiresses= In traditional heraldic practice coats of arms pass through the male line. Where a woman's father bears arms and, at his death, there are no surviving sons or surviving children of sons, the woman is an heraldic heiress and can transmit her father's arms to her descendants.Brooke-Little 1970, p. 140. In England, if there is more than one surviving daughter, each transmits her father's arms on equal terms.Friar 1993, p. 181. In Scotland, only the eldest surviving daughter transmits her father's undifferenced arms to her offspring.Burnett 1997, p. 46. =Quarterings= In heraldry a basic shield can be divided into four, essentially equal, sections or quarterings. In recent times this typically occurs as the result of the marriage of an armiger to an heraldic heiress.Slater 2002, p. 116. English heraldry appears to put no limit on such divisions, which continue to be termed \\"quarterings\\" no matter how many more are added.Fox-Davies 1985, p. 420., Scottish practice favours a simplicity of design and permits each quarter to itself be quartered, but no more. A Scottish shield, therefore, is limited to sixteen quarterings.Burnett 1997, p. 47. Important works Scottish heralds and the Lord Lyon, from an 18thC French illustration of an opening of the Scottish parliament \\"Scotland has no ancient rolls of arms as in England and its earliest document of any importance is the Armorial de Gelr√© 1369‚Äì1388 preserved in Brussels - a European manuscript with a section on Scottish arms.\\" The first truly Scottish armorial dates only from 1508.Innes-Smith 1980, p. 19; see Innes of Learney 1978, p. 39. Two of the oldest and most important works on the subject of Scottish heraldry are The Science of Herauldry by George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, first published in 1680, and A System of Heraldry by Alexander Nisbet, first published in 1722.Burnett 1997, p. 17. Mackenzie is regard as legal authority in matters of Scottish heraldry.Nisbet 1984 (Foreword by Malcolm Innes of Edingight). Whether Nisbet is likewise regarded as of \\"institutional authority\\" is unclear, but \\"his work has been treated with very great respect since it appeared in 1722.\\" Perhaps the most celebrated work of Scottish heraldry is the Public Register of all Arms and Bearings in Scotland, known more simply as the Public Register or even Lyon Register. It has been said that: \\"There is no better evidence of the diversity and splendour of heraldic art anywhere in the world than is to be found in the [Lyon Register]. . . .\\"Way of Plean 1994, p. 50. The work was created under the authority of the Statute of 1672, which provided that it record all arms properly registered with the Lord Lyon. The first volume was bound in 1677 and it has been faithfully maintained from that time.Innes of Learney 1978, p.43-44. Each of the series of massive volumes contains 120 pages of vellum, and it includes the work of some of Scotland's greatest heraldic artists over nearly three and one-half centuries.Way of Plean 1994, p. 52.  Civic heraldry  Scotland's civic heraldry is particularly rich with burgh arms from the 15th century still in use in the 21st. The earliest civic heraldry seems to have been the arms of Dundee which date back 600 years. In January 2008 a petition to matriculate armorial bearings for the City of Inverness was refused by Lord Lyon King of Arms on the grounds that there is no legal persona to which arms can be granted.\\"Coat of arms rejected in city status query\\", The Inverness Courier, accessed February 12, 2008  Notes  References Works referenced *Agnew of Lochnaw, Sir Crispin. \\"Heraldic Bibliography.\\" The Highlander.

Her other construction works include the construction of a road from Subarnarekha River to Puri for the pilgrims, Babughat (also known as Babu Rajchandra Das Ghat), Ahiritola Ghat and Nimtala ghat for the everyday bathers at the Ganges.

Biography She was born on 28 September 1793. Her father, Harekrishna Das, lived in Kona village, in present-day Halisahar, North 24 Parganas. Her mother Rampriya devi died when she was just seven years old. Exceptionally beautiful, she was married to Babu Rajachandra Das (Marh) of Janbazar, Kolkata, a member of a wealthy zamindar family, when she was eleven years old. They had four daughters. The daughters were Padmamani, Kumari, Karunamoyee and Jagadamba. Padmamani was married to Ramchandra Ata. Kumari was married to Pairimohan Chowdhury, and she died early, in 1827. Karunamoyee was married to Mathurmohan Biswas (or Madhur-mohan Biswas). She died in 1833 after childbirth, and after her death, her younger sister Jagadamba was married to her husband Mathurmohan Biswas. Dakshineswar Kali Temple, built by Rani Rashmoni in 1855 After her husband's death in 1836, Rashmoni took charge of the zamindari and finances. She was 49 years in age at that time. She soon proved herself a capable administrator. While the prestige of the zamindari grew, Rani Rashmoni, being very pious from childhood, continued to lead an extremely religious and austere life, befitting a widow in Bengali Hindu society. Rani Rashmoni died on 19 February 1861. The Rani and her clashes with the British in India became household tales in her time. By blocking the shipping trade on a part of Ganges she compelled the British to abolish the tax imposed on fishing in the river, which threatened the livelihood of poor fishermen. When Puja processions were stopped by the British on the charge that they disturbed the peace, she defied the orders. The British had to withdraw the penalty imposed on her in the face of public opposition and rioting in her support. Rani Rashmoni also had to her credit numerous charitable works and other contributions to society. She oversaw the construction of a road from Subarnarekha river to Puri for pilgrims. She funded the construction of ghats such as Babughat (in memory of her husband), Ahiritola Ghat and Nimtala Ghat for the daily bathers in the Ganges. She donated generously to the then Imperial Library (now the National Library of India) and Hindu College (now Presidency University). Prince Dwarkanath Tagore had mortgaged a part of his Zamindari in now South 24 Parganas (part of present-day Santoshpur and adjoining areas) to Rani Rashmoni for his passage to England. This part of land which was then a part of the Sunderbans was marshy and almost uninhabitable except for some families of thugs who found the area convenient to stay and venture out for plunders in far away places mounted on stilts. Rani Rashmoni persuaded these families and helped them to build up fisheries in the surrounding water bodies that later turned into large rich bheris. They gradually gave up their 'profession' of plundering and transformed into a community of fishermen. This was a great social reform that the Rani had initiated . A divine revelation led her to found the famous temple Dakshineswar Kali Temple complex on the banks of the Ganges at Dakshineswar in the North 24 Parganas. Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa (then known as Gadadhar) was appointed its head priest under her patronage. Though having such a great spiritual nature the society then had discriminated her. Being born in Chasi-Kaibartta family and being a middle-caste Shudra origin, no Brahmin was ready to be the priest in her temple. Rani Rashmoni's House at Janbazar was venue of traditional Durga Puja celebration each autumn. This included traditional pomp, including all-night jatras (folk theatre), rather than by entertainment for the Englishmen with whom she carried on a running feud. After her death in 1861, her sons-in-law took to celebrating Durga Puja in their respective premises In popular culture Rani Rashmoni on a 1994 stamp of India Shrine dedicated to Rani Rashmoni within the precincts of Dakshineswar Kali Temple Rani Rashmoni has also been subject of a biographical film in Bengali language, titled Rani Rasmani (film) (1955), directed by Kaliprasad Ghosh, and wherein lead played by famous theatre personality and actress Molina Devi.

Geography The village is in the C√©vennes, above the D999 road between Le Vigan and Alzon. History Arrigas possesses a number of Megalithic remains including the dolmen of Arrigas on the route to Peyraube, and the dolmen of Peyre Cabuss√©lado near the border with the commune of Arre. There are also three knocked-over menhirs at the mountain pass de Vernes, and more lower down at the place called Troulhas. The village itself was founded in the 12th century by a colony of Benedictine monks under the dependency of St Victor of Marseille; a church is mentioned in 1113 and a monastery in 1135. By the 14th century, during the Hundred Years' War, the church was fortified. During the French Wars of Religion the d'Albignac family, lords (seigneurs) of Arrigas, embraced the Reformation, alongside part of the population. But later their loyalty to the Crown led the d'Albignacs to change camp. In 1625, when Henri, duc de Rohan led the uprising of the Protestants of Languedoc, Charles d'Albignac took up the Catholic cause of the King, Louis XIII. His castle at the Pont d'Arre was taken by the Protestant zealots, while the fortified church of Arrigas was almost completely destroyed. Some months later, at the Siege of Creissels, Charles d'Albignac stopped the advance of the troops of Rohan, and afterwards he was elevated by the King to become the Baron d'Arre. After the destruction of the Pont d'Arre, the d'Albignac family built the ch√¢teau of Arrigas. Louis-Alexandre d'Albignac was born here in 1739 and became a Lieutenant-General in the armies of the King, then a g√©n√©ral de division in the Revolutionary and Imperial armies, decorated with the royal Order of Saint Louis and the Imperial L√©gion d'honneur. After a remarkable career under the Ancien R√©gime, d'Albignac put himself in the service of the French Revolution and accepted becoming the first mayor of Le Vigan (the main town of the region) in 1790. He took up service against the enemies of the Revolution in the Camp of Jales, and then served in the army, either the armies of the Alps or the Rhine. He is the most illustrious of the children of Arrigas, although he died in his own house in Le Vigan in 1825. Arrigas is lively village from July to August when home owners from all over France, Europe and even Canada descend to spend the summer holidays. There are communal (3 day) fetes in mid July and at the end of August.

Description and biography According to some account, Shurpanakha was, like her mother and grandmother, very beautiful, but her ability to change her form means discrepancies in description can be accounted for. *Thin and curved *Beautiful brown eyes, slightly up tilted *Thick, long brown hair *A sweet, melodious voice. Many texts mention that when she first sees Rama in the forest, she is described as \\"grim of eye and foul of face\\", \\"of unlovely figure\\", with her \\"dim locks disordered\\", a \\"dire form with age... dried\\", and \\"hideous fiend, a thing to hate\\". In her interactions with Rama and Lakshmana, the demonic woman adopted a more attractive form.The Ramayan of Valmiki, tr. Ralph T. H. Griffith, Trubner & Co., 1870, canto XVII The youngest child of Maharshi Vishrava and his second wife, Kaikesi, Shurpanakha was given the name of Mƒ´nak·π£ƒ´ \\"Dƒ´k·π£a\\" at birth, and some also called her \\"Candra·πáakhƒÅ\\" (the one with nails like the moon). Shurpanakha grew up and secretly married the Danava prince of the Kalkeya Danava clan, Vidyutjihva. Ravana became enraged with Shurpanakha for marrying a Danava. The Danavas were the mortal enemies of Rakshasas, and he was about to punish her, but Mandodari convinced him to respect the wishes of his sister. Thus Ravana accepted Shurpanakha, her husband and Danavas as relatives officially. At the time of conquering Rasatala (the underworld), her brother, Ravana decided to visit his newly married sister, where he discovered Vidyutjihva's true motive to marry Shurpanakha ‚Äì to kill Ravana. In Shurpanakha's absence, Vidyutjihva attacked Ravana, who in self-defense killed his brother-in-law.Valmiki Ramayan by Rajshekhar Basu - Uttarkanda This earned Ravana his hurt and miserable sister's great displeasure, and the widowed Shurpanakha then split her time between Lanka and the woods of Southern India, sometimes living with her forest-dwelling Asura relatives, Khara and Dushana, on Ravana's orders. She also had conceived a son by Vidyutjihva known as Shambhri who was accidentally killed by Lakshmana. Lakshmana cutting Shurpanakha's nose According to Valmiki, she met the exiled Prince Rama of Ayodhya, during one such visit to the Forest of Panchavati, and was instantly smitten by his youthful good looks. She adopted a beautiful form to entice him, but Rama meanwhile kindly rejected her advances, telling her that he was faithful to his wife Sita and thus would never take another wife. Rejected, Shurpanakha then approached his younger brother, Lakshmana, who said that he is only second to Ram and therefore not worthy of her. Infuriated by their dismissals, the humiliated and envious Shurpanakha returned to her demonic form and attacked Sita, but was thwarted by Lakshmana, who cut off her nose. Shurpanakha first went to her brother Khara, who sent seven Rakshasa warriors to attack Rama, who easily despatched them. Khara himself then attacked, along with 14,000 soldiers, all of whom were killed except for Akampana, Sumali's son and Kaikesi's brother, who fled to Lanka. She then fled to Ravana's court and spoke to her brother of the disgrace she had suffered. Her brother, hearing of Sita‚Äôs beauty, decided to kidnap Sita. Akampana too played a key role in instigating Sita's kidnapping by Ravana. Despite opposition from their brother, Vibhishana (who is considered as a traitor by some and worshipped as a deity by others), Ravana kidnapped Sita, thus triggering the Battle of Lanka. Although Shurpanakha receives no further mention from Valmiki, it has been suggested that she continued to live in Lanka after Vibhishana succeeded Ravana as king. She and her half-sister Kumbini are supposed to have perished at sea a few years later.

Some recipes include honey, brown sugar, eggs, or butter. Variations of the recipe include the addition of walnuts, hazelnuts, pecans or, for a dessert, rum or whisky. Raisin bread is eaten in many different forms, including being served toasted for breakfast (\\"raisin toast\\") or made into sandwiches. Some restaurants serve raisin bread with their cheeseboards.

Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press Retrieved January 2012 in Concord, Massachusetts lore, as there have been published recipes for bread with raisins since 1671. Since the 15th century, breads made with raisins were made in Europe. In Germany stollen was a Christmas bread. Kulich was an Easter bread made in Russia and panettone was made in Italy. The earliest citation for \\"raisin bread\\" in the Oxford English Dictionary is dated to an 1845 article in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. In England, raisin bread became a common element of high tea from the second half of the 19th century. In the 1920s, raisin bread was advertised as \\"The Bread Of Iron\\", due to the high iron content of the raisins. The bread became increasingly popular among English bakers in the 1960s.

It has been suggested that Garibaldi biscuits were based on a raisin bread that was eaten by the troops of Italian general Giuseppe Garibaldi. Production The United States Code of Federal Regulations specifies standards that raisin bread produced in the country must meet. This includes a requirement for the weight of the raisins to be equal to 50% of the weight of flour used. Raisin bread is one of five types of bread for which federal standards have been outlined.

Early life House was born in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest son of Ezekiel House, an architect and builder, and Susannah King. His father was an architect and builder, and at that time was assisting his brother Royal Earl House in perfecting and getting capital interest in his New Printing Telegraph. In the spring of 1846 the House family moved to Little Meadows, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, where they built a home on the side of a hill which was known as the Castle. There was a natural spring nearby, which was piped into the house to give running water, an unusual thing for those days. At that time there was no railroad to that part of the country, so in order to move their household goods from New York, they boarded a barge which was towed by steam up the Hudson River to Troy where it was taken through the lock into the Erie Canal and towed by horses to Ithaca on Lake Cayuga, New York. The last part of the trip was made by ox teams and the whole journey took over a month. In 1852 the family moved to Owego, New York where there were better educational facilities. Here they lived by the Susquehanna River. The boys James and Henry built a boat and rigged it up like the side wheelers they had seen on the Hudson River. This they used to take people up the river on excursions and also to carry produce down the river, thus earning money with which to pay their father for the material used to build the boat. Inventing years Ezekiel House left Owego in the spring of 1854 as he had taken a contract to build a county court house in the suburbs of Rockford, Illinois. Henry and his brother went to Rockford in the fall and started in business with their father. In 1857 Henry took a position with his father who was superintending the raising and reconstructing of the old city hall in Chicago. While working on a building in New York, Henry had the misfortune of having the extension muscle of his right hand severed by a chisel which dropped from a scaffold. This incapacitated his doing any carpentry work for several months. During this enforced idleness, he designed and patented an automatic gate. =Automatic buttonhole machine= When the Civil War broke out and Henry was rejected as a volunteer on account of his slightly cripped right hand, he turned his attention to making a button hole machine. He and his brother James entered into partnership with Mr. Seaman and in 1862 they perfected an automatic buttonhole sewing machine. It was then tested in a clothing shop in New York on army overcoats and capes, where its average was from 1,000 to 1,200 buttonholes per day. This caused hard feelings among the hand buttonhole workers, and one day during the noon hour they smashed the machine. However, the next morning another machine was working in its place. All together there were over one hundred thousand button holes made there. The patents were taken over by the Wheeler and Wilson Manufacturing Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut. While House was in Washington D.C. looking after the patent application, he met Abraham Lincoln, for whom he cast his first vote. In November 1862, he again returned to Little Meadows and married his cousin Mary Elizabeth House, daughter of William House, a miller. As his mother was very ill they hurried to Brooklyn where his mother died on November 28, 1862. He then took his bride to Bridgeport, Connecticut where he was engaged by Wheeler and Wilson to superintend the making of his buttonhole machine. In the Spring of 1863 his father Ezekiel House died in Brooklyn. During that year four patents were issued for the automatic buttonhole sewing machine. In 1867 House represented the company at the Paris Exposition Universelle, which opened in France in May 1867. =Another sewing machine patent= In 1864 his shop was moved from Brooklyn to Bridgeport, with his brother James joining him there. They soon perfected an attachment to be used on the family sewing machine. This system was entirely new and since the patent was issued in 1868, it has been adopted throughout the world. On February 27, 1865, Henry Alonzo House Jr. was born. Another son, William Ezekiel, was born on February 22, 1874. On November 21, 1875, a daughter, Libbie Grace, was born. =Steam horseless carriage= In the spring of 1866, Henry House, Sr. and his brother James built a steam carriage for their own amusement and recreation. It carried seven, including the driver and the fireman on the back seat. It developed 15 hp and could travel 30 mph on a good level road. It frightened so many horses and even men, so they did not use it long. =Knitting machine= House left Wheeler and Wilson in 1869 and turned his attention to developing a machine that could knit various-sized goods, both flat and tubular. At the time, there were no machines on the market doing that type of work. In 1870, the Armstrong and House Manufacturing Company was organized and a shop was built to produce the new knitting machines. Five patents were issued to House from 1869 to 1872, among them was one for a new system of knitting stockings in a continuous tube. The process would first knit the leg, then form a mitered heal, then the foot and mitered toe then a leg, and so on. The toe was then separated from the leg by drawing a thread leaving all the loops ready to close. =Other inventions= House resigned from Armstrong and House in the fall of 1872, and proceeded to invent a bundling machine for kindling wood in 1873. In 1875 his attention was called to the dressing of fur skins, such as buffalo hides. Using existing processes, it took from two to two and a half days of hard labor to bring a large hide down to a flexiable state. When House claimed that he could make a machine that could dress four hides or more a day, they were astonished, as they claimed no tool could stand up to those dry hides for even ten minutes. To meet the challenge, House developed a rotary plane with a ring knife that could be fed as it moved, with a set of small emery wheels each side of the knife so that it was sharpened on every revolution. The plane was universally hung and counterbalanced so it weighed nothing in the hand of the operator, though it was driven by power from the engine. On a wager, the first operator finished fifty hides in ten hours. =Paper dishes= In 1878, the president of the Union Paper Bag Co. of Philadelphia called on House, as he had heard that House had developed a machine that was able to make satchel-bottom paper bags. House came up with a folding attachment for their old machines, and although this was satisfactory to a degree, the machines were still old, and were not properly constructed. House then designed new machines. While working the attachment in Philadelphia, House was asked if he could help one of Union's western branches in making the paper dishes, as they had trouble in drying them. When House produced samples with a round flange, the design was accepted and he was given a contract to build a machine that would make twenty thousand paper dishes in 10 hours. Much work was required to maintain the heat at 800 to 900 degrees, which was necessary to dry a dish in two (2) seconds. Mr. House involved a system of using superheated steam which kept the dies at red heat. The press was first tested at his factory in Bridgeport before being shipped to Clinton, Iowa. =Hat manufacturing= Late in 1878, in collaboration with hatter Dwight Wheeler, House invented and patented a machine for blocking felt hats in 28 seconds. The patents were issued on February 25, 1879 and in the same year the House and Wheeler Hat Flanging Co., a joint stock company, was formed in Bridgeport. A practical machine was built and installed at the Marrinet Hat Co. at Salisbury, Connecticut. The employees, adverse to any innovations that might reduce their value to the company, went on strike. The hat flanging machine fulfilled all requirements, and after the machine had been working a few months the strikers were ready to compromise. In later years the Hatters Union voted against its use entirely. In October 1878, House suffered a severe shock from the accidental death of his younger son, William Ezekiel House, who was accidentally shot and killed by his cousin, Alfred Bishop Beers, Jr. =Fur work= In 1880, S.D. Castle and Henry House became interested in the picking of furs. Buffalo hides were getting scarce, and Castle wanted to use muskrat or beaver, but he found the pelts had to be picked of the outer long hair, a tedious job for an unskilled hand. After a few months, House had a small machine working that would pick large or small pelts without missing a hair. The machine-picked skins were shown to furriers in New York. A few days later, a Mr. Frasure of Wall Street, New York, called on House at Bridgeport, and the two reached an agreement for House to develop a machine that would pick a bull pelt six feet long and three feet wide, while being kept moist and warm. This patent, also the first of its kind, for treating pelts, was issued on October 19, 1882 just one month and five days after the application was made. Work on the large machine for the London Co. was finished in the spring of 1882. The pelts, after being moistened, went around on a drum which was kept warm with the circulation of hot water. Frasure was more than satisfied and was anxious to ship it to London, England. as soon as possible. Passage for House was booked on the S.S. Adriatic of the White Star Line for the middle of June. Several weeks of delays after his arrival, the demonstration was performed in secret one Saturday afternoon. In three hours, more work was accomplished than one skilled workman could do in two days. The London Co. bought all the patents pertaining to fur picking and treating of pelts. Everything was boxed and shipped to London in 30 days. Ironically, these machines were never unpacked, leaving the entire control of the fur picking trade with the English market. =Paper boxes= In 1883, House organized the Compressed Paper Box Co. and proceeded to make seamless paper boxes. He invented a new form of box termed \\"a round square\\", particularly adapted for holding cartrages, as the corners were compressed in, not out, giving extra strength. The machines built to make the boxes were semi-automatic. At this time his son Henry (Harry) Alzonzo House, Jr. joined him in his experimental work. =Metal polishing= The Deoxidized Metal Co. of Bridgeport in 1885 secured a contract for the bronze balusters required for the Treasury building in Washington, D.C. These balusters were an elaborate design incorporating leaves, beads and moulding, all intended to have a bright finish, which required a great deal of hand work. Deoxidized could make, but not burnish, the balusters and sought to subcontract this work, but no one took them up on their offer. At that time there was no machinery for polishing metals, the usual procedure was to immerse in acid, and hand work was too costly. The contract from Washington definitely stated that acid was not to be used. The president of Deoxidized contacted House, \\"the man who had done so many queer things\\" to see if he could devise a way to perform the polishing. House submitted samples which were sent to Washington and accepted. He used a small cabinet, twice the length of the baluster, in which the baluster was slipped on a shaft and fine, high-velocity sand was shot at the baluster, thus polishing all surfaces, both concave and convex. =Telegraphs and telephones= In 1885, Henry House Sr. became stockholder in the Postal Telegraph Co. of Binghamton, New York and was made superintendent of their experimental department. During his research, House came across a patent () taken out by his uncle, Royal E. House, in 1866 for a device called the Electric Phonetic Telegraph which for transmitted messages by sound, signals and letters. This invention embodied the fundamental principle of the electric telephone. Its construction was that of a triple-sized modern telephone. The hollow ear piece was made in such a form to focus the sound waves direct to the operator's ear. A thin metal diaphragm was secured to the opposite end, a pair of magnets with a pivoted armature was secured to the frame of the armature, and connected with the diaphragm by means of a strut, thus keeping the armature from contracting poles of the magnets, which were energized by a battery current. When the current was closed, the armature held the diaphragm in magnetic suspension. The slightest change in the current manifested upon the diaphragm and upon all those on the same line. It was decided best to move everything in connection with developing and manufacturing this project to House's shop in Bridgeport, . also taking Royal House (who was then over 70 years old) and his wife with them. In due time the instruments were perfected, adjusted to all conditions and ready to manufacture, but some misunderstandings with the directors and stock holders of the company in Binghamton resulted in a lawsuit, which stagnated in the court process until the patents expired. In 1886‚Äì87 when the Royal E. House Telegraph was produced with the printing telegraph, the Morse Telegraph tried to enjoin them from infringing the Morse patents. Morse claimed the sole right of transmitting intelligence by electricity (which utilized the Morse code). The courts decided the House Company did not infringe the Morse patent in the slightest degree, as the messages using the House system were all printed on a slip of paper, while the Morse signals were embossed and in code (dots and dashes) which afterwards were translated into words. As soon as Henry House procured a copy of the phonetic telegraph patent, he saw it contained all the elements and requirements of the speaking telephone, and he proceeded to make a set of instruments, which he patented on Dec 14, 1896, as the Electric Phonetic Telegraph Sender. This patent shows the exact combination and principle of the original Royal E. House patents of May 12, 1866, years before the Bell patents were issued. Henry House's invention consisted of the use of direct current, whereas the Bell Company at that time was using alternating current House demonstrated to his attorneys that he employed a different current from the Bell system and also explained that the Bell patent was on a discovery, and not an instrument. About this time the Royal E. House Company and the Morse Company merged and formed the Great Western Company. In the meantime Henry House invented and produced the first liquid door check. This was a basic patent taken out by House and his son, H.A. House Jr. in 1887. The devices were later manufactured by the Pittsburg Co. under a license. In 1888, Mr. House entered the wood-bundling business using the machines he had patented in 1873. =The flying machine= Following a disastrous fire in March 1889, which partly destroyed his factory, Henry House Sr. accepted a position with Hiram Maxim in England to construct a 300 horsepower flying machine at Bexley, Kent. In November, his son Henry House Jr. joined him to assist in this work. During this time, many patents were issued to House Sr. and assigned to the Maxim Syndicate. P.T. Barnum, a friend of House took his famous circus to England in 1889 and called on the Maxim Syndicate, expressing interest in investing in the flying machine project, but Maxim objected. After several tests of the Maxim flying machine, the project was abandoned. =Boats= In the spring of 1891, House left the Maxim Syndicate and started a factory, at Teddington on the River Thames, to build fast motor launches using kerosene oil as fuel. During the trials of the first launch, the Doil, its speed caused a wake to wash up on banks of the river. For this Henry House was summoned to appear in court and fined 10 pounds and costs. One of the witnesses for the Crown swore the craft was going 26 knots an hour, testimony which proved to be a good advertisement. After the court trial in 1893, it was decided to move the works to East Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, where they formed the Liquid Fuel Engineering Co. (LIFU) trademark. This company built high-speed launches for the Duke of St. Albans, Prince of Wales, the German Emperor, King of Belgium, Sir Thomas Lipton, and many other notables. This system used high pressure copper tubular boilers, burning kerosene oil, compound steam engines and specially designed propellers. In 1894, Henry House left his son in charge and returned to America and at Bridgeport, perfected the larger sizes of his kerosene burners. Ten sizes were developed, ranging from 1/2 HP to 100 HP. House returned to the Isle of Wight in the spring of 1896 with new patents for the burners, which were assigned to LIFU Co. The company built for House Sr. a high speed, 40 foot, 35 HP launch which he brought to America in August 1896. He expected to use this launch for demonstrating his system in forming Liquid Fuel Engineering Company in America, but on account of the death of his English associate, Sir Robert Simons, he gave up the launch business. =Miscellaneous inventions= From 1898 to 1904, House worked on horseless vehicles and patented many devices used on the early motor cars. In 1904, he went to Worcester, Massachusetts to develop a chain for the Baldwin Chain Company, and while there he also patented a Liquid Indicator and Air Pressure and vacuity indicator. In Bridgeport (1906‚Äì07), he developed and patented an all-steel barrel and keg. In 1908, he was again associated with his son Harry House Jr., who had returned from England, in developing a metal belt. In 1909, through George Mortson of Hartford, with whom had been associated on the Maxim Flying Machine, House became interested developing a paraffinized drinking cup. This led the two men to form the U.S. Paper Bottle Co. =Shredded wheat= In 1915 Mr. Herny House became associated with the Shredded Wheat Company at Niagara Falls, New York. He constructed an entirely new system for baking, handling and packing shredded wheat biscuits. The first machine was built in his shop in Bridgeport and was accepted by the Shredded Wheat Co. and shipped to Niagara Falls. The further development of the system was turned over to Earl Webster, who had been associated with House from the beginning of the project. It was at this time, while travelling to Niagara Falls and Rochester, that Mary House became seriously ill and died at the home of their niece, at Forest Lawn, near Rochester. Several years later, the Shredded Wheat Co. erected a new factory at Niagara Falls, Canada, to house the new automatic oven which was a part of the House system. This oven could produce 456,000 biscuits every 24 hours. From 1929 House, who was then 89 year sold, spent his declining years perfecting his metal barrel and flexible stick metal belt. In all, House estimated that he had obtained over 300 patents, including those taken out in foreign countries, and although he developed thirteen basic patents, he felt that the baking process for shredded wheat biscuits to be his greatest achievement. Henry A. House died, aged 90, on December 18, 1930, being survived by his son Henry A. House, Jr., and two daughters, Mrs. John Binkley and Mrs. George Mortson.

The Old Covenant () was the name of the agreement which effected the union of Iceland and Norway. It is also known as Gissurars√°ttm√°li, named after Gissur √ûorvaldsson, the Icelandic chieftain who worked to promote it. The name \\"Old Covenant\\", however, is probably due to historical confusion. Gamli s√°ttm√°li is properly the treaty of 1302 mentioned below and the treaty of 1262 is the actual Gissurars√°ttm√°li. The agreement also led to a shift in Iceland's political ideology towards the model of monarchy since it diminished the role of its chieftains (go√∞i) as models of political rule. Prior to the agreement, the chieftains' power, which developed into a Commonwealth, was idealized particularly during the 12th and 13th centuries.  Covenant  The agreement was made in 1262‚Äì1264 between the major chieftains of Iceland and Haakon IV of Norway, and his son and successor, Magnus the Lawgiver. The signing brought about the union of Iceland with Norway, which subsequently led to Iceland's union with Denmark in 1380, by way of the Kalmar Union. The years preceding the signing of the accord were marked by civil strife in Iceland (the so-called Age of the Sturlungs), as the Norwegian king tried to exert his influence through the Icelandic family clans, most notably the Sturlungs. Gissur √ûorvaldsson, a vassal of the king, worked as his agent in the matter. According to the provisions in the agreement, the Icelanders were to bear taxation from the Norwegian king, but in exchange they were to receive a code of laws, guaranteed peace and reliable transportation and shipping between Norway and Iceland. Norwegians and Icelanders received equal rights in each other's countries. The laws of the Icelandic Commonwealth were updated and a book of laws named J√≥nsb√≥k was issued in 1281. Under the Norwegian rule, trade links between the two countries increased and Iceland's settlement expanded. The agreement was renewed in 1302 at the behest of Haakon V of Norway. Iceland's union with Norway (and, after the Treaty of Kiel, with Denmark) lasted until 1944, during World War II, when the Republic of Iceland was founded. Several possible explanations have been offered for the succumbing of Icelandic chieftains to the Norwegian Crown: * They were tired of war and believed that a covenant with the King would lead to lasting peace. * A fear that the King would embargo Iceland unless they swore allegiance to him. * The support of the Church for the King's cause to annex Iceland. * Icelandic chieftains making deals with the King to annex Iceland in exchange for serving as his courtiers. * Icelandic chieftains surrendering their chieftaincies in the hopes that they would soon rule them as fiefs. * The Icelanders were not aware of ideas of sovereignty and did not adhere to modern types of nationalism. * Royal power was a much stronger political force than the Icelandic Commonwealth. The use of the sagas as accurate historical sources has been questioned by historian Patricia Pires Boulhosa who claims Gamli s√°ttm√°li is a much younger document and was used to negotiate with the Norwegian king for the benefit of Icelanders. Some historians, therefore, questioned the authenticity of the Old Covenant itself, citing that it could be an imaginative reconstruction. The earliest copies of the Old Covenant are from the 15th century.

He was the first Missionary Bishop, and the first African-American Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church (elected in 1858). Birth, enslavement and early education Burns was born 5 December 1809 in Albany, New York. He was said to be \\"thoroughly African in his complexion.\\" New York was still a slave state at this time. His parents were so poor, such that at the age of four they placed their son in service with a farmer in Greene County, New York. At the age of eight, he was indentured to a Mr. Atwood (a farmer) to learn the farming business. He was permitted to attend school with the other children of the neighborhood, during the winter season (which is when most early schools were open, the farm chores being fewer during the winter). Two years later, however, his health becoming poor, he was sent to the district school during the entire summer. Early religious life and ministry The Atwood family was respectable and eminently pious, living in Ashland, New York, in a house now owned by Samuel Creech. Burns attended the North Settlement Methodist Church, County Route 10 Ashland. Mrs. Atwood was a Methodist class-leader. One who knew her said she was \\"a holy and zealous woman.\\" At fifteen years of age Francis was converted to the Christian faith under the influence of Miss Stewart, a white teacher, the daughter of a Baptist preacher. At seventeen Francis felt that God required him to preach. Yet he refrained from doing so because he was bound to his master until the age of twenty-one. His education was insufficient from Burns's own perspective, and there appeared no field in which he might labor to answer his calling. When the way finally opened, he felt unwilling to enter it. But possessing an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, he employed all his efforts to obtain it. While attending a high school he began to hold religious meetings, and to exhort. He also began to teach school. Indeed, he is said to have been \\"the first colored student in a white school,\\" the Academy at Lexington Heights, New York. He is also said to have been \\"the first colored teacher in a white school,\\" in his own community, where he received marked respect. He was subsequently licensed as a local preacher on the Windham circuit. Bishop Matthew Simpson said of Francis Burns, in reflection: > By his intelligence, his consistent piety, and by the force of his > character, he rose above the disabilities of his color, and commanded the > respect of all that knew him. Missionary service The Rev. Francis Burns became noticed as a pastor and a preacher. A Dr. Terry of the Mission Rooms was chiefly instrumental in leading him into missionary work. He encouraged Francis to enter upon a course of study, that he might be ready to go to Liberia or elsewhere, should the door open. In 1833 Dr. Terry secured for Francis an interview with Bishop Hedding. In 1834, when the Rev. John Seys was about to sail for Liberia, it was arranged that the Rev. Burns should accompany him as a Missionary Teacher. Sailing in September of that year, they arrived in Monrovia 18 October. The Rev. Burns' first appointment in Liberia was as at Cape Palmas. For two years he suffered from the dreaded fever. He joined the Liberia Annual Conference in 1838, and in 1840-42 was an assistant Preacher on the Bassa Circuit. During 1843 and the early part of 1844 he was appointed to Monrovia. In due course he was elected to orders. Then ten years after arriving in Liberia, returning to New York, Francis Burns was ordained by Bishop Janes. The Rev. Burns performed hard and difficult work in the missionary field. He also occasionally occupied the post of teacher in the Monrovia Seminary. He served as Editor of the Africa's Luminary, doing so with marked ability. Ordained ministry The Rev. Francis Burns returned to the U.S. in 1844. He was ordained Deacon 16 June 1844 in Brooklyn, N.Y.. He was ordained Elder in the Mulberry Street Church in New York City the same day, with Bishop Janes officiating at both services. The Rev. Burns returned to Liberia later that year. When, at the 1849 session of the Mission Conference, the work in Liberia was divided into districts, the Rev. Burns was appointed Presiding Elder of the Cape Palmas District. For six years of the ten that he was Presiding Elder, he also served as President of the Conference, reporting clearly and comprehensively the business of the mission to the Missionary Board in New York. In 1851, Burns also was sent to open an academy in Monrovia and to superintend the Mission there. Episcopal ministry The 1856 General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church made provision for the first time for the election and consecration of a Missionary Bishop (for the African work). Accordingly, in January 1858 the Liberia Annual Conference elected the Rev. Francis Burns as their first Bishop. He returned to the US for consecration. This took place 14 October 1858 at the session of the Genesee Annual Conference, meeting in Perry, Wyoming County, New York. Bishops Janes and Baker presided at the consecration. Bishop Simpson, quoting Dr. John Robie (who was present at the Conference), described the proceedings: > Though of ebony complexion, he had gained wonderfully on the affection and > respect of all who had made his acquaintance, and especially of those > privileged to an intimate association with him. His manner is exceedingly > pleasant, and his spirit is as kind, sweet, and good as ever beamed from > human heart or disposition. He seems to be lacking in none of the > qualifications of the gentleman and Christian minister. He possesses also an > intelligent and cultivated mind, speaks readily and fluently, and even > eloquently, and is in all respects a model African. Such is the man whom the > Liberian Conference has selected for a bishop, and such the one the highest > authorities of one American church have set apart for the sacred and > responsible position. Bishop Burns returned to Africa almost immediately following his consecration, where he devoted himself to the work which devolved upon him for the next nearly five years. Failing health and death Bishop Burns' health began to fail. He was therefore directed to take a sea voyage. On the advice of his physician, Bishop Burns then returned to the U.S.A. He died 18 April 1863 within three days of his arrival in Baltimore, Maryland, a mere three months after Emancipation in the United States. Bishop Burns was buried in Palm Grove Cemetery in Monrovia, Liberia. See also *List of Bishops of the United Methodist Church References *Thomas, James S.

The grand magistry of the order is disputed among claimants to the headship of the formerly reigning House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.

He was the subject of the documentary Unbroken Will. Before his death Engleitner was the world's oldest known male concentration camp survivor (held in Buchenwald, Niederhagen and Ravensbr√ºck), and the oldest male Austrian. Imprisonment Born in Aigen-Voglhub, Austria, Engleiter grew up in the imperial city of Bad Ischl. He studied the Bible intensively in the 1930s and was baptised as a Jehovah's Witness in 1932. In the period up to World War II he faced religious intolerance, even persecution, from his immediate neighbourhood and the Austrian authorities, first by the fascist regime of Dollfuss and then under Nazi Germany. *Spring 1934: 48 hours in Bad Ischl prison *Winter 1934/35: 48 hours in Bad Ischl prison *5 January 1936 - 30 March 1936: imprisonment in St. Gilgen and Salzburg *19 September 1937 - 14 October 1937: detained in Bad Aussee prison When Adolf Hitler occupied Austria in 1938, Leopold Engleitner's religion, ideologies and conscientious objection to serving in the Army brought him into conflict with the Nazis. On 4 April 1939 he was arrested in Bad Ischl by the Gestapo and detained in Linz and Wels. From 9 October 1939 to 15 July 1943 he was held in the concentration camps Buchenwald, Niederhagen and Ravensbrueck. In Niederhagen he rejected a proposal to renounce his beliefs in return for his release. Despite brutal and inhumane treatment, his will ‚Äì to stand for fair principles and to refuse military service ‚Äì was unbroken. In July 1943 - weighing only - he was released on condition of his acceptance of lifelong slave labour on a farm. After returning home he worked on a farm in St. Wolfgang. On 17 April 1945, three weeks before the war ended, he received notice to enlist in the German army. He fled to the mountains of Salzkammergut, and hid in an alpine cabin and a cave, hunted by the Nazis but never found. On 5 May 1945 Engleitner was able to return home and resume work on the farm as a slave labourer. When in 1946 he tried to leave the farm, his request was rejected by the labour bureau of Bad Ischl, on the argument that the slave labour duty imposed by the Nazi occupation was still valid. Only after intervention of the US occupying power was he released from the duty in April 1946. *4 April 1939 - 5 October 1939: prisons in Bad Ischl, Linz and Wels *5 October 1939 - 9 October 1939: deportation to concentration camp (prisons in Salzburg and Munich) *9 October 1939 - 7 March 1941: Buchenwald concentration camp *7 March 1941 - April 1943: Niederhagen concentration camp in Wewelsburg *April 1943 - 15 July 1943: Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp *22 July 1943 - 10 April 1945: forced labour on a farm *17 April 1945 - 5 May 1945: call-up to the German army; flight to the mountains Rehabilitation and recognition In the years after the war Engleitner continued facing isolation and intolerance, and only after the author and film producer Bernhard Rammerstorfer documented his life in 1999 in the book and documentary film Nein statt Ja und Amen, did the larger public become aware of him. Engleitner and Rammerstorfer held lectures at universities, schools and memorials in Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and the United States. Though already far advanced in years, between 1999 and 2012 Engleitner travelled with his biographer and friend Bernhard Rammerstorfer more than 95,000 miles across Europe and the USA, to schools, memorial sites, and universities, as a witness of history to ensure the past was not forgotten, and he became a model of tolerance and peace. Once a persecuted concentration camp labourer and outlawed conscientious objector, he was honoured in May 2007 by the Republic of Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany for his courageous stand during the Nazi regime and for his tremendous awareness-raising activities with: *The Golden Order of Merit of the Republic of Austria from Austrian President Dr. Heinz Fischer *The Cross of Merit on ribbon of the Federal Republic of Germany (Knight's Cross) from German President Dr. Horst K√∂hler In 2003 he was awarded the \\"Silver Order of Merit of the Province of Upper Austria\\" by the Upper Austrian governor, Josef P√ºhringer. In 2006 he was awarded the Elfriede Gr√ºnberg Prize by Antifa, an anti-Fascist initiative in Austria. In 2008 Engleitner was presented with the \\"Ring of Honour of the Town of Bad Ischl\\" by the municipal authorities in Bad Ischl, the town where he grew up. In 2009 he received the \\"Badge of Honour of the Town of St. Wolfgang\\" from his home municipality, St. Wolfgang. Books, films and documentaries In 2004 the book and the film Nein statt Ja und Amen were translated into an English version called Unbroken Will, and were presented in the USA by a tour including the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, Columbia University in New York and the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. In 2006 Engleitner and Rammerstorfer made a second tour through the United States. They gave lectures in Washington, DC, (at Georgetown University and Library of Congress), New York (at Columbia University), Chicago (at Harold Washington College), Skokie (for the Holocaust Memorial Foundation of Illinois), Palo Alto, in the San Francisco Bay area (Stanford University) and Los Angeles (at the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust).

In 2005 Rammerstorfer released a new German biography and DVD Nein statt Ja und Amen ‚Äì 100 Jahre ungebrochener Wille. The book also contains a short biography of the German conscientious objector Joachim Escher: Escher was detained between 1937 and 1945 in several prisons and the concentration camps Sachsenhausen, Niederhagen and Buchenwald; in Buchenwald he was servant to the former French government members Georges Mandel and L√©on Blum, whom the Germans kept as hostages. The French version of the book entitled Une volont√© de fer was released in 2007. In 2008 Rammerstorfer released a new version of the German book, entitled \\"Ungebrochener Wille\\", which Engleitner and Rammerstorfer presented at the Frankfurt Book Fair during 2008, 2009 and 2011. In 2009 the new English book Unbroken Will: The Extraordinary Courage of an Ordinary Man-The Story of Nazi Concentration Camp Survivor Leopold Engleitner, born 1905 based on the latest German version was released at Harvard University. The Austrian president, Heinz Fischer, described in his foreword to the book that it is \\"a milestone in correspondence about the horror of Nazism.\\" Brewster Chamberlin, director of archives at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC from 1986 to 1997, wrote a preface.

They interpret new music, specialising in a post-minimal and \\"totalist\\" repertoire. Icebreaker always play amplified and have a reputation for playing, by classical standards, \\"seriously loud\\". They have expanded their repertoire to include non-classical material, particularly in their version of the Brian Eno album Apollo, a project based on the music of Kraftwerk, and music by Scott Walker. Biography =Founding and musical identity= Icebreaker was formed in 1989 to play at the new Dutch music festival in York. The group consists of 12 musicians, with an instrumentation that includes panpipes, saxophones, electric violin and cello, guitars, percussion, drums, accordion and keyboards as well as a sound engineer and production manager. Richard Witts who is consultant to the ensemble. Their repertoire encompasses music by a variety of well-known composers, including Louis Andriessen, Julia Wolfe, Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Michael Gordon, Yannis Kyriakides, David Lang, Steve Martland, Michael Nyman, Steve Reich, Donnacha Dennehy, and Diderik Wagenaar. Icebreaker's unusual instrumentation gives the band's music a distinctive sound and allows the blending of contemporary classical, rock and alternative music. The instrumentation evolved from the line up of the Dutch group Hoketus, who had operated between 1977 and 1987, and served as an inspiration and model for the formation of the group. The presence of pairs of panpipes and saxophones derives from Icebreaker's performances of several works from the by now defunct Hoketus's repertoire, including the eponymous work by Louis Andriessen. =Performances= Icebreaker have made concert appearances in the UK, US and Europe, including the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, the Warsaw, Aarhus, Ghent, Grenoble and Budapest festivals, Sonorities in Belfast, the Baltic Gaida Festival and the NYYD Festival in Estonia, as well as a dedicated Icebreaker festival with the Wiener Musik Galerie in Vienna. In London they have appeared at Meltdown, the ICA, the Place Theatre, the South Bank, the Barbican, the Warehouse, Ocean and the Almeida, among other venues. They have appeared on two Arts Council Contemporary Music Network tours of England. United States appearances include New York City's Bang on a Can Festival, the Lincoln Center Festival, and a performance at Carnegie Hall with the American Composers' Orchestra in Stewart Wallace's The Book of Five. =Recordings= Since 2005 most of Icebreaker's albums have been released on the New York-based label Cantaloupe Music. 2005 saw the release of Cranial Pavement, including music by John Godfrey, Richard Craig, Yannis Kyriakides and Conlon Nancarrow, as well as the worldwide release of the new version of Michael Gordon's Trance. This 52-minute work was originally released on Argo in 1996 and has been completely re-worked and re-mixed for the Cantaloupe version. Icebreaker's first album Terminal Velocity (music by Andriessen, Gordon, Lang, Gavin Bryars and Damian LeGassick), also originally on Argo, has also been produced in a remastered version for Cantaloupe. In 2007 Icebreaker's version of Philip Glass's Music with Changing Parts was released on Glass's own label Orange Mountain Music. Other albums include Rogue's Gallery (NewTone), with works by Andriessen, Lang, Godfrey, Michael Torke and Steve Martland; a portrait of Diderik Wagenaar (Composers' Voice) and Extraction (between the lines), containing music by LeGassick and Gordon McPherson plus a remix by Mel.

In July 2009 Icebreaker, with guest B. J. Cole on pedal steel guitar, premiered a new arrangement (by Woojun Lee) of Brian Eno's Apollo album, consisting of music by Brian Eno, Roger Eno and Daniel Lanois, at the IMAX cinema at London's Science Museum, alongside Al Reinert's film For All Mankind, for which the music was originally written. An expanded version of the arrangement received further performances at the Brighton Festival in May 2010, before touring later in the year. The album of the music was released in June 2012. 2014 saw the launch of the band's Kraftwerk Uncovered project. Going under the full title Kraftwerk Uncovered: A Future Past, the live show consists of reworkings and re-imaginings of Kraftwerk's music by German electronic artist J.

Critical appraisal =Early critical response= Critical response to Icebreaker has generally been positive. Their London debut in 1989 was greeted by The Guardian and The Independent in enthusiastic terms: Robert Maycock in The Independent felt that \\"there is plenty of material here for British audiences to catch up with and Icebreaker have what it takes to deliver it,\\"Robert Maycock, The Independent, London, September 1989 whilst Meirion Bowen wrote in The Guardian that \\"Icebreaker deserve an enthusiastic following.\\"Meirion Bowen, The Guardian, September 1989 Some more conservative critics have had more problems with the group and its musical direction: Nicholas Kenyon, then a music critic at The Observer, subsequently director of London's Proms, described Icebreaker's music as \\"unbelievably banal\\" and Michael Dervan, writing in The Irish Times, described it as \\"music for the aurally challenged ... or the braindead\\"Michael Dervan, The Irish Times, 10 May 1995 and \\"ideal for the deaf and stoned\\".Michael Dervan, The Irish Times, February 2004 =Volume= A number of critics have had difficulty with the very loud volumes of Icebreaker's concerts, which, whilst not excessively loud by rock standards, have challenged the ears of more classical critics. Keith Potter, a critic who has often praised Icebreaker's work (\\"Icebreaker's performers ... play with a passionate commitment as well as the requisite and highly demanding rhythmic precision\\",Keith Potter, The Independent, 14 November 2001) nevertheless complained of the high volume of Icebreaker's 1996 concert at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall: \\"This concert ... was loud. Seriously loud. It was also designed ... to 'ramp up the audience's visual input to an equal energy level' to that of the sound. ... I found all this rather too much to take.\\"Keith Potter, The Independent, 4 December 1996 For Brian Hunt, writing in The Daily Telegraph, an April 1995 Icebreaker concert was \\"too loud and not short enough.\\"Brian Hunt, The Daily Telegraph, April 1994 Others have been more enthusiastic: for Christopher Lambton, in The Guardian, a 2003 concert was \\"loud and all-enveloping, offering an experience closer to a rock concert: Icebreaker... creates the blueprint for live contemporary music.\\"Christopher Lambton, The Guardian, 15 November 2003 =Releases= Icebreaker's albums have met with a very positive response. Terminal Velocity was described by Joshua Kosman in the San Francisco Chronicle as an \\"electrifying new disc ... superb\\"Joshua Kosman, San Francisco Chronicle, 12 June 1994 and it was described by the American Record Guide as \\"a stimulating, well-filled disc\\".De Jong, American Record Guide, 1995 Trance was also well-received, particularly in its remastered version: the BBC Music Magazine referred to its \\"furious precision\\",Roger Thomas, BBC Music Magazine, February 2004 whilst Gramophone described parts of it as \\"genuinely mesmeric\\".Barry Witherden, Gramophone, March 2004 Responses to Music with Changing Parts included a 4-star review in The Times,Geoff Brown, The Times, 27 April 2007 and an appreciative review in The Wire (\\"appealing ... warmth ... vividness\\"),Andy Hamilton, The Wire, August 2007 although Andrew Clements was less enthusiastic in The Guardian, awarding it two stars.Andrew Clements, The Guardian, 2007 T J Medrek, in the Boston Herald, wrote about Cranial Pavement and the re-released Terminal Velocity that \\"Icebreaker's music is not only marvelous ear candy but also work of real structure and substance, as demonstrated in two superb new discs\\".T J Medrek, Boston Herald, 18 March 2005 Jim Farber in the New York Daily News described Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks as \\"sumptuous\\".,New York Daily News, 10 June 2012 whilst the New York Music Daily called it \\"mesmerizing ... brilliant\\", writing that Icebreaker's version \\"enhances the hypnotic, enveloping, raptly warm ambience of the original, giving it a more organic feel\\". =Further international response= Icebreaker have garnered further plaudits in the United States and Europe. For Allan Kozinn in The New York Times, the group was \\"unabashedly virtuosic\\"; Kyle Gann in The Village Voice described them as \\"rhythmically engrossing\\";Kyle Gann, The Village Voice, May 1991 Alan Rich in Los Angeles Weekly as \\"amazing ... high-powered\\";Alan Rich, Los Angeles Weekly, May 1994 and Tristram Lozaw in the Boston Herald as \\"a harmolodic carnival of battling textures, symphonic discombobulations, and noisy innovations, all delivered with the visceral force of the best rock'n'roll\\".Tristram Lozaw, Boston Herald, May 1997 In Europe Icebreaker have been described as \\"mercilessly exact\\" (Der Standard, Vienna);Der Standard, September 1999 \\"impressive ... fascinating ... almost ecstatic\\" (NRC Handelsblad, Amsterdam);Isabella Lanz, NRC Handelsblad, April 2005 and \\"commanding ... impressive\\" (Nieders√§chsische Allgemeine).Georg Pepl, Nieders√§chsische Allgemeine, 8 October 2007 David Bowie cited Icebreaker in an interview for the magazine Q in November 2006, stating that he \\"would drive a mile\\" to see Icebreaker play live, describing music from Cranial Pavement as phenomenal.Q, November 2006, p. 86 Members *James Poke (artistic director, flutes, panpipes, wind-synthesiser, keyboard programming) *Rowland Sutherland (flutes, panpipes, voice) *Bradley Grant (saxophones, clarinets) *Dominic Saunders (keyboards) *Andrew Zolinsky (keyboards) *Walter Fabeck (keyboards) *Emma Welton (electric violin) *Audrey Riley (electric cello, keyboards) *Dan Gresson (percussion, drums) *James Woodrow (guitar, bass guitar) *Pete Wilson (bass guitar) *Ian Mellish (production assistant) *Martyn Hall (sound engineer) Discography =Albums= *Official Bootleg (ICC, 1991, live album, cassette only) *Terminal Velocity (Argo, 1994) *Trance (Argo, 1996) *Rogue's Gallery (New Tone, 1997) *Diderik Wagenaar (Composers' Voice / Donemus, 2001) *Extraction (between the lines, 2001) *Trance (Cantaloupe Music, 2004) (Remix and re- master of Argo album) *Cranial Pavement (Cantaloupe Music, 2005) *Terminal Velocity (Cantaloupe Music, 2005) (Re-master of Argo album) *Music with Changing Parts (Orange Mountain Music, 2007) *Apollo (Cantaloupe Music, 2012) =Appearances on other albums= *Hook, Mesh, Stub, Cud (Argo, 1993) *Short Cuts ‚Äì Breaking the sound Barrier ‚Äì An Argo Sampler (Argo, 1994) *Century XXI UK A‚ÄìM (New Tone, 1996) *Bang on a Can plays Louis Andriessen (Cantaloupe Records) References External links * British experimental musical groups Contemporary classical music ensembles Musical groups established in 1989 21st-century classical music British electronic music groups ","title":"Icebreaker (band)"},{"id":"4002955","text":"Cerf may refer to: * CERF (Central Emergency Response Fund), a United Nations fund created to aid regions threatened by disaster * Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) * Les √âditions du Cerf, a French publisher  Places  * Corbeil-Cerf * √éle aux Cerfs * Parc-aux-Cerfs, the name given to the clearings that provided hunting fields for the French aristocracy prior to the Revolution * Trou aux Cerfs * Villeneuve-les-Cerfs, France * Cerf Island, an island in the Seychelles * Lac-du-Cerf, Quebec, a municipality in Canada People * Cerf (surname) ","title":"Cerf"},{"id":"4002979","text":"Buster Brown was an early 20th-century U.S. comic strip character.

It gets its name from the traditional way of producing it: forming it with one's own hands.Food Dictionary: handk√§se cheese It is a small, translucent, yellow cheese with a pungent aroma that some people may find unpleasant. It is sometimes square, but more often round in shape. Often served as an appetizer or as a snack with Apfelwein (Ebbelwoi or cider), it is traditionally topped with chopped onions,germanfoodguide locally known as \\"Handk√§se mit Musik\\" (literally: hand cheese with music). It is usually eaten with caraway on it, but since many people in Germany do not like this spice, in many areas it is served on the side. Some Hessians say that it is a sign of the quality of the establishment when caraway is in a separate dispenser. As a sign of this, many restaurants have, in addition to the salt and pepper, a little pot for caraway seeds. Strangers to this custom probably ask where the Musik is. They most likely are told, Die Musik kommt sp√§ter, i.e. the music \\"comes later\\". This is a euphemism for the flatulence that the raw onions usually provide. A more polite, but less likely explanation for the Musik is that the flasks of vinegar and oil customarily provided with the cheese would strike a musical note when they hit each other. Handk√§se is popular among dieters and some health food devotees. It is also popular among bodybuilders, runners, and weightlifters for its high content of protein while being relatively low in fat. Serving While Apfelwein is traditionally served with Handk√§se, white wine is also preferred in some areas, such as Rheinhessen.

Early life and career Brightman was born in Sandridge, Hertfordshire, the son of William Henry Brightman, a solicitor, and of Minnie Boston Brightman, n√©e Way. He was educated at Doon House School in Kent, Marlborough College, and St John's College, Cambridge, where he read Law. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1932. He then joined the chambers of Fergus Morton, later a law lord, and practised at the Chancery bar. During World War II, he volunteered as an able seaman in the Merchant Navy from 1939 to 1940, then was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, serving on convoy in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. In 1944, he attended the Royal Naval staff course at Greenwich, and was promoted to lieutenant commander to become assistant naval attach√© in Ankara. He returned to the bar in 1946, mainly practising trusts and taxation law, and took silk in 1961. He was appointed Attorney General of the Duchy of Lancaster, but relinquished the post on his appointment to the bench in 1970. While at the bar, Brightman was pupil master to Margaret Thatcher, who was his first female pupil. Judicial career Brightman was appointed a High Court judge in 1970 and assigned to the Chancery Division, receiving the customary knighthood. In 1971, he joined John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson and Lord Thomson as the three judges of the National Industrial Relations Court (NIRC), set up by the government of Edward Heath to reign in the power of the trades unions. In 1972, he decided that Bobby Moore and Geoff Hurst need not pay income tax on bonuses and cash gifts received following the victory of the England football team in the 1966 World Cup. In 1974, while still a High Court judge, he refused Anton Piller KG the court order that it requested to search the premises of a defendant to prevent the defendant from destroying potential evidence. He was overruled by Lord Denning's Court of Appeal, giving rise to the Anton Piller order that remains in use today. Like his colleague on the NIRC, John Donaldson, Brightman had to wait until shortly after Thatcher won the 1979 general election in 1979 to be appointed as Lord Justice of Appeal. Brightman became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and life peer, sitting in the House of Lords as Baron Brightman, of Ibthorpe in the County of Hampshire, from 12 March 1982, the same year that Donaldson was promoted to become Master of the Rolls. One of Brightman's first judgments, in 1983, was to decide that Ann Mallalieu (later Baroness Mallalieu) was not entitled to a tax deduction for the cost of her court dress. He also ruled against the taxpayer in the case of Furniss v. Dawson; upheld the manslaughter verdict in R v Hancock and Shankland, the case of a taxi driver killed during the 1984 miners' strike, modifying the test of intent required for a conviction of murder; and joined the judgment that refused to grant the government an order banning on newspaper articles about Spycatcher. on 11 March 19 Personal life He married Roxane Ambatielo in 1945 and had one son.

Flores was killed in a plane crash the previous year. The will of Adela's late wealthy husband Alfred says Adela should support his impecunious brother Smedley, though she merely lets him live in her house. Smedley dislikes living with Adela, who makes him drink yoghurt instead of cocktails. Adela's sister Bill, a former scriptwriter, is ghostwriting Adela's memoirs. Adela's impeccable butler Phipps is nervous that Bill, who was part of the jury that sentenced him to prison for safecracking a few years ago, will tell Adela about his past which he has kept secret, but she promises not to tell. Smedley hopes to find the late Carmen Flores's diary. He believes she wrote about her affairs with men who would pay to have it suppressed. Bill thinks Smedley needs looking after and wants to marry him, but Smedley has doubts about marriage. In New York, Joe Davenport, Bill's former co-worker, asks Bill's niece Kay Shannon in a joking way if she will marry him. Kay likes him but turns him down because she thinks he is not serious. They both separately go to California. Bill suggests to Joe that they buy her literary agent's business for twenty thousand dollars. Bill wants Joe to fund the purchase, since he won a radio jackpot, but he explains that he has nearly spent all his winnings. Joe later meets Smedley, who looks rich, and gives him a car ride hoping for money. Adela has invited Kay and the rich Lord Topham to her house, hoping they will marry. Adela gives Phipps notice for looking around in her bedroom against her orders. He tells Bill that he was looking for the valuable diary of the late Carmen Flores, and has not found it. Joe comes to the house, having been invited by Smedley while they were out drinking. Smedley was celebrating because he found the diary, which is written in Spanish, on top of Adela's wardrobe. He has been offered fifty thousand dollars for it. By pretending to help translate it, Adela tricks Smedley into giving her the diary. Bill reveals to Smedley, Kay, and Joe that Phipps is a safecracker, and suggests that he get the diary from Adela's safe. Phipps's cut will be five thousand dollars. He agrees. Late that night, they assemble to steal the diary. However, Phipps has been hired by movie mogul Jacob Glutz to play butler roles, and is unwilling to risk being caught burgling. Bill comes up with the idea to give Phipps strong drinks and taunt him into burgling the safe by suggesting he has lost his skill. Phipps becomes drunk and remarkably less formal, then goes to break open the safe after being taunted by Bill. Kay tells Bill that she loves Joe but thinks his proposals are too flippant, though Bill thinks he is just shy. Phipps fails to focus on his task and argues in a disjointed way with Smedley and Joe before falling asleep. Joe tells Bill he is too shy to propose to Kay seriously. Bill knocks Joe out with her only Mickey Finn drug, planning to make Kay sympathetic to him. Bill wakes up Phipps, who does not remember anything from when he was drunk. She claims Phipps knocked out Joe. Kay sees Joe unconscious and instantly goes to his side, as Bill planned. Joe recovers, and is happily surprised that Kay returns his feelings. Phipps apologizes and works on the safe. Smedley inadvertently makes noise and wakes up Adela. Adela investigates but is stopped by Bill, who stalls by talking to Lord Topham. Topham loves Gladys \\"Toots\\" Fauntleroy, but they had an argument about her new hat. He sent a cable to England apologizing and awaits her reply. A sergeant and patrolman arrive, having been telephoned by Adela. Bill again stalls by talking to the policeman about their ambition to become actors. Bill keeps them occupied long enough for Phipps to finish his task and dismiss the policemen. However, Phipps refuses to give Smedley the diary and keeps it. Topham learns that Toots loves him still, making him very amenable, but he cannot lend Bill the money she needs for the literary agency because he can't spend his money out of England. Adela thinks Bill took the diary and telephones the police again. Bill convinces Phipps to give the diary to Smedley by pointing out that Phipps will be in trouble if the police find it. She also convinces Adela that Smedley could sue her for losing a diary he had an offer for, which would bring her bad publicity. She persuades Adela to pay him off with thirty thousand dollars, with a check made out to Bill. The two policemen return and are cheerful, having been hired as background actors. Later, Phipps says that the book he gave to Smedley was not actually the diary, and is not even in Spanish. Smedley protests that it is in Spanish and gives it to Phipps to show him, but Phipps takes it and drives off. Bill is amazed that Smedley has again been tricked out of the diary, and wants to look after him. She asks him to marry her and he agrees.

It lies predominantly within Tullyvallan townland. The civil parish is within the historic barony of Fews Upper. In the 2011 Census it had 2,836 inhabitants. The village is built around two narrow main streets (Armagh Street and Dundalk Street) and a town square (The Square). Other places include Newry Street, Castleblaney Street (known locally as 'Blaney Hill'), Church Street also known as Shambles Lane (known locally as the 'back street') and The Commons. Residential areas are Dungormley Estate, Meadowvale and the Nine Mile Road.  Name  Before the Plantation of Ulster the area of Newtownhamilton was known as Tullyvallan.

History  The village of Newtownhamilton was established c.1770 by Alexander Hamilton, a descendant of the John Hamilton from Scotland who founded Hamiltonsbawn in 1619. The parish was created in 1773 out of the neighbouring parish of Creggan.Place Names NI: Newtownhamilton On 9 May 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, some 200 Irish Republican Army volunteers under Frank Aiken surrounded and attacked the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks in Newtownhamilton. After a two-hour firefight, the IRA breached the barracks wall with explosives and stormed the building. The RIC refused to surrender until the building was set alight with petrol from a potato-spraying machine.Lawlor, Pearse.

He was a dedicated Whig who allied himself with the Duke of Marlborough, Colley Cibber, and those who rose in opposition to Queen Anne's Tory ministry of 1710 ‚Äì 1714. Johnson claimed to be trained in the law, but there is no evidence of his membership in any of the inns of court. At the same time, it is possible that he was a lawyer, as his first two published works, in 1704 and 1705 (Marlborough; on the Late Glorious Victory Near Hochstet in Germany and The Queen; a Pindaric Ode) had him living in Gray's Inn, and he married a Mary Bradbury in Gray's Inn chapel in 1709, the year of his first play, Love and Liberty (unproduced). Some time around 1710, he became friends with the actor-manager of Drury Lane Theatre, Robert Wilks, and Wilks ensured that Johnson's plays received consideration. In 1711, The Wife's Relief was a great success. The play starred Colley Cibber, Robert Wilks, Thomas Doggett, and Anne Oldfield. He received ¬£300 for the play, and it remained in print for two decades. In 1712, The Successful Pyrate was acted, and John Dennis complained to Charles Killigrew, Master of the Revels that the play glamorized the pirate Henry Every. Nevertheless, the play's controversy helped its attendance, and it was a theatrical success. After the Hanoverian succession in 1715, when the whigs were ascendant, Johnson had his greatest success with The Country Lasses. It was acted in repertoire until 1813, and it had six editions and two adaptations by 1779. Furthermore, it was used as a test case for Drury Lane. The managers claimed that they needed no license from the master of revels, and they presented The Country Lasses without license. The play is sentimental, affectionate, and nostalgic, with little of the sexuality or raillery of earlier comedies. The next year, Johnson was more overtly political with The Cobler of Preston, which was a play about the Jacobite rising of 1715. In 1717, he wrote The Sultaness, a tragedy, and in the preface to the printed play, he satirized the recent Three Hours after Marriage as \\"Long-labour'd Nonsense.\\" That play had been written by John Gay, Alexander Pope, and John Arbuthnot, and Pope repaid Johnson with interest in the 1728 The Dunciad, where he deplores :\\"A past, vamp'd, future, old, reviv'd, new piece, :'Twixt Plautus, Fletcher, Congreve, and Corneille, :(That) Can make a Cibber, Johnson, or Ozell.\\" (I. 235-40) Johnson was therefore lumped in with his much more political theatrical manager, Cibber, and the overtly political accountant, John Ozell. In comparison with those two individuals, Johnson was an innocent. In 1719 his The Masquerade was performed at the Drury Lane Theatre. Johnson's next play was a comedy The Female Fortune Teller from 1726. In 1729 he produced a ballad opera The Village Opera followed by the tragedy Medea in 1730, and his last play was Caelia, which was a comedy that failed so badly that it was withdrawn early. In the preface to Medea, Johnson replied to Pope, admitting that Pope was a better poet but complaining of the pettiness shown by Pope's treatment of those who offended him. It is possible that during these decades Johnson was already engaged in other business. He ran a tavern in Bow Street, Covent Garden. He died in 1748. His plays emphasize tragic female characters (a late version of the she- tragedy), and contemporary accounts suggest that he was an extremely friendly and inoffensive individual. He was personally corpulent, and one biographer suggested that he was attacked in The Dunciad simply for being too large a target to avoid. Johnson's remarks in Medea show that he was personally very surprised and sorry to be mentioned in The Dunciad.

It is one of only a few highways in Michigan that curve around and form a U-shape. In fact, M-123 has three intersections with only two state trunklines; it meets M-28 twice as a result of its U-shaped routing. M-123 also has a rare signed concurrency with a County-Designated Highway in Michigan; in Trout Lake, there is a concurrency with H-40. All of M-123 north of M-28 is a Scenic Heritage Route within the Michigan Heritage Route system. The highway was first designated before 1936 along a section of its current routing. Sections added since then encompass segments formerly belonging to US Highway 2 (US 2) and M-48. The last changes came to the highway in 1962 and 1963, when the northern end was extended and the southern end was truncated slightly. Route description M-123 serves a thinly-populated section of the state. Much of the highway passes through the eastern unit of the Hiawatha National Forest. No part of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways. The section of highway north of the two M-28 junctions is both a Michigan Scenic Heritage Route and part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour. =Rogers Park to Paradise= The southern terminus of the highway is at exit 352 along Interstate 75 (I-75) north of St. Ignace in Rogers Park. The roadway also connects to County- Designated Highway H-63 (Old US 2) at the interchange. From the interchange north, the highway runs northwest as Tahquamenon Trail to the community of Allenville near Brevort Lake in Brevort Township. Here it meets H-57. Just north of Allenville, the trunkline crosses through the adjacent community of Moran. Allenville was a stop on the Detroit, Mackinac and Marquette Railroad, and Moran was named after William B. Moran, one of the early settlement's founders. The roadway runs parallel to a rail line north of Moran. Before crossing into Chippewa County, the highway passes through the community of Ozark, home of a rock quarry. North of the county line is the community of Trout Lake, where M-123 meets and merges with H-40 across railroad tracks and through town near Wegwaas, Frenchman and Carp lakes. Continuing to the north, the highway is renamed Deerfoot Road and serves the Three Lakes Campground, a unit of the Hiawatha National Forest, before meeting M-28 at Eckerman. The concurrency of M-123 & H-40 in Trout Lake M-123 is designated as a Scenic Heritage Route north of M-28. Here it continues northwest to East‚ÄìWest Road and turns to run along the shores of Whitefish Bay and cross the Tahquamenon River near its mouth. Continuing along the bay as Whitefish Road, M-123 meets the community of Paradise, the northernmost point along the highway. It is here that M-123 intersects Whitefish Point Road, which continues north to Whitefish Point, home of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. In either direction, M-123 runs southbound from Paradise, changing direction. Continuing east of Paradise, M-123 is the only paved road that serves the Tahquamenon Falls State Park and the Whitefish Point region. =Tahquamenon Falls State Park= The Tahquamenon Falls are a major tourist attraction along the route of M-123. The Tahquamenon Falls State Park is a 46,179 acre (186.9 km¬≤) state park in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the second largest of Michigan's state parks. Bordering on Lake Superior, most of the park is located within Chippewa County, with the western section of the park extending into Luce County. The park follows the Tahquamenon River as it passes over Tahquamenon Falls and drains into Whitefish Bay, Lake Superior. The Tahquamenon Falls include a single 50-foot (15 m) drop, the Upper Falls, plus the cascades and rapids collectively called the Lower Falls. During the late-spring runoff, the river drains as much as 50,000 gallons (200,000 liters) of water per second, making the upper falls the second most voluminous vertical waterfall east of the Mississippi River, after only Niagara Falls. =Paradise to Newberry= East of Paradise, M-123 runs along the Tahquamenon River inside the state park boundaries. Past the park, the highway is known as Falls Road in Luce County. The trunkline turns southwest at the county line. It runs south and west across Murphy Creek and the Auger River before intersecting with H-37 at Four Mile Corner. The highway crosses a branch of the Tahquamenon River one last time before becoming Newberry Avenue in the city of Newberry. The highest annual average daily traffic, a measure of traffic volume, was recorded by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) for M-123 in 2007 along Newberry Avenue at 7,500 vehicles. South of downtown, M-123 meets M-28 a second time west of Twin Lake. This intersection is the \\"northern\\" terminus of the highway. History The construction of M-123 started in the 1930s near Eckerman, the location of the current eastern M-28/M-123 junction. By 1936, M-123 was designated running north of M-28 on of hard-surface pavement. At this time, US 2 is routed along Worth Road and uses roadway later used by M-123 from Moran to Rogers Park, and M-48 was routed north of Newberry to Four Mile Corner. The first extension of M-123 southward from Eckerman, through Trout Lake to Rogers Park north of St. Ignace, came in 1954. Part of this routing in Trout Lake uses M-48 (now a portion of H-40). An additional extension is shown north to the Tahquamenon River Bridge, lengthening the highway to the north on the April 15, 1954 official state map. The section north to the Tahquamenon River Bridge is remarked on the October 1, 1954 state map as a county road, however. In 1957, M-123 was permanently extended north to the bridge, and in 1962 the final extension north to Paradise and south to Newberry was completed. From Four Mile Corner south, M-123 replaced M-117 to a new terminus at M-28 south of Newberry. The southernmost section of roadway between the I-75/US 2 freeway and H-63 (Old US 2) was transferred to Mackinac County for maintenance with the opening of the freeway in 1963. On November 9, 2007, MDOT expanded the Tahquamenon Scenic Heritage Route designation previously applied to M-123. This expanded the designation to all of the highway north of M-28, recognizing it for its \\"outstanding natural beauty\\" and the scenic views of \\"rivers, forests, trails and Tahquamenon Falls State Park.\\" Previously, the designation was limited to between Luce County Road 500 to Galloway Creek. The expansion was planned by the Eastern Upper Peninsula Regional Planning & Development Commission along with local governments and businesses.

She is usually depicted as a superheroine and the last addition to the New Warriors before the cancellation of their original series. Timeslip first appeared in New Warriors #59 (May 1995) and was created by Evan Skolnick and Patrick Zircher. Fictional character biography =Origin= Rina Patel is an Indian mutant, born with special, superhuman abilities. Initially her only known special ability was to completely swap her current consciousness with her consciousness from any other point in her life, past or future. As a college student, Rina was seen \\"time-swapping\\" to when she was four years old as an escape from studying. At the same time, her four-year-old consciousness was time-swapped to her college-age self, causing the child version of herself to panic. Suddenly Rina's current self was ripped to another time, a bewildering vision of herself in a superhero outfit talking with the New Warriors in their Crashpad headquarters. The short episode passed, and a confused Rina decided to pay little heed to the strange future that seemed to be in store for her.New Warriors #59. Marvel Comics. In her next appearance, Rina once again time- swapped to her own near future and found herself holding what appeared to be a dying Speedball in her arms.New Warriors #60. Marvel Comics. Concerned for Robbie's welfare, Rina began making concerted efforts to contact and warn him of her frightening future vision. However, Speedball did not take her warnings seriously, assuming she was a \\"super hero stalker\\" of some kind. Ultimately Rina found Carlton LaFroyge (Hindsight Lad) and convinced him of her sincerity and special abilities by pushing him out of the way of an oncoming truck. This involved Rina warping time so that she seemed to be moving super-fast, an ability she had not previously realized she had.New Warriors #62. Marvel Comics. Trying to help Rina (and her warnings) be taken seriously by the New Warriors, Hindsight Lad designed a superhero costume for her, dubbed her Timeslip, and arranged for her to meet with the team while showing off her time-warping abilities.New Warriors #64. Marvel Comics. Even after this demonstration and Rina's impassioned warnings, Speedball was still dubious about her predictions, while the rest of the team did not know quite what to make of her. However, Timeslip's persistence convinced the Warriors to keep her around as they tried to figure out how to prevent her future vision of Speedball's death from coming to pass. Over time it became clear that Timeslip's visions always came true exactly as she saw them, and Robbie's apparent death was no exception. When the Sphinx appeared and, brushing the Warriors aside, killed Speedball in cold blood. He died in her arms, just as she had foreseen.New Warriors #69. Marvel Comics. However it was ultimately revealed that the Speedball who died in Rina's arms was in fact an exact duplicate who had been created in the year 2092. This advanced biological construct was designed to take Robbie's place as a sleeper agent, tasked with preventing a deranged time-hopping villain, Advent, from rewriting future history to his liking. The Sphinx intentionally killed this Speedball duplicate because \\"he would have failed\\" to stop Advent.New Warriors #70. Marvel Comics. This brutal and seemingly senseless act of murder set in motion a chain of events that drew Rina into the New Warriors team and allowed her to stop Advent herself, saving the future and the rest of the New Warriors.New Warriors #71.

Timeslip remained with the team and was instrumental in preventing the Dire Wraith queen Volx from detonating a device that could have eliminated the special powers of thousands of superhumans.

In 1831, the present building (originally known as Benwell Towers) designed by the Tyneside architect John Dobson replaced the old house and has since provided a number of different functions.

By the 1970s the building had become The Mitre pub, before achieving national fame in 1989 as the Byker Grove youth club in the BBC children's television series, Byker Grove.

A vocal follower of Sree Narayana Guru, he was associated with a number of events related to the Kerala reformation movement and was the organizer of Misra Bojana in Cherai in 1917. He founded Sahodara Sangam, and the journal Sahodaran and was the founder editor of the magazine Yukthivadhi.  Biography  Sahodaran Ayyapan's home at Cherai K. Ayyappan was born on August 22, 1889, in Cherai, Vypin Island, in Ernakulam district of the present day south Indian state of Kerala in an aristrocatic Ezhava family of ayurvedic physicians to Kumabalathuparambil Kochavu Vaidyar and Unnooli, as the youngest of their nine children. His father died when he was a child and was brought up under the guidance of his elder brother, Achuthan Vaidyar. His early education was in the traditional way and he learnt Sanskrit from local teachers such as Mattapilla Kannu Asan and Kochupilla Asan after which he started the formal education at a local school started by Nediyara Achan Bava. Subsequently, he studied at schools in Pallippuram and North Paravur before passing the pre- degree course from Malabar Christian College to join Maharaja's College, Thiruvananthapuram, the present-day University College for his under graduate studies. In between, there was a short break in studies due to health issues. During this period, he had the opportunity to interact with Narayana Guru and it was Guru who arranged for Ayyappan's stay in Thiruvanathapuram with the noted poet, Kumaran Asan. After completing his graduate studies in 1916, he returned to his native place to start his career started as a teacher at Rama Varma Union High School, Cherai but he could not carry his social and political life along with the teaching career and he quit the job. Later, he studied law but that was a futile attempt as he failed in the FL examination. Ayyappan was married to Parvathy and the couple had a daughter, Aisha and a son, Sugathan. He died on March 6, 1968, at the age of 78,following a cardiac arrest. Reform movements After his graduation, he returned to Cherai from Thiruvananthapuram in 1917 and founded Sahodara Sangham (The Brotherhood Association), a platform to launch his fight against the Caste system. Under the aegis of this organization, he organized a Misra Bhojanan, a feast where people of all castes sat and dined under one roof, at the house of Ayyappan's nephew, Raman Pillai, on May 30, 1917, a revolutionary venture during those days and the conservative Ezhava community opposed it. Around 200 people including members representing the Pulaya caste, who were considered untouchable attended the feast and the effort earned him the moniker, Pulaya Ayyappan, meant to be derogatory but Ayyappan accepted it as a decoration. The founding of the Sahodara Sangham also earned him another epithet, Sahodaran Ayyappan, with which he came to be known thereafter. Narayana Guru supported the efforts of Sahodara Sangham through a message sent on May 15, 1921, and in order to propagate his ideals, Ayyappan started a journal, Sahodaran, from Mattancherry; the journal continued to be in print until 1956. IN 1929, when M. Ramavarma Thampan, Mithavaadi Krishnan, C. V. Kunhiraman, and M. C. Joseph started the Yukthivadi (The Rationalist), he became the founder editor of the magazine. He modified the famous slogan of Narayana Guru, Oru Jaathi Oru Matham Oru Daivam Manushyanu (One Caste, One Religion, One God for Mankind) as Jati Venda, Matam Venda, Deivam Venda Manushyanu (No Caste, No Religion, No God for Mankind). Political career In 1928, Ayyappan successfully contested the election to the Cochin Legislative Council and he retained the seat for the next 21 years. He became a minister in the Cochin Legislative assembly in 1947 and when the state of Travancore and Kochi was united to form Travancore-Cochin state, he continued to serve as a minister, only to resign from the post when the government started dismissing lower level employees as an austerity measure. However, in the next elections in October 1949, the Prajamandalam Party secured majority to form a ministry under the leadership of E. Ikkanda Warrier, he joined the ministry along with Panampilli Govinda Menon and C. A. Ouseph. He also served as a minister under Paravoor T. K. Narayana Pillai but resigned the post when the ministerial responsibilities interfered with his social life.  Literary career  Ayyappan published six books of poetry and an essay compilation, Sadhesheeyam'. Besides, he also wrote several articles and editorials which appeared in the publications he was associated with.  Memorials and honours  On February 14, 1996, Shankar Dayal Sharma, the then president of India, unveiled a statue of Ayyappan in Kochi. The Government of Kerala has set up Sahodaran Ayyappan Memorial at the house where Ayyappan was born which houses Sahodaran Ayyappan Smaraka Library and the Sahodaran Ayyappan museum.

Railroad career  Stickney was a personal and professional friend of James J. Hill, a pioneering railroad magnate, who became known in his lifetime as \\"The Empire Builder\\". Stickney worked for him and he had a hand in Stickney's later railroads. Stickney in 1879 had been the construction superintendent for St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway, later known as the Great Northern Railway. James J. Hill in 1881 sent Stickney to be construction superintendent for the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1885 he started what would become the Chicago Great Western Railway, which linked Chicago, Minneapolis, Omaha, and Kansas City. Clearing Yard in Chicago was founded by him in 1889. Stickney was a maverick among railroad executives of the time. He favored some regulation by the federal government and was opposed to the most flagrant abuses of the railroads. His viewpoint is well illustrated by the following quotation: :\\"The managing officers were now potentates,--'railroad magnates,' 'railroad kings.' They traveled in state, surrounded by their personal staff, the heads of the different departments, who were almost as important personages as their chiefs. When they visited a town on their lines, the principal business men rushed to greet them. The fat of the land was at their disposal. Merchants sent baskets of champagne to the heads of the traffic departments and sealskin jackets to their wives, while on the other hand, special rates were liberally bestowed upon their favorites. Special clerks were required to be wholly employed in issuing free passes. Judges and juries seemed to have a perceptible bias in their favor, the brightest attorneys were retained, and minor officials were glad to grant them favors. The country press was subsidized with passes for editors, their families and their friends.\\"  Legacy  Stickney died on August 9, 1916, and is buried in Oakland Cemetery, St. Paul, Minnesota.

Club career Born in Worksop, Ward began his professional career with Mansfield Town, where he made 97 appearances, helping them reach the play- offs. He moved to Notts County for ¬£150,000 in July 1995, where he would go on to make his most appearances. During a six-season stay, he played over 300 games for the Meadow Lane club. He moved across the River Trent in 2001 to join local rivals Nottingham Forest. He spent three seasons in the First Division with Forest as they strove for promotion back to the Premier League, but a play-off spot in 2003 was as near as they managed. He finally got his opportunity to play in the top flight when he joined newly promoted Norwich City in a two-year deal in August 2004. However, the form of Robert Green meant he only managed one appearance in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in a defeat at Charlton Athletic. The club was relegated after a solitary season at the highest level, but Ward made no further appearances for the Canaries in the lower tier either. He was released at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season after not signing a new contract at the club, and on 4 August 2006, he signed a contract at Sunderland. He had to wait until October for his debut, replacing teenager Ben Alnwick after the appointment of Roy Keane as manager, but made the number 1 spot his own for the rest of the season as the side went on to top the Championship. One particularly outstanding save against Southampton which was later described as being in the style of Gordon Banks by opposition manager George Burley. Ward found himself replaced by ¬£9million new signing Craig Gordon upon Sunderland's return to the Premier League, but did manage three appearances, keeping a clean sheet in his first, a 1‚Äì0 win over Derby County. During the January 2008 winter transfer window, he rejected a move to Scottish giants Rangers, preferring to stay and fight to be the first-choice keeper at the Stadium of Light. He failed to break back into the first team at Sunderland the following season and joined Wolverhampton Wanderers of the Championship in March 2009 on loan for the remainder of the campaign. However, injury meant he returned to his parent club early. He was released by Sunderland on 28 May 2009 and subsequently announced his playing retirement. On 12 October 2009 it was announced that Ward was the new goalkeeping coach for Peterborough United, replacing Andy Dibble, who departed from the role for personal reasons. International career Ward won five caps for the Welsh national team before announcing his international retirement in May 2007. He made his international debut on 2 June 2000 in a 3‚Äì0 friendly defeat to Portugal. He had to wait until 2002 for his next cap, and won further caps during 2003‚Äì04, all during friendly internationals. Family Ward married Nicola in 1997 and later became a father to Rhys Harry (2000) and Evie Mae (2003).

In addition to its football side the 1,000 member sports club also has departments for badminton, women's gymnastics, handball, and table tennis. History =Foundation to WW II= The earliest origins of the club go back to a pair of predecessor sides; Ballsportverein Vorw√§rts L√ºbeck established on 1 April 1919 and Sportvereinigung Polizei L√ºbeck founded in 1921.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag Logo of predecessor side VfR L√ºbeck ca 1931. SV Polizei L√ºbeck was the local police sports club. In 1931 it was merged with Verein f√ºr Rasensport L√ºbeck, which was the product of the 1923 union of Fu√üball Club Alemannia 1905 L√ºbeck and L√ºbecker Fu√üball Club Germania 1913. SVP played well enough to earn appearances in the playoff rounds of the senior north German circuit, but did not enjoy any success. VfR made only a single such appearance, in 1924. BSV Vorw√§rts L√ºbeck played as an unheralded local side until 1933 when it was dismantled by the Nazi regime, which regarded workers sports clubs of the sort as politically undesirable. The club's membership became part of SVP and the expanded association joined the Gauliga Nordmark, one of sixteen top flight divisions formed in the 1933 reorganization of German football under the Third Reich. The club was renamed Polizei Sportverein L√ºbeck in 1935 and played in the Gauliga Nordmark until 1942, with its best results coming as third-place finishes. PSV made unsuccessful qualification round appearances in play for the Tschammerpokal, predecessor of today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup) in 1936‚Äì38. In 1942 the club was again renamed, becoming Sportgemeinschaft der Ordnungspolizei L√ºbeck, and moved to the Gauliga Schleswig-Holstein when wartime conditions forced the breakup of the Gauliga Nordmark into three more local divisions. =Post-war era to present= Historical chart of VfB L√ºbeck league performance after WWII. Following World War II organizations throughout Germany, including sports and football clubs, were dissolved by occupying Allied authorities. In 1945 the former memberships of SG OrPo and BSV Vorw√§rts formed a new association called Verein f√ºr Bewegungsspile L√ºbeck. The new club resumed play in the top flight, first in the Berzirksmeisterschaft Schleswig-Holstein, and then in 1947, in the newly formed Oberliga Nord. Over the next decade and a half VfB bounced up and down between first and second division play; they were consistently a top performer in the Amateurliga Schlewig-Holstein (II), but completely incapable of escaping the basement of the Oberliga Nord (I). Following the 1963 formation of the Bundesliga, the country's professional first division circuit, the team settled into the Regionalliga Nord (II), generally earning mid-table results. A second-place finish in 1969 led VfB to the qualification round for the Bundesliga, where they finished last in their group with only a single point from eight matches. After 1974, VfB slipped from the ranks of second-tier teams to fourth division Landesliga Schleswig-Holstein. They recovered a place in the 2. Bundesliga just over two decades later and resumed their role as an \\"elevator side\\", moving frequently between the second and third divisions. In 2004, the team reached the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal (German Cup), but lost to Werder Bremen in extra time. After it was revealed that the club has been suffering from financial difficulties, it finally filed for bankruptcy at the district court L√ºbeck in April 2008 and was eventually forcibly relegated to the Schleswig-Holstein-Liga (fifth division) for the 2013‚Äì14 season. After a league championship at this level and success in the promotion round the club returned to Regionalliga level from 2014. In July 2009, VfB L√ºbeck shocked Bundesliga club 1. FSV Mainz 05, beating them 2‚Äì1 after extra time in the first round of the DFB-Pokal. They were eliminated in the next round by VfB Stuttgart (3‚Äì1) after again taking a Bundesliga club into extra time.

He also was a major benefactor in the tourist town of Medora, North Dakota and the Medora Musical. Background Schafer was born on a small farm near Stanton, North Dakota the second of three children born to Edward and Bertha Schafer. His brother Gordon was born in 1911, his sister Ethelwyn in 1916. Harold spoke only German at home until he went to elementary school.Brooke, James. North Dakota, With German Roots, Adopts Spanish as Second Language. The New York Times. March 2, 1996; accessed December 10, 2012. During his school years, the family moved repeatedly. In 1919, the Schafers moved from the farm near Stanton to another small farm near Hazen, then to Killdeer in 1920 and to Bismarck in 1922. Harold next spent a considerable period of time with his mother's family near Rosebud, South Dakota. In 1924, when Schafer was 12 years old, his father left the family and Harold moved back to Bismarck to live with his mother. He and his mother subsequently moved to Jamestown, then to Glen Ullin and finally back to Bismarck in 1927. Schafer graduated from Bismarck High School. During this period in his life, Schafer took his first paid job at the age of eight working in a butcher shop in Killdeer. When his family moved to Bismarck he worked as a newspaper boy, did janitorial work and was employed as a gas station attendant. In Jamestown he candled eggs, sold flowers and worked as a department store clerk. In Glen Ullin he worked on a threshing crew, and by the time he was back in Bismarck and graduating from high school, Schafer did odd jobs at the Dahl clothing store, was an usher at the Capitol Theater, a bellhop at the Patterson Hotel, and an attendant at the Standard Oil Service Station. He also delivered milk, shoveled snow and was offered a job as a salesman at Bergeson's clothing store. In 1929, Schafer enrolled at the North Dakota State Agricultural College (now NDSU) in Fargo. He continued to work at multiple jobs and once again his employment included work as a salesman, this time at the Globe Clothing Company. Schafer left college after one year and hit the road as a traveling salesman. By 1931, at the age of 19, he returned to Bismarck where once again he found work at the Dahl Clothing Store. Schafer was forced to take a job at a clothing store in Glasgow, Montana, almost immediately after his first wedding but, by January 1, 1936, he was back in Bismarck and working for Vantine's Paint and Glass. He switched to Fargo Glass and Paint in November 1936 and then worked for that company as a traveling salesman for several years. Gold Seal Company In 1942, Schafer started packaging and selling a product he called Gold Seal Floor Wax. He personally typed the labels by hand and taped them onto old cans in his basement and, thus, Gold Seal Company was born. In the spring of 1943, Harold resigned his job at Fargo Glass and Paint to pursue his new dream, only to discover that the few hundred dollars that he had expected to have available for the purpose of starting the company did not materialize. At that point the family had three small children, no job and no money, and his new company had no assets.Harold Schafer (BismarckPride.com) In 1943, his Gold Seal Company made a profit of $901.02, and Schafer borrowed money from friends to keep going. The company grew modestly at first but, in 1945 introduced a new product called Glass Wax. Sales increased dramatically and then suddenly boomed when, in 1948, Glass Wax went national. The rapid rise of this small North Dakota company, Schafer's sometimes flamboyant management style, and his incredible enthusiasm for hard work propelled it into the national limelight. The success of Glass Wax was repeated again in the 1950s with Snowy Bleach and in the 1960s with Mr. Bubble. Each of these became the number one selling product in their respective categories, and the Gold Seal Company continued to produce increasing sales and profits until it was sold to Airwick Industries in 1986.Gold Seal Company (BismarckPride.com) Later years After selling his Gold Seal interests, Schafer reinvested much of his assets in the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation to promote and preserve Medora's Western culture. Schafer was honored for this benefaction with the Roughrider Award, North Dakota's highest civilian honor.Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation ( Historic Medora, North Dakota)Harold Schafer, entrepreneur July 4, 1975 (Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award) He purchased the Rough Riders Hotel and the Ferris Store in 1962 and began renovating them in 1963. Other renovations and improvements soon followed and, in 1965, the Medora Division of the Gold Seal Company was opened to the public. Schafer was enthralled with Medora and its fascinating history, and continued to pour his money and his efforts into this project. Medora eventually developed into the largest recreational area in the state of North Dakota. When the Gold Seal Company was sold in 1986, the family donated the Medora assets to the newly formed Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation. A number of awards were bestowed on Schafer for his philanthropy, but he also became the youngest person ever to win the Horatio Alger awardHarold L. Schafer (Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans) . In 1975, he was awarded the state's highest honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award by Governor Arthur Albert Link. In 1995, he was inducted into the DeMolay International Hall of Fame. The Harold Schafer Leadership Center was established at the University of Mary in 1997 by the university's then-president Sister Thomas Welder. A collection of Native American artifacts which he assembled is displayed in the Museum of the Badlands in Medora. A Theodore Roosevelt Badlands Institute has been planned for Medora, and the artifact collection would be housed within the Institute's facility.Harold Schafer (BismarckTribune.com. December 4, 2001) Personal life On September 22, 1935, he married Marian Nelsen of Aberdeen, South Dakota. The couple had five children, Haroldeen, Joanne, Dianne, Ed, and Pam. On May 9, 1965, Harold married Sheila Chinn Limond. She had three children - Mark, Michelle, and Maureen. He was the father of Ed Schafer who was the former United States Secretary of Agriculture and North Dakota governor (1992 to 2000). Harold Schafer died December 2, 2001, in a Bismarck hospital after an extended illness, aged 89. A memorial service was held at Trinity Lutheran Church in Bismarck.

He was also a poet and author who was literary combatant of Alexander Pope. Early life Duckett was the eldest son of Lionel Duckett and his wife Martha (n√©e Ashe, 1651-1688) daughter of Samuel Ashe of Langley Burrell, Wiltshire. In 1693, he succeeded to the estates of his father. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 29 November 1700, aged 15, and was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1703. Career At the 1705 English general election, Duckett was returned in a contest as Whig Member of Parliament for Calne, in Wiltshire. He was very active in Parliament, acting several times as Teller. He spoke on the proceedings against Charles Caesar on 19 December 1705 and voted on the Place bill in 1706. He reported from the committee examining a petition relating to the administration of the Fleet prison and promoted a bill on the Calne highway. He was named to draft a bill to end the embargo on the export of white woollen cloth which was a matter of concern to his constituents. He supported his friend John Asgill over a publication and over his subsequent expulsion from the House. At the 1708 general election, he was returned in another contest He voted for the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709, and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. At the 1710 British general election, he was caught up in a double return, and the Tory majority in the new House decided against him and his fellow Whig. At the 1722 British general election, Duckett was returned again as MP for Calne, but vacated the seat on 28 February 1723 on his appointment as a commissioner of excise, a post he held until 1732. Literature Duckett was a friend of Joseph Addison, and he entertained Addison and some of Addison's \\"little senate\\" at his estates in Wiltshire. He was also a close friend of Thomas Burnet, and he and Burnet would collaborate on numerous satirical and political writings. In particular, the two teamed up to oppose Alexander Pope after the latter's disaffection with Addison and dispute with Ambrose Philips. In 1715, Burnet and Duckett wrote Homerides, or, a letter to Mr. Pope, occasion'd by his intended translation of Homer; by Sir Iliad Doggerl, and in 1716 they wrote Homerides, or, Homer's First Book Moderniz'd. Pope accused them of attacking his translation of Homer prior to anything even being written, and with some justice, and Duckett continued the battle with An Epilogue to a Puppet Show at Bath Concerning the same Iliad by himself. Edmund Curll, in his battle against Pope, published the Epilogue. Pope's revenge appeared in The Dunciad of 1728, and in particular in the Dunciad Variorum. Because of their positions in government, Pope did not attack Duckett and Burnet by name in Dunciad itself, and he did not directly impugn them until the Variorum. Duckett and Burnet also funded and contributed to two weekly journals, The Grumbler and Pasquin. He was also the patron of one of Pope's other enemies, John Oldmixon. In 1717, Duckett published an apolitical, professional work entitled A Summary of All the Religious Houses in England and Wales. It was an accounting of the values of each of the monasteries and convents at the time of the dissolution and their present value, if they were still available. It was this work that brought Duckett to the attention which led to his appointment as a commissioner of excise. In 1729, Duckett and John Dennis together wrote anti- Popery booklet called Pope Alexander's Supremacy and Infallibility Examin'd. Death and legacy Duckett died at home on his Calne estate in 1732. He had married Grace Skinner (c. 1690-1755) on 23 March 1711. The couple had nine children, eight of whom survived to adult life. # Lionel Duckett (1712‚Äì67) # Thomas Duckett (1713-1766) # Grace Duckett (1714-1784) # William Duckett # George Duckett # William Duckett (died 1780) # Skinner Duckett (died 1767) # Martha Duckett # Catherine Duckett References * Roberts, William, and Freya Johnston, 'George Duckett', in Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison, eds.

Funds raised are used to offset government borrowing and are refundable to the bond owner on demand. Interest is returned to bond owners via prizes which are distributed by means of random selection of bonds. Prize Bonds are also offered in Pakistan, by the Ministry of Finance, and in the UK, under the name Premium Bonds. Background The 1956 Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) ActSee the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956 (Part V) is the primary legislation under which the bonds are authorised; the similar concept of Premium Bonds were introduced in the United Kingdom at the same time. Bonds were first sold in March 1957, with the first draw held in September of that year. Originally the Bank of Ireland, as the government's banker, was the operator of the scheme. When the scheme commenced, the biannual draws were in September and March where by means of six drums the winning serial number was drawn randomly; in 1972 the serial number was increased from six to seven digits for bonds issued after that time. In 1993 regulation was made for the conduct of the draws on a weekly basis using a computer-driven random number generator to determine winning numbers. Organization The Prize Bond Company is a joint venture between the founders An Post and FEXCO and is based in Killorglin, County Kerry. The company was created in 1989 with issued share capital between the founders of 50% each and will operate the scheme under its current (as of 2011) contract until the end of 2019. Employees of the Prize Bond Company are seconded from the respective partner, FEXCO is responsible for administration, whilst An Post is responsible for accounting and marketing in addition to conducting the draws. The National Treasury Management Agency is responsible for the regulation of the company, since the Agency was established in 1990. Finance Originally bonds could be purchased as in units of five Irish pounds, with a minimum purchase of ¬£10. Today the unit price is 6.25 Euros (equivalent to IR¬£4.92 at the final fixed exchange rate) and a minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨25 is required. In September 2009 the Prize Bond fund exceeded ‚Ç¨1bn for the first time. Prize Bonds Press Release 29-Oct-2009 The weekly draw is held on Fridays at 12:30 in the General Post Office, Dublin. Prizes range from just ‚Ç¨50 to a jackpot of ‚Ç¨50,000 except for the last draw in second month when the jackpot is ‚Ç¨1m. Typically (2013) each weekly draw awards over 8,000 prizes with a total value about ‚Ç¨0.5m (or about ‚Ç¨1.5m for the bimonthly draw).

It is located within the Royal Route, the most prominent part of the historic city center and is one of its most notable tourist attractions. It was created in 1612-14 in place of a 13th-century gothic gate, the Brama D≈Çugouliczna (Long Street Gate). It is located at one end of Ulica D≈Çuga (Long Lane), where, together with Brama Wy≈ºynna (Highland Gate) and Wie≈ºa Wiƒôzienna (Prison Tower), it forms a part of the old city fortifications. Langgasser Tor in 1687 It was designed by architect Abraham van den Blocke and was built by Jan Strakowski. The architectural style of the gate is Dutch mannerism. Next to it is the late-gothic building of the Brotherhood of St. George. Both sides of the gate have attiques, with figures symbolizing the qualities of the ideal citizen. They were designed in 1648 by Jeremias Falck (\\"Polonus\\"), and reconstructed in 1878 due to the originals being damaged by weathering over time. From the West side they represent (in Latin): Pax (Peace), Libertas (Freedom), Fortuna (Wealth) and Fama (Fame). From the East (Long Lane) side they are Concordia (Agreement), Iustitia (Justice), Pietas (Piety) and Prudentia (Prudency). The Latin inscription on the gates reads: Concordia res public√¶ parv√¶ crescunt ‚Äì discordia magn√¶ concidunt (\\"In agreement small republics grow, because of disagreement great republics fall\\"). The gate was largely destroyed by Soviet shelling in World War II, but was rebuilt in 1957. Although most artifacts of Germanness were eradicated after the city became part of the Polish People's Republic in 1945, an original German inscription on the gate was restored in the 1990s: ' (\\"They shall prosper that love thee.

It is a brand-new theatre built into 19th-century-era Victorian industrial buildings. It is home to the Soulpepper Theatre Company and the theatre school at George Brown College.  History  Gooderham and Worts was founded by James Worts, a British immigrant, in 1832. The company became one of the world's largest distilleries, and in 1859 it constructed the largest distillery in Canada, also one of the largest in North America. This distillery is what remains today of the 'Distillery District' at the bottom of Trinity Street in Toronto, Ontario. In the first year of the new distillery, G&W; produced 849,700 U.S. gallons of proof spirits, a value equivalent to one quarter of the entire Canadian production at that time.Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History: an International Encyclopedia What is now known as the Young Center For the Performing Arts was originally built as tank house 9 and tank house 10, part of the Gooderham and Worts Distillery. The buildings were constructed in 1888 following the 1885 passage of the Canadian law which required that all whisky must be aged for two years before being consumed. Prior to this law change, whisky was often consumed quickly after it was distilled; the law change meant that Gooderham and Worts needed to increase storage space for their product. Both structures were designed by David Roberts Jr., who designed many of the Distillery's buildings.http://www.distilleryheritage.com  Current use  Currently the two tank houses with their additions/renovations house a performance center which combines studio spaces with theatre spaces. The building is a partnership between the Soulpepper Theatre company and the George Brown Theatre School. The building houses four theaters and four studio spaces, all of which are shared by the two entities that make up the owners of the complex. In December 2000 Paul Carder, then the Dean of Business and Creative Arts at George Brown College, approached Albert Schultz the Artistic Director of Soulpepper Theatre Company with the suggestion that a partnership be struck between Soulpepper and the George Brown Theatre School. In November 2001, the Distillery Historic District Project was announced and the partnership of George Brown College (GBC) and Soulpepper immediately began negotiations with the Cityscape Development group to take possession of Tank Houses 9 and 10 creating what would become the Young Centre for the Performing Arts. The vision of this partnership was to create a performing arts, education and community outreach facility that would be home to George Brown Theatre School's celebrated three-year professional actor training program; Soulpepper Theatre Company with its three-tiered mandate of performance, artist training and youth outreach; and Toronto's independent arts community. This facility, in which the performance and education of all performing disciplines would be undertaken, would be unique in the world. In 2002, the architectural firm of KPMB Architects was hired to design the centre with Thomas Payne as the principal architect, Chris Couse as senior associate and Mark Jaffar as project architect. The design created four flexible, dedicated, indoor performance venues, an outdoor concert venue and artist garden, four studios, two classrooms, a wardrobe production facility, a student lounge, administration for GBC and Soulpepper. At the centre of the building is a soaring public space, which includes a caf√©/bar, a bookstore and a reference library. The total cost of the facility is $14 million and GBC and Soulpepper Theatre Company have equally shared the cost. The shared dream became a reality in 2003, when David Young through the Michael Young Family Foundation contributed a lead gift of $3 million to what is now known as the Young Centre for the Performing Arts. Shortly thereafter, the Government of Ontario through the Ministry of Culture made a $2 million contribution and the Government of Canada through the Department of Heritage Cultural Spaces Program contributed $600,000. George Brown College and Soulpepper Theatre undertook separate capital campaigns to fund their respective shares in the project. In June 2004, Anne Sado, President of George Brown College, and Albert Schultz, Soulpepper's Artistic Director, presided over a groundbreaking ceremony for the Young Centre for the Performing Arts. On January 15, 2006 the Young Centre for the Performing Arts officially opened to the public.

Stylar beak usually straight, approximately 0.75 mm. Cultivation Grow at tropical temperatures with plenty of light and a rich substrate. It can stand lower temperatures however if acclimatised, though it will stay rather smaller and grow more slowly. Water conditions don't seem to be critical. In the smaller aquarium it will often quickly form emerse leaves, which prefer moist conditions and don't like being dried out by being too near lamps etc. It is easy to grow and makes a very good specimen plant for the larger aquarium. Medicinal It is suitable for aquariums and ornamental, and also medicinal use. The infusion tea leaf provides laxative. A survey has confirmed its effectiveness in cases of hypertension. It is also popularly used as a diuretic and antirheumatic against inflammation of skin and throat, rheumatism, arthritis and syphilis as blood purifier and eliminator of uric acid. The plant produces a rhizome which a mass is extracted. This mass can be made sweet, like pumpkin. This candy is very good as blood cleanser. The plant is used in the production of Brazilian soft drinks Mineirinho and Mate.

Millay was born July 4, 1929, at Mercy Hospital and grew up in Ocean Beach, San Francisco, and Hawaii. After serving three years in the Navy, he enrolled at UCLA. He graduated in 1955 and worked as a stockbroker. In 1958, Millay and two partners who included David Tallichet, formed Speciality Restaurants Corporation, a destination-restaurant business. Their first location was a Polynesian-themed Reef in Long Beach. More than 100 restaurants across the U.S. followed, including the Proud Bird adjacent to Los Angeles International Airport, and 94th Aero Squadron near Van Nuys Airport. After selling SRC to Tallichet, Millay envisioned creating an underwater zoo. Joining with two fraternity brothers and their former fraternity adviser, the group hoped to create an attraction to rival Marineland. SeaWorld opened in 1964 in San Diego, California. An orca named Shamu was added in 1965 and became one of its most successful attractions. Millay opened SeaWorld Ohio in 1970 and SeaWorld Orlando in 1973. He assisted in the development of Magic Mountain. In 1977, Millay developed the now-defunct Wet 'n Wild water park in Orlando, Florida.  World Waterpark Association  Founded in 1982, World Waterpark Association was inspired by Millay‚Äòs creativity and success. Based in Overland Park, Kansas, World Waterpark Association is led by a volunteer board of directors, a Governance Committee, and a paid staff of directors and managers. Annually, WWA hosts a conference and Trade Show to educate members and to showcase waterpark products and services. The organization publishes the trade publication World Waterpark Magazine. By the time Millay sold his company in 1998, ten Wet 'n Wild parks were in operation. Millay was inducted into the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Hall of Fame in 1994. Ten years later, the World Waterpark Association gave him their first ever Lifetime Achievement Award and named him the official \\"Father of the Waterpark\\".

Vincenzo Carafa, S.J. Very Rev. Vincenzo Carafa, S.J. (5 May 1585 - 6 June 1649) was an Italian Jesuit priest and spiritual writer, elected the seventh Superior-General of the Society of Jesus. He is a Servant of God. Carafa was born in Andria (Italy), of the family of the Counts of Montorio, and a relative of Pope Paul IV. He entered the Society of Jesus on 4 October 1604, and was sixty years of age at his election as general. He died four years after. He had taught philosophy and governed the principal house of the Society at Naples, and was provincial at the time of the election to the generalship. In 1635 he had published his Fascetto di Mirra (Bundle of Myrrh), which has been translated into several languages. He is the author of several other ascetical works, such as Cammino del Cielo, Cittadino del Cielo, Il Peregrino della terra, Idea Christiani hominis, and Il Serafino, all previous to his election. He wrote under the name Aloysius Sidereus. Besides personal correspondence his only known writing as Superior General was his letter addressed to all Jesuits: De mediis conservandi prim√¶vum spiritum Societatis (The means of preserving the primitive spirit of the Society). In 1648 Carafa called the forty-year old letterato Daniello Bartoli from his itinerant activities as a preacher around Italy to the Casa Professa (Rome) and a permanent position there as the official historian of the Jesuit order. The folio volumes of his Istoria della Compagnia di Ges√π began to appear in 1650. Bartoli soon after Carafa's death in 1649 wrote and published the biography of the Neapolitan general. It includes the 1646 episode of Bartoli's shipwreck in a storm off Capri and his recuperation in Naples.Della Vita del p. Vincenzo Carafa, Settimo Generale della Compagnia di Ges√π (Rome, 1651) pp. 77-78. His short term in office coincided with the beginning of the controversy with Jansenist theologians and the troubles with Palafox, Bishop of La Puebla. A great scandal occurred in Spain because of unsuccessful business speculations by a coadjutor brother, and in France on account of the open apostasy to Calvinism of a priest; but the martyrdom of Isaac Jogues, Br√©beuf, Neville, and others in Canada and England showed that the Society's ancient fervour had not relaxed. According to St Louis de Montfort in True Devotion to Mary, Carafa would wear an iron band around his feet as a mark of his servitude to Jesus. The Confraternity of the Bona Mors was instituted at the suggestion of Father Carafa. He died in Rome, aged 64.

Plot The story revolves around a male Kathakali artist Kunhikuttan, an admirable and respected performer but a member of a lower caste. He struggles to come to terms with the rejection and estrangement of his father, a member of an upper caste who denies his son. Poor, unhappy, and stuck in an arranged marriage that provides no relief, he gets by for the sake of his daughter. One night, whilst performing as Putana from Poothanamoksham from the epic Mahabharata on stage, his performance is witnessed by Subhadra, an educated and married upper-caste women, niece of the Dewan and an aspiring composer. Impressed by his performance she invites him to play Arjuna in her adaptation of Subhadraharanam. Defying the norms of India's rigid caste system, the two have an affair which results in a son. But it soon becomes clear that Subhadra loves the character Arjuna from his stage performances, and not Kunhikuttan the artist. More in love with the valiant, noble hero of the Mahabharata, than the lower-caste dancer Kunhikuttan, she rejects him and refuses to let him see his son. Denied access to his son, and rejected by his father, Kunhikuttan returns to the stage, leaving behind his hero roles to play demonic characters, reaching within the dark corners of his mind, becoming increasingly resentful and full of anger, until one last dance which brings the feature to a stunning end Subhadraharanam.

Her life was purportedly described, with adaptations to protect her anonymity, in 1973 in the book Sybil, subtitled The True Story of a Woman Possessed by 16 Separate Personalities. Two films of the same name were made, one released in 1976 and the other in 2007. Both the book and the films used the name Sybil Isabel Dorsett to protect Mason's identity, though the 2007 remake stated Mason's name at its conclusion. Mason's diagnosis and treatment under Cornelia B. Wilbur have been criticized, with allegations that Wilbur manipulated or possibly misdiagnosed Mason. Biography Mason was born and raised in Dodge Center, Minnesota, the only surviving child of Walter Wingfield Mason (a carpenter and architect) and Martha Alice \\"Mattie\\" Atkinson. In regard to Mason's mother: \\"...many people in Dodge Center say Mattie\\" ‚Äî \\"Hattie\\" in the book ‚Äî \\"was bizarre,\\" according to Bettie Borst Christensen, who grew up across the street. \\"She had a witch- like laugh....She didn't laugh much, but when she did, it was like a screech.\\" Christensen remembers Mason's mother walking around after dark, looking in the neighbors' windows. At one point, Martha Mason was reportedly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Mason graduated from Dodge Center High School in 1941 and became an art student at Mankato State College, now Minnesota State University, Mankato. In the early 1950s, Mason was a substitute teacher and a student at Columbia University. She had long suffered from blackouts and emotional breakdowns, and finally entered psychotherapy with Cornelia B. Wilbur, a Freudian psychiatrist. Their sessions together are the basis of the book. From 1970-71, she taught art at Rio Grande College in Rio Grande, Ohio (now the University of Rio Grande). Some people in Mason's home town, reading the book, recognized Mason as Sybil. By that time, Mason had severed nearly all ties with her past and was living in West Virginia. She later moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where she lived near Wilbur. She taught art classes at a community college and ran an art gallery out of her home for many years. Wilbur diagnosed Mason with breast cancer in 1990, and she declined treatment; it later went into remission. The following year, Wilbur developed Parkinson's disease, and Mason moved into Wilbur's house to take care of her until Wilbur's death in 1992. Mason was a devout Seventh-day Adventist. When her breast cancer returned Mason gave away her books and paintings to friends. She left the rest of her estate to a Seventh-day Adventist TV minister. Mason died on February 26, 1998. Over one hundred paintings were found locked in a closet in Mason's Lexington home when it was being emptied after her estate sale. These paintings, often referred to as the ‚ÄúHidden Paintings‚Äù, span the years 1943, eleven years before starting psychotherapy with Dr. Wilbur, to 1965, the year of her successful integration. Several of the paintings were signed by Shirley, however many remained unsigned, and include examples of some of the artwork presumably created by, and signed by the alternate personalities. Sybil Flora Rheta Schreiber's non-fiction book Sybil: The True Story of a Woman Possessed by 16 Separate Personalities told a version of Mason's story with names and details changed to protect her anonymity. The book, whose veracity was challenged (e.g., Sybil Exposed by Debbie Nathan), stated that Mason had multiple personalities as a result of severe child sexual abuse at the hands of her mother, who, Wilbur believed, had schizophrenia. The book was made into a highly acclaimed TV movie starring Sally Field and Joanne Woodward, in 1976. The TV movie was remade in 2007 with Tammy Blanchard and Jessica Lange. Controversy Mason's diagnosis had been challenged. Psychiatrist Herbert Spiegel saw Mason for several sessions while Wilbur was on vacation and felt that Wilbur was manipulating Mason into behaving as though she had multiple personalities when she did not. Spiegel suspected Wilbur of having publicized Mason's case for financial gain. According to Spiegel, Wilbur's client was a hysteric but did not show signs of multiple personalities; in fact, he later stated that Mason denied to him that she was \\"multiple\\" but claimed that Wilbur wanted her to exhibit other personalities. Spiegel confronted Wilbur, who responded that the publisher would not publish the book unless it was what she said it was. The Making of a Disease abstract, nybooks.com; accessed November 1, 2015. Spiegel revealed that he possessed audio tapes in which Wilbur tells Mason about some of the other personalities she has already seen in prior sessions. Spiegel believes these tapes are the \\"smoking gun\\" proving that Wilbur induced her client to believe she was multiple. Spiegel made these claims 24 years later, after Schreiber, Wilbur and Mason had all died and he was finally asked about the topic. In August 1998, psychologist Robert Rieber of John Jay College of Criminal Justice stated that the tapes belonged to him and that Wilbur had given them to him decades earlier. He cited the tapes to challenge Mason's diagnosis. Rieber had never interviewed or treated Mason but asserted that she was an \\"extremely suggestible hysteric.\\" He claimed Wilbur had manipulated Mason in order to secure a book deal. In a review of Rieber's book, psychiatrist Mark Lawrence asserts that Rieber repeatedly distorted the evidence and left out a number of important facts about Mason's case to advance his case against the validity of the diagnosis. Debbie Nathan's Sybil Exposed draws upon an archive of Schreiber's papers stored at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and other first-hand sources. Nathan claims that Wilbur, Mason, and Schreiber knowingly perpetrated a fraud and describes the purported manipulation of Wilbur by Mason and vice versa and that the case created an \\"industry\\" of repressed memory. Nathan hypothesizes that Mason's physical and sensory issues may have been due to untreated pernicious anemia, the symptoms of which were mistaken at the time for psychogenic issues. She notes that after Mason was treated with calf's-liver supplements for chronic blood disorders as a child and young woman, her psychological symptoms likewise went into remission for years at a time, and that Wilbur herself noted that \\"Sybil\\" suffered from pernicious anemia later in life. Nathan's writing and her research methods have been publicly criticized by Mason's family and by Dr. Patrick Suraci, who was personally acquainted with Shirley Mason. In addition, Suraci claims that Spiegel behaved unethically in withholding tapes which supposedly proved Wilbur had induced Mason to believe she had multiple personalities. Spiegel also claimed to have made films of himself hypnotizing Mason, supposedly proving that Wilbur had \\"implanted false memories\\" in her mind, but when Suraci asked to see the films Spiegel said he had lost them.Patrick Suraci, Sybil In Her Own Words: The Untold Story of Shirley Mason, Her Multiple Personalities and Paintings. Abandoned Ladder, 2011.Patrick Suraci, \\"Sybil In Her Own Words\\", Review of Sybil Exposed with commentary about Nathan and Spiegel, Huffington Post, December 15, 2011. Although Wilbur's papers were destroyed, copies and excerpts within Flora Rheta Schreiber's papers at the Lloyd Sealy Library of John Jay College were unsealed in 1998. In 2013, Nancy Preston published After Sybil, a personal memoir which includes facsimile reproductions of Mason's personal letters to her, along with color plates of her paintings. According to Preston, Mason taught art at Ohio's Rio Grande College, where Preston was a student. The two became close friends and corresponded until a few days before Mason's death. In the letters, Mason claimed that she had had multiple personalities.Nancy Preston, After Sybil: From the Letters of Shirley Mason. Infinity, 2013.

It was established in 1926 when Crompton House was donated by a prominent local land owner, Mary Crompton, to the Church of England to be used as a school. The school has expanded over the years as its reputation and achievements have increased along with the size of its intake. The school is but mainly funded by fee paying students or by donations and events; some money is provided by the Anglican Diocese of Manchester. The school is affiliated therefore with the Church of England, and younger pupils are required to attend the Anglican church in order to be admitted to the school, although this is subject to change given the additional 112 pupils per year for the 2018 intake, However this is not the case for the sixth form, admission to which is based on secular grounds. The school has proposed expansion plans, with planning consolation currently underway, expected to increase staff from the current 100 teachers and the total number of students by 50% from 1120 students to 1680 students for the 2018 intake. (an additional 112 places per year group in year 7 to year 11) The buildings are currently made up of a number of 19th-century buildings and modern extensions, although a potential redesigns are currently underway to allow the accommodation of the additional 560 students. History Crompton House, much like Crompton Hall, was originally a primary dwelling of the Crompton family, who since the Norman Conquest had a majority land ownership of Shaw and Crompton. Following the death and subsequent dissipation of the Crompton family line, Crompton House was donated in 1926 by Miss Mary Crompton and her cousin, Mrs Anne Ormerod on the understanding it would become a school with a strong Christian ethos. The then Dean of Manchester, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, declared open the new Higher Grade Church School to be known as Crompton House School on 29 September and the first 25 pupils were admitted on 1 October. From the beginning its relatively small size enabled the care of every child to be the concern of all the teaching staff. Now a co-educational, voluntary aided secondary school catering for about 1400 pupils with an established sixth-form, that same care remains the guiding spirit of the school community. Over the years additions have been made to the original buildings. These include a separate Year 11 block, a modern craft building, new science laboratories and new sixth-form accommodation. A new block of classrooms and science laboratories was officially opened in October 1994, and is colloquially referred to as The new block. More recently, a block of ten new classrooms has been opened. A drama studio has also been built due to the school's Arts status. Whilst this is a Church of England school, when available the school will also offer places to children from other Christian denominations, though due to the popularity of the school this is increasingly unlikely. The official position of the school is to believe strongly that a Christian school exists to serve the needs of the local, and wider communities. The school is also a Post-Graduate Teacher Training Centre, and since September 1998 has Beacon status. Crompton House was awarded Specialist School Status in 2005 as an Arts College (Music, Art and Drama). Pastoral care Crompton House uses a house system. All pupils are in mixed year group houses, which include Cocker, Crompton, Ormerod and Ridley. These House names are the surnames of individuals who have contributed to the creation of Crompton House as a school. Expansion 2018/2019 Crompton House is currently undergoing an expansion process , with a planning application to create a new three-storey building to allow an increase of 50% (560 pupils), details of the current planning application can be found on the Oldham Councils Website. Given the need for additional pupils is due to international immigration (source Oldham Council Future Education Provision), a change to the admissions policy is also anticipated. Musical achievements The music department of the school has a variety of groups including two orchestras, swing and brass bands, and several choirs. The senior orchestra played at the Royal Albert Hall in London as part of the Schools Proms in 2005,www.tda.gov.uk TDA web page. Retrieved 14 October 2007 and the Senior Choir has sung in venues such as Manchester Cathedral, York Minster, and Liverpool Cathedral. The choir has sung evensong in Westminster Abbey, and the Boys' Choir has sung in St Asaph Cathedral.www.tes.co.uk Times educational supplement web page. Retrieved 14 October 2007 On 2 July 2010 the orchestra, brass band and choirs combined to perform Karl Jenkin's The Armed Man at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Sixth form Crompton House has its own sixth form, which itself performs at a high national standard. The majority of pupils in the sixth form at Crompton House have continued from the compulsory education there. However, approximately 40 pupils from other schools in the surrounding area join the sixth form each year. Unlike years 7‚Äì11, there are no criteria for selection based on religion. There are a number of subjects available at AS-level and A-level to study at Crompton House. These are: Art and Design, Biology, Business Studies, Chemistry, Design Technology, Economics, English Language, English Language and Literature, English Literature, Food and Nutrition, French, General Studies, Geography, Government and Politics, German, History, ICT, Mathematics, Multimedia, Music, Physical Education, Physics, Psychology, Sociology, Theatre Studies, Philosophy & Ethics, and Travel and Tourism. =Old Cromptonians= *Ian Greaves, football player and manager * Ben Pearson, football player at Preston North End * Michelle Marsh, glamour model * Anna Friel, actress * Clive Rowe MBE, actor * Jessica Fullalove, GB swimmer =Staff= * Musician John Lees, music technician until July 2012.

Around 200 pupils had to be evacuated from the new block while the rest of the school stayed inside, well away from danger. In a panic the student ran from his Chemistry lesson which was being taught by Dr Midgley and placed it down a grid. Greater Manchester Police, along with the bomb disposal unit, confirmed the grenade was inactive and the school was back to normal in the afternoon. The pupil involved was suspended for a fixed term.

Dysart, Jr. invented the Negative Volume Index and Positive Volume Index indicators. The indicators remain useful to identify primary market trends and reversals. In 1936, Paul L. Dysart, Jr. began accumulating two series of advances and declines distinguished by whether volume was greater or lesser than the prior day's volume. He called the cumulative series for the days when volume had been greater than the prior day's volume the Positive Volume Index (PVI), and the series for the days when volume had been lesser the Negative Volume Index (NVI). A native of Iowa, Dysart worked in Chicago's LaSalle Street during the 1920s. After giving up his Chicago Board of Trade membership, he published an advisory letter geared to short-term trading using advance-decline data. In 1933, he launched the Trendway weekly stock market letter and published it until 1969 when he died. Dysart also developed the 25-day Plurality Index, the 25-day total of the absolute difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of declining issues, and was a pioneer in using several types of volume of trading studies. Richard Russell, editor of Dow Theory Letters, in his January 7, 1976 letter called Dysart \\"one of the most brilliant of the pioneer market technicians.\\" Dysart‚Äôs NVI and PVI The daily volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NYSE Composite Index's advances and declines drove Dysart's indicators. Dysart believed that ‚Äúvolume is the driving force in the market.‚Äù He began studying market breadth numbers in 1931, and was familiar with the work of Leonard P. Ayres and James F. Hughes, who pioneered the tabulation of advances and declines to interpret stock market movements. Dysart calculated NVI as follows: 1) if today's volume is less than yesterday's volume, subtract declines from advances, 2) add the difference to the cumulative NVI beginning at zero, and 3) retain the current NVI reading for the days when volume is greater than the prior day's volume. He calculated PVI in the same manner but for the days when volume was greater than the prior day's volume. NVI and PVI can be calculated daily or weekly. Initially, Dysart believed that PVI would be the more useful series, but in 1967, he wrote that NVI had ‚Äúproved to be the most valuable of all the breadth indexes.‚Äù He relied most on NVI, naming it AMOMET, the acronym of ‚ÄúA Measure Of Major Economic Trend.‚Äù Dysart's theory, expressed in his 1967 Barron's article, was that ‚Äúif volume advances and prices move up or down in accordance [with volume], the move is assumed to be a good movement - if it is sustained when the volume subsides.‚Äù In other words, after prices have moved up on positive volume days, \\"if prices stay up when the volume subsides for a number of days, we can say that such a move is 'good'.\\" If the market ‚Äúholds its own on negative volume days after advancing on positive volume, the market is in a strong position.‚Äù He called PVI the ‚Äúmajority‚Äù curve. Dysart distinguished between the actions of the ‚Äúmajority‚Äù and those of the ‚Äúminority.‚Äù The majority tends to emulate the minority, but its timing is not as sharp as that of the minority. When the majority showed an appetite for stocks, the PVI was usually ‚Äúinto new high ground‚Äù as happened in 1961. It is said that the two indicators assume that \\"smart\\" money is traded on quiet days (low volume) and that the crowd trades on very active days. Therefore, the negative volume index picks out days when the volume is lower than on the previous day, and the positive index picks out days with a higher volume. Dysart‚Äôs Interpretation of NVI and PVI Besides an article he wrote for Barron's in 1967, not many of Dysart's writings are available. What can be interpreted about Dysart's NVI is that whenever it rises above a prior high, and the DJIA is trending up, a ‚ÄúBull Market Signal‚Äù is given. When the NVI falls below a prior low, and the DJIA is trending down, a ‚ÄúBear Market Signal‚Äù is given. The PVI is interpreted in reverse. However, not all movements above or below a prior NVI or PVI level generate signals, as Dysart also designated ‚Äúbullish‚Äù and ‚Äúbearish penetrations.‚Äù These penetrations could occur before or after a Bull or Bear Market Signal, and at times were called ‚Äúreaffirmations‚Äù of a signal. In 1969, he articulated one rule: ‚Äúsignals are most authentic when the NVI has moved sideways for a number of months in a relatively narrow range.‚Äù Dysart cautioned that ‚Äúthere is no mathematical system devoid of judgment which will continuously work without error in the stock market.‚Äù According to Dysart, between 1946 and 1967, the NVI ‚Äúrendered 17 significant signals,‚Äù of which 14 proved to be right (an average of 4.32% from the final high or low) and 3 wrong (average loss of 6.33%). However, NVI ‚Äúseriously erred‚Äù in 1963-1964 and in 1968, which concerned him. In 1969, Dysart reduced the weight he had previously given to the NVI in his analyses because NVI was no longer a ‚Äúdecisive‚Äù indicator of the primary trend, although it retained an ‚Äúexcellent ability to give us ‚Äòleading‚Äô indications of short-term trend reversals.‚Äù A probable reason for the NVI losing its efficacy during the mid-1960s may have been the steadily higher NYSE daily volume due to the dramatic increase in the number of issues traded so that prices rose on declining volume. Dysart‚Äôs NVI topped out in 1955 and trended down until at least 1968, although the DJIA moved higher during that period. Norman G. Fosback has attributed the ‚Äúlong term increase in the number of issues traded‚Äù as a reason for a downward bias in a cumulative advance-decline line. Fosback was the next influential technician in the story of NVI and PVI. Fosback‚Äôs Variations Fosback studied NVI and PVI and in 1976 reported his findings in his classic Stock Market Logic. He did not elucidate on the indicators‚Äô background or mentioned Dysart except for saying that ‚Äúin the past Negative Volume Indexes have always [his emphasis] been constructed using advance-decline data‚Ä¶.‚Äù He posited, ‚ÄúThere is no good reason for this fixation on the A/D Line. In truth, a Negative Volume Index can be calculated with any market index - the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P; 500, or even ‚Äòunweighted‚Äô market measures.... Somehow this point has escaped the attention of technicians to date.‚Äù The point had not been lost on Dysart, who wrote in Barron‚Äôs, ‚Äúwe prefer to use the issues-traded data [advances and declines] rather than the price data of any average because it is more all-encompassing, and more truly represents what‚Äôs happening in the entire market.‚Äù Dysart was a staunch proponent of using advances and declines. Fosback made three variations to NVI and PVI: 1\\\\. He cumulated the daily percent change in the market index rather than the difference between advances and declines. On negative volume days, he calculated the price change in the index from the prior day and added it to the most recent NVI. His calculations are as follows: If Ct and Cy denote the closing prices of today and yesterday, respectively, the NVI for today is calculated by * adding NVIyesterday (Ct \\\\- Cy) / Cy to yesterday's NVI if today's volume is lower than yesterday's, adding zero otherwise, and the PVI is calculated by: * adding PVIyesterday (Ct \\\\- Cy) / Cy to yesterday's PVI if today's volume is higher than yesterday's, adding zero otherwise. 2\\\\. He suggested starting the cumulative count at a base index level such as 100. 3\\\\. He derived buy or sell signals by whether the NVI or PVI was above or below its one-year moving average. Fosback's versions of NVI and PVI are what are popularly described in books and posted on Internet financial sites. Often reported are his findings that whenever NVI is above its one-year moving average there is a 96% (PVI - 79%) probability that a bull market is in progress, and when it is below its one-year moving average, there is a 53% (PVI - 67%) probability that a bear market is in place. These results were derived using a 1941-1975 test period. Modern tests might reveal different probabilities. Today, NVI and PVI are commonly associated with Fosback's versions, and Dysart, their inventor, is forgotten. It cannot be said that one version is better than the other. While Fosback provided a more objective interpretation of these indicators, Dysart's versions offer value to identify primary trends and short-term trend reversals. Although some traders use Fosback's NVI and PVI to analyze individual stocks, the indicators were created to track, and have been tested, on major market indexes. NVI was Dysart's most invaluable breadth index, and Fosback found that his version of ‚Äúthe Negative Volume Index is an excellent indicator of the primary market trend.‚Äù Traders can benefit from both innovations.

Dollar cost averaging is also called the constant dollar plan (in the US), pound-cost averaging (in the UK), and, irrespective of currency, unit cost averaging, incremental trading, or the cost average effect.:de:Durchschnittskosteneffekt, Retrieved 2009-01-12 By dividing the total sum to be invested in the market (e.g., $100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular intervals (e.g., $1,000 per week over 100 weeks), DCA seeks to reduce the risk of incurring a substantial loss resulting from investing the entire lump sum just before a fall in the market. Dollar cost averaging is not always the most profitable way to invest a large sum, but it is alleged to minimize downside risk. The technique is said to work in markets undergoing temporary declines because it exposes only part of the total sum to the decline. The technique is so called because of its potential for reducing the average cost of shares bought. As the number of shares that can be bought for a fixed amount of money varies inversely with their price, DCA effectively leads to more shares being purchased when their price is low and fewer when they are expensive. As a result, DCA possibly can lower the total average cost per share of the investment, giving the investor a lower overall cost for the shares purchased over time.Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor Professional Designation Program, College for Financial Planners, Volume 9, page 64 However, there is also evidence against DCA. Finance journalist Dan Kadlec of Time summarized the relevant research in 2012, writing: \\"The superior long-term returns of lump sum investing [over DCA] have been acknowledged for more than 30 years.\\"Kadlac, Dan. Is Dollar Cost Averaging Dumb? Time, Nov. 15, 2012, accessed 11 October 2016 Similarly, decades of empirical research on DCA have found that it generally does not function as promoted and is usually a sub-optimal investment strategy.John Knight and Lewis Mandell, ‚ÄúNobody Gains from Dollar Cost Averaging: Analytical, Numerical and Empirical Results,‚Äù Financial Services Review, 2(1), pp. 51-61, 1992 Some investment advisors who acknowledge the sub-optimality of DCA nevertheless advocate it as a behavioral tool that makes it easier for some investors to start investing a lump sum. They contrast the relative benefits of DCA versus never investing the lump sum.https://blog.wealthfront.com/dollar-cost- averaging-behavioral-view/ Parameters In dollar cost averaging, the investor decides on two parameters: the fixed amount of money to invest each time and the time horizon over which all of the investments are made. With a shorter time horizon, the strategy behaves more like lump sum investing. One study found that the best time horizon when investing in the stock market in terms of balancing return and risk is 6 or 12 months. One key component of maximizing profits is to include the strategy of buying during a downtrending market, using a scaled formula to buy more as the price falls; then, as the trend shifts to a higher-priced market, to use a scaled plan to sell. Using this strategy, one can profit from the relationship between the value of a currency and a commodity or stock.  Return  Assuming that the same amount of money is invested each time, the return from dollar cost averaging on the total money invested is r = \\\\frac{p_F}{\\\\tilde{p}_P} - 1, where p_F is the final price of the investment and \\\\tilde{p}_P is the harmonic mean of the purchase prices. If the time between purchases is small compared to the investment period, then \\\\tilde{p}_P can be estimated by the harmonic mean of all the prices within the purchase period. Criticism The pros and cons of DCA have long been a subject for debate among both commercial and academic specialists in investment strategies.Explaining the riddle of dollar cost averaging Hayley, S Cass Business School report 2010 While some financial advisors, such as Suze Orman, claim that DCA reduces exposure to certain forms of financial risk associated with making a single large purchase, others, such as Timothy Middleton, claim DCA is nothing more than a marketing gimmick and not a sound investment strategy. The financial costs and benefits of DCA have also been examined in many studies using real market data, typically revealing that the strategy does not deliver on its promises and is not an ideal investment strategy.Knight, J.R. and Mandell, L. Nobody Gains From Dollar Cost Averaging: Analytical, Numerical And Empirical Results. Financial Services Review, Vol. 2, Issue 1 (1992/93 pp. 51-61Greenhut, J.G. Mathematical Illusion: Why Dollar-Cost Averaging Does Not Work. Journal of Financial Planning, Vol. 19, Issue 10 (October 2006), pp. 76-83Constantinides, G.M. A Note on the Suboptimality of Dollar-Cost Averaging as an Investment Policy. The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Jun., 1979), pp. 443-450 Recent research has highlighted the behavioural economic aspects of DCA, which allows investors to make a trade-off between the regret caused by not making the most of a rising market and that caused by investing into a falling market, which are known to be asymmetric. University of Buffalo report Middleton claims that DCA helps investors enter the market, investing more over time than they might otherwise be willing to do all at once. Others supporting the strategy suggest the aim of DCA is to invest a set amount, the same amount one would have had one invested a lump sum. Confusion Dollar cost averaging is not the same thing as continuous, automatic investing. This confusion of terms is perpetuated by some articles (AARP, Motley Fool) and specifically noted by others (Vanguard, clarified in a later paper). The argued weakness of DCA arises in the context of having the option to invest a lump sum, but choosing to use DCA instead. If the market is expected to trend upward over time, DCA can conversely be expected to face a statistical headwind: the investor is choosing to invest at a future time rather than today, even though future prices are expected to be higher. But most individual investors, especially in the context of retirement investing, never face a choice between lump-sum investing and DCA investing with a significant amount of money. The disservice arises when these investors take the criticisms of DCA to mean that timing the market is better than continuously and automatically investing a portion of their income as they earn it. For example, stopping one's retirement investment contributions during a declining market on account of the argued weaknesses of DCA would indicate a misunderstanding of those arguments. Continuous automatic investment is more like lump-sum investing in that the investor invests the funds as soon as they are available, in contrast to DCA where the investor withholds available fund from the market. The weakness of DCA investing applies when considering the investment of a large lump sum; DCA would postpone investing most of that sum until later dates. Given that the historical market value of a balanced portfolio has increased over time, starting today tends to be better than waiting until tomorrow. However, for the average retirement investor's situation, where only small sums are available at any given time, the historical market trend would support a policy of continuous, automatic investing without regard to market direction.

Because she came from an honored lineage (originally on par with Former Yan's imperial clan, the Murongs), she did not respect Murong Jun (Emperor Jingzhao)'s wife Empress Kezuhun, and Empress Kezuhun despised her greatly. In 358, perhaps at her instigation, the eunuch Nie Hao (Ê∂ÖÊµ©) falsely accused Princess Duan of witchcraft. Murong Jun had her and her alleged coconspirator, Murong Chui's assistant Gao Bi (È´òÂºº), arrested. Princess Duan and Gao were tortured, but they refused to admit the charges of witchcraft, and because of this the torture was intensified. Murong Chui was saddened by his wife's suffering, and he sent her a message trying to persuade her to end her suffering by admitting to the charge (and thus end the torture but be sentenced to death). Princess Duan remarked: As she was interrogated, Princess Duan replied logically and openly, and Murong Chui was able to avoid being dragged into the case, but she still died in prison, either from the torture or a secret execution. Murong Chui subsequently married her sister, and then her niece Duan Yuanfei as his wife. In 388, after he had established Later Yan, he posthumously honored her as Empress Chengzhao.

March in the Eastern Orthodox calendar ","title":"March 12 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)"},{"id":"4003614","text":"Multiscale modeling or multiscale mathematics is the field of solving problems which have important features at multiple scales of time and/or space. Important problems include multiscale modeling of fluids, solids, polymers, proteins, nucleic acids as well as various physical and chemical phenomena (like adsorption, chemical reactions, diffusion). History Horstemeyer 2009, 2012 presented a historical review of the different disciplines (mathematics, physics, and materials science) for solid materials related to multiscale materials modeling. The aforementioned DOE multiscale modeling efforts were hierarchical in nature. The first concurrent multiscale model occurred when Michael Ortiz (Caltech) took the molecular dynamics code, Dynamo, (developed by Mike Baskes at Sandia National Labs) and with his students embedded it into a finite element code for the first time. Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt, Arieh Warshel 2013 were awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of a multiscale model method using both classical and quantum mechanical theory which were used to model large complex chemical systems and reactions. Areas of research In physics and chemistry, multiscale modeling is aimed to calculation of material properties or system behavior on one level using information or models from different levels. On each level particular approaches are used for description of a system. The following levels are usually distinguished: level of quantum mechanical models (information about electrons is included), level of molecular dynamics models (information about individual atoms is included), coarse-grained models (information about atoms and/or groups of atoms is included), mesoscale or nano level (information about large groups of atoms and/or molecule positions is included), level of continuum models, level of device models. Each level addresses a phenomenon over a specific window of length and time. Multiscale modeling is particularly important in integrated computational materials engineering since it allows the prediction of material properties or system behavior based on knowledge of the process-structure- property relationships. In operations research, multiscale modeling addresses challenges for decision makers which come from multiscale phenomena across organizational, temporal and spatial scales. This theory fuses decision theory and multiscale mathematics and is referred to as multiscale decision-making. Multiscale decision-making draws upon the analogies between physical systems and complex man-made systems. In meteorology, multiscale modeling is the modeling of interaction between weather systems of different spatial and temporal scales that produces the weather that we experience. The most challenging task is to model the way through which the weather systems interact as models cannot see beyond the limit of the model grid size. In other words, to run an atmospheric model that is having a grid size (very small ~ ) which can see each possible cloud structure for the whole globe is computationally very expensive. On the other hand, a computationally feasible Global climate model (GCM), with grid size ~ , cannot see the smaller cloud systems. So we need to come to a balance point so that the model becomes computationally feasible and at the same time we do not lose much information, with the help of making some rational guesses, a process called Parametrization. Besides the many specific applications, one area of research is methods for the accurate and efficient solution of multiscale modeling problems. The primary areas of mathematical and algorithmic development include: *Analytical modeling *Center manifold and slow manifold theory *Continuum modeling *Discrete modeling *Network-based modeling *Statistical modeling See also * Computational mechanics * Equation-free modeling * Integrated computational materials engineering * Multiphysics * Multiresolution analysis * Space mapping References Further reading  External links * Mississippi State University ICME Cyberinfrastructure * Multiscale Modeling of Flow Flow * Multiscale Modeling of Materials (MMM- Tools) Project at Dr. Martin Steinhauser's group at the Fraunhofer-Institute for High-Speed Dynamics, Ernst-Mach-Institut, EMI, at Freiburg, Germany.

He served on the High Council in the Salt Lake Park Stake. In his later years, despite poor health, he completed a mission with his wife in the Norway Oslo Mission. He lost his ability to hear due to spinal meningitis. He married Vynola Dean Kernell on June 6, 1946 and later divorced. He married Madelaine Peterson Burton on December 27, 1976.

Founded by Adam Weishaupt in Bavaria in 1776, the Illuminati have been referred to in popular culture, in books and comics, television and films, and games. A number of novelists, playwrights and composers are alleged to have been Illuminati members and to have reflected this in their work. Early conspiracy theories surrounding the Illuminati have inspired various creative works, and continue to do so.  Books and Comics  * Gothic literature had a particular interest in the theme of the Illuminati. The Cambridge Companion to Gothic Fiction states that readers had a \\"scandalous vogue for German tales of the Illuminati.\\"Hogle, Jerrold E. The Cambridge Companion to Gothic Fiction. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. . pp. 51‚Äì55 The Illuminati have a role in Horrid Mysteries, as in Montague Summers' introduction to a later reprint of it. The Illuminati also turn up in two spoofs of the gothic genre, which both also reference Horrid Mysteries, Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen and Nightmare Abbey by Thomas Love Peacock.Gothic immortals: the fiction of the brotherhood of the rosy cross by Marie Mulvey Roberts, passim. * A number of writers have pointed out Mary Shelley's familiarity with the early anti- Illuminati text, Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism (1797-98), due to Percy Bysshe Shelley's enthusiasm for it. They describe the Memoirs influence in Frankenstein, and point to Frankenstein's monster as an amalgam of Shelley's Illuminati-influenced ideas as well as of the Illuminati itself, with the monster being created in Ingolstadt, where the Illuminati had been formed.Roberts.Baldick, Chris. In Frankenstein's Shadow: Myth, Monstrosity, and Nineteenth-century Writing, . p.36Mary Shelley: Her Life, Her Fiction, Her Monsters, Anne K. Mellor, pp. 73, 83‚Äì84. * The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson is a three-book science fiction series published in the 1970s, which is regarded as a cult classic particularly in the hacker community. An incomplete comic book version of the Illuminatus! was produced and published by Eye-n-Apple Productions and Rip Off Press between 1987 and 1991. A nine-hour theatrical adaptation was produced by Ken Campbell. * Robert Anton Wilson also published Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati in 1977, The Illuminati Papers in 1980, Masks of the Illuminati in 1981, and The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles in the 1980s and 1991. * Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum is a labyrinthine 1988 novel about all sorts of secret societies, including the Illuminati and the Rosicrucians.\\"Foucault's Pendulum (review)\\", New York, 6 November 1989, p. 120 * Fallen Angels by Bernard Cornwell (under the pseudonym Susannah Kells) (1984). A love story set in the shadow of the Paris revolutionary guillotine and the grounds of Lazender Castle in England. The Illuminati plot to bring revolution to England is a central thread. * Angels & Demons (German title: Illuminati), Dan Brown's 2000 precursor to 2003's The Da Vinci Code, is about an apparent Illuminati order plot to destroy its enemy the Catholic Church by using antimatter to blow up the Vatican while Papal elections are being held. In this novel the Illuminati movement was founded by Galileo Galilei, and others, as an enlightened reaction to persecution by the Catholic Church. They were initially based in Italy, but fled after four key members were executed by the Vatican. Apparently there are four churches to them in Rome, each representing one of the four elements. In actual fact, the Illuminati are indeed defunct and the events of the book are orchestrated as part of an elaborate scheme by its central antagonist.Dice, Mark (2005). The Resistance Manifesto, The Resistance, San Diego, , p. 305 This is also the plot of the film of the same name. Simon Cox, writer of Cracking the Davinci Code, also wrote the book Illuminating Angels and Demons, in which he explains the facts behind the pagan signs and secret societies in Angels & Demons. * In Michael Romkey vampire novels, the Illuminati are an order of benevolent vampires, consisting of many famous figures throughout history (Beethoven, Mozart, etc.). The main character, David Parker, joins the order, but later leaves.Altner, Patricia (1998) Vampire Readings: An Annotated Bibliography, Scarecrow Press, , p. 60 * In Larry Burkett's book The Illuminati, \\"The Society\\" seeks world power.The new inquisitions: heretic-hunting and the intellectual origins of modern totalitarianism By Arthur Versluis, pp. 121‚Äì122. * In War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, Count Pierre Bezukhov, a Freemason, is accused of attempting to introduce the ideals of Illuminism to his lodge. *In Kazue Kato's manga Blue Exorcist, the Illuminati are a secret organization that oppose the True Cross Order (an organization of exorcists that specializes in killing demons) and, by extension, the Vatican itself, which controls the Order. Their goal is to merge the world of humans and world of demons so that Satan, the king of all demons, can rule over the new world order. *The Illuminati are a fictional group of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The characters joined forces and secretly work behind the scenes. The Illuminati was established to exist (via story retcon) in their first published appearance in New Avengers #7 (July 2005), written by Brian Michael Bendis. Their history was discussed in the special New Avengers: Illuminati (May 2006). The group was revealed to have been formed very shortly after the Kree-Skrull War. Television and film * In Simon West's 2001 film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, a group of high-society villains call themselves Illuminati, developing a plan to rule the world.

They are most prominent in the Street Fighter III games as a crime organisation similar to Shadaloo. *The Illuminati frequently appears in the cyberpunk Role-playing video game Deus Ex game series as a major faction. **In the first Deus Ex, the Illuminati was almost destroyed in an inside coup by their own research division Majestic 12. The events of the game are part of a power struggle between the Illuminati, Majestic-12 and other factions attempting to secretly take over the world. **In Deus Ex: Invisible War, the Illuminati was successfully revived after \\"the Collapse\\", an event which saw the destruction of the world telecommunication infrastructures. The Illuminati created and secretly controls two competing factions that rose in the post-collapse world: the hyper-capitalist World Trade Organization and a transdenominational church called \\"The Order Church\\", in order to better control society through social division. **In Deus Ex: Human Revolution, the protagonist Adam Jensen discovers the Illumanati were behind many of the game's events, attempting to control the spread of \\"augmentations\\", advanced artificial organs capable of greatly improving and enhancing the human body's performance.  Music  Many fans of modern African-American music, especially hip hop music, believe that an Illuminati conspiracy is active in its production and marketing. The methods and motives of the conspiracy, and its relation to the Bavarian order, are matters of speculation that change with each telling. Some artists, such as Jay-Z and Kanye West, are believed to be agents of the conspiracy who leave hints to their listeners through lyrics, eye of providence handsigns or other signals. Conspiracy literature involving the Illuminati has been cited in the lyrics of several hip hop artists. Milton William Cooper's Behold a Pale Horse is one such work that both Nas and Public Enemy have made reference to. Other such conspiracy books circulate in African-American communities, where both artists and listeners encounter them. Aside from this, the \\"Illuminati\\" are invoked to explain why some artists become rich and famous, some die suddenly, and others go unnoticed.

Although the sisters are skeptical, there is much talk of a long-hoped-for trip to Europe for the two sisters. In fact, Julian has money from a real estate deal that he pulled off with the help of Charlotte Warkins, a former lover, who is now in an abusive marriage. Carrie is obsessed with her brother. Her jealousy, deriving from her sublimated incestuous desires for her brother, is aimed at Lily. Carrie tricks Lily into informing Charlotte's husband of a rendezvous between Charlotte and Julian, at which Julian was to give Charlotte her half of the money, and Charlotte then was going to leave her husband and flee town. Charlotte's husband sends thugs who beat up Julian, maim Charlotte, and take both halves of the money. Julian discovers that Carrie manipulated Lily into making the phone call to Charlotte's husband by convincing Lily that Julian and Charlotte were going to leave together. After Carrie hurls insults at Julian and Anna, telling them they will both be failures, both leave the house. Julian finds and reconciles with Lily, and Anna leaves for Europe. Carrie is left alone, deluding herself into thinking they both will return one day.

Early life and education  Baca was born in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, in 1952. Abandoned by his parents at the age of two, he lived with one of his grandmothers for several years before being placed in an orphanage. At the age of 13 he ran away and wound up living on the streets. When he was twenty-one he was convicted on charges of drug possession and incarcerated. He served six and a half years in prison, three of them in isolation, and having expressed a desire to go to school (the guards considered this dangerous), he was put in the same area of the prison with the inmates on death row for a period of time before he was released. During this time, Baca taught himself to read and write, and he began to compose poetry. He sold these poems to fellow inmates in exchange for cigarettes. A fellow inmate convinced him to submit some of his poems to the magazine Mother Jones, then edited by Denise Levertov. Levertov printed Baca's poems and began corresponding with him, eventually finding a publisher for his first book. Career Immigrants in Our Own Land, Baca's first major collection, was published by Louisiana State University Press in 1979. This early collection included \\"I Am Offering This Poem,\\" a poem later reprinted in 1990's Immigrants in Our Own Land and Selected Early Poems and anthologized in The Seagull Book of Poems. In 1987, his semi-autobiographical minor epic in verse, Martin & Meditations on the South Valley, received the American Book Award for poetry, bringing Baca international acclaim and, in 1989, the Hispanic Heritage Award in Literature.

It was not until 2009 when the festival was given its current name, QFest. One of the festival's founders and current Artistic Director, Raymond Murray, stays true to QFest's mission to give gay and lesbian audiences the opportunity to see films that accurately reflect their life experiences without the filter of the \\"straight\\" Hollywood system. The event is the third largest of its kind in the US, and the largest on the East Coast. The festival is held in Center City Philadelphia in various venues near and on the Avenue of the Arts. Film screenings take place at the Prince Music Theater, the Wilma Theater, and several other locations that differ from year to year. It takes place for two weeks annually in mid-July and shows as many as 200 films from more than 40 countries. There is a juried competition for best features and shorts (gay male and lesbian) as well as audience awards, selected by the viewers. In 2014, QFest was canceled for the first year since its founding in 1995. Due to lack of fundraising and the unavailability of Raymond Murray to lead the film programming, the festival was postponed and then canceled for the year. Due to the cancellation of the festival in 2014, Thom Cardwell, QFest head, announced that he would launching qFLIX Philadelphia to take its place. QFLIX was a weeklong festival that did not focus on traditional film, but rather on new media. An event known as \\"There's No Place Like Home\\" is a two-week long celebration that takes place concurrently with QFest. This offers alternate activities for patrons to attend in between and after film screenings. The event is held in celebration of Philadelphia's thriving \\"Gayborhood\\" and has featured a ribbon-cutting ceremony, block parties, photo exhibits and many other special events throughout the festival. TLA had previously hosted an annual lesbian and gay film festival in the 1980s at the two cinemas the company ran in Philadelphia at that time: the TLA on South Street and the Roxy Screening Room on Sansom Street.

The station went on the air in August 1961. The station is currently owned by Golden West Broadcasting, who also own Estevan's two FM stations, CHSN-FM and CKSE-FM. Hockey games involving the senior Big 6 Hockey League are broadcast by the station in the winter, while in the summer the station carries Toronto Blue Jays baseball.  History  CJSL began as a satellite station of Weyburn's CFSL after the Soo Line Broadcasting Company Ltd. applied to use the frequency of 1280 kHz. In August 1961 CJSL signed on the air with a power of 1,000 watts, effectively becoming Estevan's first radio station.

In 1977, CJSL applied to the CRTC to increase full-time power from 1,000 watts to 10,000 watts. The increase was approved in principle by the CRTC, but a final decision was delayed. The delay was caused by concerns from CJME Regina, who then operated at a frequency of 1300 kHz. The power increase was granted in 1978 after an agreement was reached with CJME. In the 1980s, the station became known as \\"Super Country CJSL\\". In 1995, both CJSL and CFSL were sold to Frontier City Broadcasting Company, now known as Golden West Broadcasting.

Goswin was born in Koslar, North-Westphalia (Germany). He studied in Paderborn and Mainz (1611‚Äì1615), where he was promoted priest on 28 October 1614. He was elected Superior-General less than a week after the death of his predecessor Aloysius Gottifredi, on 17 March 1652. During these years the quarrels with the Jansenist theologians were growing more and more acrimonious, especially in France where Blaise Pascal, French scientist, philosopher and Jansenist sympathizer was leading the attack on the Jesuits. The great controversy on the Chinese Rites (1645) continued. Owing to his great age, Father Nickel obtained from the 11th General Congregation the election of Gian Paolo Oliva as vicar-general with right of succession (on 7 June 1661). This was approved by Alexander VII. The German novelist Thomas Mann mentions Nickel in his famous book The Magic Mountain, bringing up a relatively forgotten quote by the Superior-General about love for one's fatherland, which Nickel called \\"a plague with the most certain death of Christian love\\". This notion of Nickel's has already been touched on in the Finnish philosopher Edward Westermark's book The Origin and Development of Moral Ideas, back in 1917. Nickel died in Rome.

His best-known composition is the 1972 choral work African Sanctus.  Life  Fanshawe was born in Paignton in Devon in 1942. His father was an officer in the Royal Artillery who played a central role in the planning of D-Day. His father's stories of military service in India fired Fanshawe's enthusiasm for travel and adventure. His first ambition was to be an explorer, but when he attended St George's School, Windsor Castle and Stowe School he discovered a love of music. His severe dyslexia, however, prevented him from reading a musical score and becoming a chorister. At Stowe School he spent much of his spare time learning to play the piano, and when he was 17 he was discovered by the mother of a school friend, a French baroness who tutored him in the piano even after he left the school in 1959. He started his adult career as a musician and film editor for a small production company in Wimbledon in London who made documentary films. In 1965 Fanshawe won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, where he studied composition under John Lambert. During his holidays he continued to travel widely in Europe and the Middle East. During a summer spent hitchhiking in Afghanistan he heard Islamic music for the first time and was immediately attracted to its beauty. During further travels in Iraq and Bahrain he recorded the traditional music he heard. On completing his studies in 1969, Fanshawe travelled up the Nile from the Mediterranean Sea, visiting Egypt, Sudan, Uganda and Kenya over a three-year period before finally reaching Lake Victoria. He brought a small stereo tape recorder on his journey and would persuade local musicians to play for him. Returning to the United Kingdom in 1972 with several hundreds of hours of recordings made during his travels, Fanshawe used the material to compose what became his best known work, African Sanctus. After this work he became widely known for the composition of choral works. Besides vocal pieces, he also composed the score for films and television,. including films such as Tarka the Otter (1979) and Dirty Weekend (1993), and TV productions such as the BBC's Softly, Softly: Taskforce and When the Boat Comes In and also ITV's The Feathered Serpent, Flambards and The Good Companions. His ethnic field recordings have featured in countless TV documentaries, including Musical Mariner and Tropical Beat, as well as various feature films including Mountains of the Moon, How to Make an American Quilt, Seven Years in Tibet and Gangs of New York.African Sanctus on bellevuechamberchorus.net .Obituary in The Scotsman 12 July 2010. During a ten-year odyssey across the islands of the Pacific Ocean begun in 1978, Fanshawe collected several thousand hours of indigenous music, and documented the music and oral traditions of Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia in journals and photographs. These pieces form the core of his collection, an archive of approximately 2,000 hours of ethnic music and 60,000 images. Pacific Song, a movement based on this material, premiered in Miami in 2007. This was the first completed section of Pacific Odyssey, a new choral work which Fanshawe conceived on a grander scale than African Sanctus. He did not complete the work by the time of his death. The University of the West of England awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Music to Fanshawe in 2007 for his pursuit of musical excellence and for introducing music into lives of people who could neither read nor write music. Fanshawe also earned a Churchill Fellowship and a nomination for an Ivor Novello Award for the recording of African Sanctus. Fanshawe married Judith Croasdell Grant in 1971; they had two children together, Alexander and Rebecca. The marriage was dissolved in 1985. He married his second wife, Jane in 1985, with whom he had a daughter, Rachel. His younger brother is James, a former naval officer. He lived near Ramsbury in Wiltshire in England.

(1944) Biography Wolgamot was not a professional writer; he ran a movie theater for a living. In Sara was published in a very small run financed by the author.Robert Ashley and Keith Waldrop (2001). John Barton Wolgamot, NY: Lovely Music Press, The information normally included in a published book for the era (e.g., mailing address for the publisher, Library of Congress number) was missing. Wolgam ot sent two copies of the book to H.L. Mencken, an influential journalist and critic of the early 20th century, evidently hoping for a positive review. Mencken's brief notes scribbled in one of the books dismissed the poem as \\"balderdash\\". Both copies of In Sara were donated to the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore upon Mencken's 1956 death, along with most of his private library. Wolgamot's work captured the imagination of several young poets and critics when the poem was discovered in a second-hand shop in the 1950s by then-graduate student Keith Waldrop. Waldrop and Robert Ashley tracked down Wolgamot in mid-1973, finding him living in New York City and describing him as \\"an old-fashioned spiffy dresser\\" in his 60s. He had written no further works after In Sara, but named Ashley the executor of his estate in gratitude for bringing his work to wider attention.Ashley & Waldrop, 2001 In a 1980 letter to Waldrop, Wolgamot claimed to be working on a new book but no such book was found among his possessions after Wolgamot's death.

Playing career =Newcastle United= Veitch was born in the Heaton area of Newcastle upon Tyne. At school he was both a gifted scholar and footballer, becoming the first captain of Newcastle Schools in 1895. After enrolling at the city's Rutherford College, Veitch appeared for the College team, regarded at the time as one of the finest amateur teams in North East England, where he attracted the attention of Newcastle United for which he at first signed as an amateur before turning professional in the summer of 1899. Veitch made his debut in October 1899, a match which Newcastle United lost 1‚Äì0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. For a short spell, Veitch considered giving up his football career to pursue career in academia, but after a spell in the reserves, playing under the pseudonym of 'Hamilton' he changed his mind. Renowned for his versatility, Veitch captained the successful United side which won League Championships in 1905, 1907 and 1909, the FA Cup in 1910 and were FA Cup finalists in 1905, 1906, 1908 and 1911, and also represented England on six occasions. Off the pitch, he was an active member of the players' union.Tony Mason, 'Veitch, Colin Campbell McKechnie (1881‚Äì1938)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Despite a dispute with Newcastle United in 1911, Veitch continued to play for the club until the outbreak of World War I, during which he served as a lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery. After the war, he returned to St James' Park to become a coach, and in 1924 formed the junior side, Newcastle Swifts, the pioneers of the current Newcastle United juniors system. Veitch was sacked in 1926, ending a 26-year association with United. =Bradford City= In August 1926, Veitch was appointed manager of Bradford City. In his first season the club was relegated to Division Three (North). The following season City recorded their then record victory, 9‚Äì1 over Nelson and were mounting a promotion challenge. But in January 1927 Veitch resigned, deciding that football management was not for him. Personal life Away from football, Veitch was a great lover of the arts and co-founded the People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne in 1911.Christopher Goulding, \\"The Story of the People's\\" (Newcastle City Libraries, 1991) He was also an accomplished playwright, composer, conductor and producer, and counted George Bernard Shaw amongst his circle of friends. Veitch served in France during the First World War as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery. Veitch was also very politically aware and was approached to stand as a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party. Although he turned the proposal down, he did become a union activist for the Professional Footballers' Association and was the PFA's chairman for a number of years. After resigning from Bradford City he returned to Tyneside and became a journalist with the Evening Chronicle. In 1929 he was banned from the St James' Park press box. In 1938, Veitch contracted pneumonia and died aged 57 in Bern, Switzerland whilst on a recuperation holiday.

The other ones were located in the former Duchy of Lorraine. The inhabitants of these municipalities didn't and still don't speak any German dialect (Lower Alemannic) such as their neighbors. The linguistic boundary runs between Wisches and Lutzelhouse. The people of the annexed towns speaks a Romance language from the Langues d'o√Øl, Lorraine family, such as some municipalities in the district of Upper Alsace. This cultural particularity stresses the fact that the annexation of French territories by the German Empire not always referred to the pan-nationalist political idea (Pan-Germanism trying to unite all German-speaking people. When Alsace was recovered by France in 1919 it was decided not to return the 18 annexed municipalities to their former Department(Vosges). Thus in terms of departmental boundaries, the mountain region remains administratively separated from the western portion of the Vosges mountains.

Life  Born in Brussels to Philip Poelaert (1790‚Äì1875), a former architecture student at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, Poelaert also trained there under Tilman-Fran√ßois Suys, and then in Paris under Louis Visconti and Jean-Nicolas Huyot. Poelaert first came to attention with his winning competition entry for the Congress Column in 1849. He was made city architect of Brussels in 1856. Poelaert's most significant commission was the colossal Law Courts of Brussels, the largest single building constructed in the 19th Century and even copied in smaller scale at the Palace of Justice in Peru. During construction the inhabitants of the Marollen quarter, the working-class neighbourhood site of the Law Courts, gave Poelaert the nickname \\"Skieven Architect\\" (roughly, 'the crooked architect') because the long period of construction drove many inhabitants out of their houses, with the help of the local police. The nickname refers also to \\"chief architect\\" because many of the workers of the Law Courts were English. The local inhabitants corrupted \\"chief architect\\" to \\"skieven architect\\", with a totally different meaning in the Brussels dialect. Poelaert himself was residing in the heart of the Marolles rue des Minimes in a house adjoining his vast offices and workshops and communicating with them.Poelaert et son temps, Bruxelles, (catalogue exposition), 1980, p. 166: \\"Il habitait une maison rue des Minimes, voisine de ses bureaux et qui communiquait avec ceux-ci\\" Poelaert Place, the largest square in Brussels, lies in front of the courts building. He is buried in Laeken Cemetery under a miniature version of his own Palais de Justice. Poelaert was the great-uncle of Belgian architect Henri Van Dievoet.

The professionals who engage in training the prospective teachers are called teacher educators (or, in some contexts, teacher trainers). There is a longstanding and ongoing debate about the most appropriate term to describe these activities. The term 'teacher training' (which may give the impression that the activity involves training staff to undertake relatively routine tasks) seems to be losing ground, at least in the U.S., to 'teacher education' (with its connotation of preparing staff for a professional role as a reflective practitioner).The two major components of teacher education are in-service teacher education and pre-service teacher education. see for example Cecil H. Allen, In-Service Training of Teachers in Review of Educational Research. 1940; 10: 210‚Äì215. In the UK, however, the term 'teacher training' is still in general use: see for instance the UK government's information on tda.gov.uk  Policy and related issues  The process by which teachers are educated is the subject of political discussion in many countries, reflecting both the value attached by societies and cultures to the preparation of young people for life, and the fact that education systems consume significant financial resources. However, the degree of political control over Teacher Education varies. Where TE is entirely in the hands of universities, the state may have no direct control whatever over what or how new teachers are taught; this can lead to anomalies, such as teachers being taught using teaching methods that would be deemed inappropriate if they used the same methods in schools, or teachers being taught by persons with little or no hands-on experience of teaching in real classrooms. In other systems, TE may be the subject of detailed prescription (e.g. the state may specify the skills that all teachers must possess, or it may specify the content of TE courses). Policy cooperation in the European Union (EU) has led to a broad description of the kinds of attributes that teachers in EU Member States should possess: the Common European Principle for Teacher Competences and Qualifications. Continuum Although ideally it should be conceived of, and organised as, a seamless continuum, teacher education is often divided into these stages *initial teacher training / education (a pre-service course before entering the classroom as a fully responsible teacher); *induction (the process of providing training and support during the first few years of teaching or the first year in a particular school); *teacher development or continuing professional development (CPD) (an in-service process for practicing teachers). = Initial =  Organization  In many countries, Initial Teacher Education (also known as preservice teacher training) takes place largely or exclusively in institutions of Higher Education. In countries like Sri Lanka there are separate institutes called National colleges of Education to provide pre- service teacher training while Teacher Training Colleges provide in-service teacher education. Further institutes called Teacher Centers provide continuing professional development for teachers. It may be organized according to two basic models. In the 'consecutive' model, a teacher first obtains a qualification in one or more subjects (often a diploma in teaching or an undergraduate bachelor's degree), and then studies for a further period to gain an additional qualification in teaching (this may take the form of a post-baccalaureate credential or master's degree). In the alternative 'concurrent' model, a student simultaneously studies both one or more academic subjects, and the ways of teaching that subject, leading to a combined bachelor's degree and teaching credential to qualify as a teacher of that subject. Other pathways are also available. In some countries, it is possible for a person to receive training as a teacher by working in a school under the responsibility of an accredited experienced practitioner. In the United Kingdom there is a long tradition of partnerships between universities and schools in providing state supported teacher education. This tradition is not without tensions and controversies. In the United States, approximately one- third of new teachers come through alternative routes to teacher certification, according to testimony given by Emily Feistritzer, the President of National Center for Alternative Certification and the National Center for Education Information, to a congressional subcommittee on May 17, 2007. However, many alternative pathways are affiliated with schools of education, where candidates still enroll in university-based coursework. A supplemental component of university-based coursework is community-based teacher education, where teacher candidates immerse themselves in communities that will allow them to apply teaching theory to practice. Community-based teacher education also challenges teacher candidates' assumptions about the issues of gender, race, and multicultural diversity.This assists to make an attitudinal change in the teacher trainees in order to eliminate segregation within the school community.  Curriculum  The question of what knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and skills teachers should possess is the subject of much debate in many cultures. This is understandable, as teachers are entrusted with the transmission to learners of society's beliefs, attitudes and deontology, as well as of information, advice and wisdom, and with facilitating learners' acquisition of the key knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that they will need to be active in society and the economy. Generally, Teacher Education curricula can be broken down into four major areas: *foundational knowledge in education-related aspects of philosophy of education, history of education, educational psychology, and sociology of education. *skills in assessing student learning, supporting English Language learners, using technology to improve teaching and learning, and supporting students with special needs. *content-area and methods knowledge and skills‚Äîoften also including ways of teaching and assessing a specific subject, in which case this area may overlap with the first (\\"foundational\\") area. There is increasing debate about this aspect; because it is no longer possible to know in advance what kinds of knowledge and skill pupils will need when they enter adult life, it becomes harder to know what kinds of knowledge and skill teachers should have. Increasingly, emphasis is placed upon 'transversal' or 'horizontal' skills (such as 'learning to learn' or 'social competences'), which cut across traditional subject boundaries, and therefore call into question traditional ways of designing the Teacher Education curriculum (and traditional school curricula and ways of working in the classroom). *practice at classroom teaching or at some other form of educational practice‚Äîusually supervised and supported in some way, though not always. Practice can take the form of field observations, student teaching, or (U.S.) internship (See Supervised Field Experiences below).  Rural  Those training to teach in rural and remote areas face different challenges from those who teach in urban centres. Therefore, a different approach to teacher education is needed for those who aspire to each in rural and remote areas. It has been proposed that rural and remote communities may have more success recruiting teachers who already live in these communities, rather than trying to recruit urbanites to move to rural communities once they have completed their teacher training. Online and blended teacher education programs are becoming more prevalent to help meet the needs of teacher shortages in rural and remote areas. In addition, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 aims to substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers by 2030 through international cooperation.  Supervised field experiences  *field observations‚Äîinclude observation and limited participation within a classroom under the supervision of the classroom teacher *student teaching‚Äîincludes a number of weeks teaching in an assigned classroom under the supervision of the classroom teacher and a supervisor (e.g. from the university) *internship‚Äîteaching candidate is supervised within his or her own classroom These three areas reflect the organization of most teacher education programs in North America as well as Asian countries like Sri Lanka. Courses, modules, and other activities are often organized to belong to one of the three major areas of teacher education. The organization makes the programs more rational or logical in structure. The conventional organization has sometimes also been criticized, however, as artificial and unrepresentative of how teachers actually experience their work. Problems of practice frequently (perhaps usually) concern foundational issues, curriculum, and practical knowledge simultaneously, and separating them during teacher education may therefore not be helpful. However, the question of necessary training components is highly debated as continuing increases in attrition rates by new teachers and struggling learners is evident. Additionally, with the increasing demands of the \\"teacher\\" research is beginning to suggest that teachers must not only be trained to increase learning experiences for their students, but how to also be a leader in an increasingly challenging field. The debate of how best to prepare teachers for teaching in today's demanding environments will continue to be an important focus of the United States, where the education of all children successfully is priority. = Induction of beginning teachers = Teaching involves the use of a wide body of knowledge about the subject being taught, and another set of knowledge about the most effective ways to teach that subject to different kinds of learner; it, therefore, requires teachers to undertake a complex set of tasks every minute. Many teachers experience their first years in the profession as stressful. The proportion of teachers who either do not enter the profession after completing initial training, or who leave the profession after their first teaching post, is high. A distinction is sometimes made between inducting a teacher into a new school (explaining the school's vision, procedures etc.), and inducting a new teacher into the teaching profession (providing the support necessary to help the beginning teacher develop a professional identity, and to further develop the basic competences that were acquired in college). A number of countries and states have put in place comprehensive systems of support to help beginning teachers during their first years in the profession. Elements of such a programme can include: * mentoring: the allocation to each beginning teacher of an experienced teacher, specifically trained as a mentor; the mentor may provide emotional and professional support and guidance; in teacher training, induction is limited to the provision of a mentor, but research suggests that, in itself, it is not enough.Wong H; Induction programs that keep new teachers teaching and improving; NASSP Bulletin ÔøΩ Vol. 88 No. 638 March 2004 * a peer network: for mutual support but also for peer learning. * input from educational experts (e.g. to help the beginning teacher relate what she learned in college with classroom reality). * support for the process of self-reflection that all teachers engage in (e.g. through the keeping of a journal). Some researchAshby, P., Hobson, A., Tracey, L., Malderez, A., Tomlinson, P., Roper, T., Chambers, G. and Healy, J. (2008). Beginner teachers' experiences of initial teacher preparation, induction and early professional development: a review of literature. London: DCSF suggests that such programmes can: increase the retention of beginning teachers in the profession; improve teaching performance; promote the teachers' personal and professional well-being.Huling-Austin, J. A synthesis of research on teacher induction programs and practices; paper presented to the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association, New Orleans LA, April 5‚Äì9, 1988 However, numerous authors Jabbar, Abdul and Hardaker, Glenn (2013) The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools. Teaching in Higher Education , 18 (3). pp. 272-284. suggest that current teacher education is highly flawed and primarily geared towards a western dominated curriculum. Hence, they suggest that teacher education should be inclusive and take into account multiple backgrounds and variables to allow teachers to be responsive to the requirements of their students. This falls into the area of culturally responsive teaching and requires teaching education and teachers to address issues of diversity education and disadvantage as a part of a teacher education curriculum. Jabbar & Hardaker (2013) argue that this is an essential process in helping students of ethnicity, colour and diversity achieve and attain. = Continuous Professional Development = Because the world that teachers are preparing young people to enter is changing so rapidly, and because the teaching skills required are evolving likewise, no initial course of teacher education can be sufficient to prepare a teacher for a career of 30 or 40 years. In addition, as the student body continues to change due to demographic issues there is a continuous pressure on academics to have mastery of their subjects but also to understand their students. Continuous Professional Development (CPD) is the process by which teachers (like other professionals) reflect upon their competencies, keep them up to date, and develop them further. The extent to which education authorities support this process varies, as does the effectiveness of the different approaches. A growing research base suggests that to be most effective, CPD activities should: *be spread over time, *be collaborative, *use active learning, *be delivered to groups of teachers, *include periods of practice, coaching, and follow-up, *promote reflective practice, *encourage experimentation, and *respond to teachers' needs.see: Snow-Renner and Lauer, ‚ÄòProfessional Development Analysis (synthesis of 54 studies), McREL, 2005see General Teaching Council for England, 'Teachers' Professional Learning', London, 2005. However, a systematic review published in 2019 by the Campbell Collaboration, summarizing evidence from 51 studies, finds no clear evidence that CPD in education improves student academic outcomes.

Europass Teacher Academy. 2020; https://www.teacheracademy.eu/funding/erasmus-plus-ka1/  Quality assurance in teacher education The concept of 'Quality' in education is contested and understood in numerous different ways. It is sometimes taken to relate to the quality of the work undertaken by a teacher, which has significant effects upon his or her pupils or students. Further, those who pay teachers' salaries, whether through taxes or through school fees, wish to be assured that they are receiving value for money. Ways to measure the quality of work of individual teachers, of schools, or of education systems as a whole, are therefore often sought. In most countries, teacher salary is not related to the perceived quality of his or her work. Some, however, have systems to identify the 'best-performing' teachers, and increase their remuneration accordingly. Elsewhere, assessments of teacher performance may be undertaken with a view to identifying teachers' needs for additional training or development, or, in extreme cases, to identify those teachers that should be required to leave the profession. In some countries, teachers are required to re-apply periodically for their license to teach, and in so doing, to prove that they still have the requisite skills. But still there are countries (e.g. Sri Lanka) where teaching cannot be considered as a profession as the teachers are not provided with a license to teach. Feedback on the performance of teachers is integral to many state and private education procedures, but takes many different forms. The 'no fault' approach is believed by some to be satisfactory, as weaknesses are carefully identified, assessed and then addressed through the provision of in house or school based training. These can, however, be seen as benefiting the institution and not necessarily fully meeting the CPD needs of the individual as they lack educational gravitas. Teacher educators A teacher educator (also called a teacher trainer) is a person who helps in-service and pre-service teacher trainees to acquire the knowledge, competencies and attitudes they require to be effective teachers. Several individual teacher educators are usually involved in the initial or ongoing education of each teacher; often each specialises in teaching about a different aspect of teaching (e.g. educational ethics, philosophy of education, sociology of education, curriculum, pedagogy, subject-specific teaching methods etc.). Not every culture has a concept that precisely matches the English term 'teacher educator'...Francesca Caena: Perspectives on Teacher Educator policies in European countries: an overview. Retrieved January 2017 at http://www.lerarenopleider.nl/velon/wp- content/uploads/2015/01/summary_national_situations_teacher_educator_policies_europe.pdf Even where the concept exists, the range of roles that is covered by the term varies significantly from country to country.see, for example, the analysis of how this term is used within Europe in: European Commission (2012), 'Supporting the Teaching Professions for Better Learning Outcomes' retrieved January 2017 from http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2012:0374:FIN:EN:PDF In some traditions, the term 'teacher trainer' may be used instead of 'teacher educator'. A teacher educator may be narrowly defined as a higher education professional whose principle activity is the preparation of beginning teachers in universities and other institutions of teacher education, such as National Colleges of Education, Teacher Training Colleges and Teacher Centers. A broader definition might include any professional whose work contributes in some way to the initial education or the continuing professional development of school and other teachers. Even within a single educational system, teacher educators may be employed in different roles by different kinds of organisation. In the European context, for example, people who could be considered to be teacher educators include: * Higher Education academics with a responsibility ** for Teacher Education as such, ** for teaching a subject (such as chemistry or mathematics) to students who will later become teachers; ** for research into teaching, ** for subject studies or ** for didactics; * teachers in schools who supervise student teachers during periods of teaching practice; * school teachers or school managers responsible for inducting new teachers during their first year of teaching; or * those in charge of school teaching staff‚Äôs continuous professional development.these examples are taken from the European Commission's text 'Supporting teacher educators' retrieved January 2017 from Teacher educators may therefore work in many different contexts including National Colleges of Education, teacher training colleges, teacher centers,(universities, schools, private sector training organisations or trade unions) and their working time may be fully, or only partly, dedicated to the preparation of teachers. =Professional knowledge and competences of teacher educators= Being able to educate teachers requires different knowledge and skills than those required to teach pupils or students.Murray, J., Male, T. (2005) ‚ÄòBecoming a teacher educator: evidence from the field‚Äô Teaching and Teacher Education 21 125‚Äì142[000] Teacher educators' fields of knowledge Some recent research has highlighted the many fields of knowledge that are required by teacher educators; these include knowledge about: the pedagogy of teacher education; learning and learners; teaching and coaching; and the profession of teacher educator itself. In addition, teacher educators need to know about the specific contexts their students will work and working in (e.g. for primary, or secondary education) and the subjects they will teach. More experienced teacher educators need expertise in: curriculum development and assessment; the wider context of teacher education, the way it is organised, and in research.These are taken from: Dengerink J, Lunenberg M and Kools Q (2015) ‚ÄòWhat and how teacher educators prefer to learn‚Äô, Journal of Education for Teaching, 41:1, 78-96; but see also a similar list of required competences in European Commission (2012), 'Supporting the Teaching Professions for Better Learning Outcomes' retrieved January 2017 at http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2012:0374:FIN:EN:PDF Multiple identities The complexity of the tasks of the teacher educator arises in part because, as research has shown, they have multiple professional identities. (This is linked to the issues of definition of the term, highlighted above). While some of those who carry responsibility for the education of teachers do self-identify as 'teacher educator', others may self- identify rather as 'researcher' or 'academic'; others may relate primarily to their academic discipline, such as 'chemist' or 'geographer.'see, for example: Swennen A., Jones K, Volman M (2010). ‚ÄòTeacher Educators: their identities, sub-identities and implications for professional development‚Äô, Professional Development in Education, 36 (1-2), March- June 2010, 131-148. But the key duality of identity that lies at the core of the teacher educator profession is that of first-order and second order teaching. A teacher educator must be a highly competent ‚Äòfirst-order educator‚Äô (i.e. a good teacher) but also a skilled ‚Äòsecond-order educator‚Äô (i.e. capable of teaching effectively about the skill of teaching and facilitating others to acquire teaching skills). As first-order educators, they need to be proficient teachers (of 'adult' students). As second-order educators, they require, in addition, specific competences and dispositions, such as modelling and meta-reflection, that enable them to teach about teaching. The acquisition or improvement of teacher competences requires training, through which it will be improved educational planning and assessment. This results in a better learning of students, as evidences show. It is the objective of FAMT & L Comenius project, conducted at the University of Bologna, designed with the aim of promoting the correct use of formative assessment in mathematics education for students aged from 11 to 16. Reaching this goal supposes to design training programs for teachers of mathematics, starting from identificating their needs, believes, expectations and the use of formative assessment. =Modelling= The way in which teacher educators teach has a greater impact on student teachers‚Äô thinking about practice than what teacher educators teach.Russell, 1997 cited in Loughran J. and Berry A.: ‚ÄòModelling by teacher educators‚Äô, Teaching and Teacher Education 21 (2005) 193‚Äì203 So, teacher educators need to be able to model the competences and attributes they wish their students to adopt.Loughran and Berry 2005; Lunenberg M., Korthagen F. and Swennen A. (2007): ‚ÄòThe teacher educator as a role model‚Äô, Teaching and Teacher Education 23 586‚Äì601; Davey, R. and Ham, V. (2011), ‚Äò ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs all about paying attention!‚Äô ‚Ä¶ but to what?‚Äô in Bates et al.: ‚ÄòThe Professional Development of teacher educators‚Äô, Routledge, London, 2011; pp 232-247 Swennen et al. (2008).Swennen, A., Lunenberg, M. and Korthagen, F. (2008): ‚ÄòPreach what you teach! Teacher educators and congruent teaching‚Äô, Teachers and Teaching: theory and practice, 14(5), 531‚Äì542 concluded that, in order to ‚Äòmodel‚Äô what they teach, teacher educators need to develop the ability to link their own (tacit) theories and practice of teaching to public theory, i.e., in Korthagen‚Äôs Korthagen FAJ, (2001), ‚ÄòLinking practice and theory: The pedagogy of realistic teacher education‚Äô. Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,Inc. words, to translate Theory with a capital ‚ÄòT‚Äô to theory with a small ‚Äòt‚Äô. =Meta-reflection= Just as teaching is no longer seen as simply transferring factual information, so educating teachers also requires a more sophisticated approach, based upon professional awarenesssee, for example: Yaffe E. and Maskit D, ‚ÄòDiscussing pedagogical dilemmas with teacher educators ‚Ä¶‚Äô In Bates et al 'The Professional Development of teacher educators', Routledge, London, 2011 that comes from reflective practice.see for example Ken Zeichner 'Becoming a teacher educator: a personal perspective;'Teaching and Teacher Education 21 (2005) 117‚Äì124 For Loughran,Loughran J (2014) ‚ÄòProfessionally Developing as a Teacher Educator‚Äô; Journal of Teacher Education 2014, Vol. 65(4) 271‚Äì283(2014) being a professional teacher educator requires ‚Äúgenuinely reflecting on, and responding to, the needs, demands, and expectations of teaching about teaching within the academy‚Äù. =Professional standards for teacher educators= In some parts of the world (notably the United States, Flanders and the Netherlands) specific standards of professional practice have been developed for, or by, teacher educators. These set out the range of competences that a member of the teacher educator profession is expected to be able to deploy, as well as the attitudes, values and behaviours that are deemed to be acceptable for membership of the profession).See examples from United States: http://www.ate1.org/pubs/uploads/tchredstds0308.pdf and the Netherlands: http://www.lerarenopleider.nl/velon/beroepsstandaard/ =Policy and legislation on the teacher educator profession= While schools and school teachers are often in the news and in political debate, research shows that the teacher educator profession is largely absent from such public discussions and from policy discourse in Education which often focuses exclusively on teachers and school leaders. Some research suggests that, while most countries have policies, and legislation, in place concerning the teaching profession, few countries have a clear policy or strategy on the teacher educator profession. Caena (2012) Caena F (2012) ‚ÄòPerspectives on Teacher Educator policies in European countries: an overview‚Äô paper prepared for the European Commission conference ‚ÄòEducation¬≤: Policy support for Teacher Educators‚Äô; downloaded August 2013 at http://ec.europa.eu/education/school- education/teacher-educator_en.htm found that some of the consequences of this situation can include a teacher educator profession that is poorly organised, has low status or low formal recognition, has few regulations, professional standards - or even minimum qualifications, and no coherent approach to the selection, induction, or continuing professional development of Teacher Educators. In India, the National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE) released the 'National Curricular Framework for Teacher Education, 2010 (NCFTE), which aims to remedy many of the ills of teacher training in India. It calls for preparing a 'humane and reflective practitioner' and for fostering the agency and autonomy of the teacher, who can interpret the curriculum meaningfully to the contextual needs of the learners, than merely focus on 'teaching the text book'. =Research into the teacher educator profession= The teacher educator profession has also been seen as under-researched; empirical research on professional practice is also scarce. However, the importance of the quality of this profession for the quality of teaching and learning has been underlined by international bodies including the OECD and the European Commission.see, for example: European Commission (2012), 'Supporting the Teaching Professions for Better Learning Outcomes' retrieved January 2017 at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2012:0374:FIN:EN:PDF Some writers have therefore identified a need for more research into \\"what teachers of teachers themselves need to know\\", and what institutional supports are needed to \\"meet the complex demands of preparing teachers for the 21st century\\".Cochran-Smith M (2003): \\"Learning and unlearning: the education of teacher educators\\", Teaching and Teacher Education 19 (2003) 5‚Äì28) In response to this perceived need, more research projects are now focussing on the teacher educator profession.For one example, see the InfoTED project at https://www.ntnu.edu/info-ted Several academic journals cover this field.

The Evening Chronicle is published by ncjMedia, a division of Reach plc. It has a circulation of 26,811 as of 2016, down ‚àí12.3% year on year.  History  The Chronicle originated as the Newcastle Chronicle, founded in 1764 as a weekly newspaper by Thomas Stack. The paper was owned by his descendants until 1850, when it was sold to a consortium led by Mark William Lambert, a local businessman. The repeal of the taxes on newspapers in 1855, along with the hiring of new journalists and the installation of a new printing press created an opportunity to expand the newspaper. On 1 May 1858 the Newcastle Daily Chronicle was launched. Its editor was Joseph Cowen, who became the sole owner at the end of 1859. He soon turned the Chronicle into the most successful newspaper in north-eastern England and one of the most successful provincial newspapers of the 19th century. In April 2013 the Evening Chronicle became known as The Chronicle or Chronicle Live.  Present day  The Chronicle was a broadsheet from its inception until 8 October 1997, when it switched to become a tabloid. Prior to 2007 the paper was published twice daily, with an evening edition on sale from the late afternoon. It concentrates on local news, human interest stories and sport, with a particular emphasis on Newcastle United F.C. A jobs supplement increases the paper's circulation every Thursday. In October 2013, the Chronicle and its sister publications The Journal and Sunday Sun were banned from Newcastle United F.C. due to the papers' coverage of a fans' protest march. The ban was later withdrawn. The Chronicle's political coverage is focused towards the region and local politics: being a predominately Labour supporting region, this feeds into the coverage of current affairs. However, the Chronicle has never made an official endorsement unlike contemporary regional papers such as the Evening Standard or the Liverpool Echo. Sister papers Owned by Reach plc, the Chronicle is the sister publication of another North East newspaper The Journal. The two papers once complemented each other with |The Journal being published in the morning and the Chronicle in the afternoon, though both titles are now printed overnight and are on newsstands along with national titles. In 2007, a local free paper The Herald and Post was rebranded under the Chronicle banner, as Chronicle Extra. The Chronicle focuses on news and sport in the North East and in particular the Newcastle United. North East sport was covered by The Pink (a Chronicle supplement) from 1895 to 2005. The \\"Pink\\" paper was usually issued after the days football had concluded on a Saturday. The last edition was published on 17 December 2005.

In a strongly stated version, physical causal closure says that \\"all physical states have pure physical causes\\" ‚Äî Jaegwon Kim, or that \\"physical effects have only physical causes\\" ‚Äî Agustin Vincente, p. 150. Those who accept the theory tend, in general although not exclusively, to the physicalist view that all entities that exist are physical entities. As Karl Popper says, \\"The physicalist principle of closedness of the physical ... is of decisive importance and I take it as the characteristic principle of physicalism or materialism.\\" Definition Physical causal closure has stronger and weaker formulations. The stronger formulations assert that no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain ‚Äî Jaegwon Kim. That is, they assert that for physical events, causes other than physical causes do not exist. (Physical events that are not causally determined may be said to have their objective chances of occurrence determined by physical causes.) Weaker forms of the theory state that \\"Every physical event has a physical cause.\\" ‚Äî Barbara Montero, or that \\"Every physical effect (that is, caused event) has physical sufficient causes\\" ‚Äî Agustin Vincente, (According to Vincente, a number of caveats have to be observed, among which is the postulate that \\"physical entities\\" are entities postulated by a true theory of physics, a theory of which we are ignorant today, and that such a true theory \\"will not include mental (or in general, dubious) concepts\\" (Note 5, p. 168).) or that \\"if we trace the causal ancestry of a physical event we need never go outside the physical domain.\\" ‚Äî Jaegwon Kim. Weaker forms of physical causal closure are synonymous with the causal completeness, the notion that \\"Every physical effect that has a sufficient cause has a sufficient physical cause.\\" That is, weaker forms allow that in addition to physical causes, there may be other kinds of causes for physical events. The notion of reductionism supplements physical causal closure with the claim that all events ultimately can be reduced to physical events. Under these circumstances, mental events are a subset of physical events and caused by them. Importance Physical causal closure is especially important when considering dualist theories of mind. If no physical event has a cause outside the physical realm, it would follow that non-physical mental events would be causally impotent in the physical world. However, as Kim has agreed, it seems intuitively problematic to strip mental events of their causal power. Only epiphenomenalists would agree that mental events do not have causal power, but epiphenomenalism is objectionable to many philosophers. One way of maintaining the causal powers of mental events is to assert token identity non-reductive physicalism‚Äîthat mental properties supervene on neurological properties. That is, there can be no change in the mental without a corresponding change in the physical. Yet this implies that mental events can have two causes (physical and mental), a situation which apparently results in overdetermination (redundant causes), and denies the strong physical causal closure. Kim argues that if the strong physical causal closure argument is correct, the only way to maintain mental causation is to assert type identity reductive physicalism‚Äîthat mental properties are neurological properties. Criticism The validity of the physical causal closure has long been debated. In modern times, it has been pointed out that science is based on removing the subject from investigations, and by seeking objectivity. This outsider status for the observer, a third-person perspective, is said by some philosophers to have automatically severed science from the ability to examine subjective issues like consciousness and free will. A different attack upon the physical causal closure discussed by Hodgson is to claim science itself does not support the physical causal closure. Some philosophers have criticized the argument for the physical causal closure by supporting teleology and mental-to-physical causation via a soul. =Ignoring phenomena= There seem prima facie to be irreducible purpose-based (or teleological) explanations of some natural phenomena. For instance, the movement of a writer's fingers on the keyboard and a reader's eyes across the screen is irreducibly explained in reference to the goal of writing an intelligible sentence or of learning about the physical causal closure arguments, respectively. On the face of it, an exclusively non- teleological (descriptive) account of the neurological and biological features of hand movement and eye movement misses the point. To say, \\"I am moving my fingers because my brain signals are triggering muscle motion in my arms\\" is true, but does not exhaustively explain all the causes. Both are causes. In Aristotelian terms, a neurological account explains the efficient cause, while the purpose-based account explains the final cause. The physical causal closure thesis challenges this account. It attempts to reduce all teleological final (and formal) causes to efficient causes. Goetz and Taliaferro urge that this challenge is unjustified, partly because it would imply that the real cause of arguing for the physical causal closure is neurobiological activity in the brain, not (as we know it is) the purpose-based attempt to understand the world and explain it to others.

She wrote about her marriage in her 2000 book La V√©rit√©: autobiographie. Ayoub stated she wrote the book to explain her situation, and to address allegations published in the Middle East by a Lebanese magazine that she was a modern-day Madame Bovary. As Scott MacLeod of Time Magazine wrote: \\"But if her tale provides a rare look at the extravagance often wrought by unimagined wealth, it also serves as a disturbing manifesto against the extreme restrictions imposed on women by some ultraconservative Arab societies.\\" Her former husband filed suit in an attempt to stop publication of the autobiography. The book became a best seller in France. In 1997, she bought a boat from Bernard Tapie, the Phoc√©a (the largest sailing yacht in the world before 2004), for ‚Ç¨5.56 million to which was added ‚Ç¨18.25 million worth of work.

After getting rid of the yacht, she sold the contents in a well publicized auction. The Associated Press estimated her net worth at over $300 million. In 2006, The New York Times offered a figure of about $500 million. She has the largest private collection of haute couture in the world, encompassing more than 10,000 items.

Plot Jack Dunne (Winkler), an amnesiac Vietnam veteran most likely suffering from a severe case of PTSD , escapes a mental ward in New York City intent on starting a business as a worm farmer in Eureka, California. At the bus station, he accidentally meets Carol Bell (Field), a woman unsure of her engagement to a man towards whom she has confused feelings. Initially annoyed by Jack, Carol gradually warms to him as they set off on a trip through middle America towards Northern California: during the journey she has time to reflect on her impending nuptials as Jack tries to locate his three war buddies hoping to enlist them in his dream to start a worm farm. It becomes clear that the first two friends Jack and Carol locate are in too poor condition to do much work of any kind. When a visit to the parents of the third results in the disclosure that the friend had died in the war, Jack, who knew as much but was in denial, relives the battlefield trauma of his buddy's death. Finally, Carol's compassion and caring enable Jack to come to terms with reality.

He sent it to the agent of Henry Winkler, then hugely popular because of Happy Days. Winkler loved the script and showed it to two producers, Lawrence Turman and David Foster, who wanted to work with him. They presented it as a package to Ned Tanen at Universal who agreed to finance the movie.MOVIE CALL SHEET: Aaaayyy! New Role for the Fonz Kilday, Gregg. Los Angeles Times 21 July 1976: g10.

Vincent Canby was far more negative, calling it \\"excruciatingly obvious\\" and \\"frighteningly bad\\", with \\"all of the magic of commercial television except canned laughter.\\"'Heroes,' Excruciatingly Obvious Film, by Vincent Canby, in The New York Times; published November 5, 1977 Paul Mavis, reviewing Mill Creek's Blu-ray release of Heroes for Movies & Drinks, wrote, \\"Heroes isn't funny enough to be a comedy, nor emotional enough to be a romance, nor consequential enough to be a straight drama.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". When the movie was released on VHS/DVD, the ending song, \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" by Kansas - their first Top 20 hit - was replaced by an instrumental song, as the rights to the song had not been obtained. This greatly diminished the emotional impact of the final scene. However, most TV airings still contain the original soundtrack, and, in fact, the inclusion of the Kansas song has allowed \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" to remain popular since its release, being certified Gold in 1990, and frequently still heard on the radio. =Box office= The movie was a box office success, grossing $33.5 million on a $3.1 million budget, and opened at number 1 at the U.S. box office. =Accolades= Henry Winkler received a Golden Globe award nomination for Best Actor in a Drama film.https://www.goldenglobes.com/person/henry-winkler He also received the corresponding BAFTA nomination.

It c. south of Urbino. The Burano flows near the town. History Cagli occupies the site of an ancient village on the Via Flaminia, which seems to have borne the name Cale, or Calliumhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Diocese_of_Cagli_e_Pergola north of Helvillum (now Sigillo) and southwest of Forum Sempronii (now Fossombrone). In the 6th century it was one of the strongholds of the Byzantine Pentapolis. A free commune was founded in Cagli at the end of the 12th century, and it quickly subdued more than 52 surrounding castles, overthrowing the rural lords and threatening the feudal powers of the abbots. Its expansion established the borders of the diocese of Cagli. When the city was partially destroyed by fire, started by Ghibelline factions in 1287, the settlement was moved down from the slopes of Monte Petrano and rebuilt anew on flatter land, incorporating the pre-existing suburb. The rebuilding of the city, under the patronage of Pope Nicholas IV, followed Arnolfo di Cambio's grid-pattern town plan. Cagli soon returned to being a prosperous centre. A register of taxes paid to the Church in 1312, revised after a heavy fall in population due to famine, shows that Cagli then numbered around 7,200 inhabitants. Shortly afterwards, in the Constitutiones Aegidianae of 1357, Cagli appeared among the nine major cities in the Marca (along with Pesaro, Fano and Fossombrone). The economic development of the city centred mainly on the manufacture of woollen cloth (later also silk) and the tanning of hides, industries that grew considerably under the dukes of Urbino. When the Duchy of Urbino was handed over to the Papal States in 1631, Cagli became subject to the same economic policies as the rest of the Marche region, principally cereal cultivation. The low yields in the upland Apennine areas brought about an unstoppable decline. The Unification of Italy stirred up strong anticlerical feelings. The building of the Fano-Fabriano-Rome railway, the construction of the new Municipal Theatre, and new public spaces gave substance to the progressive vision of the future. At the same time, the confraternities were stripped of their roles in city life and the monasteries were confiscated. Cagli's destiny was now absorbed within the wider context of Italy's national history. The railway line was destroyed by Nazi forces in 1944 and the Via Flaminia lost its importance as a major road, marking a long period of decline for Cagli and the surrounding valleys, which was to be reversed only towards the end of the second Millennium. Main sights Torrione =Rocca Torrione= The fortified complex, built in 1481, was designed for Duke Federico III da Montefeltro by Francesco di Giorgio Martini. The latter in his Treatise, places Cagli as first among his six outstanding fortresses, and describes it in great detail with a certain degree of pride. Particularly unusual is the secret passage (the soccorso coverto) that links the tower to the imposing ruins of the diamond-shaped fortress (demolished in 1502). The fortifications date back to a time when architects like Francesco di Giorgio Martini were testing out innovative solutions to the problems posed by new developments in artillery. Since 1989, the rooms of the tower - which have a certain sculptural form themselves - have hosted the Centre for Contemporary Sculpture, containing specially commissioned works by sculptors of international renown such. =San Francesco= Church of San Francesco. The church, dating from 1234, is the pivot around which Cagli was rebuilt in 1289. The marble portal with its inlaid lintel and spiral columns (with the stylized owl on the lower left-hand side) dates from 1348. In the interior, the recent dismantling of the 19th century vaulting above the apse has brought to light medieval vaulting above with a cycle of frescoes dating to the 1340s. These frescoes are believed to be the work of Mello da Gubbio and show influences of the Sienese painter Ambrogio Lorenzetti. Two fragments of 14th century frescoes on the counter fa√ßade are attributed to the circle of the Maestro of Montemartello. On the side altars the principal works (counterclockwise from the right) are: two fragments of framed frescoes, once attributed to Antonio Alberti da Ferrara, now attributed to the Secondo Maestro of the Oratory of St John the Baptist, Urbino; the Miracles of the Snow by Ernst van Schayck(1617) and a young Gaetano Lapis (1730); a processional wooden crucifix, from the Northern European school, from the second half of the 15th century; an altarpiece (1540) by Raffaellino del Colle. The organ - attributed to Baldassarre Malamini - is the oldest in the Marche region and dates from the second half of the 16th century. Beside it, on the left, is one of three wash drawings by Battaglini da Imola from 1529 (the other two are beside the main altar). In the piazza in front of the church is a bronze statue of Angelo Celli, by Angelo Biancini, erected in 1959, in front of the loggia built in 1885. =Church of Santa Maria della Misericordia= The church bears the same name as the confraternity that has been based here since 1301. The sturdy portal (1537) is topped by a 16th-century fresco of the Madonna della Misericordia. The interior was decorated with frescoes, of which several large fragments still remain: the Martyrdom of St Apollinia (1455) is by Jacopo Bedi from nearby Gubbio, while the others have elements that are reminiscent of the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi. The main altar, with its 15th-century canopy with the Four Evangelists, also has a remarkable polychrome group in the niche depicting the Madonna della Misericordia. On the two side altars (c. 1625) are works by Claudio Ridolfi, and the predella showing the Massacre of the Innocents (1634) by Girolamo Cialdieri. =Church of Sant'Angelo Minore= Passing through the loggia (built in a 15th-century style, though erected in 1560), the interior has an elaborate main altar dating from the mid-17th century. Made from gilded and lacquered wood with great Solomonic columns, at its centre is the painting depicting Noli me tangere (1504), signed \\"THIMOTHEI DE VITE URBINAT. OPUS\\", a masterwork by Timoteo Viti, alongside his work in the mausoleum of the Dukes of Urbino. =Town Hall= Palazzo Comunale. Piazza Matteotti - once known as Piazza Maggiore - is dominated by the 13th century Palazzo Pubblico, or Town Hall, built to house the city's governors. The building, onto which was added the Palazzo del Podest√† (the monumental fa√ßade overlooks via Alessandri), was donated by the Comune to Federico III da Montefeltro in 1476. The Duke commissioned Francesco di Giorgio Martini to transform it into a ducal palace, but the works were never completed. The lowering of the raised entrance, the creation of a loggia(of which only the benches and corbels remain), and the vaulted rooms on the ground floor, all date from this period. The area around the clock on the fa√ßade date from 1575, while the statue of the \\"Madonna with Child\\" is from 1680 and was commissioned in Venice. To the side of the undecorated entrance are three standard measuring units: piede (foot), braccio (arm) and canna (cane): to these should be added the stub of a Roman column known as the \\"Cagliese quarter\\" now positioned just inside the main room on the ground floor. The fresco in the lunette on the back wall is of the Madonna with Child, St Michael Archangel and St Gerontius (1536) attributed to Giovanni Dionigi. Also on show - as an extension to the Archeological Museum - are objects including ducal coats of arms of both the Montefeltro and Della Rovere families, communal emblems - including one of St Michael - and a pair of dolphins. From the Entrance Hall, the door to the left of the entrance from the piazza takes you down to the segrete, a dungeon-like basement with ceramic fragments discovered during excavation works, and Medieval masonry including a civic coat of arms, capitols, a rose boss, a garland carving, and drain covers from the civic aqueduct. Heading out of the Sala del General Consiglio the passageway under the fresco is framed by a 15th-century doorway decorated with the emblems of Duke Federico in bas-relief. From here one enters the courtyard. At its centre is the sculpture \\"Ordine Cosmico\\" (1997) by Eliseo Mattiacci. The Archaeological Museum (currently being enlarged) occupies parts of the 13th century Palazzo del Podest√†. The fountain at the centre of Piazza Matteotti was built in 1736 by Giovanni Fabbri, to a design by Anton Francesco Berardi the younger. =Cagli Cathedral= View of the Cathedral. This basilica church has been modified over the centuries. The Gothic portal (1424) can still be seen on the left wall; it was sculpted by Maestro Antonio di Cristoforo of Cagli and the 17th century painted decoration is by Lodovico Viviani). After the damaging earthquake in 1781, Pietro Giacomo Patriarca's tall dome was replaced by the present-day rounded vault. The bell tower is topped by an octagonal brick belfry (1790) designed by Giovanni Antinori. The main works are: in the right nave, the altarpieces by Gaetano Lapis (1758) (2nd chapel) and by Sebastiano Conca (1720) (3rd chapel); in the transept, The Patron Saints (1704) by Luigi Garzi and the Madonna and Child with Saints Peter and John the Baptist commissioned in 1695 by the Medicis of Florence and painted by a member of the Nasini family; in the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, two canvases by Gaetano Lapis (1754 and 1756); in the left nave, an Annunciation from the workshop of Barocci, a fragment of a 16th-century fresco of the Immaculate Conception attributed to Giuliano Persciutti of Fano (though perhaps by Dionigi of Cagli), and the 17th century Eternal Father by the local artist Giambattista Gambarini in the tympanum above the altar. The organ was built by Nicola Morettini in 1889. =Church of San Domenico= The church was built by the Celestines, a branch of the Benedictine order, after the reconstruction of the city in 1289. The front portal dates from 1483, the apse from 1655 and the bell tower from 1654. Inside, the principal works are by Giovanni Santi, father of Raphael. These are (from the left) the funeral monument with a fresco of Christ in the Tomb between Saints Jerome and Bonaventure(1481) and the celebrated Tiranni Chapel, considered to be his masterpiece, which dates from the early 1490s. Beside the Virgin's throne, the work depicts an angel gazing outwards from the scene; it is traditionally believed that this is a portrait of Raphael as a child, while the face of St John the Baptist appears to be a self-portrait of Santi himself. On the opposite wall of the church, in a niche, is the 16th century Annunciation, once attributed to Girolamo Genga and more recently to Timoteo Viti. Beside it is the Presentation in the Temple by Gaetano Lapis. 14th-century frescoes can be see beneath the 1576 layer of plaster. In the spacious crypt (stairs to the side of the Tiranni Chapel) is a cycle of frescoes by Antonio Viviani. = Other sights = Ponte Mallio About to the northwest of Cagli and west of the Via Flaminia, at the modern Acqualagna, is the site of an ancient town; the place is now called piano di Valeria, and is scattered with ruins. Inscriptions show that this was a Roman stronghold, perhaps Pitinum Mergens. Other sights in the town include: *Ponte Mallio, dating to Roman Republican times (220 BC): it is one of the most imposing Roman remains along the ancient consular road, the via Flaminia. The bridge was built using large blocks (some more than a cubic metre) of which were put into place without mortar. The section of dressed cornelian stone dates from a later restoration, perhaps at the beginning of the Roman Imperial period. *Municipal theatre, opened in 1878 and designed by Giovanni Santini. *Palazzo Berardi Mochi-Zamperoli, enlarged in the early 17th century, to designs by Anton Francesco Berardi. Its architecture was further refined in the 18th centuryby another Berardi (Anton Francesco junior). Beneath the frescoed upper rooms, decorated by pupils of Barocci, on the ground floor is the Polo Culturale di Eccellenza, with libraries and archives (in preparation), while on the top floor is the Centro di Documentazione della Scultura (in preparation) with drawings and models of public sculptures by 20th century Italian artists. On the main piano nobile various art exhibitions take place during the year. *Church of San Giuseppe. This church was once known as Sant'Angelo Maggiore, and was used by the city's governors. Its barrel-vaulted interior is decorated with Mannerist stucco- work. The paintings portray events from the life of St Joseph, while high- relief figures (kings, patriarchs and biblical figures) decorate the niches around the walls. At the centre of the vaulting is Charity, linked by Telamons to the other Theological Virtues. On the two late-16th century side altars are plaster statues of \\"St Joseph\\" and \\"Our Lady of Sorrows\\", with ornate plaques. On the high altar is an Archangel Michael (1764) between 17th-century frescoes by Girolamo Cialdieri. Events * is a national celebration of Italian and international charcuterie takes place annually, at the end of April when the town showcases the best charcuterie from the rich gastronomic culture of Italy. Cagli is now known as a national marketplace for high-quality charcuterie and is seeking to become a leader in the promotion of traditional breeds, free range pigs and the production of top quality meat and charcuterie.http://www.distintisalumi.it *Procession of Cristo Morto, held in the late afternoon of Good Friday: after the deposition in the Cathedral, it ends in front of the church of San Giuseppe, where the two images of Our Lady of Sorrows and Christ are brought before each other. In the evening, four hundred confraternity members, barefoot and hooded, from five confraternities form the religious procession that precedes the carriage bearing the veiled statue of the Dead Christ, in a ritual that remains unchanged since the 16th century. Corpus Christi procession The city's streets are carpeted with flowers, arranged by citizens and worshippers as a demonstration of popular piety, for the procession in which the priest carries the consecrated host, under a rich canopy, accompanied by members of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament. *Palio and 'Gioco dell'Oca. Old rivalries between Cagli's historic Quarters form the background to this competition, which traces its history back to 1543. The Eve of the event (the 2nd Saturday of August) begins with the investiture of the Captains and the offering of oil to the patron saint. In the evening everyone gathers in the Quarters to share traditional dishes, hoping that fortune will be on their side. On the day of the Palio (the 2nd Sunday of August) the Magistrate, accompanied in procession, displays the trophy of the golden goose. Dice throwers move the score-markers of the respective Quarters on a 54-square board, while young players battle each other in contests which moves them backwards or forwards on the board until the winner is proclaimed. In the evening, there is general celebration or consolation in the outdoor taverns of the four Quarters.

They originated simultaneously‚Äîbut independently‚Äîin the USA, Canada, and the UK, followed later by Sweden (UK-influenced), Germany (US-influenced), Australia. They encompass a wide variety of fanbase activities, from those who simply like to collect, to those who enthusiastically show their models at model horse shows. Unlike model cars or trains, model horse collectibles do not need to be assembled from kits, although they can be altered to the collector's liking. Brand History The earliest popular brands of mass-produced model horses in the UK and the USA strongly influenced the collecting and showing trends in these two countries - the latex-bodied and haired Julips in the UK, and the injection moulded, hard plastic Breyers in the USA. =UK Brands= Model horses have long been popular toys, mainly as mounts for soldiers or figures for model farms - essentially accessories for action figures. In 1920 Britains Ltd became one of the first companies to mass produce these types of figures. Over the years their range of equine figures expanded though they remained generic action figures; Roy Selwyn-Smith created some very detailed 54 mm ('mini') horses for Britains Ltd. Julip Horses Ltd, in 1947, created the first mass produced, stand-alone equine figures. Originally, Julips were stuffed soft toys in the tradition of companies such as Edith Reynolds, but later switched to hand-casting in latex (Julip Originals). Other companies such as Isis, Pegasus, and Otway, soon released their own lines of latex composition (the forerunner of resin) equines. Pamela du Boulay took the latex models to the next level with the creation of Rydal models in 1969 - highly accurate, airbrushed sculptures, each an artist original. In 2008 Helen and Alice Moore launched a line of detailed latex models, the Equorum Model Horse Stud. Hobby artist Donna Chaney, known for her porcelain figures, introduced a small number of latex equine molds known as RubberNedz in 2015. Many toy companies produce plastic equine figures as companions or accessories and a few of these have dedicated equine lines. One of these earlier companies was Dream Ponies, a product of Swallow Horsetoys. In 1971, they released a small range of injection moulded plastic equine models and accessories; Dream Ponies was later sold and re-launched as Magpie Models. Other brands with a significant following includes My Beautiful Horses by Vivid Imaginations; Plastech, manufactures of Thelwell Pony figures; and Sindy, a British version of Barbie which included a variety of horses in their product line. In 2015 Utterly Horses, the largest model horse distributor in the UK, announced the creation of a new model horse company, CopperFox Model Horses. The mission of this new enterprise is to produce accurate and high quality examples of British breeds which are underrepresented in the plastic arena dominated by USA-based companies. Ceramic horses are also popular, though more fragile collectibles. Companies such as Beswick, Border Fine Arts (ceramic and resin), Alchemy Ceramics ‚Äì later purchased by Animal Artistry, Melba Ware and many others offer a variety of equine figures. =USA Brands= In the late 1940s - early 1950s, Hartland Collectibles and Breyer Animal Creations (now a division of Reeves International) began producing realistic injection moulded plastic model horses. Both companies' first models were standing western horses next to or over a clock. Most of Breyer's original horses, dogs and cattle were sculpted by Chris Hess, though many artists have contributed to create a wide variety of breeds and poses. Breyer Animal Creations hosts BreyerFest, a weekend-long celebration of the product every year at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky. Breyer Horses traditionally come in five scales, from largest to smallest: Traditional (1:9), Classic (1:12), Little Bit/Paddock Pal (1:24), Stablemate (1:32), and Mini Whinny (1:64). A 1:6 scale model was added in 2014, though it is unknown whether this scale group will be expanded and given a name. In addition to their fully hard plastic line, Breyer also produces haired 'toy' models, soft toys, ceramic and resin models, books, ornaments, and craft kits. Hartland Collectibles changed ownership many times throughout their history and suffered devastating flooding in 1986 and 1994 which damaged product and machinery. The latest purchase took place in 2001 and production ceased again around 2008. In the mid-1990s, Peter Stone, son of Sam Stone who originally helped create Breyer Animal Creations, worked for Breyer most of his life but eventually parted ways and started his own company. Stone Horses are known for a handful of molds released in a wide range of special, limited edition runs and collectible decorator colors, as well as turning a popular Quarter Horse resin by Carol Williams into plastic. Today Stone and Breyer horses are the top two popular plastic model horse brands. Companies such Grand Champion, Blue Ribbon, Creata, and many others produce some form of model horse, but these are generally considered too toy- like to be of major interest to collectors. Hagen-Renaker is a California- based company which produces model horse figures. These figures are highly collectible and a number of the molds were leased by Breyer for production in plastic. =Artist Resins= Limited edition artist resins (usually original sculptures rather than customs), first began to appear in the 1980s. The very first were castings taken from customized Breyers, issued by Black Horse Ranch owned by the late Karen Grimm. Carol William's famous \\"Quarter Horse 1\\" or \\"RRQH1\\" (\\"RR\\" for \\"Rio Rondo\\", the name of Williams' modeling enterprise) was one of the first to be cast from an original sculpture. Resin models - high- quality castings of an original artist's sculpture - are typically sold unpainted, ready to finish by the customer. They took the hobby by storm in the 1990s, and are very popular and much-sought after today. A resin can be an affordable way to own a favorite artist's work, with the price dependent on the rarity of the piece. Some resins are released in highly limited editions of 50 pieces or less. Such models sell out rapidly, and might be resold with higher secondary-market prices. Brief history In the late 1960s, UK collectors came together through PONY magazine, and several clubs and newsletters were born, the most important being The Postal Pony Club. From this was created the Lindfield Model Showing Association and later Model Horse News (MHN), a bi-monthly magazine which ran until 1989. In 1979 The International Arabist magazine appeared, which though restricted to Arab horses and their descendants, was the first magazine to actively seek to unite hobbyists from around the world. While MHN remained largely in the original tradition of Julips, etc., TIA promoted realism through custom Breyers. TIA changed its name to Model Horse International (MHI) to reflect its move away from purely Arabian interest, but the magazine folded around 1989. MHN also folded around this time, but was replaced by Model Horses Unlimited (MHU) catering for both realistic and more traditional models, and which is still in existence today. During the 1960s, hobbyists such as Ellen Hitchins, Simone Smiljanic, and Marney Walerius began to organize photo shows. One of the earliest known clubs was the IMHA, or International Model Horse Association, which was run by Hitchins and Smiljanic. Many young hobbyists got their start after reading a short article about model horse collecting, which was published in the March 1969 issue of Western Horseman magazine. In the 1970s, US model horse collectors decided that their horses should be doing something else than just sitting on a shelf. They began to seek each other out, and early model horse magazines such as Breyer's Just About Horses and Model Horse Showers Journal were the means for collectors to socialize. Realism became the goal and the hobby grew a larger fanbase. With more techniques being shared, the shift in realism became more apparent. For example, an early bridle might have been made out of string. Today it would be made from leather, and include actual miniature bits. Clubs also formed as an outlet for collectors. Most clubs are devoted to particular breeds, performance activities (such as racing, eventing etc.) or regions, and just like real horse clubs, there are year-end awards, club events, point programs and newsletters for members. Model horse activities =Collecting= Due to the vast amount of model horses available, some hobbyists collect only one kind of breed, scale or particular mold. Most model horses are in the 1:9 scale, while others are no bigger than mice. Usually a model is released in a particular color for a number of years or a limited run. The model horse company may decide to make portrait models of famous horses as well, such as Secretariat and Man o' War. Having a collection of several color versions of one mold is referred to as a \\"conga line\\". Hobbyists simply collect what they like, and others may collect in hopes of selling at a profit later on. There is no guarantee that models will increase in value over time. Since the advent of eBay, comparing prices has become much easier, so prices have fallen. Buyers can now purchase a horse for much less than what it was originally bought. While the original scope of collecting may have focused on plastic horses, they may now be made of resin or ceramic. Common brands are: Breyer Horses, Paradise Horses, Stone Horses, Hagen-Renaker, Royal Doulton, North Light, Grand Champion and Schleich. While most model horses are sold as toys, some, like resins, are delicate, much more expensive and are not made for children. Common plastic model horses may be bought from toy stores, tack shops, authorized dealers or other collectors. Prices range from a few dollars to many thousands for an artist resin. Some hobbyists also collect Model Horse catalogs, magazines and promotional items. =Customizing= Custom repaint of a Hagen-Renaker Mini Shetland Pony Mare (circa 2005). Acrylics and pastels on ceramic. Not content with factory produced models, hobbyists took to remaking factory-made models by adding hair, removing tails or altering the position or color. Many of these early customs are considered crude by today's standards. These early models often had fake fur manes and tails, or were painted with spray paint and even permanent markers. Legs were moved by heating plastic with hair dryers or candles. However, in the late 1970s, British artists finally gained access to Breyers (which were not then commercially available in the UK), and began to rework them using more sophisticated techniques in a deliberate attempt to replicate the realism of the du Boulay Rydals. This comprised the use of airbrushes, fine mohair tops and epoxy putty for re-sculpting. Today these techniques and the term \\"customizing\\" have been adopted worldwide to become effectively hobby standard. Acrylics (brushed or air-brushed), oil paints, brushed-on pastel dust, and etching away the original finish paint with an x-acto knife are all common materials and methods for altering the appearance of a model. Coloured pencils, watercolour (pencil and paint), and even ink are sometimes used as well. The preference for sculpted or hair manes and tails goes in and out of vogue and can vary by region as well. Mohair is generally used, though some artists use glue-coated embroidery thread to great effect creating something between a sculpted and haired appearance. Many sculpting pastes have been used over the years with varying levels of success and durability. Wood putty and plumber's epoxy was most commonly used in the beginning, but now new epoxy-type products are available which have been designed for artistic use. Products such as Apoxie Sculpt and Gapoxio have longer drying times, a finer texture, and more flexibility than the earlier sculpting materials. Customized models can range from simple repaints of an otherwise unaltered model to those which have been so thoroughly manipulated and re-sculpted as to make the original form totally unrecognizable. Many artists make their living from customizing models, with certain artists widely sought after. =Showing the model horse= Model horse showing has two ways in which to participate - photo showing (online or postal) and live showing. Photo showing is convenient for people who aren't able to travel or don't live near other collectors. Showholders publish a classlist and invite people to enter for a nominal fee. The shower then takes photos of their horse, usually against a background. On the back of the photo, the horse's vitals are recorded along with the shower's address. A piece of tape is also placed on the back, on which the shower writes down the numbers of the classes in which the horse will be entered. Once the showholder receives all the entries, They are sorted by class numbers and begin judging. A showholder may place a horse based on quality of photo, accuracy of breed depiction, and condition. Usually championships and reserves are offered as well. Sometimes ribbons or small prizes are sent to the show entrants along with the returned photographs and show results. More recently, photo shows posted on the Internet have eliminated the cost of postage and long wait for returns. Live showing is much different. Here again the showholder publishes a classlist and invites other showers to attend. The show is usually held in a large space such as a hotel or arena, and entrants travel in person to attend. Each shower usually gets a table to use as a \\"home base\\" in the show hall. The \\"rings\\" are tables with ring numbers, where showers place their horses as classes are called. Live shows classlists are usually divided between original finish and customized models, and some also have separate divisions for china figurines, artist resins, and very-rare original finish. Live shows frequently have multiple judges and judge several classes at once to accommodate the long classlists. As in photo showing, judges consider condition and breed correctness. Live shows may also include collectibility classes, or may judge breed classes simultaneously for collectibility as well, in which models are thereby evaluated on the bases of rarity and condition, verses breed correctness. Any profits from the shows are often donated to animal-related charities. If a shower belongs to a club, they may record points earned from their horses' placings for year-end awards. There are many clubs that hold periodic‚Äîoften monthly‚Äîphoto or online shows that allow members the opportunity to earn points for their horses that may be applied to end-of-the-year and cumulative awards. NAN cards are also sought after. These pink and green cards allow a particular horse to enter the North American Nationals (NAN), a yearly show organized by the North American Model Horse Show Association (NAMHSA). The show and the qualification cards carry a lot of prestige in the hobby world - a model which is \\"NAN qualified\\" goes up in value. In the UK the Model Equine Championships (MECs) have a similar concept to NAN and have been running since 1998. Postal showing was the original method of showing, where a horse's details were sent to a judge and places were awarded by rolling dice. Now postal showing is more usually the preserve of performance disciplines such as racing or dressage, and the model events often mirror real events. Places may be awarded by pairing a model with a real participant whose luck it shares, or in the case of racing, with reference to a sophisticated handicapping system. =Props and Tack= Hobbyists also use props, tack and riders. It is important that props and tack are in scale to the model for added realism. Props are anything which might enhance a scene, such as dogs, jumps, trees, trail elements, backgrounds and fences. Some classes such as jumping, roping, and trail require the use of props. Dolls range from pre-packaged jointed dolls, to one-of-a-kind creations by skilled dollmakers. They currently are optional for performance showing in the United States, elsewhere, however, they are required. Hobby tack covers the entire range of real horse tack, from numnahs to full saddle sets; from simple barn halters to extravagant multiple horse harness hitches; and from stable blankets to hand-stitched Arabian horse costumes. They are made out of a variety of materials such as leather hide, leather lace, satin and grosgrain ribbon, jewelry chain, and various fabrics. Hardware can be made by hand out of wire, or cast metal such as pewter and white bronze. Much research goes into making high-quality tack, with some tack makers accumulating reference libraries of online image folders and books. Tack can be made from scratch, or using kits. Knowledge of leather stamping, carving, dying, and sewing are all skills the model horse tackmaker uses in his or her craft. =Pedigreeing= In the pursuit of realism, many hobbyists also research and give their models pedigrees and names. Pedigree assignment‚Äîcommonly abbreviated \\"PA\\"‚Äîis a way to learn about different breeds and creating progeny. Some pedigrees are researched from real horses or other models. Model horse breeders may offer their horse's parentage for a nominal fee and usually issue a certificate to the foal's owner. Some clubs keep records of real mares and their open years for members who want to make sure that the model they PA from living parents does not have the same dam and foaling year as a model belonging to another member. In keeping with the hobby's attempt to maintain realism, collectors assigning pedigrees to models usually try to use only years that a real mare did not have a foal, or, in the case of scarce breeds, a year that she had a foal that was gelded (and thus could not reproduce).

It is uniformly black on the dorsum, with a bright orange or red belly. Behavior The black swamp snake is almost entirely aquatic. It spends most of its time hiding among dense vegetation in tannic cypress swamps. Diet L. pygaea feeds on small fish, tadpoles, frogs, salamanders, sirens, amphiumas, and invertebrates, such as leeches and earthworms. Reproduction The black swamp snake is ovoviviparous, giving birth to live young directly in shallow water. Unlike many snakes, females feed actively while gravid, suggesting that they may pass nutrients directly on to the young. Broods of 11 to 13 have been observed.Schmidt, Karl P.; Davis, D.

The landscaped pleasure gardens occupied a large area in the northeastern sector of Rome, in what would become Region VI, between the Pincian and Quirinal hills, near the Via Salaria and later Porta Salaria. The modern rione is now known as Sallustiano. History The property originally belonged to Julius Caesar as the Horti Caesaris, but after his death it was acquired by the historian Sallust, who developed it using his wealth acquired as governor of the province of Africa Nova (newly conquered Numidia). After the writer's great-nephew it passed to Tiberius in 20 AD and was maintained for several centuries by the Roman Emperors as a public amenity. The Emperor Nerva died of a fever in a villa in the gardens in AD 98, and it remained an imperial resort until it was sacked in 410 by the Goths under Alaric, who entered the city at the gates of the Horti Sallustiani. The complex was severely damaged and never rebuilt.Procopius. However, the gardens were not finally deserted until the 6th century.Miranda Marvin, \\"The Ludovisi Barbarians: The Grand Manner\\", Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome. Supplementary Volumes, 1, \\"The Ancient Art of Emulation\\"(2002:205-223) p. 205 and note 9. In the early 17th century Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi, nephew of Pope Gregory XV, purchased the site and constructed the Villa Ludovisi, in the course of which several important Roman sculptures were rediscovered. Much of the area occupied by the gardens was divided into building lots and filled following the break-up of Villa Ludovisi after 1894, as Rome expanded as the capital city of Italy after the unification of Italy. The ancient topography itself has been irrevocably altered with the filling of the valley between the Pincio and Quirinal hills where these horti existed.Hartswick 2004.

Pyle, Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, Chapter VII. Anomalies of Stature, Size, and Development. Art The gardens, which were enriched with many additional structures in the four centuries during which they evolved, contained many pavilions, a temple to Venus, a porticus of a thousand paces, and monumental sculptures. Items later found in the gardens include: *the Obelisco Sallustiano, a Roman copy of an Egyptian obelisk which now stands in front of the Trinit√† dei Monti church above the Piazza di Spagna at the top of the Spanish Steps *the Borghese Vase, discovered there in the 16th century. *the sculptures known as the Dying Gaul and the Gaul Killing Himself and His Wife *the Ludovisi Throne, found in 1887, and the Boston Throne, found in 1894. *the Crouching Amazon, found in 1888 near the via Boncompagni, about twenty-five meters from the via Quintino Sella (Museo Conservatori). Remains A remarkably well preserved pavilion of the villa can be seen at the center of present-day Piazza Sallustio. The pavilion originally stood at the garden's summit on a spectacular location. Its main feature is a circular hall roofed by a dome. Remains of a cryptoporticus were discovered in constructing the garage of the American Embassy on Via Friuli.

He lives in Boston with his wife Amy and their two young sons, Michael and Nicholas. Career A member of ASCAP, Karidoyanes is the conductor of the Plymouth Philharmonic Orchestra, a professional orchestra on Boston's historic South Shore, since 1994. In 2000 he composed Caf√© Neon: Fantasy on Greek Songs and Dances that was performed by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Of the piece, which he dedicated to his parents, Karidoyanes writes: :\\"Caf√© Neon owes its form and existence to the 20th century Hungarian composer, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly. When I first conducted Kod√°ly's Gal√°nta Dances I was immediately taken by the music's passion and color and wished there was a Greek equivalent which would gratify my Hellenic heritage. Caf√© Neon now fills that personal void.\\" The original title for this piece was Tav√©rna, the Greek word for tavern, but it was not inspiring enough for Karidoyanes and the title was changed to Caf√© Neon, an Americanized version of the Greek word Kafen√≠on, coffee bar. Since its premiere in November 2000, Caf√© Neon has had dozen of performances by orchestras in Massachusetts, Michigan, Wisconsin, California, Indiana, Italy and Greece. A classical music announcer/producer, Mr. Karidoyanes is a frequent fill-in host for Boston's WGBH Radio, and has worked for NPR (National Public Radio) affiliates in North Carolina and Indiana. On September 20, 2003, Karidoyanes conducted an All- Mozart program with the Prague Symphony Chamber Orchestra in the Czech Republic's Smetana Hall. On March 13, 2004 he conducted the Massachusetts All- State Senior High School Festival Orchestra in Boston's Symphony Hall. Past guest conductor engagements include the Syracuse Symphony, the Rochester Philharmonic and orchestras throughout the New England and Washington, D.C. regions. His performances have been called \\"excellent\\" (The Boston Globe) and \\"beautifully controlled\\" (The Washington Post). He has held the posts of Music Director of the Boston College Symphony Orchestra, Associate Conductor of the Winston-Salem Symphony and Greensboro Symphony orchestras in North Carolina, and Assistant Conductor of the Rhode Island Philharmonic.

The Saepta Julia was a building in the Campus Martius of Rome, where citizens gathered to cast votes. The building was conceived by Julius Caesar and dedicated by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in 26 BCE. The building replaced an older structure, called the Ovile, built as a place for the comitia tributa to gather to cast votes.Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth (eds.), The Oxford Classical Dictionary (1996) ‚Äî ; available online for a fee The Saepta Julia can be seen on the Forma Urbis Romae, a map of the city of Rome as it existed in the early 3rd century CE. Part of the original wall of the Saepta Julia can still be seen right next to the Pantheon.  History  The conception of the Saepta Julia, which also goes by Saepta or Porticus Saeptorum, began during the reign of Julius Caesar. It took the form of a quadriporticus, an architectural feature made popular by Caesar. After Caesar's assassination in 44 BCE, work continued on projects that Caesar had set into motion.Cic. Att 4.16.14 Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who had supported Caesar before his death, and subsequently aligned with his successor Octavian, took on the continuation of the Saepta Julia building project. The building was finally completed and dedicated by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in 26 BCE. Agrippa also decorated the building with marble tablets and Greek paintings. The Great Fire of Rome led to its destruction in 80 CE, and was rebuilt sometime before the reign of Domitian. Restoration also took place under Hadrian, as is evidenced by brick-work and literary sources. The building is also attested on a post-Constantine bronze collar of a slave, but there is no known mention of the building in the Middle Ages. The Saepta Julia can be seen on the Forma Urbis Romae, a map of the city of Rome as it existed in the early 3rd century CE. Part of the original wall of the Saepta Julia can still be seen right next to the Pantheon  Plan  Due to the limited archaeological remains, the majority of archaeological reconstructions are derived from the Forma Urbis Romae and corresponding literary sources. Located on the Campus Martius, between the Baths of Agrippa and the Serapeum, the Saepta Julia was a rectangular porticus complex, which extended along the west side of the Via Lata to the Via di S. Marco. It was 310 meters long by 120 meters wide and was built of travertine marble. Two porticoes lay on the east and west of the complex. The north end was a lobby, and the south side connected to the Diribitorium through an uncolonnaded, broad corridor. The only entrances that have been discerned are minor entrances on the south end of the complex. Archaeological excavations underneath the Palazzo Doria uncovered multiple travertine piers. While the majority of the piers measured 1.7 meters square, other piers showed a variety of dimensions. This has led some scholars to speculate on the existence of a second floor. The Saepta was supplied with water by Aqua Virgo, which supplied the majority of buildings on the Campus Martius. = Porticus Argonautarum = Western wall of the Porticus Argonautarum The Porticus Argonautarum lined the western side of the Saepta Julia. It was completed by Agrippa ca. 25 BCE, and received its name from the artwork it depicted, which showed Jason and the Argonauts. A portion of the western wall survives, and is located beside the Pantheon, and suggests that it was made of brick-faced concrete, and covered in marble. Reconstructed by Domitian after the fire of 80 CE, this portico was also part of Hadrian's reconstruction of the entire Saepta Julia. = Porticus Meleagri = The Porticus Meleagri lined the eastern side of the Saepta Julia. Little remains of the Porticus Meleagri, and location and reconstruction rely primarily on the Forma Urbis Romae. Although not mentioned, it was most likely constructed during the final decades of the first century BCE, along with the dedication of the Saepta.  Use  The concept of the Saepta was initially planned by Caesar in place of the earlier Ovile, and was projected as early as 54 BCE, and finished by Agrippa in 26 BCE. In a letter to Atticus, Cicero writes that the building was to be made of marble, with a lofty portico and a roof. The building was initially intended to be used as a voting place for both the comitia centuriata and the comitia tributa. However, with the diminishing importance of the voting comitias from the Augustan period onward, the building began to be repurposed. Gladiatorial combats were exhibited during the period of Augustus, and the building was also used by the senate as a meeting point. When Tiberius returned from Germany, after his military procession, he was presented in this building by Augustus. Both Augustus and Caligula used this building for naumachiae. It was used for gymnastics competitions and exhibitions during the reign of Nero. Statius and Martial report that it was used intermittently as a public space for Roman citizens, as well as a market for luxury goods.

It takes its name from the village of Ojc√≥w, where it also has its headquarters. Chopin visited Ojc√≥w in 1829. It is Poland's smallest national park, with an original area of , since expanded to . Of this area, is forested and is strictly protected. The park is approximately north of Krak√≥w, in the Jurassic Krak√≥w-Czƒôstochowa Upland.  Geography  Karst topography of soluble bedrock characterizes the park, which in addition to two river (the PrƒÖdnik and Sasp√≥wka) valleys contains numerous limestone cliffs, ravines, and over 400 caves. The largest of these, ≈Åokietek's Cave (said to have sheltered King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I ≈Åokietek, for whom it was named), is deep. The area is also noted for its rock formations, the most famous being Hercules' Club, a -high limestone column. Ojcowski Park is very biodiverse; over 5500 species reside in the park. These include 4600 species of insects (including 1700 of beetles and 1075 of butterflies) and 135 of birds. Mammals include the beaver, badger, ermine, and 15 species of bats, many of which hibernate in the park's caves during the winter. = Waters = The water network in its present shape developed in the end of the Tertiary period as a result of deep erosion of streams. The main watercourse is the Pradnik. Its tributary in the Park is the Saspowka. The streams are supplied with water from about 20 springs in karst cracks, called \\"wywierzyska\\" (rising springs). Human habitation and culture The earliest settlement in the area dates to the Paleolithic, approximately 120,000 years ago. The Ojc√≥w region is rich in flint, which attracted early humans. The park contains numerous castles, including a ruined Gothic castle at Ojc√≥w and a better-preserved Renaissance castle at Pieskowa Ska≈Ça, both on the tourist Trail of the Eagles' Nests.

These highly unusual and diverse annelids were first discovered by Friedrich Sigismund Leuckart in 1827.  Morphology  Myzostoma anatomy, showing cirri (c); the pharynx (p), and anus (a) Diversity of myzostomid body shapes A typical myzostomid has a flattened, rounded shape, with a thin edge drawn out into delicate radiating hairs called cirri. The dorsal surface is smooth, with five pairs of parapodia on the bottom surface. These parapodia are armed with supporting and hooked setae, by means of which the worm adheres to its host. Beyond the parapodia are four pairs of organs, often called suckers. These organs are probably of sensory nature, and are comparable to the lateral sense organs of capitellids. The mouth and cloacal opening are generally at opposite ends of the bottom surface. The former leads to a protrusible pharynx, from which the esophagus opens into a wide intestinal chamber with branching lateral diverticula. There appears to be no vascular system. The nervous system consists of a circumoesophageal nerve, with scarcely differentiated brain, joining below a large ganglionic mass, no doubt representing many fused ganglia. The dorsoventral and the parapodial muscles are much developed, while the coelom is reduced mostly to branched spaces in which the genital products ripen. Full-grown myzostomids are hermaphrodites. Their internal organs consist of a branched sac opening to the exterior or each side. The paired ovaries discharge their eggs into a median chamber with side branches, often called the uterus, from which the ripe ova (eggs) are discharged by a mediar dorsal pore into the end of the rectum.  Biology  Some species, such as Myzostoma cirriferum, move about on the host; others, such as Myzostoma glabrum, remain stationary with the pharynx inserted in the mouth of the crinoid. Myzostoma deformator gives rise to a gall on the arm of the host, one joint of the pinnule growing round the worm so as to enclose it in a cyst while Myzostoma pulvinar lives in the alimentary canal of a species of Antedon. Fridtjof Nansen wrote in 1885 the thesis Bidrag til myzostomernes anatomi og histologi Bidrag til myzostomernes anatomi og histologi on the Myzostomida. Classification In the past Myzostomida have been regarded as close relatives of the trematode flatworms or of the tardigrades, but in 1998 it was suggested that they are a sub-group of polychaetes. However, another analysis in 2002 suggested that myzostomids are more closely related to flatworms or to rotifers and acanthocephales. They are now thought to be annelids, while their relationship to other annelids is unclear.

Playing career Born Chatham, Kent and educated at Watford Grammar School for Boys, he started his career as a full back with Northfleet and had been club captain. He once scored three own-goals when playing against Swindon Town. He transferred to New Brompton in 1897 and spent two seasons there before joining Thames Ironworks in 1899. He was considered one of the best full backs in the Southern League and \\"The Irons\\" had to immediately turn down Derby County's offer for the player. Syd' King recorded 16 appearances in their first season in the Southern League Division One, also making seven appearances in the FA Cup that year, an impressive run that ended in a 1‚Äì2 home defeat against arch- rivals Millwall Athletic. In 1900 he was retained as a member of the squad after the club's transition to West Ham United, and continued to play for them until 1903, recording 59 league and 7 FA Cup appearances in total. Managerial career At the start of his last season as a player he had been appointed club secretary, although he was already considered to be a 'manager' of the club. On the eve of the 1904‚Äì05 season a small postcard of the team photograph was issued and featured the following text from King on its reverse endorsing Oxo: :\\"When training, Oxo is the only beverage used by our team and all speak of the supreme strength and power of endurance which they have derived from its use.\\" - E.

His tenure at West Ham included their election to the Football League in 1919, which coincided with a personal cheque from the board for ¬£1,500Equivalent to ¬£ in today's pounds. that paid tribute to his twenty years of service for the club. His basic wage was also raised to ¬£10 a week.Equivalent to ¬£ in today's pounds. February 1922 saw the controversial sale of West Ham legend Syd Puddefoot to Falkirk for a record ¬£5,000. For negotiating the transfer, Syd King received a ¬£300 bonus.Equivalent to ¬£ in today's pounds. By this time he was also on a ¬£100 annual bonus.Equivalent to ¬£ in today's pounds. The following season West Ham reached the FA Cup Final for the first time, losing to Bolton Wanderers but also assured their place in the top division finishing as Division Two runners up. An edition of local newspaper East Ham Echo proclaimed in 1923 that: ::\\"Syd King is West Ham and West Ham is Syd King.\\" Following promotion Syd King instilled a period of consolidation for West Ham in the First Division, the highlight of which was the 1926‚Äì1927 season when West Ham finished in 6th place in Division One. This performance was not equalled by the Hammers until the 1958‚Äì1959 season during Ted Fenton's tenure. Part of the reason that this consistency was possible, was due to Syd King signing players that went on to become West Ham legends and record holders, as well as England internationals, including Jimmy Ruffell, Ted Hufton & Vic Watson. Syd King was appointed a shareholder of West Ham United in 1931, but the team was relegated in the 1931‚Äì32 season back to Division Two. On 5 November 1932 West Ham lost their ninth game of the next season, against Bradford Park Avenue, and at the same day's board meeting, according to one board member, \\"during the discussion on the team, (King) was \\"drunk and insubordinate.\\" It was no secret that King \\"liked a drink\\", but he had already been appeased by the board many times over the issue. On the following day they announced that: :\\"It was unanimously decided that until further notice C. Paynter be given sole control of players and that E. S. King be notified accordingly.\\" It was also postulated by the board, but never confirmed, that King had been syphoning off West Ham funds for himself. He was suspended for three months without pay and also banned from entering the Boleyn Ground. Following a board meeting on 3 January 1933 his contract was terminated permanently, and he was given an ex-gratia payment of ¬£3 a week.Equivalent to ¬£ in today's pounds. Death Although comparatively rich for an ex-player working in football, King's reputation as well as his career were in tatters. Within a month of the sacking he committed suicide by drinking alcohol mixed with a corrosive liquid. The inquest into his death declared that he had taken his life 'while of unsound mind', and had been suffering from persecution delusions. According to his son at the inquest, his depression had begun when the team were relegated in the summer of 1932, and that his paranoia had followed on from that. Personal life King was a freemason, initiated into the Merchant Navy Lodge No 781 in 1905. He, along with 25 others including Henry Norris, unsuccessfully petitioned for an association football lodge in 1920.

The view from the Pincian Hill overlooking Piazza del Popolo toward St. Peter's Basilica The Pincian Hill (; ; ) is a hill in the northeast quadrant of the historical center of Rome. The hill lies to the north of the Quirinal, overlooking the Campus Martius. It was outside the original boundaries of the ancient city of Rome, and was not one of the Seven hills of Rome, but it lies within the wall built by Roman Emperor Aurelian between 270 and 273. Villas and gardens Several important families in Ancient Rome had villas and gardens (horti) on the south-facing slopes in the late Roman Republic, including the Horti Lucullani (created by Lucullus), the Horti Sallustiani (created by the historian Sallust), the Horti Pompeiani, and the Horti Aciliorum. The hill came to be known in Roman times as Collis Hortorum (the \\"Hill of Gardens\\"). Its current name comes from the Pincii, one of the families that occupied it in the 4th century AD.

His position of choice was at second-row forward, where his height and strong build made him among the most powerful runners in the game during the 1980s. Background Wynn was born in Thirroul, New South Wales, Australia. Career The lanky younger brother of rugby league player Peter Wynn of Parramatta, Wynn represented the Jack Gibson-coached New South Wales under-18s in 1977. The next year he won a premiership with Western Suburbs in the Newcastle competition, scoring 17 points in the grand final, and went on to represent Country NSW. That sparkling form saw him receive a contract from the St George Dragons to start with them in 1979. St George Dragons He stunned the rugby league world as a 19-year-old in 1979 with his powerful running wide of the rucks propelled by long, powerful legs. His ability to break defensive lines created attacking runs and tries for St George Dragons in his debut year. Wynn was described as playing, \\"a major role in the club's grand final win over Canterbury with his great attacking game,\\" as they won their second premiership in three years. Although he was beaten by his brother to selection in representative teams, Graeme was named \\"Rookie of the Year\\". The following year he played, \\"an astounding game,\\" for New South Wales in the inaugural State of Origin match and went on to be selected in the Australian squad for that season's New Zealand tour. Wynn did not play in a Test but was reserve for both tests and in the following years was subject to a serious knee injury and then to a suspension for twelve matches for biting Parramatta Eels Ray Price. He was adamant in his denial of the biting charge, saying, \\"I feel I've been branded. I'm innocent of this charge. I wonder if I can ever live it down. After 19 years without a blemish on my record.\\" He was the first player to be suspended for biting by the NSWRL. Described as \\"an accomplished goalkicker\\" in his early days, Wynn no longer kicked after the 1982 season. Nonetheless, Wynn remained a vital part of St. George's big forward pack right up to their minor premiership win in 1985. However, Wynn was strong in the Grand Final, being replaced with 10 minutes to go after being king hit by Peter Kelly. In 1988, he was to play for Chorley Borough in England, but left without taking the field. In the later years at St.George his form was strong Had a sensational game at the opening of the Sydney Football Stadium Sydney where he scored two barnstorming tries), and he also played in the victorious Dragons team that won the 1988 Panasonic Cup. Warren Ryan, however, thought Wynn still had something left in him and he won a first-grade berth with the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1991 and played solidly. Graeme won a new contract at the age of thirty-two, and was again a member of the Magpies semi-finals team, but was used mainly as a reserve and retired at the end of 1992.

In his 1880 work, Odontornithes: A monograph on the extinct toothed birds of North America, he added the Saururae, represented by Archaeopteryx, as a third order. The resulting classification was paraphyletic, not accurately resolving evolutionary relationships, and so it has been abandoned by most modern scientists, though at least one 21st century paper re-used the concept under the older name Odontoholomorphae (first coined by Stejneger, 1885).Livezey, B.C. & Zusi, R.L.

However, M. Braun and especially P. Fraisse showed later that the structures in question are of the same kind as the well-known serrated \\"teeth\\" of the bill of anserine birds. In fact the papillae observed in the embryonic birds are the soft cutaneous extensions into the surrounding horny sheath of the bill, comparable to the well-known nutritive papillae in a horse's hoof. They are easily exposed in the well-macerated under jaw of a parrot, after removal of the horny sheath. Occasionally calcification occurs in or around these papillae, as it does regularly in the egg tooth of the embryos of all birds. The best known of the \\"Odontornithes\\" are Hesperornis regalis, standing about 3 ft. high, the somewhat taller H. crassipes, and Ichthyornis dispar. Hesperornis looked somewhat similar to a loon, while Ichthyornis was quite similar to a gull or petrel. However, they were entirely distinct groups of birds and merely shared with modern birds some distant ancestry in the Early Cretaceous. The Hesperornis lineage may have derived even sooner or possibly independently from the ancestors of modern birds.

The tapir-like appearance is no longer considered accurate. Palaeotherium ('old beast') is an extinct genus of perissodactyl ungulate known from the Mid Eocene to earliest Oligocene of Europe. First described by French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1804, Palaeotherium was among the first Paleogene mammals to be described. Taxonomy Palaeotherium belongs to the family Palaeotheriidae, a group proposed to consist of two subfamilies, the Palaeotheriinae representing Palaeotherium and the Plagiolophinae containing the closely related Plagiolophus. Although at times proposed to be ancestral to modern horses the palaeotheres are now considered a sister taxon to the Equidae, and not part of the same lineage. The species and subspecies referable to Palaeotherium are a subject of debate, due in part to the diversity of species within the genus. Species and subspecies are mainly assigned based on dental and cranial characteristics.  Description  Palaeotherium was a diverse genus of herbivorous perissodactyl exhibiting a wide range of sizes from the large horse-sized Palaeotherium magnum at over 1.45m tall at the shoulder to diminutive species such as Palaeotherium minus. The average species of Palaeotherium stood at c.75 cm (2 ft 6 in) tall at the shoulder. Post- cranially Palaeotherium was relatively robust with long legs and three-toed fore and hindfeet. The forelimbs were proportionally longer than the hindlimbs. Elongated but robust tarsal and carpal bones indicate a cursorial locomotion for the genus. The cervical vertebra are also elongate, and particularly so in P. magnum, giving Palaeotherium a relatively long neck. Palaeotherium exhibits a selenolophodont dentition, with high crowned cheek teeth. The genus shows a trend for increasingly molariform premolars, beginning with early species such as P. medium and developing further in P. muehlbergi and P. magnum. Skull of Palaeotherium magnum. Palaeotherium possessed a skull with a vaguely similar shape to that of a horse, although the skull was much shorter with the orbits in a more anterior position. This is partly due to the greater development of the temporal muscles, which required longer temporal pits. Georges Cuvier originally described Palaeotherium as a kind of tapir, and as such, Palaeotherium was popularly reconstructed as a tapir-like animal. 19th and 20th century reconstructions, most famously those at Crystal Palace Park, depicted Palaeotherium with a short trunk like that seen in Tapirs. Reconstructions of this nature are now considered erroneous with Palaeotherium exhibiting a suite of distinct skeletal characteristics to Tapirs, such as more elongated legs, relatively long upright necks, and longer forelimbs than hindlimbs. Furthermore, although the nasal bones are set back, there is no specialization of the nasal area for proboscis like that observed in tapirs. A closer post-cranial would be the Okapi.  Palaeontology  Fossils of Palaeotherium have been found across Europe in Middle Eocene-early Oligocene strata in France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Greece. Palaeotherium magnum the type species of the genus was first described based on fossils from the Gypsum of Montmartre and the Buttes Chaumont in Paris, since then fossils have been collected at a variety of sites across France including the Phosphorites du Quercy, La Debruge, Aubrelong and Escamps. In the United Kingdom Palaeotherium material has been found in the Hampshire Basin, occurring alongside the closely related palaeothere Plagiolophus. Isolated teeth, bones and rare articulated material of P. magnum, P. medium, P. curtum and P. muehlbergi have been regularly collected from the Priabonian to Rupelian coastal plain sediments of the Solent Group, exposed along the northern coastline of the Isle of Wight and at Hordle Cliff in Hampshire. Rarer and slightly older material dating to the Bartonian has also been collected from the lacustrine Creechbarrow Limestone in Dorset, and in the shallow marine sediments of the Barton Group at Barton Cliff and Elmore in Hampshire. In 2010 a reassessment of perissodactyl post cranial material collected in the mid-19th century from Balouk Keui in Thrace revealed the bones to belong to a Palaeothere. The bones were attributed to Palaeotherium sp., cf. P. Magnum. The discovery of Palaeotherium fossils at Balouk Keui constitutes the easternmost record of the genus and greatly extends the known biogeographical range of Palaeotherium, previously considered to be limited to western Europe.  Paleobiology  Palaeotherium was a relatively large herbivore for Late Eocene Europe. Proportionally longer forelimbs, an elongated neck (especially evident in P. magnum), and high crowned teeth suggest Palaeotherium is likely to have been a browser, with a diet of soft fruit and leaves taken from low hanging vegetation and ground level. The largest species P. magnum may have been capable of browsing at heights of up to 2m. These browsing adaptions indicate Palaeotherium may have had a preference for wooded or at least semi-wooded habitats. Palaeotherium became extinct during the Grande Coupure c.33.6 million years ago, an important faunal turnover event in the early Oligocene that saw the extinction of many of the mammal groups that typify Late Eocene Europe. As climatic conditions cooled and dried at the onset of the Oligocene immigrant taxa from Asia dispersed into Europe, including anthracotheres, entelodonts, and rhinocerotids. These groups may have been better adapted to the changed climatic conditions and rapidly replaced most of the components of the Late Eocene faunas. The ecological niches left vacant by the extinction of the Palaeotheres were likely assumed by rhinocerotids such as Ronzotherium. The facies represented in the Solent Group of the Hampshire Basin indicate Palaeotherium was residing on a low-lying coastal floodplain, with areas of seasonally inundated wetlands and lakes, with floodplain forests.

In his first season with the team in 1954, he played on the defensive line, and famously grabbed the ball out of Lions QB Bobby Layne's hands (in what the referees ruled as a fumble recovery) in the 1954 NFL Championship game against the Detroit Lions, helping set up an important early touchdown. The following season, he was shifted to offensive tackle and helped the Browns once again capture the NFL title. He played a key role in helping legendary running back Jim Brown become one of the dominant players in the game, ending his career with six selections to the Pro Bowl. Paul Brown, legendary Cleveland Browns founder, owner, and coach, stated in his 1979 memoir, PB: The Paul Brown Story, \\"I consider (Mike) McCormack the finest offensive tackle who ever played pro football.\\" Also, according to Paul Zimmerman's 1984 book, The New Thinking Man's Guide to Pro Football, Brown also stated that McCormack was the best offensive lineman he ever coached.Zimmerman, Paul. , Simon & Schuster, 1984, p. 54. The book states that McCormack \\"[c]ould handle the Colts' Gino Marchetti better than any tackle in the game. Power combined with great intelligence and 4.8 speed. 'I've seen him have games,' former player and NFL executive Bucko Kilroy says, 'where if you were grading him, he'd score 100. Not one mistake, and his guy would never make a tackle.'\\" Coaching career McCormack retired from playing in 1962 and began coaching with the first of four consecutive stints as an assistant in the annual College All-Star Game. In 1965, he was hired as an assistant coach with the Washington Redskins, spending the next eight seasons working under four different head coaches, including former teammate Otto Graham from 1966-1968\\\\. McCormack was hired to replace Ed Khayat as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles on January 17, 1973. He inherited a team that ended 1972 in the NFC East cellar at 2-11-1 and hadn't had a winning campaign since 1966.\\"McCormack, Redskin Aide, Named Eagles' Head Coach,\\" The Associated Press, Wednesday, January 17, 1973.

That year, the Seahawks lost their first two games, then a 57-day players strike ensued. During the hiatus, seventh-year head coach Jack Patera was fired in mid-October and McCormack took over as interim head coach. He led them to a 4‚Äì3 record, the only time he compiled a winning record as an NFL head coach, but Seattle did not qualify for the 16-team postseason. McCormack then returned to his management position when the Seahawks hired Chuck Knox as their new head coach in 1983 and declined all further offers to become a head coach. In late January 1989, he was abruptly fired by the new Seahawks owner, Ken Behring, who explained the decision was necessary in order to make changes in the financial operations of the team. Later that year, McCormack became a consultant for Jerry Richardson and his ownership group that were seeking to land an NFL expansion team in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1993, he was hired by the newly-formed Carolina Panthers as their team president and general manager, and their inaugural season was in 1995. He retired from the Panthers organization in 1997, which erected a monument in their stadium honoring him. Death At age 83 in 2013, McCormack died of heart failure in Palm Desert, California.https://sports.yahoo.com/news/hall-fame-lineman-mike- mccormack-210325109--nfl.html See also * List of American Football League players References External links  * 1930 births 2013 deaths American football offensive tackles Baltimore Colts head coaches Carolina Panthers executives Cincinnati Bengals coaches Cleveland Browns players Kansas Jayhawks football players New York Yanks players Philadelphia Eagles head coaches Players of American football from Illinois Seattle Seahawks head coaches Washington Redskins coaches National Football League general managers Eastern Conference Pro Bowl players Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Western Conference Pro Bowl players Sportspeople from Chicago ","title":"Mike McCormack (American football)"},{"id":"4004231","text":"Pecora is an infraorder of even-toed hoofed mammals with ruminant digestion (Ruminantia, a clade within the Artiodactyla). Most members of Pecora have cranial appendages projecting from their frontal bones; only two extant genera lack them, Hydropotes and Moschus. The name ‚ÄúPecora‚Äù comes from the Latin word pecus, which means ‚Äúhorned livestock‚Äù.Bubenik, A. Epigenetical, Morphological, Physiological, and Behavioral Aspects of Evolution of Horns, Pronghorns, and Antlers. in Horns, Pronghorns, and Antlers. G. Bubenik and A. Bubenik eds. Springer-Verlag. New York. 1990 Although most pecorans have cranial appendages, only some of these are properly called ‚Äúhorns‚Äù, and many scientists agree that these appendages did not arise from a common ancestor, but instead evolved independently on at least two occasions.Janis, C., K. Scott. The Interrelationships of Higher Ruminant Families with Special Emphasis on the Members of the Cervoidea. American Museum Novitates. 2893: 1-85. 1987. http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/5180 Likewise, while Pecora as a group is supported by both molecular and morphological studies, morphological support for interrelationships between pecoran families is disputed.  Evolutionary history  The first fossil ruminants appeared in the mid-Eocene and were small, likely omnivorous, forest-dwellers. Artiodactyls with cranial appendages first occur in the early Miocene. The appearance of Pecora during the Miocene suggests that its rapid diversification may correspond to the climate change events of that epoch. = Taxonomy = Current attempts to determine the relationships among pecoran families (as well as all artiodactyls) rely on molecular studies, as little consensus exists in morphological studies. Different families within Pecora are recognized as valid by different groups of scientists.and sources therein, pp. 4‚Äì5 Infraorder Pecora (\\"horned ruminants\\", \\"higher ruminants\\") * Family ‚Ä†Gelocidae * Family ‚Ä†Hoplitomerycidae * Family ‚Ä†Leptomerycidae ** Parvorder Giraffomorpha *** Family ‚Ä†Palaeomerycidae *** Superfamily Giraffoidea **** Family Giraffidae (giraffe, okapi) **** Family ‚Ä†Climacoceratidae ** Superfamily Cervoidea *** Family Cervidae (deer) *** Family Moschidae (musk deer) ** Superfamily Bovoidea *** Family Antilocapridae (pronghorn) *** Family Bovidae (cattle, goats, sheep, and antelopes)  Anatomy  Pecorans share characteristics with other artiodactyls, including a four-chambered stomach, and a paraxonic foot, meaning that it supports weight on the third and fourth digits. Several characteristics distinguish Pecora from its sister taxon, Tragulina: an astragalus with parallel sides, a loss of the trapezium, and differences in parts of the skull such as the petrosal bone. The distinguishing features of most pecoran families are cranial appendages. Most modern pecorans (with the exception of the Moschidae) have one of four types of cranial appendages: horns, antlers, ossicones, or pronghorns. * True horns have a bone core that is covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. They are indicative of Bovidae. Horns develop in the periosteum over the frontal bone, and can be curved or straight. Surface features on the keratin sheath (e.g., ridges or twists) are thought to be caused by differential rates of growth around the bone core. * Antlers are bony structures that are shed and replaced each year in members of the family Cervidae. They grow from a permanent outgrowth of the frontal bone called the pedicle. Antlers can be branched, as in the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), or palmate, as in the moose (Alces alces). * Ossicones are permanent bone structures that fuse to the frontal or parietal bones during the lifetime of an animal. They are found only in the Giraffidae and closely related extinct clades, represented in modern animals by the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) and the okapi (Okapia johnstoni). * Pronghorns are similar to horns in that they have keratinous sheaths covering permanent bone cores; however, these sheaths are deciduous and can be shed like antlers. Very little is known about the development of pronghorns, but they are generally presumed to have evolved independently. The only extant animal with pronghorns is the pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana).

It is found in America, Europe, Western Asia, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa. mtDNA- based chart of possible large human migrations. Haplogroup X arose from haplogroup N, roughly 30,000 years ago (just prior to or during the Last Glacial Maximum). It is in turn ancestral to subclades X2 and X1, which arose ca. 20,000 and ca. 12,000 years ago, respectively. Distribution Haplogroup X is found in approximately 7% of native Europeans, and 3% of all native North Americans.Malhi and Smith, Brief Communication: Haplogroup X Confirmed in Prehistoric North America, American Journal of Physical Anthropology, Volume 119, Issue 1, (September 2002), Pages 84‚Äì86. Overall, haplogroup X is found in around 2% of the population of Europe, the Near East and North Africa. It is especially common, 14.3%, among the natives of Bahariya Oasis (Western Desert, Egypt. The X1 subclade is much less frequent, and is largely restricted to North Africa, the Horn of Africa and the Near East. Subclade X2 appears to have undergone extensive population expansion and dispersal around or soon after the Last Glacial Maximum, roughly 20,000 years ago. It is more strongly represented in the Near East, the Caucasus, and Southern Europe and somewhat less strongly present in the rest of Europe. The highest concentrations are found in Georgia (8%), Orkney (Scotland) (7%), and amongst the Druze community in Israel (27%). Subclades X2a and X2g are found in North America, but are not present in native South Americans. =Archaeogenetics= Haplogroup X has been found in various other fossils that were analysed for ancient DNA, including specimens associated with the Alf√∂ld Linear Pottery (X2b-T226C, Garadna- Elker√ºl≈ë √∫t site 2, 1/1 or 100%), Linearbandkeramik (X2d1, Halberstadt- Sonntagsfeld, 1/22 or ~5%), and Iberia Chalcolithic (X2b, La Chabola de la Hechicera, 1/3 or 33%; X2b, El Sotillo, 1/3 or 33%; X2b, El Mirador Cave, 1/12 or ~8%) cultures. Haplogroup X has been found in ancient Egyptian mummies excavated at the Abusir el-Meleq archaeological site in Middle Egypt, which date from the late New Kingdom and Roman periods. Fossils excavated at the Late Neolithic site of Kelif el Boroud (Kehf el Baroud) in Morocco, which have been dated to around 5,000 years old, have also been found to carry the X2 subclade. =Druze= The greatest frequency of haplogroup X is observed in the Druze, a minority population in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, as much in X1 (16%) as in X2 (11%). The Druze also have much diversity of X lineages. This pattern of heterogeneous parental origins is consistent with Druze oral tradition. The Galilee Druze represent a population isolate, so their combination of a high frequency and diversity of X signifies a phylogenetic refugium, providing a sample snapshot of the genetic landscape of the Near East prior to the modern age. =North America= Haplogroup X is also one of the five haplogroups found in the indigenous peoples of the Americas. (namely, X2a subclade). Although it occurs only at a frequency of about 3% for the total current indigenous population of the Americas, it is a bigger haplogroup in northern North America, where among the Algonquian peoples it comprises up to 25% of mtDNA types. It is also present in lesser percentages to the west and south of this area‚Äîamong the Sioux (15%), the Nuu- chah-nulth (11%‚Äì13%), the Navajo (7%), and the Yakama (5%). Unlike the four main Native American mtDNA haplogroups (A, B, C, D), X is not strongly associated with East Asia. The main occurrence of X in Asia discovered so far is in the Altai people in Siberia. One theory of how the X Haplogroup ended up in North America is that the people carrying it migrated from central Asia along with haplogroups A, B, C, and D, from an ancestor from the Altai Region of Central Asia. Two sequences of haplogroup X2 were sampled further east of Altai among the Evenks of Central Siberia. These two sequences belong to X2* and X2b. It is uncertain if they represent a remnant of the migration of X2 through Siberia or a more recent input. This relative absence of haplogroup X2 in Asia is one of the major factors used to support the Solutrean hypothesis during the early 2000s. The Solutrean hypothesis postulates that haplogroup X reached North America with a wave of European migration emerging from the Solutrean culture, roughly 20,000 years ago .\\"The North Atlantic ice-edge corridor: a possible Palaeolithic route to the New World\\".

Since the later 2000s and during the 2010s, evidence has turned against the Solutrean hypothesis, as no presence of mt-DNA ancestral to X2a has been found in Europe or the Near East. New World lineages X2a and X2g are not derived form the Old World lineages X2b, X2c, X2d, X2e, and X2f, indicating an early origin of the New World lineages \\"likely at the very beginning of their expansion and spread from the Near East\\". A 2008 study came to the conclusion that the presence of haplogroup X in the Americas does not support migration from Solutrean-period Europe. \\"Our results strongly support the hypothesis that haplogroup X, together with the other four main mtDNA haplogroups, was part of the gene pool of a single Native American founding population; therefore they do not support models that propose haplogroup-independent migrations, such as the migration from Europe posed by the Solutrean hypothesis ... Here we show, by using 86 complete mitochondrial genomes, that all Native American haplogroups, including haplogroup X, were part of a single founding population, thereby refuting multiple-migration models.\\" (Fagundes et al. 2008) The lineage of haplogroup X in the Americas is not derived from a European subclade, but rather represent an independent subclade, labelled X2a. \\"The similarities in ages and geographical distributions for C4c and the previously analyzed X2a lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for Paleo-Indians. Taking into account that C4c is deeply rooted in the Asian portion of the mtDNA phylogeny and is indubitably of Asian origin, the finding that C4c and X2a are characterized by parallel genetic histories definitively dismisses the controversial hypothesis of an Atlantic glacial entry route into North America. The X2a subclade has not been found in Eurasia, and has most likely arisen within the early Paleo-Indian population, at roughly 13,000 years ago.X2a is dated in Soares et al. (2009). A basal variant of X2a was found in the Kennewick Man fossil (ca. 9,000 years ago).\\"X2a has not been found anywhere in Eurasia, and phylogeography gives us no compelling reason to think it is more likely to come from Europe than from Siberia. Furthermore, analysis of the complete genome of Kennewick Man, who belongs to the most basal lineage of X2a yet identified, gives no indication of recent European ancestry and moves the location of the deepest branch of X2a to the West Coast, consistent with X2a belonging to the same ancestral population as the other founder mitochondrial haplogroups. Nor have any high-resolution studies of genome-wide data from Native American populations yielded any evidence of Pleistocene European ancestry or trans-Atlantic gene flow.\\" Subclades =Tree= This phylogenetic tree of haplogroup X subclades is based on the paper by Mannis van Oven and Manfred Kayser Updated comprehensive phylogenetic tree of global human mitochondrial DNA variation and subsequent published research. *X **X1 ***X1a ****X1a1 ***X1b **X2 ***X2a ****X2a1 *****X2a1a *****X2a1b ****X2a2 ***X2b ****X2b1 ****X2b2 ****X2b3 ****X2b4 ***X2c ****X2c1 ****X2c2 *****X2d ***X2e ****X2e1 *****X2e1a ******X2e1a1 *******X2e1a1a ****X2e2 *****X2e2a ***X2f ***X2g ***X2h  See also  *Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups *Indigenous American genetic studies *Kennewick Man *The Seven Daughters of Eve  References   External links  *General **Mannis van Oven's ‚Äì mtDNA subtree N *Haplogroup X **The Presence of Mitochondrial Haplogroup X in Altaians from South Siberia Miroslava V.

It is marking the anniversary of the death of the Slovene national poet France Pre≈°eren on 8 February 1849 and is the celebration of the Slovenian culture. It was established in 1945 to raise the cultural consciousness and the self- confidence of the Slovene nation, and declared a work-free day in 1991. On February 7, the eve of the holiday, the Pre≈°eren Awards and the Pre≈°eren Fund Awards, the highest Slovenian recognitions for cultural achievements, are conferred. Pre≈°eren Day continues to be one of the most widely celebrated Slovene holidays. During the holiday all state and municipal museums and galleries offer free entry, and various other cultural events are held. The holiday is celebrated not only in Slovenia, but also by Slovene communities all around the world. History The anniversary of Pre≈°eren's death first became a prominent date during World War II in 1941, when 7 February was celebrated as the day of all-Slavic unity. The proposal to celebrate 8 February as the Slovene cultural holiday was put forward in January 1945, during World War II, in ƒårnomelj by the Slovene Liberation Front's cultural worker Bogomil Gerlanc. It was officially proclaimed a cultural holiday with a decree passed by the Presidency of the Slovene National Liberation Council on 28 January 1945 and published in the newspaper Slovenski poroƒçevalec on 1 February 1945. It remained a public holiday during the era of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia within the SFR Yugoslavia and was celebrated also by the Carinthian Slovenes and the Slovenes in Italy. It was marked with many cultural festivals and remembrances and with school excursions to culturally significant institutions. The declaration of Pre≈°eren Day as a work-free day in 1991 was opposed by many, claiming it would bring the banalisation of a holiday designed to be dedicated to cultural events. As a result, 3 December, the anniversary of the poet's birth, has also become widely celebrated as an alternative holiday. Today both days are almost equally celebrated, with no antagonism between the two, although only Pre≈°eren Day in February is officially recognised as a national holiday. Since it became a work-free day, it has become even more highly valued.

He was knighted in 1910 for his contributions to industry in British India. Early life and education Dorab was the elder son of Hirabai and Parsi Zoroastrian Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata. Through an aunt, Jerbai Tata, who married a Bombay merchant, Dorabji Saklatvala, he was a cousin of Shapurji Saklatvala who later became a Communist Member of the British Parliament.Article on Saklatvala by Mike Squires, who refers to Jamsetji as J.N. Tata. Tata received his primary education at the Proprietary High School in Bombay (now Mumbai) before travelling to England in 1875, where he was privately tutored. He entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1877, where he remained for two years before returning to Bombay in 1879. He continued his studies at St. Xavier's College, Bombay, where he obtained a degree in 1882. Upon graduating, Dorab worked for two years as a journalist at the Bombay Gazette. In 1884, he joined the cotton business division of his father's firm. He was first sent to Pondicherry, then a French colony, to determine whether a cotton mill might be profitable there. Thereafter, he was sent to Nagpur, to learn the cotton trade at the Empress Mills which had been founded by his father in 1877. Marriage Dorabji's father Jamshetji had visited Mysore State in south India on business, and had met Dr. Hormusji Bhabha, a Parsi and the first Indian Inspector-General of Education of that state. While visiting the Bhabha home, he had met and approved of young Meherbai, Bhabha's only daughter. Returning to Bombay, Jamshetji sent Dorab to Mysore State, specifically to call on the Bhabha family. Dorab did so, and duly married Meherbai in 1897. The couple did not have children. Meherbai's brother Jehangir Bhabha became a reputed lawyer. He was the father of the scientist Homi J. Bhabha and thus Dorabji was Homi Bhabha's uncle by marriage. This family connection explains why the Tata group lavishly funded Bhabha's research and the research institutions set up by Bhabha, including the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Business career Dorabji was intimately involved in the fulfilment of his father's ideas of a modern iron and steel industry, and agreed to the necessity for hydroelectric electricity to power the industry. Dorab is credited with the establishment of the conglomerates Tata Steel in 1907 which his father founded and Tata Power in 1911, which are the core of the present-day Tata Group. Dorabji is known to have personally accompanied the mineralogists who were searching for iron fields, and it is said that his presence encouraged the researchers to look in areas that would otherwise have been neglected. Under Dorabji's management, the business that had once included three cotton mills and the Taj Hotel Bombay grew to include India's largest private sector steel company, three electric companies and one of India's leading insurance companies. Founder of New India Assurance Co Ltd. in 1919, the largest General Insurance company in India. Dorabji Tata was knighted in January 1910 by Edward VII, becoming Sir Dorabji Tata. Non- business interest Dorabji was extremely fond of sports, and was a pioneer in the Indian Olympic movement. As president of the Indian Olympic Association, he financed the Indian contingent to the Paris Olympics in 1924. The Tata family, like most of India's big businessmen, were Indian Nationalists.Claude Markovits, Indian Business and Nationalist Politics 1931‚Äì39: The Indigenous Capitalist Class and the Rise of the Congress Party (Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp 160‚Äì66 Death Mausoleum of Dorabji Tata in Brookwood Cemetery Meherbai Tata died of leukaemia in 1931 at the age of 52. Shortly after her death, Dorabji established the Lady Tata Memorial Trust to advance the study into diseases of the blood. On 11 March 1932, one year after Meherbai's death and shortly before his own, he established a trust fund which was to be used \\"without any distinction of place, nationality or creed,\\" for the advancement of learning and research, disaster relief, and other philanthropic purposes. That trust is today known as the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. Dorabji additionally provided the seed money to fund the setting up of India's premier scientific and engineering research institution, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Dorabji died in Bad Kissingen, Germany on 3 June 1932, at the age of 73. He is buried alongside his wife Meherbai in Brookwood Cemetery, Woking, England. They had no children.

She produced over 800 photographs mostly of her adolescent daughters. Family Clementina was one of five children of Admiral Charles Elphinstone Fleeming (1774‚Äì1840), and Catalina Paulina Alessandro (1800‚Äì1880). In 1845, she married Cornwallis Maude, 4th Viscount Hawarden; the couple had eight children. Photography She turned to photography in late 1856 or, probably, in early 1857, whilst living on the family estate in Dundrum, Co. Tipperary, Ireland. A move to London in 1859 allowed her to set up a studio in her elegant home in South Kensington. There she took many of the characteristic portraits for which she is principally remembered. Many include her adolescent daughters Isabella Grace, Clementina and Florence Elizabeth. The furniture and characteristic decor of an upper- class London home was removed in order to create mise-en-scene images and theatrical poses within the first floor of her home. Hawarden produced albumen prints from wet-plate collodion negatives, a method commonly used at the time.Victoria and Albert Museum.

The Viscountess Hawarden first exhibited in the annual exhibition of the Photographic Society of London in January 1863 and was elected a member of the Society the following March. Her work was widely acclaimed for its artistic excellence, winning her the medal for composition at the exhibition. At a Grand F√™te and Bazaar held to raise funds for a new building for the Royal Female School of Art she set up a booth where she photographed guests, the only known occasion on which she took photographs in public. Lewis Carroll, an admirer of her work, brought two children to be photographed at this booth, and purchased the resulting prints.Leggatt, Robert. \\"A History of Photography\\". Her work is often likened to fellow aristocratic photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, although their aesthetics differ widely. Her photographic years were brief but prolific. Hawarden produced over eight hundred photographs between 1857 and her sudden death in 1864. Lady Hawarden's photographic focus remained on her children. There is only one photograph believed to feature the Viscountess herself, yet it could also be a portrait of her sister Anne Bontine. A collection of 775 portraits were donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum, London in 1939 by Hawarden's granddaughter, Clementina Tottenham. The photographs were torn, or cut, from family albums. This accounts for the torn or trimmed corners which are now considered a hallmark of Hawarden's work. Carol Mavor writes extensively about the place of Hawarden's work in the history of Victorian photography. She states, \\"Hawarden's pictures raise significant issues of gender, motherhood, and sexuality as they relate to photography's inherent attachments to loss, duplication and replication, illusion, fetish.\\" Gallery File:Hawarden- clem-maude-flo-1863-4.jpg|Hawarden-clem-maude-flo-1863-4 File:Clementina Hawarden, Clementina Maude.jpg|Clementina Hawarden, Clementina Maude File:Hawarden-clementina-maude-1862-3-mirror.jpg|Hawarden-clementina- maude-1862-3-mirror File:Hawarden1.jpg|Hawarden1 File:Clementina Hawarden, Clementina Maude and Isabella, 1861.jpg|Clementina Hawarden, Clementina Maude and Isabella, 1861 File:Lady Clementina Hawarden3.jpg|Lady Clementina Hawarden3 Notes References * Virginia Dodier.

Hartigan was also the Democratic nominee for governor in 1990, but lost the race to Republican Jim Edgar.  Background  Hartigan grew up in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood, in an Irish Catholic family. His father David was Alderman of the 49th Ward.Chicago reader: \\"What's the Deal With Neal Hartigan?\\" By Florence Hamlish Levinsohn October 25, 1990 Hartigan graduated from Loyola Academy.

Upon completion of law school Hartigan worked for 10 years for the city of Chicago. He served in various roles: as the city's legislative counsel in Springfield, as attorney for the Chicago Board of Health and as general counsel for the Chicago Park District. Hartigan was elected the Democratic Committeeman for the 49th ward in 1968 and served in the position until stepping down in 1980. Former state legislator Michael Brady defeated Hartigan's choice, Cook County Treasurer Edward J. Rosewell in the Democratic primary.  Lt.

Founded in 1932, it is one of the oldest non-sectarian philanthropic organisations in India. History Like his respected father, Sir Dorabji believed that one must make use of the wealth one had acquired for constructive purposes. So, in less than a year after his wife Meherbai's death, he donated all his wealth to the Trust, insisting that it must be used \\"without any distinction of place, nationality or creed\\", for the advancement of learning and research, the relief of distress and other charitable purposes. He died three months later. The wealth that he turned over to the Trust comprised his substantial share holdings in Tata Sons, Indian Hotels and allied companies, his landed properties and 21 pieces of jewellery left by his wife, including the famous Jubilee Diamond, estimated then to be of the value of Rs 10 million. Today, these would be worth more than Rs 500 million. Mission As the Trust got formed and the trustees deliberated on the policy aspects and finalised them, it decided to adopt a broad framework‚Äîthat it should undertake such projects, which are too large for individuals to handle and that each of these projects should have a genuine relevance to the welfare of the country. The Trust is mandated to: * Maintain and support schools, educational institutions and hospitals * Provide relief in distress caused by the elements of nature such as famine, pestilence, fire, tempest, flood, earthquake or any other calamity * Help advancement of learning in all its branches especially research work in medical and industrial problems * Offer financial aid to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, by instituting professorships or lectureships or giving scholarships * Award fellowships in any branch of science or assist students to study abroad either by payment of lump sums grants or by payment of periodical sums * Give aid to any other charitable institutions or objects endowed by the settler in his lifetime, or by the grandfather, father or both of the settler. Notable national institutes The Trust is best known for promoting and setting up pioneering institutions of national importance. * Tata Institute of Social Sciences, (1936) * Tata Memorial Hospital, (1941) * Tata Institute of Fundamental Research-Mumbai, (1945) * National Centre for the Performing Arts, (1966) * The National Institute of Advanced Studies, (1988) * Indian Institute of Science * The J.

The ideas that have generated from these institutions and the people who have passed through their portals have enriched the various facets of India's development. Each of these institutions has produced many social scientists, cancer specialists, nuclear scientists and distinguished institutional administrators who have all strived to make the country a power to reckon with in science and technology. In the last decade, the Trust has also given shape to the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore and helped the Dr MS Swaminathan Research Foundation to start the JRD Tata Centre for Ecotechnology in Chennai. In addition to these institutions, it has started with the assistance of the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind, Asia's first institute for the training of the rural blind, The Tata Agricultural and Rural Training Centre for the Blind, and with the cooperation of the United Nations, the International Institute of Demographic Studies. The Trust also helps various organisations and individuals with its grants. Its grants consist of Endowment Grants, grants to Non-Governmental Organisations and Small Grants, while Individual Grants are given to deserving individuals for medical, travel or educational purposes. Under JRD Tata What has helped the Trust in achieving its objectives has been the presence of distinguished personalities, most of them industry pioneers, on its board. Among them were JRD Tata, chairman of the Tata Group, Sir Ardeshir Dalal, Dr John Matthai and Sir Homi Mody. The involvement of JRD Tata in the affairs of Trust is not just incidental. Being a trustee since the Trust's inception, he held the position of chairman during the last 25 years of his life. His imprint is visible in the setting up of the Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, National Institute of Advanced Studies and National Centre for the Performing Arts. His role was especially crucial in the establishment of the Tata Memorial Hospital. Right from its conceptual stages in early 1941, till it became a national centre for cancer research and treatment, JRD Tata was there all along to guide its destinies. In 1957, when the government of India's ministry of health temporarily took over the Tata Memorial Hospital, JRD Tata, along with Dr Homi Bhabha, the pioneer of India's nuclear energy programme, had the vision to foresee the role of radiation in cancer treatment and prevailed on the government to have the administrative control of the hospital transferred to the department of atomic energy in 1962. He had also put his own money and efforts to set up, in 1944, the multipurpose JRD Tata Trust. Many years later, he established the JRD and Thelma J Tata Trust, selling part of his shares and an apartment in Mumbai. The Trust works to improve the lot of India's disadvantaged women. Tata Memorial Hospital What is typical of the Trust is that after establishing pioneering institutions, giving them shape and stabilising them, the Trust has handed over their day-to-day running to the Government of India. Thus, The Tata Memorial Hospital is now under the government, run by the department of atomic energy. Tata Institute of Fundamental Research The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research too has been handed over to the Atomic Energy Commission. Tata Institute of Fundamental Research today is a Deemed University. In the case of TISS and the TIFR, the chairmen of the boards have so far been the representatives of the Tata Trusts. The Trust is represented on the governing council of the Tata Memorial Hospital. However, the Trust still takes interest in these institutions and contributes its mite to their running. As neither Sir Dorabji nor Sir Ratan had any children, their holdings could well have been fragmented and with them Tata Sons. The Trusts that Sir Dorabji and Sir Ratan set up gave to Tata Sons a cohesive and a continuing character over decades. The Trust sanctioned institutional grants, as well as grants to private individuals. The total disbursal made by the Trust in the fiscal year 2003 - 2004 was Rs 442.39 million.

Formally, it is a quotient object in the category of (locally small) categories, analogous to a quotient group or quotient space, but in the categorical setting. Definition Let C be a category. A congruence relation R on C is given by: for each pair of objects X, Y in C, an equivalence relation RX,Y on Hom(X,Y), such that the equivalence relations respect composition of morphisms. That is, if :f_1,f_2 : X \\\\to Y\\\\, are related in Hom(X, Y) and :g_1,g_2 : Y \\\\to Z\\\\, are related in Hom(Y, Z), then g1f1 and g2f2 are related in Hom(X, Z). Given a congruence relation R on C we can define the quotient category C/R as the category whose objects are those of C and whose morphisms are equivalence classes of morphisms in C. That is, :\\\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{C}/R}(X,Y) = \\\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/R_{X,Y}. Composition of morphisms in C/R is well-defined since R is a congruence relation. Properties There is a natural quotient functor from C to C/R which sends each morphism to its equivalence class. This functor is bijective on objects and surjective on Hom- sets (i.e. it is a full functor). Every functor F : C ‚Üí D determines a congruence on C by saying f ~ g iff F(f) = F(g). The functor F then factors through the quotient functor C -> C/~ in a unique manner. This may be regarded as the \\"first isomorphism theorem\\" for functors. Examples * Monoids and groups may be regarded as categories with one object. In this case the quotient category coincides with the notion of a quotient monoid or a quotient group. * The homotopy category of topological spaces hTop is a quotient category of Top, the category of topological spaces. The equivalence classes of morphisms are homotopy classes of continuous maps. *Let k be a field and consider the abelian category Mod(k) of all vector spaces over k with k-linear maps as morphisms. To \\"kill\\" all finite-dimensional spaces, we can call two linear maps f,g : X -> Y congruent iff their difference has finite-dimensional image. In the resulting quotient category, all finite-dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic to 0. [This is actually an example of a quotient of additive categories, see below.]  Related concepts  =Quotients of additive categories modulo ideals= If C is an additive category and we require the congruence relation ~ on C to be additive (i.e. if f1, f2, g1 and g2 are morphisms from X to Y with f1 ~ f2 and g1 ~g2, then f1 \\\\+ f2 ~ g1 \\\\+ g2), then the quotient category C/~ will also be additive, and the quotient functor C -> C/~ will be an additive functor. The concept of an additive congruence relation is equivalent to the concept of a two-sided ideal of morphisms: for any two objects X and Y we are given an additive subgroup I(X,Y) of HomC(X, Y) such that for all f ‚àà I(X,Y), g ‚àà HomC(Y, Z) and h‚àà HomC(W, X), we have gf ‚àà I(X,Z) and fh ‚àà I(W,Y). Two morphisms in HomC(X, Y) are congruent iff their difference is in I(X,Y). Every unital ring may be viewed as an additive category with a single object, and the quotient of additive categories defined above coincides in this case with the notion of a quotient ring modulo a two-sided ideal. =Localization of a category= The localization of a category introduces new morphisms to turn several of the original category's morphisms into isomorphisms. This tends to increase the number of morphisms between objects, rather than decrease it as in the case of quotient categories. But in both constructions it often happens that two objects become isomorphic that weren't isomorphic in the original category. =Serre quotients of abelian categories= The Serre quotient of an abelian category by a Serre subcategory is a new abelian category which is similar to a quotient category but also in many cases has the character of a localization of the category.

The taxon was first described in 2006 by Xu Xing et al., who found it to represent a new taxon related to Tyrannosaurus. The name is derived from Chinese, translating as \\"crown dragon\\". Two individuals are currently known, a partially complete adult and a nearly complete juvenile. These specimens come from the Oxfordian stage of the Chinese Shishugou Formation. Description Guanlong compared to a human in size About ,Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2008) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages Supplementary Information its fossils were found in the Shishugou Formation dating to about 160 million years ago, in the Oxfordian stage of the Late Jurassic period, 92 million years before its well- known relative Tyrannosaurus. This bipedal saurischian theropod shared many traits with its descendants, and also had some unusual ones, like a large crest on its head. Unlike later tyrannosaurs, Guanlong had three long fingers on its hands. Aside from its distinctive crest, it would have resembled its close relative Dilong, and like Dilong may have had a coat of primitive feathers. Discovery The paratype specimen IVPP V14532, with its skull removed Guanlong was discovered in the Dzungaria area of China by a joint expedition by scientists from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology and George Washington University, and named by Xu Xing and others in 2006. Guanlong comes from the Chinese words for \\"crown\\", ÂÜ†, and \\"dragon\\", Èæç, referring to the crest. The specific epithet (‰∫îÂΩ©), wucaii (Hanyu Pinyin: w«îc«éi), means \\"multicoloured\\" and refers to the colours of rock of the Wucaiwan (‰∫îÂΩ©ÁÅ£, \\"5-colored bay\\", \\"multicolored bay\\"), the multi-hued badlands where the creature was found. Adult material At present, Guanlong is known from two specimens, one discovered on top of the other, with three other individual theropod dinosaurs, in the Shishugou Formation. The holotype (IVPP V14531) is a reasonably complete, partially articulated adult skeleton, and was the one on top. Another, immature specimen, the paratype IVPP V14532, is known from fully articulated and nearly complete remains. It was presumed to have been trampled, after death, by the adult. The crest on the skull of the immature specimen is notably smaller and restricted to the forward portion of the snout, while the adult has a larger and more extensive crest. The crests of both specimens are thin, delicate structures that likely served as display organs, possibly for events like mating. Classification Body restoration In a recent study, Guanlong was found to be in a clade with both Proceratosaurus and Kileskus. Together they formed the family Proceratosauridae with a clade containing Sinotyrannus, Juratyrant and Stokesosaurus. However, in 2014 another study was published, instead finding Stokesosaurus outside the family, which only included Guanlong, Proceratosaurus, Kileskus and Sinotyrannus. Below is a simplified cladogram of the later analysis, from Fiorillo & Tykoski, 2014. Paleobiology Head restoration The age of the two individuals were determined using a histological analysis. The adult was shown to have matured at 7 years of age, and died at the age of 12. The juvenile died at 6, and was still growing. As the individuals are different ages, it can be seen some of the changes that happened during growth. In the juvenile, the crest is restricted to the snout, which is proportionally shorter. The orbit is also larger, the hand comparatively larger, the lower leg is longer, the pubic bone has a less expanded end, and other features found in more derived coelurosaurs and tyrannosauroids. Guanlong possessed a cranial crest, which may have been used for display. It is similar to those of Dilophosaurus and Monolophosaurus, and like those it was highly pneumatized. However, it was more delicate than in the other genera, and also proportionately larger and more elaborate. Structures in Dilophosaurus and Monolophosaurus have also been suggested to be for species recognition, but the more gracile crest of Guanlong is more likely for display purposes.

Greek text and English translation thereof available online at the Perseus Project. The speech was delivered by Pericles, an eminent Athenian politician, at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War (431‚Äì404 BC) as a part of the annual public funeral for the war dead.  Background  It was an established Athenian practice by the late 5th century BC to hold a public funeral in honour of all those who had died in war.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.34.1‚Äì6. See also Plato, Menexenus. The remains of the deadThe bodies of the dead were cremated soon after death. The bones were kept for the funeral at the end of the year. were left in a tent for three days so that offerings could be made. Then a funeral procession was held, with ten cypress coffins carrying the remains, one for each of the Athenian tribes, and another for the remains that could not be identified. Finally they were buried at a public grave (at Kerameikos). The last part of the ceremony was a speech delivered by a prominent Athenian citizen. Several funeral orations from classical Athens are extant, which seem to corroborate Thucydides' assertion that this was a regular feature of Athenian funerary custom in wartime.The funeral orations of Lysias, Demosthenes, and Hyperides. Additionally Plato authored a possibly satirical version of a funeral oration, the Menexenus. The Funeral Oration was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his famous History of the Peloponnesian War. Although Thucydides records the speech in the first person as if it were a word for word record of what Pericles said, there can be little doubt that he edited the speech at the very least. Thucydides says early in his History that the speeches presented are not verbatim records, but are intended to represent the main ideas of what was said and what was, according to Thucydides, \\"called for in the situation\\".Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 1.22.1. We can be reasonably sure that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war, but there is no consensus as to what degree Thucydides' record resembles Pericles' actual speech.The bibliography on this topic is enormous. See , Another confusing factor is that Pericles is known to have delivered another funeral oration in 440 BC during the Samian War.Plutarch, Pericles, 28.4. It is possible that elements of both speeches are represented in Thucydides' version. Nevertheless, Thucydides was extremely meticulous in his documentation, and records the varied certainty of his sources each time. Significantly he begins recounting the speech by saying: \\"\\", i.e. \\"Pericles, son of Xanthippos, spoke like this\\". Had he quoted the speech verbatim, he would have written \\"\\" (\\"this\\", or \\"these words\\") instead of \\"\\" (\\"like this\\" or \\"words like these\\"). The authorship of the Funeral Oration is also not certain. Plato, in his Menexenus, ascribes authorship to Pericles' companion, Aspasia.Monoson, Sara (2002). \\"Plato's Opposition to the Veneration of Pericles\\". Plato's Democratic Entanglements. Hackett Publishing. . pp. 182‚Äì186  Content of the speech  The Funeral Oration is significant because it differs from the usual form of Athenian funeral speeches.On the degree of departure, see David Cartwright describes it as \\"a eulogy of Athens itself...\\". The speech glorifies Athens' achievements, designed to stir the spirits of a state still at war. = Proemium (2.35) = The speech begins by praising the custom of the public funeral for the dead, but criticises the inclusion of the speech, arguing that the \\"reputations of many brave men\\" should \\"not be imperilled in the mouth of a single individual\\".Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.35.1. Pericles argues that the speaker of the oration has the impossible task of satisfying the associates of the dead, who would wish that their deeds be magnified, while everyone else might feel jealous and suspect exaggeration.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.35.2. = Praise of the dead in war (2.36‚Äì2.42) = Pericles begins by praising the dead, as the other Athenian funeral orations do, by regard the ancestors of present-day Athenians (2.36.1‚Äì2.36.3), touching briefly on the acquisition of the empire. At this point, however, Pericles departs most dramatically from the example of other Athenian funeral orations and skips over the great martial achievements of Athens' past: \\"That part of our history which tells of the military achievements which gave us our several possessions, or of the ready valour with which either we or our fathers stemmed the tide of Hellenic or foreign aggression, is a theme too familiar to my hearers for me to dwell upon, and I shall therefore pass it by.\\"Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.36.4. Instead, Pericles proposes to focus on \\"the road by which we reached our position, the form of government under which our greatness grew, and the national habits out of which it sprang\\". This amounts to a focus on present- day Athens; Thucydides' Pericles thus decides to praise the war dead by glorifying the city for which they died.  The greatness of Athens  \\"If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences...if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbour for doing what he likes...\\"Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.37.1‚Äì2.37.2. These lines form the roots of the famous phrase \\"equal justice under law.\\" The liberality of which Pericles spoke also extended to Athens' foreign policy: \\"We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien acts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing, although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our liberality...\\"Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.39.1. Yet Athens' values of equality and openness do not, according to Pericles, hinder Athens' greatness, indeed, they enhance it, \\"...advancement in public life falls to reputations for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit...our ordinary citizens, though occupied with the pursuits of industry, are still fair judges of public matters...at Athens we live exactly as we please, and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger.\\"Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.37.1, 2.40.2, 2.39.1. In the climax of his praise of Athens, Pericles declares: \\"In short, I say that as a city we are the school of Hellas; while I doubt if the world can produce a man, who, where he has only himself to depend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a versatility as the Athenian.\\"Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.41.1. Finally, Pericles links his praise of the city to the dead Athenians for whom he is speaking, \\"...for the Athens that I have celebrated is only what the heroism of these and their like have made her...none of these men allowed either wealth with its prospect of future enjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of a day of freedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger. No, holding that vengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal blessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they joyfully determined to accept the risk... Thus, choosing to die resisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from dishonour...\\"Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.42.2, 2.42.4. The conclusion seems inevitable: \\"Therefore, having judged that to be happy means to be free, and to be free means to be brave, do not shy away from the risks of war\\". With the linkage of Athens' greatness complete, Pericles moves to addressing his audience. = Praise for the military of Athens = In his speech, Pericles states that he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the citizens of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers whom he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies' the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt in the mind of the doubtful. He explained that fighting for one's country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations ‚Äì they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city. = Exhortation to the living (2.43‚Äì2.44) = Pericles then turns to the audience and exhorts them to live up to the standards set by the deceased, \\"So died these men as becomes Athenians. You, their survivors, must determine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field, though you may pray that it may have a happier outcome.\\"Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.43.1. = Epilogue (2.45‚Äì2.46) = Pericles ends with a short epilogue, reminding the audience of the difficulty of the task of speaking over the dead. The audience is then dismissed.  Language and translations  Thucydides' Greek is notoriously difficult, but the language of Pericles Funeral Oration is considered by many to be the most difficult and virtuosic passage in the History of the Peloponnesian War. The speech is full of rhetorical devices, such as antithesis, anacoluthon, asyndeton, anastrophe, hyperbaton, and others; most famously the rapid succession of proparoxytone words beginning with e (\\"\\" [judging courage freedom and freedom happiness]) at the climax of the speech (43.4). The style is deliberately elaborate, in accord with the stylistic preference associated with the sophists. There are several different English translations of the speech available. Peter Aston wrote a choral version, So they gave their bodies, published in 1976.  Modern parallels of the Pericles' Funeral Oration  American Civil War scholars Louis Warren and Garry Wills have addressed the parallels of Pericles' funeral oration to Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address.Garry Wills, Lincoln at Gettysburg (New York: Simon and Schuster 1992) pp. 182, 212 and appendix IIIb. Lincoln's speech, like Pericles': * Begins with an acknowledgement of revered predecessors: \\"Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent...\\" * Praises the uniqueness of the State's commitment to democracy: \\"...a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal...government of the people, by the people, and for the people...\\" * Addresses the difficulties faced by a speaker on such an occasion, \\"...we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground\\" * Exhorts the survivors to emulate the deeds of the dead, \\"It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the great task remaining before us\\" * Contrasts the efficacy of words and deeds, \\"The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract...The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\\" It is uncertain to what degree, if any, Lincoln was directly influenced by Pericles' funeral oration. Wills never claims that Lincoln drew on it as a source, though Edward Everett, who delivered a lengthy oration at the same ceremony at Gettysburg, began by describing the \\"Athenian example\\".Garry Wills, Lincoln at Gettysburg (New York: Simon and Schuster 1992) pp. 41‚Äì42, appendix IIIa.

Her best-known book, Photographie et soci√©t√© (1974), is about the uses and abuses of the photographic medium in the age of technological reproduction. In 1977, she became President of the French Association of Photographers, and in 1981, she took the official portrait of French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand. She was made Officier des Arts et Lettres in 1982 and Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur, the highest decoration in France, in 1983. In 1991, she became the first photographer to be honored with a retrospective at the Mus√©e National d‚Äôart Moderne in Paris (Centre Georges Pompidou).Meeker, Carlene. Jewish Women's Archive Freund's major contributions to photography include using the Leica Camera (with its 36 frames) for documentary reportage and her early experimentation with Kodachrome and 35 mm Agfacolor, which allowed her to develop a \\"uniquely candid portraiture style\\" that distinguishes her in 20th century photography.Zox-Weaver, Annalisa. \\"Gisele Freund.\\" Encyclopedia of Twentieth- Century Photography. Ed. Lynne Warren. (564-566). She is buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris, France near her home and studio at 12 rue Lalande. Biography Max Slevogt, Portrait of Julius Freund, 1925. Freund was born into a textile merchant family on 19 December 1908 to Julius and Clara (nee Dressel) Freund, a wealthy Jewish couple in the Sch√∂neberg district of Berlin. Her father, Julius Freund, was a keen art collector with an interest in the work of photographer Karl Blossfeldt, whose close-up studies explored the forms of natural objects. Freund's father bought Gis√®le her first camera, a Voigtl√§nder 6x9 in 1925 and a Leica camera as a present for her graduation in 1929.Stiftung Stadtmuseum Catalogue for \\"Gis√®le Freund: A Revisit to Berlin, 1957-1962\\" In 1931, Freund studied sociology and art history at Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg, Breisgau, Germany; and from 1932-33 she studied at the Institute for Social, Sciences, University of Frankfurt under Theodor W. Adorno, Karl Mannheim and Norbert Elias (also known as the Frankfurt School). At university she became an active member of a student socialist group and was determined to use photography as an integral part of her socialist practice. One of her first stories, shot on May 1, 1932, \\"shows a recent march of anti-fascist students\\" who had been \\"regularly attacked by Nazi groups.\\" The photos show Walter Benjamin, a good friend of Freund, and Bertolt Brecht. In March 1933, a month after Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany, Walter Benjamin fled to Paris on May 30, Gis√®le followed him since she was both a socialist activist and a Jew. She escaped to Paris with her negatives strapped around her body to get them past the border guards. Gis√®le and Walter Benjamin would continue their friendship in Paris, where Freund would famously photograph him reading at the National Library. They both studied and wrote about art in the 19th and 20th centuries as Freund continued her studies at the Sorbonne. In 1935, Andre Malraux invited Freund to document First International Congress in Defence of Culture in Paris, where she was introduced to and subsequently photographed many of the notable French artists of her day. Freund befriended the famed literary partners, Sylvia Beach of Shakespeare and Company, and Adrienne Monnier of Maison des Amis des Livres. In 1935, Monnier arranged a marriage of convenience for Freund with Pierre Blum so that Freund could obtain a visa to remain in France legally (they officially divorced after the war in 1948). In 1936, while Sylvia Beach was visiting the United States, Freund moved into Monnier and Beach's shared apartment and they became intimates. When Beach returned, she ended her intimate relationship with Monnier yet maintained a strong friendship with both Monnier and Freund.The Very Rich Hours of Adrienne Monnier. viii Freund finished her Ph.D. in Sociology and Art at the Sorbonne in 1936,Zox-Weaver, Annalisa and Monnier published the doctoral dissertation as \\"La photographie en France au dix-neuvieme si√®cle,\\" under the La Maison des Amis des Livres imprint by Monnier. Monnier \\"introduced [Freund] to the artists and writers who would prove her most captivating subjects.\\"Zox-Weaver Later that year, Freund became internationally famous with her photojournalistic piece, \\"Northern England,\\" which was published in Life (magazine) on December 14, 1936 and showed the effects of the depression in England. No magazine in France could publish color photographs at that time, so Freund's work with Life‚Äîone of the first color mass magazines‚Äîwould start a lifelong relationship between the photographer and magazine. In 1938, Monnier suggested that Freund photograph James Joyce for his upcoming book, Finnegans Wake. Joyce, who disliked being photographed, invited Freund to his Paris flat for a private screening of her previous work. He was impressed enough by Freund's work to allow her to photograph him, and over a period of three days, she captured the most intimate portraits of Joyce during his time in Paris.Freund, Gisele. James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years Gis√®le Freund's gravestone at Montparnasse Graveyard, Paris. In 1939, after being \\"twice refused admission to Tavistock Square,\\" Freund gained the confidence of Virginia Woolf and captured the iconic color photographs of the Woolfs on display in the English National Portrait Gallery. Woolf even \\"agreed to change her clothes to see which best suited the colour harmony and insisted on being photographed with Leonard (and their spaniel Pinka). In some of the prints, Woolf is pale and lined, in others smiling a little and more youthful. The background of fabrics and mural panels by Bell and Grant adds to the value of the images; this was the inner sanctum of the queen of Bloomsbury where parties were given and friends came to tea. Just over a year later the house was destroyed in The Blitz.\\" On June 10, 1940,Freund, Gisele. The World in My Camera with the Nazi invasion of Paris looming, Freund escaped Paris to Free France in the Dordogne. Her husband by convenience, Pierre, had been captured by the Nazis and sent to a prison camp. He was able to escape and met with Freund before going back to Paris to fight in the Resistance. As the wife of an escaped prisoner, a Jew, and a Socialist, Freund \\"feared for her life.\\"The World in My Camera In 1942, with the help of Andr√© Malraux, who told his friends, \\"we must save Gisele!,\\"Daley, Suzanne, \\"Gisele Freund Is Dead at 91; Photographed Paris Writers.\\" New York Times, April 1, 2000 Freund fled to Buenos Aires, Argentina \\"at the invitation of Victoria Ocampo, director of the periodical Sur.

She writes, \\"In reality, I started this for the De Gaulle government in exile where I was working in the Information ministry, volontairement without payment.\\"Letter to Verna B. Carleton, January 7, 1965 She also founds a relief action committee for French artists and becomes a spokesperson for Free France. In 1947, Freund signed a contract with Magnum Photos as a Latin America contributor, but by 1954, she was declared persona non grata by the U.S. Government at the height of the Red Scare for her socialist views, and Robert Capa forced her to break ties with Magnum. In 1950, her photocoverage of a bejewelled Eva Peron for Life (magazine) caused a diplomatic stir between the United States and Argentina and upset many of Peron's supporters‚Äîthe ostentatious photographs went against the official party line of austerity; Life Magazine was blacklisted in Argentina, and once again, Freund had to escape a country with her negatives. She moved to Mexico and became friends with Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jose Clemente Orozco.Stiftung Stadtmuseum Catalogue for \\"Gisele Freund: A Revisit to Berlin, 1957-1962\\" In 1953, she moved back to Paris permanently. Over the life of her career, she went on over 80 photojournalism assignments, primarily for Life (magazine) and \\"Time (magazine)\\", but also Du, The Sunday Times (London), Vu, Picture Post, Weekly Illustrated, and Paris-Match (magazine), among others. From the 1960s onward, Freund continued to write, and her reputation as an important portrait photographer grew with each successive exhibition. She is now celebrated as one of the best portrait photographers of the twentieth century: Upon her death, \\"President Jacques Chirac praised her as 'one of the world's greatest photographers.. Notable work In 1936 Freund photographed the effects of the Depression in England for Life Magazine. Freund's dissertation was published in book form by Adrienne Monnier (1892‚Äì1955). One of her best-known early works shows her friends Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht participating in one of the last political street demonstrations in Germany before Hitler took power. In 1938, Freund had the opportunity to photograph James Joyce in Paris through her connections with Adrienne Monnier and Sylvia Beach. Joyce hated being photographed, and during one of the sessions he hit his head on a light, which cut his forehead. Joyce exclaimed, \\"I'm bleeding. Your damned photos will be the death of me,\\" which he said, \\"forgetting in his pain that he had made it a rule never to swear in the presence of a lady.\\"\\"On Photographing Joyce\\" in James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years (4). Freund was in a taxi crash right after the photo-session, which caused her cameras to crash to the ground. She called Joyce and said, \\"Mr. Joyce, you damned my photos ‚Äî you put some kind of a bad Irish spell on them and my taxi crashed. I was almost killed and your photos are ruined\\". Being superstitious, Joyce was convinced that his cursing in front of a lady had caused the crash, so he invited Freund back to his home for a second round of photographs.\\"On Photographing Joyce,\\" in James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years (5). Time Magazine used one of these photos for its cover on May 8, 1939. The entire series of photographs would eventually be published in 1965 in James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years by Freund and V. B. Carleton and a Preface by Simone de Beauvoir. Freund became famous for her portraits of literary geniuses, including Samuel Beckett, Virginia Woolf, George Bernard Shaw and many others. In 1981, Freund made her official portrait of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, who was President of France (1981‚Äì1995). In Freund's obituary for The New York Times, Suzanne Daley writes, \\"[Freund] specialized in conveying the attitude of her subjects. She focused on hands, body posture and clothing. Reviewing an exhibition of her life's work in 1979, Hilton Kramer wrote in The New York Times that she excelled in 'brilliant documentation rather than originality.' In a 1996 interview, Ms. Freund said she read her subjects' work and often spent hours discussing their books with them before taking a portrait.\\" Indeed, it was Freund's ability to connect with writers and artists‚Äîespecially the famously difficult James Joyce‚Äîthat gave her the ability to photograph them with their guard down. Quotations From \\"Photographer\\" (1985) * \\"For a writer, his portrait is the only link he can establish with his readers. When we read a book whose content moves us, we are interested to look at the author's face, which is generally printed on the jacket since the publisher is aware of our wish to see if these features correspond to the idea we have formed of the author. This image is thus very important to the man of letters. He prefers a photographer in whom he can have confidence.\\" From Photography & Society * \\"The lens, the so-called impartial eye, actually permits every possible distortion of reality: the character of the image is determined by the photographer's point of view and the demands of his patrons. The importance of photography does not rest primarily in its potential as an art form, but rather in its ability to shape our ideas, to influence our behaviour, and to define our society\\" (4). * \\"In our technological age, when industry is always trying to create new needs, the photographic industry has expanded enormously because the photograph meets modem man's pressing need to express his own individuality\\" (5). * Although the first inventor of photography, Nic√©phore Ni√©pce, tried desperately to have his invention recognized, his efforts were in vain and he died in misery. Few people know his name today. But photography, which he discovered, has become the most common language of our civilization\\" (218). * \\"When you do not like human beings, you cannot make good portraits.\\" Exhibitions Michel Dieuzaide (1981) Gis√®le Freund (second at right) at the opening of her exhibition at Galerie municipale du Ch√¢teau d'eau, Toulouse, March 1981 with (from left) Michel Tournier, Jean Dieuzaide, Michel Delaborde, unidentified woman. * 2015 \\"Frida Kahlo: Mirror, Mirror.\\" (Throckmorton Fine Art, New York) * 2014 \\"Gis√®le Freund: Photographic scenes and portraits\\" (Berlin, Academy of Arts) * 2014 \\"From Paris to Victoria: Gis√®le Freund's James Joyce Photographs.\\" University of Victoria, Canada * 2011-2012 \\"Gis√®le Freund: L'≈íil fronti√®re, Paris 1933-1940\\", (Fondation Pierre Berg√© - Yves Saint Laurent) * 2008 \\"Gis√®le Freund, ritratti d'autore\\" Galleria Carla Sozzani, Milan, Italy;

The urban renaissance of the United Kingdom is the recent period of repopulation and regeneration of many British cities, including Birmingham,The beginnings of an urban renaissance? Recent migration flows into and out of English cities, as revealed in a new study, just may be the glimmerings of a new pro-urban movem... Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, and parts of London after a period of inner city urban decay and suburbanisation during the mid-20th century. The most common equivalent term used in North America is New Urbanism. Regeneration was achieved through a number of initiatives including tax incentives and the lifting of some planning restrictions, as well as positive state intervention encouraging business and residents back into city centre areas. Urban renaissance deals with the negative impact of major factors driving change in urban areas such as technical revolution, ecological threat and social transformation. It differs from the New Urbanism popular in North America, but could be considered the British equivalent. Large developments such as the London Docklands project have helped to encourage people back into the city, assisted by gentrification. Often redundant land, such as 17th and 18th-century canals and docks, railway yards and derelict industrial sites have been the focus of regeneration by agencies such as 'urban renewal companies' and 'regional development agencies'. The most common re-development is mixed use, with flats, townhouse and offices, often with public art and high-quality streetscapes. Derelict but attractive historical buildings have been converted into residential or commercial premises (dubbed \\"loft apartments\\" in the US) with generous grants or tax relief. In the United States, efforts to revitalise urban areas often involve ideas of downtown/city centre as an art and cultural hub or arts district, somewhat akin to Richard Florida's concept of making the urban core friendly to the Creative Class. City leaders may promote events such as First Friday art walks and the construction of convention centers and theatres in order to attract visitors who live in suburbs. Many American cities have renaissance-themed agency and building. An example is the Renaissance Center and Detroit Renaissance Board in the city of Detroit, Michigan. Many American cities have seen at least a modest bounce in interest in core cities and older neighborhoods in recent years with a special emphasis on condominium projects, often in formerly non- residential structures. Criticism In a 2008 report, the Policy Exchange think tank argued that policies to regenerate struggling cities over the previous ten, twenty, or even fifty years have failed - \\"we can‚Äôt buck economic geography... Places that enjoyed the conditions for creating wealth in the coal-powered 19th-century are often poorly positioned today. There is no realistic prospect that our regeneration towns and cities can converge with London and the South East. There is, however, a very real prospect of encouraging significant numbers of people to move from those towns to London and the South East.\\" The report was criticised by a number of British politicians.

Cardinal Pole in the cathedral Becket was murdered in the north transept of the cathedral on 29 December 1170. Four years later a disastrous fire destroyed the eastern end of the church. After William of Sens had rebuilt the Choir, William the Englishman added the immense Corona as a shrine for the crown of St. Thomas (with a new shrine for the main relics in the form of the Trinity Chapel between the Corona and the Choir). The shrine was not installed in the Corona until 1220, in a ceremony at which the king, Henry III, assisted. The anniversary of the occasion was celebrated each year as the Feast of the Translation of the Blessed St Thomas, until suppressed by royal injunction in 1536. The income from pilgrims who visited Becket's shrine, which was regarded as a place of healing, largely paid for the subsequent rebuilding of the Cathedral and its associated buildings. In 1538 Henry VIII allegedly summoned the dead saint to court to face charges of treason. Having failed to appear within thirty days, he was tried in his absence, and found guilty. Becket's remains were buried, and the treasures of his shrine confiscated, carried away in two coffers and twenty-six carts. Archbishop Cardinal Reginald Pole was also buried in the Corona.

There is very little scientific data about the benefits of vocal warm-ups. Relatively few studies have researched the effects of these exercises on muscle function and even fewer have studied their effect on singing-specific outcomes. Description Vocal warm ups are intended to accomplish five things: a physical whole-body warm-up, preparing the breath, preparing the articulators and resonators, moving from the spoken register to the singing register (or an extended spoken register for acting), and preparing for the material that is going to be rehearsed or performed. Physical whole-body warm-ups help prepare a singer or actor's body in many ways. Muscles all over the body are used when singing/acting. Stretching helps to activate and prepare the large muscle groups that take care of balance and posture, and the smaller muscle groups that are directly involved with breathing and facial articulation. Stretches of the abdomen, back, neck, and shoulders are important to avoid tension, which influences the sound of the voice through constriction of the larynx and/or breathing muscles. Actors (including opera singers or musical theatre performers) may need to do a more comprehensive physical warm-up if their role is demanding physically. Preparing the breath involves not only stretching the many muscles involved with respiration, but preparing them to sustain exhalation during long singing/speaking passages. Specific training of the respiratory muscles is required for singers to take very quick deep breath and sustain their exhalation over many bars of music. A good vocal warm-up should include exercises such as inhaling for 4 counts, then exhaling for 8 counts (and slowly transitioning until the performer can inhale for 1 count and exhale for as long as possible); panting or puffing air are also used to engage in the intercostal muscles. Vocal articulation is controlled by a variety of tissues, muscles, and structures (place of articulation), but can be basically understood as the effects of the lips, the teeth, and the tip of the tongue. Often we also try and use our jaw for articulation, which creates unnecessary tension in the facial muscles and tongue. A good vocal warm up will relax the jaw, while activating the lips and the tongue in a variety of exercises to stretch the muscles and prepare for the more defined vocal articulation that is required when singing or acting. These exercises may include tongue twisters, or the famous \\"me, may, ma, moh, moo\\" that many actors are seen doing in film. Resonators are the hard and soft surfaces within the oral cavity that affect the sound waves produced during phonation. Hard surfaces, such as the hard palate, cannot be controlled by the singer, but soft surfaces, such as the soft palate, can be trained to change the timbre of the sound. A vocal warm up should include exercises which direct sound towards these hard and soft surfaces ‚Äì these exercises can incorporate a variety of sound effects, including whoops, wails, and nasal sounds. Other exercises can help singers/actors be aware of lifting the soft palate, which can create a darker richer timbre when singing ‚Äì an example would be simulating a sudden shocked gasp, and then maintaining the openness at the back of the mouth. Changing pitch undoubtedly stretches the vocal muscles,Elliot N, Sundberg J, Gramming P, Iwarsson J. Effects of vocal warmup, part II. 23rd Annual Symposium Care of the Professional Voice, Philadelphia, June 1994. and singing or projecting one's voice for acting requires a more strenuous use of these muscles. A good vocal warm-up should move the singer/actor from the spoken register (small pitch range, small dynamic range, colloquial diction) into the singing register (large pitch range, large dynamic range, and diction specific to the demands of the role or piece). This is often the largest and most complex part of the vocal warm-up, and requires a multitude of exercises. These exercises also provide voice training, and are sometimes called vocalises. These activities teach breath control, diction, blending, and balance. A vocalise is a vocal exercise (often one suitable for performance) without words, which is sung on one or more vowel sounds.Owen Jander. \\"Vocalise.\\" Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy. Accessed 25 Jun 05 (subscription access). Lastly, a good vocal warm-up should prepare the specific material that is going to be rehearsed or performed (usually a vocal warm-up is a precursor to either rehearsal or performance). This could be as simple as doing some exercises in the key that is to be sung, or with the accent that an actor must use for their role. Certain difficult passages of the forthcoming repertoire might be broken down and used as an exercise, and any language requirements must be prepared (if the performer is singing in their non-native language, they will want to do exercises to prepare for the sounds and shapes which are required in that language). When a vocal warm-up is led by a director (either musical or theatrical), it also provides an important opportunity to assess the vocal abilities of the singers/actors at hand without the distraction of the repertoire and to specifically train areas of weakness. For some, their director will be the only voice teacher they ever work with, so the vocal warm-up is the only time where they receive specific training for the muscles required by their craft. Vocalise =Classical music= Vocalises date back to the mid-18th century. Jean-Antoine B√©rard's 1755 compilation L'art du chant includes a selection of songs without words (sans paroles) by composers such as Lully (1632‚Äì1687) and Rameau (1683‚Äì1764), chosen for their value as exercises in vocal technique. Accompanying the exercises are instructions on mastering the technical challenges they pose. By the 19th century, vocalises were commonly composed specifically for pedagogical purposes rather than being adapted from existing songs. A related tradition of vocalises sprang up in the 19th century with wordless technical etudes set to piano accompaniment. This followed the fashion of the time of setting even the most mechanical of √©tudes to piano accompaniment with the thought that this would inspire the performer to execute the music more artistically. In the early 20th century, many orchestral scores incorporated wordless choruses (especially female choruses) for coloristic effects, and such choruses may be found in works by Debussy, Ravel, Vaughan Williams, Holst, and in many film scores. Notable examples * Gabriel Faur√©: Vocalise-√©tude (1906) * Maurice Ravel: Vocalise-√©tude en forme de habanera, M.51, for voice and piano (1907) * Igor Stravinsky: Pastorale for soprano (1907) * Carl Nielsen: Symphony No. 3, Op. 27: second movement (1911) * Sergei Rachmaninoff: Vocalise, Op. 34, No. 14, for soprano (1912) * Nikolai Medtner: Sonata-Vocalise, Op. 41, No. 1 (1922) and Suite-Vocalise, Op. 41, No. 2 (1927) * Heitor Villa-Lobos: Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5: first movement (1938) * Reinhold Gli√®re: Concerto for Coloratura Soprano and Orchestra, Op. 82 (1943) * John Corigliano: Vocalise, for soprano, electronics and orchestra (1999) * Gilad Hochman: Night Winds, vocalise for soprano and piano (2015) =Jazz and world music= Vocalese (with the -ese suffix) refers to a type of jazz singing in which new words are created and sung to existing instrumental improvisations. Both The Swingle Singers and Jon Hendricks famously combined both these techniques. This style is pre-composed (i.e. not improvised); therefore, it is not to be confused with scat singing, which is wordless improvisation. The 1929 gospel blues song \\"I Had a Good Father and Mother\\" by Washington Phillips has a vocalise as refrain. In Indian classical music, the tradition of aakar is used as a vocal exercise before singing, and also to a certain extent adds to the singing and the melody.

It consists of 55 member associations, each of which is responsible for governing football in their respective countries. All widely recognised sovereign states located entirely within Europe are members, with the exceptions of the United Kingdom, Monaco and Vatican City. Eight states partially or entirely outside Europe are also members: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Israel, Cyprus and Turkey. The United Kingdom is divided into the four separate football associations of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales; each association has a separate UEFA membership. The Faroe Islands, an autonomous country of the Kingdom of Denmark, also has its own football association which is a member of UEFA. The football association of Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, was approved as a member by UEFA in 2013. Kosovo was approved as a member in 2016, even though it is claimed by Serbia and is not recognised by several other UEFA member states. Each UEFA member has its own football league system, except Liechtenstein. Clubs playing in each top-level league compete for the title as the country's club champions. Clubs also compete in the league and national cup competitions for places in the following season's UEFA club competitions, the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. Due to promotion and relegation, the clubs playing in the top-level league are different every season, except in San Marino and Gibraltar where there is only one level. Some clubs play in a national football league other than their own country's. Where this is the case the club is noted as such. UEFA coefficients The UEFA league coefficients, also known as the UEFA rankings, are used to rank the leagues of Europe, and thus determine the number of clubs from a league that will participate in UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. A country's ranking determines the number of teams competing in the season after the next; the 2009 rankings determined qualification for European competitions in the 2010‚Äì11 season. A country's ranking is calculated based on the results of its clubs in UEFA competitions over the past five seasons. Two points are awarded for each win by a club, and one for a draw. If a game goes to extra time, the result at the end of time is used to calculate ranking points; if the match goes to a penalty shootout, it is considered to be a draw for the purposes of the coefficient system. The number of points awarded to a country's clubs are added together, and then divided by the number of clubs that participated in European competitions that season. This number is then rounded to three decimal places; two and two-thirds would become 2.667. For the league coefficient the season's league coefficients for the last five seasons must be added up. In the preliminary rounds of both the Champions League and Europa League, the awarded points are halved. Bonus points for certain achievements are added to the number of points scored in a season. Bonus points are allocated for: *Qualifying for the Champions League group phase. (4 bonus points) *Reaching the second round of the Champions League. (5 bonus points) *Reaching the quarter, semi and final of both Champions League and Europa League. (1 bonus point)  Current champions  The below map displays the locations of the current champions of the UEFA countries (except Liechtenstein, which does not organise a domestic championship). The map is correct as of the end of the 2019‚Äì20 season. The current champions of Cyprus, Gibraltar, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands are actually those of the 2018‚Äì19 season, and are shown in italics below.

Tirana are the most successful team in the league's history, having won the competition on 24 occasions, followed by FK Dinamo Tirana (now playing in the second division) with 18 championships, and Partizani with 16. The league became affiliated with UEFA in 1954. Since the 2014‚Äì15 season, 10 teams compete in the division. The teams finishing in the bottom two places are relegated to the Albanian First Division and are replaced by the champions of each of that league's two groups. Clubs and locations as of 2019‚Äì20 season: =Andorra= * Country: Andorra * Football association: Andorran Football Federation * Top-level league: Andorran First Division () * UEFA ranking: 54th * Soccerway profile: here Andorra's national league system was formed in 1993, and the Andorran Football Federation gained UEFA membership in 1996. Records from the league's first three seasons are incomplete, but FC Santa Coloma have won more First Division titles than any other team, with at least 13.CE Principat have three titles, and were runners-up in the 1993‚Äì94 season, meaning that they cannot match Santa Coloma's six confirmed league titles. Another Andorran football club, FC Andorra, play in the Spanish football league system. In recent years, eight teams have competed in the First Division. Each team plays two matches against the other seven clubs. After fourteen games, the league splits into two groups, with teams carrying their previous points totals forward. The top four teams play each other a further two times in the championship round to decide 1st‚Äì4th places, while the bottom four teams do likewise in the relegation round, to determine the 5th‚Äì8th positions. At the end of the season, the bottom-placed team is relegated, while the seventh-placed team plays a two-legged play-off against the second-placed team in the Second Division to decide which team plays in which division for the following season.

Organised football had been played in Armenia since 1936, as part of the Soviet football system. The Football Federation of Armenia gained UEFA affiliation in 1992, and the league ran as the national championship for the first time in the same year. Since independence, the country's most successful team is Pyunik, who has won 14 league titles.

Following the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, the first independent Azeri championship took place in 1992, and the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan gained UEFA affiliation in 1994 Since independence, the country's most successful team is Neft√ßi Baku, with eight league titles. In recent years, 10 teams had competed in the Azerbaijan Premier League, but two teams that otherwise would have competed in the 2016‚Äì17 season were denied professional licenses, making it an eight-team league at present. Clubs and locations as of 2019‚Äì20 season: =Belarus= * Country: Belarus * Football association: Football Federation of Belarus * Top- level league: Belarusian Premier League () * UEFA ranking: 24th * Soccerway profile: here Belarus declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. Its independence was widely recognised within Europe in 1991, an independent national championship began in 1992, and UEFA membership followed in 1993. Through the 2018 season, the most successful team is BATE Borisov, with 15 league championships, including an ongoing streak of 13 titles. The 2016 season saw the league expand from 14 teams to 16, accomplished by promoting three clubs from the Belarusian First League and relegating only the last- place team in the 2015 Premier League. At the end of the season, the bottom two teams are relegated to the First League and replaced by that league's top two finishers. Clubs and locations as of 2019 season: =Belgium= * Country: Belgium * Football association: Royal Belgian Football Association * Top-level league: Belgian First Division A (, , ) * UEFA ranking: 8th * Soccerway profile: here Organised football reached Belgium in the 19th century; the Royal Belgian Football Association was founded in 1895, and FC Li√©geois became the country's first champions the following year. Belgium joined European football's governing body, UEFA, upon its formation in 1954. Historically the country's most successful team are Anderlecht, with 34 league titles as of 2019. The Belgian First Division A, historically known as the First Division and also known as the Pro League from 2008‚Äì09 through 2015‚Äì16, currently consists of 16 teams. Initially, each team plays the other clubs twice for a total of 30 matches. At this point, the league proceeds as follows (as of the current 2016‚Äì17 season): * The top six teams take half of their points (rounded up) into a championship play-off, playing each other two further times to determine the national champion. * The teams finishing the regular season between 7th and 15th enter one of two six-team groups. The remaining teams in this competition are the top three teams from the Belgian First Division B (historically known as the Second Division), excluding that division's champion (which earns automatic promotion to First Division A). Each team plays the other five teams in its group home and away, and the winners of each group play one another in a two-legged play-off. The winner of that match advances to a two-legged play-off against the fourth- or fifth- place team (depending on results) from the championship play-off for the country's final UEFA Europa League place for the following season. * The bottom team on the regular-season table is automatically relegated to First Division B. Clubs and locations as of 2019‚Äì20 season: =Bosnia and Herzegovina= * Country: Bosnia and Herzegovina * Football association: Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina * Top-level league: Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina () * UEFA ranking: 40th * Soccerway profile: here Prior to gaining independence from Yugoslavia, clubs from Bosnia and Herzegovina were eligible to compete in the Yugoslav First League, which they won three times. The country gained independence in 1992, and its Football Association gained UEFA membership in 1998. Due to political tensions between Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats, the country did not have a single national top division until the 2002‚Äì03 season, but rather two or three. Since then, Zrinjski Mostar have won six titles, ≈Ωeljezniƒçar and Sarajevo have each won three, ≈†iroki Brijeg have won twice and three other teams have won it once each. Since the 2016‚Äì17 season, the Premier League has consisted of 12 clubs, reduced from 16 in previous seasons. The 2016‚Äì17 season was the first for a two-stage season. In the first stage, each team plays all others home and away, after which the league splits into two six-team groups that also play home and away. The top six teams play for the championship and European qualifying places; the bottom six play to avoid relegation. At the end of the second stage, the bottom two clubs of the relegation group drop to either the First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina or the First League of the Republika Srpska. Clubs and locations as of 2019‚Äì20 season: =Bulgaria= * Country: Bulgaria * Football association: Bulgarian Football Union * Top-level league: First Professional Football League (; short form \\"Parva Liga\\" [–ü—ä—Ä–≤–∞ –ª–∏–≥–∞]) * UEFA ranking: 27th * Soccerway profile: here A national Bulgarian championship has been held in every year since 1924, although the 1924, 1927 and 1944 seasons were not completed. The country gained UEFA membership in 1954. Historically, the most successful teams in Bulgarian football have been CSKA Sofia and Levski Sofia; no other team has won more than ten league titles. In recent years, Ludogorets Razgrad has dominated the league; although the team did not make its first appearance in the top flight until 2011‚Äì12, it has won the championship in each of its first eight seasons at that level. The 2015‚Äì16 season was intended to have 12 teams, but was reduced to 10 after four clubs (the two clubs that would otherwise have been promoted to what was then known as the A Group, plus two from the previous season's A Group) were denied professional licenses. Following that season, the Bulgarian Football Union revamped the country's professional league structure, expanding the top flight to 14 teams and changing that league's name from \\"A Group\\" to \\"First League\\". Under the current structure that began in 2016‚Äì17, each team plays the others twice, once at each club's stadium. At the end of the season the league splits into separate playoffs, with table points and statistics carrying over in full. The top six teams enter a championship playoff, with each team playing the others home and away. The top finisher is league champion and enters the UEFA Champions League; the second-place team earns a place in the UEFA Europa League; and the third-place team (or fourth-place team, should the winner of that season's Bulgarian Cup finish in the top three) advances to a playoff for the country's final Europa League place. The bottom eight split into two four- team groups, playing home and away within each group. The top two teams from each group enter a knockout playoff consisting of two-legged matches (note, however, that if one of these four teams is the Bulgarian Cup winner, it is withdrawn from the playoff and its opponent receives a bye into the final). The winner of this playoff then plays the third-place team in a one-off match for the final Europa League place. The bottom two clubs from each group enter an identical knockout playoff. The winner remains in the First League; the other three teams face a series of relegation playoffs that also include the second- and third-place clubs from the Second League, with places for only two of these five teams in the next season's First League. Clubs and locations as of 2019‚Äì20 season: =Croatia= * Country: Croatia * Football association: Croatian Football Federation * Top-level league: Croatian First Football League () * UEFA ranking: 18th * Soccerway profile: here National Croatian leagues were organised in 1914 and during the Second World War, but during peacetime Croatia's biggest clubs competed in the Yugoslav First League. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, a national football league was formed in 1992, and the Croatian Football Federation gained UEFA membership in 1993. Since its formation, the Croatian First League has been dominated by Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split; as of the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season, one of these teams has won the title in all but two of the league's 28 seasons. Since the 2013‚Äì14 season, the First League has consisted of 10 teams. At the end of the season, the 10th-placed team is relegated directly to the second division, while the 9th-placed team enters a relegation play-off.

The inaugural competition was won by Preston North End, who remained unbeaten throughout the entire season. It was the top level football league in England from its foundation until 1992, when the 22 clubs comprising the First Division resigned from the Football League to form the new FA Premier League. As of the 2019‚Äì20 season the Premier League comprises 20 clubs; each team plays every other team twice, with the bottom 3 clubs at the end of the season relegated to the EFL Championship. The most successful domestic club is Manchester United, who have won the league 20 times, while the most successful English club in Europe is Liverpool, who have won 6 European Cups, 3 UEFA Cups and 4 UEFA Super Cups, more than any other English team. Clubs and locations as of 2019‚Äì20 season: =Estonia= * Country: Estonia * Football association: Estonian Football Association * Top-level league: Estonian Premier Division () * UEFA ranking: 51st * Soccerway profile: here An independent Estonian league took place between 1921 and 1940. However, after the Second World War it became part of the Soviet Union, and became a regional system. Estonia regained independence after the dissolution of the USSR, organising the first national championship in 52 years in 1992, the same year that the Estonian Football Association joined UEFA. FC Flora is the most successful team in the modern era, with 11 league titles as of the end of the 2018 season. Since 2005, the Premier Division has consisted of 10 teams, which play one another four times. At the end of the season the bottom team is relegated to the second level of Estonian football, while the ninth-placed team enters into a relegation playoff.

The most successful team are HJK with 29 titles; as of 2018, no other team has won 10 or more. However, between 1920 and 1948 a rival championship operated, organised by the Finnish Workers' Sports Federation. Frequent champions in that competition before it came under the jurisdiction of the Football Association of Finland included Kullervo Helsinki, Vesa Helsinki and Tampereen Pallo-Veikot. The Premier League consists of 12 teams. Since 2019 season teams play one another two times, then the top 6 teams play the championship round, and the bottom 6 the relegation round. At the end of the season the bottom club is relegated to the First Division, and the second-last club contests a in a play-off with the 2nd team of the First Division.

The first French championship was first held in 1894, but only featured teams from the capital, Paris. Between 1896 and 1912, national championships were organised by several competing federations; the first universally recognised national championship took place in the 1912‚Äì13 season. However, it only lasted two seasons; from the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, French football operated on a regional basis until 1932. A national league resumed between 1932 and 1939, and has operated annually since the conclusion of the Second World War in 1945. Ligue 1 and its predecessors have featured 20 teams since the 1946‚Äì47 season. Each team plays the other nineteen sides home and away, and at the end of the season the bottom three teams are relegated to Ligue 2. So far, Olympique de Marseille are the only French club to have won the UEFA Champions League, in 1993.

The first independent championship took place in 1990, despite the fact that Georgia remained a Soviet state until 1991. Upon independence, Georgia subsequently joined UEFA and FIFA in 1992. When Georgia organised its first independent championship, it operated with a spring-to- autumn season contained entirely within a calendar year. After the 1991 championship, the country transitioned to an autumn-to-spring season spanning two calendar years. This format continued through the 2015‚Äì16 season, after which it returned to a spring-to-autumn format. This was accomplished by holding an abbreviated 2016 season in autumn; the transition was completed for the 2017 season.

The Football Federation of Ukraine was formed shortly after the country achieved independence in 1991, and gained UEFA membership the following year. Since the formation of a national league, Dynamo Kyiv have won 15 titles, Shakhtar Donetsk 12, and Tavriya Simferopol one, as of the most recently completed 2018‚Äì19 season. Through the 2013‚Äì14 season, 16 teams participated in the Premier League. However, during that season's winter break, the Euromaidan protests began, soon followed by Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula and the still-ongoing war in the country's east. These developments led to the league dropping to 14 teams in 2014‚Äì15 and 12 in 2016‚Äì17. Beginning with the 2016‚Äì17 season, the league season is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the teams play one another home and away, after which the league splits into two groups, each playing a home-and-away schedule within the group and with table points carrying over intact. The top six teams play to determine the league champion and European qualifying spots, while the bottom six teams play to avoid relegation, with the bottom two at the end of the second stage dropping to the Ukrainian First League.

The nitrogen rule is not a rule, per se, as much as a general principle which may prove useful when attempting to solve organic mass spectrometry structures. Formulation of the rule This rule is derived from the fact that, perhaps coincidentally, for the most common chemical elements in neutral organic compounds (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and the halogens), elements with even numbered nominal masses form even numbers of covalent bonds, while elements with odd numbered nominal masses form odd numbers of covalent bonds, with the exception of nitrogen, which has a nominal (or integer) mass of 14, but has a valency of 3. The nitrogen rule is only true for neutral structures in which all of the atoms in the molecule have a number of covalent bonds equal to their standard valency (counting each sigma bond and pi bond as a separate covalent bond for the purposes of the calculation). Therefore, the rule is typically only applied to the molecular ion signal in the mass spectrum. Mass spectrometry generally operates by measuring the mass of ions. If the measured ion is generated by creating or breaking a single covalent bond (such as protonating an amine to form an ammonium center or removing a hydride from a molecule to leave a positively charged ion) then the nitrogen rule becomes reversed (odd numbered masses indicate even numbers of nitrogens and vice versa). However, for each consecutive covalent bond that is broken or formed, the nitrogen rule again reverses. Therefore, a more rigorous definition of the nitrogen rule for organic compounds containing exclusively hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and the halogens would be as follows: An even nominal mass indicates that a net even number of covalent bonds have been broken or formed and an even number of nitrogen atoms are present, or that a net odd number of covalent bonds have been broken or formed and an odd number of nitrogen atoms are present. An odd nominal mass indicates that a net even number of covalent bonds have been broken or formed and an odd number of nitrogen atoms are present, or that a net odd number of covalent bonds have been broken or formed and an even number of nitrogen atoms are present. Inorganic molecules do not necessarily follow the rule. For example, the nitrogen oxides NO and NO2 have an odd number of nitrogens but even masses of 30 and 46, respectively.

Frail is an astronomer working at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Socorro, New Mexico. He was born in Canada, spent much of his childhood in Europe, and his professional career has been based in the United States. Career Frail received his university education in Canada: first an undergraduate degree in Physics from Acadia University in Nova Scotia, followed by MSc and PhD degrees in Astrophysics from the University of Toronto. In 1989 he moved to the United States as an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow. After completing a prized Jansky Postdoctoral Fellowship in 1993, he joined the research staff of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, where he remains today. He is the author of over 250 peer-reviewed research papers,\\"Dale Frail\\", Partial list from the NASA ADS database including more than 30 articles in the prestigious journal Nature. He has made contributions to numerous sub-fields of astrophysics including multi-wavelength electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational-wave events, gamma-ray bursts, extrasolar planets, soft gamma-ray repeaters, the interstellar medium, pulsars, masers, and supernova remnants. To the public he is best known for discoveries in extrasolar planets and gamma-ray bursts. In 2010, he was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship. From August 2011 through September 2015, he was NRAO's Assistant Director for the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array, and site director for New Mexico operations. In 2016, he received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Acadia University. Key discoveries In early 1992, Frail and Polish astronomer Aleksander Wolszczan announced their discovery of the existence of two planets and a possible third around the pulsar PSR B1257+12. Their discovery was confirmed in mid-1992. In addition to being the first confirmed discovery of pulsar planets, the find is also generally considered to be the first confirmed discovery of extrasolar planets of any kind. Beginning in 1997, Frail was part of a Caltech-NRAO team that helped unravel the long-standing mystery of the origin of gamma-ray bursts. They used an optical spectrum taken with the Keck Telescope toward the optical afterglow of GRB 970508 to establish that gamma- ray bursts were at cosmological distances. They then used the Very Large Array radio telescope discovery of radio afterglow emission from this same burst to measure the object's size and infer that the source was expanding relativistically. These two observations have remained cornerstones in the cosmological fireball model for gamma-ray bursts. In 2009 Thomson ISI listed Frail as the third-most cited researcher in the field of gamma-ray bursts over the period from 1999 to February 2009.http://archive.sciencewatch.com/ana/st/gamma/authors/ Special Topics Analysis of Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) Research There are many popular science accounts of the discovery of extra-solar planets as well as those of gamma-ray bursts and their afterglows.

As a public register, it can be seen by anyone on application, and on payment of a statutory fee. History The Register was established by Act of the Scottish Parliament in 1672. It is held at the Court of the Lord Lyon, and contains every grant of arms by Lord Lyon King of Arms since that date, as well as older coats of arms that the owners have chosen to register. Bearings that are not matriculated in the Register may not be used in Scotland, unless it can be proved that they were in use before 1672. The first volume of the Register (now divided into two parts for ease of handling and conservation reasons) continued in use from 1672 until 1804, and contains 2,702 entries.Paul 1903, p. xvi. It begins with the arms of the Lyon Office, followed by the personal achievement of Sir Charles Erskine, Bt, who was Lord Lyon at the time. Most of the arms in this volume are given in blazon only: relatively few are painted.Paul 1903, pp. xiv‚Äìxvi. From the beginning of the second volume in 1804 the arms are consistently painted.Paul 1903, p. xvii. The Register now consists of over eighty volumes of parchment, and is illustrated by a succession of the most prominent heraldic artists working in Scotland. Published ordinaries In 1893, Sir James Balfour Paul, Lord Lyon King of Arms, published the contents of the first twelve volumes of the Register, to that date, in the form of an ordinary (i.e. with the entries in blazon, rearranged by design; and with a name index): the work contained roughly 5,200 entries. Ten years later, by which time the Register had reached its sixteenth volume, he published an updated second edition including all arms registered to the end of 1901: this edition contained 5,532 entries. By 1973 the Register had reached its 57th volume, and in 1977 Lyon Office published a second volume of the Ordinary: this covered all arms registered from 1902 to the end of 1973, and contained a further 6,040 entries. This volume was edited by David Reid of Robertland, Carrick Pursuivant (who died in December 1973, while the work was in progress), and Vivien Wilson.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1946 Pacific hurricane season. At the time, tropical storms that formed within this region of the western Pacific were identified and named by the United States Armed Services, and these names are taken from the list that USAS publicly adopted before the 1945 season started. Storms =Typhoon Barbara= Typhoon Barbara formed on March 27, and moved west. It strengthened briefly to a category 3 with 115 mph winds. But shortly after, it began to weaken. Typhoon Barbara curved northward and then westward, in turn hitting the Philippines as a category 1. After making landfall, it curved back to the east and continued to weaken until April 7, when it dissipated. =Typhoon Charlotte= =Typhoon Dolly= On June 17, Typhoon Dolly formed. It moved northwestward, only to strengthen. After passing by the Philippines, it reached its maximum intensity of 125 mph, a strong major hurricane. It rounded around Taiwan and made landfall on China's shoreline. It dissipated hours after on June 23. =Tropical Storm Elinor= =Typhoon Ginny= =Mid July Typhoon= =Typhoon Ingrid= Tropical Storm Ingrid formed July 12, immediately moving west. After strengthening, it briefly became a category four on July 15. It weakened to a category two and struck the northern part of the Philippines. Ingrid retained its strength until it hit Hong Kong and Macau. Right after it made landfall immediately to the west of Macau, it moved north and dissipated on July 20. =Typhoon Janie= Janie formed on July 23. It moved northwest and then curved west. It was then that she became a major hurricane with 115 mph winds. After heading westward for a while, Janie began curving the opposite direction.

Janie traveled over the island and dissipated near Russias coast on July 31. =Typhoon Lilly= On August 10, a disturbance managed to organize itself enough to be designated Tropical Storm Lilly. It moved in a generally northwest direction while intensifying at a moderate pace-becoming Typhoon Lilly shortly after its formation. Before Lilly moved over cold waters, it attained a peak intensity of 145 mph. It narrowly missed Japan's shoreline as a category two before striking Korea as a moderate tropical storm.

It has no official bounds; it ran year- round in 1945, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the international date line. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1945 Pacific hurricane season. Predecessor agency to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), Fleet Weather Center/Typhoon Tracking Center was established on the island of Guam in June 1945, after multiple typhoons, including Typhoon Cobra in the previous season and Typhoon Connie in this season, had caused a significant loss of men and ships. It would not take major responsibility in the West Pacific basin until 1950 season. Instead, storms in this season are identified and named by the United States Armed Services, and these names are taken from the list that USAS publicly adopted before this season had started earlier this year. Since this is the first season to be included in the West Pacific typhoon database, this would also be the first season where the names of Western Pacific tropical cyclones are preserved publicly. Systems =Tropical Storm Ann= Tropical Storm Ann was the first storm of the 1945 Pacific typhoon season and was formed on April 19. The storm made no landfall. It dissipated on April 26. =Tropical Storm Betty= Tropical Storm Betty formed on May 13, 1945, and began to move in a northeastern direction. It strengthened into a tropical storm only 18 hours later, and continued on its path. However, the storm eventually moved further north, and into colder waters. Betty weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated on May 16th, having not threatened land at all. =Typhoon Connie= A small, yet powerful typhoon, Connie, was first spotted on June 1 by the Weather Central Guam, moving northeast. Winds were reported to have been as high as 140 mph. But by June 7, it began to weaken. Its final fate is unknown. The U.S. Navy's Third Fleet was hit by Connie. The same fleet had previously been hit, with great loss of life, by Cobra, in late last year. Connie being lesser, only one officer and five USN men were lost or killed because of Connie, and around 150 airplanes on its carriers were either lost or damaged. =Tropical Storm Doris= Tropical Storm Doris existed from June 18 to June 21 and did not make landfall. =Tropical Storm Nancy= =Typhoon Opal= =Tropical Storm Peggy= =Tropical Storm Edna= =Typhoon Eva= =Typhoon Queenie= =Tropical Storm Frances= =Tropical Storm Grace= =Typhoon Ruth= =Typhoon Susan= =Typhoon Tess= =Typhoon Helen= Typhoon Helen formed on August 29. It moved west-northwest and strengthened into a category 3 typhoon with 120 mph winds. It weakened slightly to a category two and struck Taiwan. It briefly was over waters before it hit Mainland China as a tropical storm. It dissipated on September 4. =Typhoon Ursula= This typhoon is especially remembered for the 6 aircraft containing liberated prisoners of war brought down by the typhoon between Okinawa and Manila. Over 120 servicemen lost their lives. At the time, it was the single greatest loss of life in an aviation disaster during peacetime.https://noaahrd.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/70th-anniversary-of- typhoon-ursula/amp/ =Typhoon Ida= In Japan, Typhoon Ida is called Makurazaki Typhoon. It was the strongest typhoon to hit Kyushu on record, with a minimum sea-level pressure of 916.1 hPa (27.05 inHg) observed on the land and a maximum wind gust of , which was recorded at a weather station in Makurazaki.Weather Records of Makurazaki Japan Meteorological Agency More than 2,000 people were killed in the Hiroshima Prefecture after heavy rains brought by a weakening Ida caused severe landslides.Makurazaki typhoon Hiroshima disaster prevention Web Hiroshima Prefectural Government =Tropical Storm Verna= =Tropical Storm Wanda= =Typhoon Jean= =Tropical Storm Kate= =Typhoon Louise= Louise was first seen developing on October 2, 1945, in the Caroline Islands. It unexpectedly veered north and slowed down, only to intensify as it passed over Okinawa on October 9 with 90 mph wind gusts and a minimum central pressure of 968.5 mbar. Shortly after, Louise began to weaken, and hit Japan as a strong tropical storm. The tropical cyclone became extratropical shortly after on October 12. In Okinawa, 36 people died, 47 people were reported missing, and 100 people were seriously injured. In Buckner Bay, where the US military were occupying a temporary base, to waves were reported to have crashed ashore, tearing into Quonset huts and other buildings. At the time, Buckner Bay was being used as a port by the US military. Fifteen merchant ships were driven ashore, with a few wrecked. Three US Navy destroyers were grounded and declared beyond salvage. Over 200 other US military vessels, including six LSTs, a number of special purpose boats, patrol boats, and amphibious landing craft were grounded, severely damaged, or wrecked beyond repair. Eighty percent of the buildings in the bay were completely wiped out, while all 60 airplanes at the local airports were damaged.US Navy Historical Center.

Symptoms include signs of dehydration, weakness, leg cramps, vision problems, and an altered level of consciousness. Onset is typically over days to weeks. Complications may include seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, mesenteric artery occlusion, or rhabdomyolysis. The main risk factor is a history of diabetes mellitus type 2. Occasionally it may occur in those without a prior history of diabetes or those with diabetes mellitus type 1. Triggers include infections, stroke, trauma, certain medications, and heart attacks. Diagnosis is based on blood tests finding a blood sugar greater than 30 mmol/L (600 mg/dL), osmolarity greater than 320 mOsm/kg, and a pH above 7.3. Initial treatment generally consists of intravenous fluids to manage dehydration, intravenous insulin in those with significant ketones, low molecular weight heparin to decrease the risk of blood clotting, and antibiotics among those in whom there is concerns of infection. The goal is a slow decline in blood sugar levels. Potassium replacement is often required as the metabolic problems are corrected. Efforts to prevent diabetic foot ulcers are also important. It typically takes a few days for the person to return to baseline. While the exact frequency of the condition is unknown, it is relatively common. Older people are most commonly affected. The risk of death among those affected is about 15%. It was first described in the 1880s. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of high blood sugar including increased thirst (polydipsia), increased volume of urination (polyuria), and increased hunger (polyphagia). Symptoms of HHS include: * Altered level of consciousness * Neurologic signs including: blurred vision, headaches, focal seizures, myoclonic jerking, reversible paralysis *Motor abnormalities including flaccidity, depressed reflexes, tremors or fasciculations * Hyperviscosity and increased risk of blood clot formation * Dehydration * Weight loss * Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain * Weakness * Low blood pressure with standing Cause The main risk factor is a history of diabetes mellitus type 2. Occasionally it may occur in those without a prior history of diabetes or those with diabetes mellitus type 1. Triggers include infections, stroke, trauma, certain medications, and heart attacks. Other risk factors: * Lack of sufficient insulin (but enough to prevent ketosis) * Poor kidney function * Poor fluid intake (dehydration) * Older age (50‚Äì70 years) * Certain medical conditions (cerebral vascular injury, myocardial infarction, sepsis) * Certain medications (glucocorticoids, beta- blockers, thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and phenytoin) Pathophysiology HHS is usually precipitated by an infection, myocardial infarction, stroke or another acute illness. A relative insulin deficiency leads to a serum glucose that is usually higher than 33 mmol/L (600 mg/dL), and a resulting serum osmolarity that is greater than 320 mOsm. This leads to excessive urination (more specifically an osmotic diuresis), which, in turn, leads to volume depletion and hemoconcentration that causes a further increase in blood glucose level. Ketosis is absent because the presence of some insulin inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase-mediated fat tissue breakdown. Diagnosis =Criteria= According to the American Diabetes Association, diagnostic features include: * Plasma glucose level >30 mmol/L (>600 mg/dL) * Serum osmolality >320 mOsm/kg * Profound dehydration, up to an average of 9L (and therefore substantial thirst (polydipsia)) * Serum pH >7.30 * Bicarbonate >15 mEq/L * Small ketonuria (~+ on dipstick) and absent-to-low ketonemia (<3 mmol/L) * Some alteration in consciousness * BUN > 30 mg/dL (increased) * Creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL (increased) =Imaging= Cranial imaging is not used for diagnosis of this condition. However, if MRI is performed, it may show cortical restricted diffusion with unusual characteristics of reversible T2 hypointensity in the subcortical white matter.Neuroradiology 2007 Apr;49(4):299-305. =Differential diagnosis= The major differential diagnosis is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In contrast to DKA, serum glucose levels in HHS are extremely high, usually greater than 40-50 mmol/L (600 mg/dL). Metabolic acidosis is absent or mild. A temporary state of confusion (delirium) is also more common in HHS than DKA. HHS also tends to affect older people more. DKA may have fruity breath, and rapid and deep breathing. DKA often has serum glucose level greater than 300 mg/dL (HHS is >600 mg/dL). DKA usually occurs in type 1 diabetics whereas HHS is more common in type 2 diabetics. DKA is characterized by a rapid onset, and HHS occurs gradually over a few days. DKA also is characterized by ketosis due to the breakdown of fat for energy. Both DKA and HHS may show symptoms of dehydration, increased thirst, increased urination, increased hunger, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, blurred vision, headaches, weakness, and low blood pressure with standing. Management =Intravenous fluids= Treatment of HHS begins with reestablishing tissue perfusion using intravenous fluids. People with HHS can be dehydrated by 8 to 12 liters. Attempts to correct this usually take place over 24 hours with initial rates of normal saline often in the range of 1 L/h for the first few hours or until the condition stabilizes. =Electrolyte replacement= Potassium replacement is often required as the metabolic problems are corrected. It is generally replaced at a rate 10 mEq per hour as long as there is adequate urinary output. =Insulin= Insulin is given to reduce blood glucose concentration; however, as it also causes the movement of potassium into cells, serum potassium levels must be sufficiently high or dangerously low blood potassium levels may result. Once potassium levels have been verified to be greater than 3.3 mEq/l, then an insulin infusion of 0.1 units/kg/hr is started. The goal for resolution is a blood glucose of less than 200 mg/dL.

They are commonly known as Paraguay horned frogs or Budgett's frogs (in honor of John Samuel Budgett, who described the genus), although the latter technically describes a specific species, Lepidobatrachus laevis.  Geographic range  Lepidobatrachus are found in South America, in Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia.  Description  Lepidobatrachus frogs are generally a light, olive green in color, sometimes with lighter green or yellow mottling. They have a rounded, flattened body with eyes set high on their head. They have short limbs, which make them inefficient swimmers. They do not have teeth, but they do have two sharp protrusions, common to all Ceratophryidae, inside their mouth, which serve the same purpose.  In captivity  Budgett's frogs are very rarely found in a traditional chain pet shop. The most commonly available species is L. laevis. Due to their comical appearance, they tend to make an attractive option for the intermediate to advanced amphibian keeper. They have an average lifespan of about 10 years.

It was released on November 6, 1978, by MCA Records. Working with a new producer in Jerry Goldstein, Tucker drifts away from her earlier country style to do a much more rock-based effort. She covers well-known rock songs originally performed by such artists as Buddy Holly (\\"Not Fade Away\\"), Elvis Presley (\\"Heartbreak Hotel\\"), and Chuck Berry (\\"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\\"). Tucker also covers John Prine's \\"Angel from Montgomery\\". The album was Tucker's second-highest ranked ever on the Billboard Country charts at #2, and even reached #54 in the Pop category. Released singles and their Billboard positions were: \\"Texas (When I Die)\\" at #5, \\"Not Fade Away\\" at #70, and \\"I'm the Singer, You're the Song\\" at #18. While not necessarily embraced by the country music establishment, the album garnered critical and commercial success. It was certified Gold by the RIAA and earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female. Critical reception Billboard published a review of the album in the November 18, 1978 issue, which said, \\"Tucker's newest release sheds a new light on her singing and image. Working within a pop framework, Tucker's vocals convey a wholesome richness, evident in her rendition of John Prine's \\"Angel from Montgomery\\" (in which he also gives background vocal help), \\"Not Fade Away\\" and others. The inside photo makes Tucker out to be a sexpot, a ploy that gives her broader appeal. Tucker is backed by a tight band which utilizes both country and rock orchestrations and strings for sweetening.\\" The review in the November 11, 1978 issue of Cashbox said, \\"If country fans have raised an eyebrow at the changes Dolly Parton has made lately, they certainly aren't ready for the 'new' Tanya Tucker. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, the cover graphics are the most blatantly sexual of any album jacket ever released by a country artist. And the music inside is tough LA rock. Tanya does throw in a small dose of country, but this is in no way a country album.

Owned by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and ridden by Dick Francis, Devon Loch had won two races already that season and finished third in the National Hunt Handicap Chase at Cheltenham. His progress was helped when the favourite, Must, and a previous winner, Early Mist, fell early on. He went to the front of the race with three jumps remaining, cleared the last half a length ahead of E.S.B., and took a commanding lead on the final stretch. Then, in front of the royal box just 40 yards from the winning post and five lengths ahead, he suddenly inexplicably jumped into the air and landed on his stomach, allowing E.S.B. to overtake and win. Although jockey Dick Francis tried to cajole the horse, it was unable to continue. Afterwards, the Queen Mother said: \\"Oh, that's racing.\\" It is not known why Devon Loch jumped; some reports claimed he suffered a cramp in his hindquarters causing the collapse. Another report asserted that a shadow thrown by the adjacent water-jump fence (which horses only traverse on the first circuit of the Aintree course) may have baffled Devon Loch into thinking a jump was required and - confused as to whether he should jump or not - he half-jumped and collapsed. Jockey Dick Francis later stated that a loud cheer from the crowd, for an expected royal winner, distracting the horse is a more likely explanation. Reports that the horse had suffered a heart attack were dismissed, as Devon Loch recovered far too quickly for this to have been the case. He lived another six years, being put down during or shortly after the cold winter of 1962‚Äì3. Modern use \\"To do a Devon Loch\\" is a modern metaphor now sometimes used in sports and otherwise to explain a sudden, last- minute failure of teams or a sportsperson to complete an expected victory, for example: \\"Manchester United won't do a Devon Loch and lose the title after beating Chelsea\\" or \\"Lewis Hamilton surrendering the championship having led Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen by 17 points with just two races remaining was a Devon Loch calamity\\". Another example occurred ahead of the 2011 Irish presidential election when Se√°n Gallagher's campaign came undone in the final television debate, his fall from grace was compared to Devon Loch's fall just before the winning post in the 1956 Grand National.\\"Surprises still possible in Irish presidential election\\". BBC News. 27 October 2011. In an article in The Times on 4 August 2012, Rick Broadbent wrote about the final day of the 2012 Olympics heptathlon competition: \\"Jessica Ennis is almost there.

On the morning of September 17, 1981 Rupe fatally shot bank tellers Candace Hemmig and Twila Capron during a robbery of Tumwater State Bank in Olympia, Washington. Capron's husband arrived at the bank shortly after the robbery and called 9-1-1. While police were investigating the scene they were approached by Rupe, who told them that he had been at the bank that morning. Rupe was questioned by police several times and confessed to committing the crimes, giving three statements to police officers. Additionally, Rupe's bloodstained checkbook was found at the crime scene, and the type of ammunition used in the crime was found in Rupe's car. At his trial, Rupe denied any involvement in the crime and blamed a friend of his. A psychologist testified that he had given Rupe a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder and a secondary diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder, and that these disorders caused Rupe to make a false confession. Mitchell Rupe was found guilty of aggravated murder and sentenced to death. His death sentence was overturned twice, the second time being in 1994 when United States federal judge Thomas S. Zilly ruled that Rupe was too heavy to hang. Rupe was over 425 pounds at the time (as high as the scale went) and the judge was concerned that execution by hanging could cause Rupe to be decapitated, which would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Rupe was re-sentenced a third time in 2000 by a new jury. After a two-week sentencing hearing, Rupe escaped a new death sentence when the jury deadlocked by an 11‚Äì1 vote in favor of the death penalty, falling short of the unanimous verdict required by Washington law for imposition of a death sentence. Rupe died of liver disease in the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla, Washington on February 7, 2006.

Description Male flame skimmers are known for their entirely red or dark orange body, this includes eyes, legs, and even wing veins. Females are usually a medium or darker brown with some thin, yellow markings. This particular type of skimmer varies in size but is generally measured somewhere between two and three inches long.Kris Wetherbee, Kris. Attracting Birds, Butterflies & Other Winged Wonders To Your Backyard. New York, New York: Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2005. These naiads are known for being rather large and chubby-looking due to their rounded abdomen. They are covered with hair but, unlike most young dragonflies, they lack hooks or spines. Location Due to its choice habitat of warm ponds, streams, or hot springs, flame skimmers are found mainly in the southwestern part of the United States. They also make their homes in public gardens or backyards. Feeding habits Nymph of Libellula saturata from California. An immature flame skimmer (nymph) feeds mainly on aquatic insects. Its diet consists of mosquito larvae, aquatic fly larvae, mayfly larvae, freshwater shrimp, small fish, and tadpoles. The nymphs, which live in the mud at the bottom of warm streams or ponds, catch their prey by waiting patiently for it to pass by. Adult skimmers usually feed on moths, flies, ants, or any other soft-bodied insect while waiting perched on a small rock or twig or while flying through the air.Lung, Mark, and Stefan Sommer. \\"Libellula saturata.\\" Idaho Museum of Natural History., 1 2001. February 27, 2008 Reproduction Female flame skimmer Female flame skimmer Breeding for flame skimmers occurs during their flight season from May to September. Males compete with other males for prime breeding locations and females.Mason, Jim. \\"Dragonflies & Damselflies.\\" Great Plains Nature Center. , March 13, 2008 After mating, the male and female separate, and the female flies off alone to lay her eggs. She does this by hovering above small streams or ponds and dipping the end of her abdomen into the water. Often she deposits her eggs in many different places in order to prevent the naiads from using each other as a source of food.

National Hunt flat races were created on 15 July 1891 when a conference between the stewards of the British and Irish National Hunt Committees decided to abolish the distinction between the hunter and handicap horses and created a new amalgamated rule: In modern days the National Hunt flat races are designed for horses who have not previously ran under any other form of racing except National Hunt flat or French AQPS races and in Great Britain are restricted to horses aged seven years or less. They are used by trainers to give horses experience on a racecourse before beginning a career in jumps racing. Because of the lack of fences and hurdles, the horses sometimes run faster; however the low quality of many of these races, and that horses are only taking part to gain experience, often results in a slow pace. Bumpers are typically put at the end of a race meeting and such races are notorious for being difficult to predict the winner. The vast majority of National Hunt meetings in Ireland include a bumper. They are run much less frequently in Britain. The term 'bumper' arose because in the past only amateur riders were allowed to compete and had an ungainly bumping style in comparison to the professionals. Bumpers are most commonly run over distances of 13‚Äì20 furlongs.

He is founder and CEO of Crescent Capital Associates,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerry- killinger-18279026 and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Washington Mutual. Killinger was included in CNBC's September 2018 10-year look-back coverage about the 2008 financial crisis and his thoughts on the current state of finances in the US and around the world. Early life and career Killinger was born in Des Moines, Iowa. He received his education at the University of Iowa, from which he received his BBA in 1970 and MBA in 1971. He began his career in the financial services industry in 1972 as an investment analyst with Bankers Life Insurance Company of Nebraska, and moved on to Murphey Favre in 1976 where he rose from a securities analyst to executive vice president and director. Philanthropy Throughout his life, Killinger (with wife Linda) has supported charitable organizations and higher education institutions in Seattle, Iowa, and Palm Desert, including 2018 donations to support Cascade Public Media's Crosscut Festival in Seattle and a Communications and Civility in our Democracy Summit at Iowa State University in fall 2019. Washington Mutual Washington Mutual acquired Murphey Favre in 1983. Killinger was named executive vice president, and promoted in 1986 to senior vice president, and to director in 1988. He was named president of the company that year, CEO in 1990, and chairman in 1991. American Banker named him its 2001 Banker of the Year. In 2003, Killinger predicted that by 2008, Washington Mutual would not be identified as a bank. He said \\"We hope to do to this industry what Walmart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe‚Äôs-Home Depot did to their industry.\\" Faced with mounting losses from the mortgage market and steep declines in the stock price as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis, the board of directors removed Killinger as CEO on September 8, 2008. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) seized Washington Mutual's banking divisions on September 25, 2008, and named the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as their receiver in the largest bank failure in the history of the United States. While CEO of Washington Mutual in 2007, Killinger earned a total compensation of $14,364,883. In 2008, he took home $25.1 million in compensation. Killinger received a $15.3 million severance payment in September 2008 \\"as well as a $445,200 lump-sum payment for vacation benefits and a $300,669 'special payment'\\". In March 2011, Killinger and two other bank officers were sued by the FDIC for \\"reckless lending\\". That case was settled in 2012. As of 2013, \\"Killinger, who was investigated by the Justice Department but never charged with any crimes, now appears to be clear of all legal action against him.\\" The portrayal of Killinger‚Äôs role in WaMu's downfall, told by Wall Street Journal reporter Kirsten Grind in The Lost Bank: The Story of Washington Mutual ‚Äîthe Biggest Bank Failure in American History was challenged by Killinger in an open letter.

He is perhaps best known as the vocalist and guitarist of 1990s band The Super Friendz. Music career Murphy first achieved notability for his role as leader of the mid-1990s Halifax band The Super Friendz, a power pop act that became a prominent part of the Halifax music scene, which at that time was often referred to as \\"Seattle north\\". Murphy formed the band with fellow King's College students Charles Austin (bass) and Drew Yamada (guitar). The three shared singing and songwriting duties, as was common in the democratically oriented scene at the time, but Murphy emerged as the standout performer. After the Super Friendz dissolved in 1997, Murphy relocated to Toronto and formed a new band, The Flashing Lights. That band featured a more polished rock sound than the Super Friendz, and achieved a degree of fame in Canada. Its members were bassist Henri Sangalang, organist Gaven Dianda, and drummer Steve Pitkin, along with vocalist/guitarist Murphy. Murphy also appeared on The Virginian, the 1997 debut album by Neko Case and Her Boyfriends, and also played lead guitar on ex-Inbreds singer Mike O'Neill's first solo album What Happens Now?. Murphy now splits his days between Halifax and Toronto and his musical time among a variety of projects. In 2003, The Super Friendz reunited for a new album and a brief tour, and Murphy played a show with his old Halifax country side project Little Orton Hoggett. Flashing Lights are currently on an indefinite hiatus. In 2004, Murphy became a member of Toronto band City Field, in which he plays a smaller role, providing mostly backing rather than lead vocals.\\"City on fire: Matt Murphy returns with new band, film\\".

He headed the Kei school during the reconstructions of T≈çdai-ji and K≈çfuku-ji. Although his works are still largely in the style established by J≈çch≈ç in the Heian period, K≈çkei's sculpture show a move toward the greater realism that characterizes the works of his disciples Unkei, Kaikei, and J≈çkei. Career K≈çkei was a direct descendant, both genetically and artistically, of J≈çch≈ç, a master sculptor of the Heian period.Noma 163. He was likely the organizer of the Kei school, which comprised his son, disciples, and assistants. Notable members of K≈çkei's school include Unkei, Kaikei, and J≈çkei.Mason 188. Today, K≈çkei is best known for leading teams involved in the 1188‚Äì1189 reconstruction of the T≈çdai-ji and K≈çfuku-ji, temples in Nara, Japan. He and his assistants were placed in charge of work at the Nanend≈ç (Southern Octagonal Hall). Statues by K≈çkei there include the Four Heavenly Guardians and the Six Patriarchs of Hoss≈ç. The centerpiece is the giant Fuk≈´kenjaku Kannon, which he created in 1188. This was a replacement for an original created in 746 and lost in a temple fire.Mason 189. First-hand details of K≈çkei's talent and personality come from the diary of Kuj≈ç Kanezane, who became the Fujiwara chieftain in 1186, and thus took over as supervisor of the temple reconstructions. Kanezane paints the artist as a greatly talented and morally sound man, but also as someone who did not refrain from questioning Kanezane's decisions.Grapard 230. Style K≈çkei's works are still largely in the Heian mold established by his ancestor, J≈çch≈ç. For example, K≈çkei's Fuk≈´kenjaku Kannon follows J≈çch≈ç's canon of proportions: widely spread legs provide a base for a triangular figure with a square-shaped face. Likewise, the folds of drapery still follow a conventional geometric pattern.Paine 110. However, K≈çkei does show signs of the emerging realism that characterizes the art of the Kei school. He uses crystal inlays to give a more lifelike sheen to the Kannon's eyes and byakugo (Sanskrit: urna). The details of the face and clothing are more deeply carved and realized than those in J≈çch≈ç's work. Individual hairs are carefully carved into the figure's head. The result is a figure that seems more corporeal than the ephemeral-looking works of the previous 150 years. Notes References * Grapard, Allan G. (1992).

Saudi Arabia Exposed: Inside a Kingdom in Crisis. Palgrave Macmillan. 19 May 2005. 7.) was a popular Saudi Arabian satirical comedy that ran for 18 seasons. It aired on the Saudi State-owned television channel Saudi 1 for 13 seasons but in 2005 it was bought by MBC. New episodes ran exclusively during Ramadan right after sunset.

Every episode has a new story and characters, though popular characters tend to re-appear in new storylines. Most episodes poke fun at the flaws of Saudi society while others show a tendency for dark comedy and melodrama. The show was one of the pioneers of self-criticism in the Saudi media, with the episodes often dealing with sensitive topics such as social aspects, culture, terrorism, marital relations, and religion. The show satirizes regional social, cultural, and legal state found within Saudi Arabia. Set Locations        Societal relations John R. Bradley, author of Saudi Arabia Exposed: Inside a Kingdom in Crisis, said that the show continues to run and receive high ratings because, in Saudi Arabia, people perceive comedy to be a good valve for frustrations for social, regional, and other issues. The show has been a target for religious clergy after an episode aired which criticized the judges of the local courts (who are clergymen) of skipping work or leaving early, leaving paperwork and cases delayed. One episode portrayed the difficulty for women to do basic things without a mahram (a legal male guardian). The two heroines of the episode were alone because the husband of one and brother of the other were in Paris for a few weeks. The women were harassed and flirted with in parks by young men, escorted out of shops and turned away from banks. They tried to regain freedom of movement by borrowing a senile grand father (a cure worse than the disease) and finally disguised the daughter of one and niece of the other as a little boy. Ultra- conservatives deemed this episode offensive to Islamic traditions. Many people considered this episode to be somewhat exaggerated but true.Qusti, Raid. \\"Tash Ma Tash: A Barometer of Self-Criticism.\\" Arab News. 3 November 2004 (20 Ramadan 1425).

Badria Al- Bishir details what she calls battles between the extremist (mutawa) and the liberals in Saudi Arabia. The show is considered a milestone in the critique of extremist thought in Saudi Arabia, which has been used to shape the public opinion. It rose in times when the Newspapers and TV production were dominated the liberal party, while the educational systems were dominated by the religious party. The nature of the clash has often been explored in the Tash Ma Tash program.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise rescues a Starfleet admiral's grandson, long thought dead, but who had been adopted and raised by the enemies who killed the boy's parents. Plot The Enterprise responds to a distress call from a Talarian vessel. They rescue five teenaged crewmembers - four Talarian, and one human, Jono (Chad Allen). Jono keeps to himself, but shows strict obedience to Captain Picard, which together with some unexplained past injuries leads Doctor Crusher to suggest Jono may have been physically abused. It is determined that Jono is Jeremiah Rossa, a long-lost Federation citizen. His grandmother is a Starfleet admiral, and he was orphaned ten years ago when his parents were killed in a skirmish with the Talarians. When the Captain introduces the topic of Jono's human family, Jono becomes angry. After persistent effort by Picard, Jono's memories of the attack begin to return and a friendship develops between Jono and Wesley Crusher. A Talarian ship arrives. Its Captain, Endar, asks for a status on his son, who happens to be Jono. Ten years ago, Endar claimed Jono after Jono's parents were killed. This is part of the Talarian custom of adopting the children of slain enemies to replace their own children who have died in battle. Endar explains Jono's injuries as the products of a boy trying to impress his father by participating in high-risk activities; Picard seems satisfied and observes that Endar seems to care for Jono. Picard allows Endar to see Jono, but when Jono says he wants to stay with Endar, Picard suspects the boy is afraid to say he wants to stay in the Federation. Endar insists that Jono will come back with him, even if the result is war between the Talarians and the Federation. Returning to his vessel, Endar calls for reinforcements, as Picard decides to try to convince Jono to stay. After Jono receives a message from his grandmother, Picard takes the boy to play a form of racquetball, where Jono breaks down and cries. The crew believes they are making progress with the boy, but that night, Jono stabs the Captain. The dagger is deflected by Picard's sternum, and the wound is minor. The problem of where Jono should live is now compounded as Jono has committed a crime. When Picard learns that Jono feels he cannot betray Endar by befriending Picard, the Captain realizes he has been trying to impose his wishes on the boy. Just as Endar's patience is about to run out, Picard contacts the Talarians and lets them know he will let Jono go back. Jono bids Picard farewell with a Talarian ritual that is normally reserved for family members. Future Deep Space Nine episode similarities ‚ÄúSuddenly Human‚Äù, which aired in 1990, has strong similarities to the second season DS9 episode, ‚ÄúCardassians‚Äù, which aired in 1993. In both ‚ÄúSuddenly Human‚Äù and ‚ÄúCardassians‚Äù, a young male alien is living with a family of another species, who adopt him after the conclusion of a battle or war. In both episodes, the adopting family insists on the return of the child, while the biological family also fights for custody. Tensions rise as the question of custody is decided. In both episodes, custody is decided by the commanding officers present. However, the episodes have different conclusions. In ‚ÄúSuddenly Human‚Äù, Captain Picard returns the young man Jono/Jeremiah Rossa to his adoptive father because the young man is old enough to decide for himself with whom he wishes to live, and because it is the only life he has ever known. In ‚ÄúCardassians‚Äù, Commander Benjamin Sisko removes the child from his caring Bajoran foster family when it is revealed that he was placed in foster care under false pretenses by another Cardassian. Reviews Jamahl Epsicokhan of TrekNation's Jammer's Reviews, pointed out that this was the third TNG episode in a row to deal with family issues. Epsicokhan called ‚ÄúSuddenly Human‚Äù the least effective of the three family-oriented episodes, criticizing the script by stating that the plot took too long to play out, and that the storyline was flat in parts. The reviewer was also disappointed that the Starfleet admiral's reaction to her request for custody being disregarded by Picard was left as an unresolved plot point. As of March 22, 2017, ‚ÄúSuddenly Human‚Äù has an average viewer rating of 6.5 out of 10 stars, on the IMDb. References External links  * \\"Suddenly Human\\" rewatch by Keith R.A.

He has specially addressed issues of racism and conflict in Southern Africa and politics in Mexico and South America, as well as poverty among youth in the United States, and is well known for his writing on surfing. Early years Finnegan was born in New York City, the eldest of four children to Patricia and Bill Finnegan, a television and film producer whose well known credits included Hawaii Five-O and The Fabulous Baker Boys. Bill Finnegan worked on a number of television productions shot on location in Hawaii and William and his siblings were raised in Los Angeles and Hawaii. William graduated from William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California and received his B.A. from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1974 with a degree in Literature. During his youth he took up surfing, which became a lifelong passion he still practices off Long Island when at home. Finnegan spent the next four years taking seasonal jobs and working on an MFA in creative writing at the University of Montana. Finnegan then spent four years abroad, traveling in Asia, Australia, and Africa. He supported himself with freelance travel writing and other odd jobs, but upon reaching Cape Town, South Africa, Finnegan was in need of a job. He found a position as an English teacher at Grassy Park High School, a school for \\"coloured\\" students. Finnegan's teaching experience coincided with a nationwide school boycott, giving him fodder for his first book, Crossing the Line: A Year in the Land of Apartheid, which was published in 1986 and was selected by the New York Times Book Review as one of the ten best nonfiction books of the year. Journalism career Finnegan's experience in South Africa transformed him from a novelist to a political journalist. His first short piece, about his experience living in Sri Lanka, was published in Mother Jones in 1979. Finnegan began contributing to The New Yorker in 1984 and has been a staff writer there since 1987. He has also contributed to Harper's and The New York Review of Books, among other publications. Finnegan contributed a two-part series for the New Yorker in 1992 entitled \\"Playing Doc's Games.\\" A widely experienced surfer himself, Finnegan writes about the local surf scene in San Francisco revolving around Ocean Beach and Dr. Mark Renneker (\\"Doc\\") as well as Finnegan's own personal experiences. A remarkable piece of writing, it is considered to be one of the best pieces of journalism on surfing. Finnegan's next two books grew out of assignments for The New Yorker. In 1986, he was sent to Johannesburg, where he followed black reporters who gathered information for white reporters during Apartheid. This led to the 1988 publication of Dateline Soweto: Travels with Black South African Reporters. A Complicated War: The Harrowing of Mozambique, published in 1992, grew out of a series of correspondences about the war-torn nation for the magazine, and Finnegan's own travels throughout that war-torn nation. 1998 saw the publication of Cold New World: Growing Up in a Harder Country, which deals with the bleak lives of American teenagers in spite of the United States‚Äô economic affluence. It was a finalist for the New York Public Library‚Äôs Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism in 1999. In the July 20th, 2009 issue of The New Yorker, Finnegan profiled Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona and his role in the conflict over immigration in that border state. In the May 31st, 2010 issue, he reported from Michoacan state in Mexico on the rise of the \\"La Familia\\" drug gang and the increasing social and political instability in Mexico. His \\"Talk of the Town\\" comment on \\"Borderlines,\\" which addresses the U.S. political stalemate over immigration reform, appeared in the magazine's issue for July 26, 2010. Diversity or Division: Race, Class and America at the Millenium Random House Bio of William Finnegan Awards Finnegan's autobiographical work \\"Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life\\" won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Finnegan has twice received the John Bartlow Martin Award for Public Interest Magazine Journalism, given by Northwestern University‚Äôs Medill School of Journalism, in 1994 and 1996.

Board representation is fundamental to all aspects of a chess program including move generation, the evaluation function, and making and unmaking moves (i.e. search) as well as maintaining the state of the game during play. Several different board representations exist. Chess programs often utilize more than one board representation at different times, for efficiency. Execution efficiency and memory footprint are the primary factors in choosing a board representation; secondary considerations are effort required to code, test and debug the application. Early programs used piece lists and square lists, both array based. Most modern implementations use a more elaborate but more efficient bit array approach called bitboards which map bits of a 64-bit word or double word to squares of the board. Board state A full description of a chess position, i.e. the position \\"state\\", must contain the following elements: * The location of each piece on the board * Whose turn it is to move * Status of the 50-move draw rule. The name of this is sometimes a bit confusing, as it is 50 moves by each player, and therefore 100 half-moves, or ply. For example, if the previous 80 half-moves passed without a capture or a pawn move, the fifty-move rule will kick in after another twenty half-moves. * Whether either player is permanently disqualified to castle, both kingside and queenside. * If an en passant capture is possible. Board representation typically does not include the status of the threefold repetition draw rule. To determine this rule, a complete history of the game from the last irreversible action (capture, pawn movement, or castling) needs to be maintained, and so, is generally tracked in separate data structures. The board state may also contain secondary derived information like which pieces attack a square; for squares containing pieces, which spaces are attacked or guarded by that piece; which pieces are pinned; and other convenient or temporary state. The board state is associated with each node of the game tree, representing a position arrived at by a move, whether that move was played over the board, or generated as part of the program's search. It is conceptually local to the node, but may be defined globally, and incrementally updated from node to node as the tree is traversed. Types =Array based= Piece lists Some of the very earliest chess programs working with extremely limited amounts of memory maintained serial lists (arrays) of the pieces in a conveniently searchable order, like largest to smallest; associated with each piece was its location on the board as well as other information, such as squares representing its legal moves. There were several lists, one set for white pieces and another for black pieces. The lists were usually divided into pieces and pawns. This was a compact representation because most squares of the board are unoccupied, but inefficient because acquiring information about the relationship of pieces to the board or to each other was tedious. Piece lists are still used by many of today's programs in conjunction with a separate board representation structure, to give serial access to the pieces without searching the board. Square list One of the simplest ways to represent a board is to create an 8x8 two-dimensional array (or, equivalently, a 64 element one-dimensional array). Each array element would identify what piece occupied the given square, or alternatively, if the square is empty. A common encoding is to consider 0 as empty, positive as white, and negative as black, e.g., white pawn +1, black pawn ‚àí1, white knight +2, black knight ‚àí2, white bishop +3, and so on. This scheme is called mailbox addressing. A problem with this approach arises during move generation. Each move has to be checked to ensure it is on the board, significantly slowing down the process. One solution is to use a 12x12 array instead, with the outer edges filled with, say, the value 99. During move generation, the operation to check for a piece on the destination square will also indicate whether the destination square is off the board. Better memory usage can be achieved with a 10x12 array, which provides the same functionalities as a 12x12 one by overlapping the leftmost and rightmost edge files (which are marked as off-the-board). Some chess engines use 16x16 arrays to improve the speed of the rank and file number conversion and allow some special coding tricks for attacks etc. 0x88 method The 0x88 method takes advantage of the fact that a chessboard's 8x8 dimensions are an even power of two (i.e. 8 squared). The board uses a one-dimensional array of size 16x8 = 128, numbered 0 to 127 rather than an array of size 64. It is basically two boards next to each other, the actual board on the left while the board on the right would contain illegal territory. The binary layout for a legal board coordinate's rank and file within the array is \`0rrr0fff\` (The r's are the 3 bits used to represent the rank. The f's for the file). For example, 0x71 (binary \`01110001\`) would represent the square b8 (in Algebraic notation). When generating moves from the main board, one can check that a destination square is on the main board before consulting the array simply by ANDing the square number with hexadecimal 0x88 (binary \`10001000\`). A non-zero result indicates that the square is off the main board. In addition, the difference between two squares' coordinates uniquely determines whether those two squares are along the same row, column, or diagonal (a common query used for determining check).0x88 method. Bruce Moreland =Bitboards= A more efficient but more elaborate board representation than the array-based structures is the bitboard. A bitboard is a 64-bit sequence of bits (0 or 1), which indicates the absence or presence (false or true) of some state of each space on the board. A board position can then be represented using a series of bitboards. For example, a series of bitboards for each piece type, for each side, can represent the board position. The advantage to this representation is the ability to use bit parallel operations upon the 64-bit entities instead of iteration to manipulate and derive information about the state of the board. This makes maximal use of the hardware available, especially as 64-bit processors have become mainstream. A substantive advantage of bitboards is that enables maps for the spaces attacked by each type of piece on each space of the board to be pre-collated and stored in a table, so that possible moves of the piece can be retrieved in a single memory fetch of the attack map for the square on which the piece resides which, excluding spaces occupied by friendly pieces (one bitwise operation), yields the legal moves of the piece. But the moves of the sliding pieces (rooks, bishops, queens) are indeterminate because the moves of these pieces depend on the configuration of other pieces on the board. So special and complex data structures have been devised to represent their moves.  Rotated bitboards  Rotated bitboards is a move generation technique for the sliding pieces that uses rotated copies of a bitboard to place spaces (bits) in a file or diagonal into adjacent bits analogous to the bits representing a rank. These bits can be extracted and used as an index into a table to obtain the map of spaces attacked by these pieces. The bitboard is rotated 90¬∞ for file indexing and either 45¬∞ or -45¬∞ for diagonal indexing. Rotating a chessboard is conceptually challenging, and rotating a bitboard is computational inelegant, but the transformation avoids serially enumerating the piece moves, or a lengthy sequence of shifting and masking a bitboard of the attack map of the piece to take into account the board configuration. Direct lookup The masked ranks, files and diagonals of sliding pieces can be used via a hash function to directly index a table of precomputed attack vectors based on the occupancy bits in the masked portion. One such scheme that uses a perfect hash function along with tricks to minimize the potential size of the table that must be stored in memory, is called \\"magic bitboards\\". = Transposition table = A transposition table is a cache of previously seen positions, and associated evaluations, in a game tree generated by a computer game playing program. For fast searching of the table, a hash function may be used, such as Zobrist hashing, to speed finding matching boards.Albert Lindsey Zobrist, A New Hashing Method with Application for Game Playing, Tech. Rep. 88, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, (1969). = Other methods = Other methods such as Compact Chessboard Representation (CCR) have been proposed, but none has gained acceptance. CCR uses 4 bits per square to represent the occupancy of the square,There are 6 types of pieces: king, queen, rook,bishop,knight,pawn for each of black and white plus unoccupied square, for a total of 13 states, representable in 4 bits or 24=16 possible codes. an entire rank can be represented in 32 bits, and the board in 8 registers (with an additional one for remaining position information). The occupancy code for a square can be dialed out of a register and added to the program counter to index a jump table, branching directly to code to generate moves for the type of piece on this square (if any). Although the program is longer than for conventional move generation methods, no checks for the edge of the board are required, and no moves off the board are possible, increasing move generation speed. The drawbacks of CCR are: 1) dependency on 32-bit word size; 2) availability of at least 9 free registers to the API; 3) necessity of assembly programming on a CISC architecture to access the registers; 4) non- portability of assembly application.

Proximal diabetic neuropathy is a type of diabetic neuropathy characterized by muscle wasting, weakness, pain, or changes in sensation/numbness of the leg. It is caused by damage to the nerves of the lumbosacral plexus. Proximal diabetic neuropathy is most commonly seen people with type 2 diabetics.National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse (NDIC). (2009, February). Diabetic neuropathies: the nerve damage of diabetes. Retrieved March 20, 2012, from http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/neuropathies/#proximalneuropathy It is less common than distal polyneuropathy that often occurs in diabetes. Signs & symptoms Signs and symptoms of proximal diabetic neuropathy depend on the nerves affected. The first symptom is usually pain in the buttocks, hips, thighs or legs. This pain often starts suddenly and affects one side of the body, although may spread to both sides. This is often followed by variable weakness in the proximal muscles of the lower limbs such as the thigh and buttocks.The damage to nerves supplying specific muscles may cause muscle twitching (fasciculations) in addition to the weakness. It is sometimes associated with weight loss. Diabetes most commonly causes damage to the long nerves that supply the feet and lower legs, causing numbness, tingling and pain (diabetic polyneuropathy). Although these symptoms may also be present, the pain and weakness of proximal diabetic neuropathy often onset more quickly and affect nerves closer to the torso. Causes This condition most commonly affects people with type 2 diabetes, although sometimes presents in those without diabetes (nondiabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy). The population trends suggest that hyperglycemia likely plays a role but may not be the causative factor.Dyck P. J., Winderbank, A. J. (2002). Diabetic and non diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathies. New insights into pathophysiology and treatment. Muscle Nerve, 25, 477‚Äì491. The nerve damage associated with the disease was first thought to be caused by metabolic changes such as endoneurial microvessel disease, in which cells that support the endothelium (pericytes) are damaged due to high blood sugar. Pericytes regulate capillary blood flow and phagocytosis of cellular debris and ischemia of the nerves can occur if pericytes are damaged. A different potential mechanism involves an immune mechanism causing a microvasculitis which could lead to ischemia. Diagnosis Patients with diabetes and proximal (hip, thigh) pain and weakness may be suspected of having diabetic amyotrophy. More definitive diagnosis can be made with electrodiagnostic studies including nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG).Diabetic Amytrophy. 2014. American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine. Diabetic amyotrophy is often a diagnosis of exclusion in diabetic patients with evidence of lumbosacral plexopathy on NCS and EMG studies for whom no other cause of lumbosacral plexopathy can be determined. Treatment Proximal diabetic neuropathy can be prevented through management of diabetes. The incidence of proximal diabetic neuropathy incidence is thought to be correlated to blood glucose control in diabetics, and is likely reversible with improved blood glucose control. Medications can help reduce the pain involved in proximal diabetic neuropathy. Common types of medication used to treat diabetic amyotrophy target the nerve directly such as gabapentin or pregabalin.  Prognosis  Proximal diabetic neuropathy is often monophasic and will improve after initial onset. However, the pain and weakness usually do not completely resolve and may lead to impairments in mobility and function.

They were low-freeboard, steam-powered ironclad vessels, with one or two rotating armored turrets, rather than the traditional broadside of guns. The low freeboard meant that these ships were unsuitable for ocean-going duties and were always at risk of swamping and possible loss, but it reduced the amount of armor required for protection.

Its coastal range extends as far north as Northern California, while inland it has migratory populations found throughout the Great Basin and Rocky Mountain regions, ranging as far north as southern British Columbia. White-throated swifts are found in open areas near cliffs, rock faces, or man- made structures, where they roost. Swifts are social birds, and groups are often seen roosting and foraging for flying insects together.  Description  The White-throated swift is medium-sized bird that is primarily black and white.

In newly molted adults, the dark feathers may have a slight greenish sheen, though this is rarely observable in the field. Sexes cannot be distinguished by plumage. Juvenile (first basic) plumage is similar to adult (definitive basic) plumage, but with the feathers on juveniles' heads and necks appearing duller and paler.

Taxonomy  The order in which White-throated swifts are placed is debated, with some taxonomies placing them in Caprimulgiformes, but others putting them in Apodiformes.Pellegrino I, Cucco M, Harvey JA, Liberatore F, Pavia M, Voelker G, Boana G. 2017. So similar and yet so different: taxonomic status of Pallid Swift Apus pallidus and Common Swift Apus apus. Bird Study [Internet]. [cited 2018 Oct 3]; 64(3): 344‚Äì352. . The difficulty in taxonomic placement is largely due to the morphological similarities between swifts which make determining the history of evolutionary divergence difficult. At lower taxonomic levels, White-throated swifts belong to the family Apodidae and the genus Aeronautes.Aeronautes saxatalis [Internet]. 2016. Cambridge (UK): International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources; [cited 2018 Oct 3].Aeronautes includes only two other species, the Andean swift (Aeronautes andecolus) and the White-tipped swift (Aeronautes montivagus). There are two subspecies of the White-Throated Swift, A. s. saxatalis, and A. s. nigrior. The A. s. saxatalis subspecies comprises birds that winter in North America south to the Isthmus of Tehantepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, while birds of the A. s. nigrior subspecies are found wintering below Oaxaca south to Honduras. Birds of A. s. saxatalis tend to have a more prominent superciliary streak, darker upper parts, and a broader white abdominal streak than those of A. s. nigrior.  Habitat and distribution  = Distribution = White-throated swifts are year-round residents of coastal and southern California, southern Arizona, southern New Mexico, western Texas, central Mexico, and the Sierra Madre Occidental and Oriental mountains. Migratory breeding populations can be found from Arizona and New Mexico north to southern British Columbia, and from central California east to eastern Colorado and Wyoming.Bartholomew GA, Howell TR, Cade TJ. 1957. Torpidity in the White-throated swift, Anna Hummingbird, and Poor-Will. The Condor [Internet]. [cited 2018 Sep 21]; 59(3): 145‚Äì155. . . In the southern part of its migratory range, birds arrive in mid-March and depart in mid-October, while in the northern portion, they do not arrive until mid-April to early- May, and depart in late-August to mid-September.Small A. 1994. California birds: their status and distribution. Vista (CA): Ibis Publishing Company. There are two main areas in which non-breeding wintering populations can be found: the first includes southwestern California, eastern Arizona, the Texas Panhandle, while the second is in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and the Mexican state of Chiapas. = Habitat = White-throated swifts flying near cliff habitat. Swifts roost in cliffs, bluffs, and canyons, as well as man- made structures like bridges, overpasses, and walls of quarries. In natural settings, swifts form colonies of as many as 400‚Äì500 birds in protected cliff crevices that are generally 6‚Äì50 meters above the ground.Hanna WC. 1909. The White-throated Swift on Slover Mountain. The Condor [Internet]. [cited 2018 Oct 4]; 11(3): 77‚Äì81. . . White-throated swifts will sometimes roost and nest in amongst colonies of other swallows species, including Cliff, Violet-Green, and Northern Rough-WingedSwallows.Bent AC. 1940. Life histories of North American cuckoos, goatsuckers, hummingbirds, and their allies. Bulletin of the United States National Museum [Internet]. [cited 2018 Oct 4]; 176: 1‚Äì506. .Pitelka FA. 1944. White-throated Swift breeding with Cliff Swallows at Berkeley, California. The Condor. 46: 34‚Äì35. While foraging, White-throated swifts are found flying over meadows, agricultural fields, and open areas along the edges of ridges and hills.  Behavior  White-throated swifts are rapid fliers who rarely land except to roost. Swifts usually fly 10‚Äì100 meters above the ground, and can be observed taking advantage of wind currents and updrafts to gain speed. White-throated swifts usually leave their roosts in the morning, and will remain flying and foraging all day until late afternoon or evening.Ryan TP. 1996. Activity Patterns of the White-throated Swift in Southern California [Dissertation]. Long Beach (CA): California State University. While in flight, swifts can sometimes be observed bathing by hitting the surface of the water with their underside, which is followed by airborne preening. Occasionally White-throated swifts will fight with one another while in flight, and may chase or strike other White-throated swifts or Violet-Green Swallows. = Diet and predators = Swifts are aerial insectivores who frequently forage in areas of rising air along the edges of canyons, foothills, or mountains to capture insects. White-throated swifts have also been observed foraging over agricultural lands, and are known to follow harvesting machinery to capture insects disturbed by the equipment.Alden SM, Mills GS. 1976. White-Throated Swifts Following Farm Machinery. The Wilson Bulletin [Internet]. [cited 2018 Sep 19]; 88(4): 675‚Äì675. . Stomach content analysis has found that beetles, flies, bees, and true bugs (Hemiptera) constitute a majority of the White-throated swift's diet.Bailey FM. 1907. White-throated Swifts at Capistrano. The Condor [Internet]. [cited 2018 Oct 4]; 9(6): 169‚Äì172. . Adult swifts nourish their nestlings by carrying a bolus of arthropods in their buccal cavity, and feeding it to the young. Swifts derive most of their water from their diet, but can also be skimming the surface of ponds to drink. Known predators of White-throated swifts include Peregrine falcons, Prairie falcons, and American kestrels.Arnold LW. 1942. The aerial capture of a White-throated Swift by a pair of falcons. The Condor [Internet]. [cited 2018 Oct 4]; 44(2): 280.Boyce DA. 1985. Prairie Falcon prey in the Mojave Desert, California. Raptor Research [Internet]. [cited by 2018 Oct 4]; 19(4): 128‚Äì134.Johanson CA, White CM. 1995. An American Kestrel captures a White-throated Swift in flight. Journal of Raptor Research [Internet]. [cited 2018 Oct 4]; 29(4): 284. When predators are detected, swifts are known to quickly lower their altitude and fly just above the vegetation. There is no data available on levels of nest predation. = Vocalizations = White-throated swifts make vocalizations while in the air that are described as \\"staccato chattering\\", and may also make a sharp one- or two-note call or a shrill drawn-out \\"scree\\" call.Chantler P, Driessens G. 1995. Swifts: a guide to the swifts and treeswifts of the world. Sussex (UK): Pica Press. In the morning and evening, \\"twittering\\" sounds may be made at their roost sites. Additionally, juveniles may make begging sounds that are higher-pitched versions of the adult's shrill scree call. = Reproduction = A) Eggs and nest of White-throated swift. B) 8‚Äì9-day-old chicks. C) 23‚Äì24-day-old chicks. D) 38-day-old chick. During the courtship season, White-throated swifts may perform gliding displays and plummeting courtship falls prior to forming monogamous pairs. Once a pair is established, nests made of plant material and feathers held together with saliva are built on rocky cliffs faces or human-made structures.Collins CT. 2009. Notes on the breeding biology of the white-throated swift in southern California. Southern California Academy of Sciences [Internet]. [cited 2018 Sep 17]; 109(2): 23‚Äì36. . These nests are usually 8‚Äì10 centimeters across, and 2.5‚Äì2.8 centimeters deep, and may be used for several years in a row. An average of 4‚Äì5 white matte eggs are laid over the course of 4‚Äì6 days, with incubation generally beginning only after the last egg is laid. In southern parts of their range, egg-laying occurs in April, but in more northerly areas, clutches are usually laid throughout May, with a median first-egg date of May 13. The incubation period lasts on average 24 days, with swifts weighing approximately 2 grams upon hatching. Both parents feed the nestlings, and by the time of fledging, swifts may weigh up to 46 grams. There are no documented cases of swifts attempting a second brood if the first nest fails.  Conservation status  Across North America, White-throated swift populations have declined by 2.8% from 1966‚Äì1998, which is considered to be a significant decline. Such declines could be related to loss of roosting and nesting sites from quarrying, mining, and the demolition of older buildings, as well as reduction in food supply due to pesticide use. However, in certain areas swift populations appear to have increasing trends, and most populations appear stable. The patchy distribution of this species makes interpreting these data difficult, but the apparent overall decline is of concern given the concurrent declines of other aerial insectivores.

The National Cybersecurity FFRDC, operated by the Mitre Corporation, maintains the system, with funding from the National Cyber Security Division of the United States Department of Homeland Security. The system was officially launched for the public in September 1999. The Security Content Automation Protocol uses CVE, and CVE IDs are listed on MITRE's systemcve.mitre.org. CVE¬Æ International in scope and free for public use, CVE is a dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures. as well as in the US National Vulnerability Database. CVE identifiers MITRE Corporation's documentation defines CVE Identifiers (also called \\"CVE names\\", \\"CVE numbers\\", \\"CVE-IDs\\", and \\"CVEs\\") as unique, common identifiers for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities in publicly released software packages. Historically, CVE identifiers had a status of \\"candidate\\" (\\"CAN-\\") and could then be promoted to entries (\\"CVE-\\"), however this practice was ended some time ago and all identifiers are now assigned as CVEs. The assignment of a CVE number is not a guarantee that it will become an official CVE entry (e.g. a CVE may be improperly assigned to an issue which is not a security vulnerability, or which duplicates an existing entry). CVEs are assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA); there are three primary types of CVE number assignments: # The Mitre Corporation functions as Editor and Primary CNA # Various CNAs assign CVE numbers for their own products (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Red Hat, etc.) # A third-party coordinator such as CERT Coordination Center may assign CVE numbers for products not covered by other CNAs When investigating a vulnerability or potential vulnerability it helps to acquire a CVE number early on. CVE numbers may not appear in the MITRE or NVD CVE databases for some time (days, weeks, months or potentially years) due to issues that are embargoed (the CVE number has been assigned but the issue has not been made public), or in cases where the entry is not researched and written up by MITRE due to resource issues. The benefit of early CVE candidacy is that all future correspondence can refer to the CVE number. Information on getting CVE identifiers for issues with open source projects is available from Red Hat. CVEs are for software that has been publicly released; this can include betas and other pre-release versions if they are widely used. Commercial software is included in the \\"publicly released\\" category, however custom-built software that is not distributed would generally not be given a CVE. Additionally services (e.g. a Web-based email provider) are not assigned CVEs for vulnerabilities found in the service (e.g. an XSS vulnerability) unless the issue exists in an underlying software product that is publicly distributed. CVE data fields The CVE database contains several fields: =Description= This is a standardized text description of the issue(s). One common entry is: ** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided. This means that the entry number has been reserved by Mitre for an issue or a CNA has reserved the number. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of 500), the CVE number will be marked as reserved even though the CVE itself may not be assigned by the CNA for some time. Until the CVE is assigned, Mitre is made aware of it (i.e., the embargo passes and the issue is made public), and Mitre has researched the issue and written a description of it, entries will show up as \\"**RESERVED **\\". =References= This is a list of URLs and other information This is the date the entry was created. For CVEs assigned directly by Mitre, this is the date Mitre created the CVE entry. For CVEs assigned by CNAs (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Red Hat, etc.) this is also the date that was created by Mitre, not by the CNA. The case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of 500) the entry date that CVE is assigned to the CNA. =Obsolete fields= The following fields were previously used in older CVE records, but are no longer used. * Phase: The phase the CVE is in (e.g. CAN, CVE). * Votes: Previously board members would vote yay or nay on whether or not the CAN should be accepted and turned into a CVE. * Comments: Comments on the issue. * Proposed: When the issue was first proposed. Changes to syntax In order to support CVE ID's beyond CVE-YEAR-9999 (aka the CVE10k problem, cf. year 10,000 problem) a change was made to the CVE syntax in 2014 and took effect on Jan 13, 2015. The new CVE-ID syntax is variable length and includes: CVE prefix + Year + Arbitrary Digits NOTE: The variable length arbitrary digits will begin at four (4) fixed digits and expand with arbitrary digits only when needed in a calendar year, for example, CVE-YYYY-NNNN and if needed CVE-YYYY-NNNNN, CVE-YYYY-NNNNNN, and so on. This also means there will be no changes needed to previously assigned CVE-IDs, which all include a minimum of 4 digits. CVE SPLIT and MERGE CVE attempts to assign one CVE per security issue, however in many cases this would lead to an extremely large number of CVEs (e.g. where several dozen cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are found in a PHP application due to lack of use of \`htmlspecialchars()\` or the insecure creation of files in \`/tmp\`). To deal with this there are guidelines (subject to change) that cover the splitting and merging of issues into distinct CVE numbers. As a general guideline one should first consider issues to be merged, then issues should be split by the type of vulnerability (e.g. buffer overflow vs. stack overflow), then by the software version affected (e.g. if one issue affects version 1.3.4 through 2.5.4 and the other affects 1.3.4 through 2.5.8 they would be SPLIT) and then by the reporter of the issue (e.g. Alice reports one issue and Bob reports another issue the issues would be SPLIT into separate CVE numbers). Another example is Alice reports a /tmp file creation vulnerability in version 1.2.3 and earlier of ExampleSoft web browser, in addition to this issue several other \`/tmp\` file creation issues are found, in some cases this may be considered as two reporters (and thus SPLIT into two separate CVEs, or if Alice works for ExampleSoft and an ExampleSoft internal team finds the rest it may be MERGE'ed into a single CVE). Conversely, issues can be merged, e.g. if Bob finds 145 XSS vulnerabilities in ExamplePlugin for ExampleFrameWork regardless of the versions affected and so on they may be merged into a single CVE.CVE Abstraction Content Decisions: Rationale and Application Search CVE identifiers The Mitre CVE database can be searched at the CVE List Search, and the NVD CVE database can be searched at Search CVE and CCE Vulnerability Database. CVE usage CVE identifiers are intended for use with respect to identifying vulnerabilities: > Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a dictionary of common names > (i.e., CVE Identifiers) for publicly known information security > vulnerabilities. CVE‚Äôs common identifiers make it easier to share data > across separate network security databases and tools, and provide a baseline > for evaluating the coverage of an organization‚Äôs security tools. If a report > from one of your security tools incorporates CVE Identifiers, you may then > quickly and accurately access fix information in one or more separate CVE- > compatible databases to remediate the problem. Users who have been assigned a CVE identifier for a vulnerability are encouraged to ensure that they place the identifier in any related security reports, web pages, emails, and so on.

The chapel was planned to be a little over double its actual length, but this plan was never completed owing to the downfall of the founder Henry VI. A plaque on a building opposite the west end marks the point to which it should have reached. The Chapel is built in the late Gothic or Perpendicular style. The fan vaulting was installed in the 1950s after the wooden roof became infested with deathwatch beetles. It was completed in three years and is made of concrete, faced with stone, and supported by steel trusses with hand-carved Clipsham stone for the stone ribs supporting each bay. Services Eton College Chapel is in frequent use, with at least one service a day during termtime, and many additional services which are in popular demand, ranging from Taiz√© to Roman Catholic Communion, to Compline. Almost every morning there is a compulsory service, attended by different 'Blocks' (school years) depending on the day, something which has been both criticised and defended by boys in The Chronicle (the school magazine). These last no more than twenty minutes. Founder The interior of Eton College Chapel. The organ of Eton College Chapel. The church yard next to the chapel. Henry VI attached the greatest importance to the religious aspects of his new foundation and he planned that the services would be conducted on a magnificent scale by providing an establishment of 10 fellow priests, 10 chaplains, 10 clerks and 16 choristers. There were to be 14 services a day plus prayers that were said. There would also be masses offered for the Founder's parents and after his death for the Founder instead. This last custom reflected the belief in the Middle Ages that prayers said for a dead person's soul hastened the progress of that soul from Purgatory to Paradise. This was befitting for a church that was to become a great place of pilgrimage in Europe: for about a decade pilgrims attracted by the relics and the available Indulgences flocked to Eton on the Feast of the Assumption in August, when there was a fair lasting six days on the fields. For around forty years before the chapel was completed, services were held in the parish church, which was dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin. In the 1460s the annual influx of pilgrims died out, and the large establishment of clergy was permanently reduced in size. The chapel services remain a key part of the life of the college: boys attend Chapel once on Sundays in addition to compulsory services three or four days a week, and the numerous optional services that take place out of school hours. A second chapel, Lower Chapel, was built in 1890 to accommodate the growing number of boys at the school. The choir The chapel choir is made up of boys from the school, and is directed by the Precentor and Director of Music, Tim Johnson. Up to 75% of the choir are former members of various cathedral and collegiate choirs, and many have been admitted under the school's Music Scholarship scheme. Many continue their singing careers as choral scholars at Oxford or Cambridge. Formerly there was a \\"professional\\" choir whose trebles attended the Choir School. The choir sings at three or four compulsory services a week: recent cuts in the services mean that the choir only sings on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. There are a number of other services that are optional. Acoustics and lighting The chapel is unique amongst its comparably-sized peers in that it eschews sound boards (a common feature of English churches and chapels in which medium-to-large-scale services and concerts are heard) in favour of what the former Precentor, Ralph Allwood, calls a more \\"organic\\" sound produced without the use of equipment (apart from microphones in the pulpit and lectern). The audio reinforcement system in the chapel, installed by DRV Integration, was the winner of the AV Magazine audio project of the year award in 2003. Wall paintings The wall paintings in the chapel are considered to be the most remarkable work of art in the College. They are the work of at least four master painters, including William Baker, who took eight years to complete them (1479‚Äì87). In the Flemish style, they adorn the sides of the chapel. On the north side the paintings depict the Virgin Mary (to whom the chapel is dedicated), while those on the South side tell a popular medieval story about a mythical empress. These paintings were whitewashed over in 1560 as a result of an order from the new Protestant church authorities which banned depictions of mythical miracles. They were left obscured and forgotten for the best part of 300 years until they were rediscovered in 1847, and it was not until 1923 that they were cleaned, restored and revealed by the removal of the stall canopies. Chapel windows In World War II, all of the chapel glass, except a window above the organ, was shattered by a bomb that fell on the nearby Upper School. The replacement East Window is the work of Evie Hone. The designs for the windows on either side are by John Piper and were executed in glass by Patrick Reyntiens. The subjects are divided into four miracles on the north side and four parables on the south side. The miracles are: the Miraculous Draft of Fishes, the Feeding of the Five Thousand, the Stilling of the Waters, and the Raising of Lazarus. The parables are: the Light under a Bushel, the House built on the Rock, the Lost Sheep, and the Sower.

His working title for the story was \\"The Lost U-Boat.\\" The sequence was first published in Blue Book Magazine as a three-part serial in the issues for September, October and November 1918. The complete trilogy was later combined for publication in book form under the title of the first part by A. C. McClurg in June 1924. Beginning with the Ace Books editions of the 1960s, the three segments have usually been issued as separate short novels. Plot introduction Starting out as a harrowing wartime sea adventure, Burroughs's story ultimately develops into a lost world story reminiscent of such novels as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World (1912) and Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island (1874) and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864). Burroughs adds his own twist by postulating a unique biological system for his lost world, in which the slow progress of evolution in the world outside is recapitulated as a matter of individual metamorphosis. This system is only hinted at in The Land That Time Forgot; presented as a mystery whose explication is gradually worked out over the course of the next two novels, it forms a thematic element serving to unite three otherwise rather loosely linked stories. Plot summary Cover art for first separate edition of The Land That Time Forgot by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ace Books, 1963. The novel is set in World War I and opens with a framing story in which a manuscript relating the main story is recovered from a thermos off the coast of Greenland. It purports to be the narrative of Bowen J. Tyler, an American passenger sunk in the English Channel by a German U-boat, , in 1916. He and a woman named Lys La Rue are rescued by a British tugboat. The tug is also sunk, but its crew manages to capture the submarine when it surfaces. Unfortunately, all other British craft continue to regard the sub as an enemy, and they are unable to bring it to port. Sabotage to the navigation equipment sends the U-33 astray into the South Pacific. The imprisoned German crew retakes the sub and begins a raiding cruise, only to be overcome again by the British. A saboteur continues to guide the sub off course, and by the time he is found out it is in Antarctic waters. The U-33 is now low on fuel, with its provisions poisoned by the saboteur Benson. A large island ringed by cliffs is encountered, and identified as Caprona, a land mass first reported by the fictitious Italian explorer Caproni in 1721 whose location was subsequently lost. A freshwater current guides the sub to a stream issuing from a subterranean passage, which is entered on the hope of replenishing the water supply. The U-boat surfaces into a tropical river teeming with primitive creatures extinct elsewhere; attacked, it submerges again and travels upstream in search of a safe harbor. It enters a thermal inland sea, essentially a huge crater lake, whose heat sustains Caprona's tropical climate. As the sub travels north along the island's waterways the climate moderates and wildlife undergoes an apparent evolutionary progression. On the shore of the lake the crew builds a palisaded base, dubbed Fort Dinosaur for the area's prehistoric fauna. The British and Germans agree to work together under Tyler, with Bradley, the mate from the tug, as second in command and Von Schoenvorts, the original sub commander, in control of the Germans. The castaways are attacked by a horde of beast men and take prisoner Ahm, a Neanderthal Man. They learn that the native name for the island is Caspak. Oil is discovered, which they hope to refine into fuel for the U-33. As they set up operations, Bradley undertakes various explorations. During his absence Lys disappears and the Germans abscond with the submarine. Tyler leaves the other survivors to seek and rescue Lys. A series of adventures ensues among various bands of near-human primitives, each representing a different stage of human advancement, as represented by their weaponry. Tyler rescues Lys from a group of Sto-lu (\\"hatchet men\\"), and later aids the escape of a woman of the Band-lu (spearmen) to the Kro-lu (bowmen). Lys is lost again, and chance discoveries of the graves of two men associated with Bradley's expedition leaves Tyler in despair of that party's fate. Unable to find his way back to Fort Dinosaur, he retreats to the barrier cliffs ringing Caspak in a vain hope of attracting rescue from some passing ship. Improbably reunited with Lys, he sets up house with her, completes the account of his adventures which he has been writing, and casts it out to sea in his thermos.

The text is available via Project Gutenberg,The Land That Time Forgot and as an audiobook from LibriVox.Audio file of the novel at LibriVox Adaptations The novel was adapted to film in 1975 under the direction of Kevin Connor by Britain's Amicus Productions. The movie was a sleeper hit and inspired Amicus to make two more Burroughs adaptations, At the Earth's Core (1976), an adaptation of the first book in the Pellucidar series, and The People That Time Forgot (1977), a direct sequel to Land based on the second book of the Caspak series. All three films were distributed in the United States by American International Pictures. A second film adaptation of the same name, produced by the American studio The Asylum, was released in 2009. It featured people from the present interacting with World War II troops on a mysterious, prehistoric island much like the one Burroughs created. This element appeared to be influenced by the DC Comics series \\"The War that Time Forgot\\", which began in the 1960s. In July 2016, publisher American Mythology Productions released a comic book sequel by writer Mike Wolfer and artist Giancarlo Caracuzzo. It stars Bowen J.

On 24 March 2004, the FTC filed a formal complaint alleging multiple violations of the FDCPA. On the same day, a consent decree was entered, in which CAMCO agreed to pay a $300,000 civil penalty and to refrain from further violations of the law. Notwithstanding the agreement, complaints of violations from consumers continued. Accordingly, on 3 December 2004, the FTC obtained an injunction against CAMCO and its owners and froze their assets.

They formed in 2003 while studying at the Glasgow School of Art, consisting of Joel Stone (bass, guitar, vocals), Joe Reeves (bass, guitar, vocals), Jan Lee (keyboards, backing vocals) and Darren Cullen (drums). The band's first single \\"Disco Blood\\"/\\"I Know Kung Fu\\" was released in December 2005. Signed to record label Fierce Panda, their debut album Kingdom of Fear was released on 16 April 2007. The group have been compared to Talking Heads and The Rapture, but admitted influences ranging from Donna Summer, Arthur Russel and The Prodigy to Gang of Four and The Clash. Since the release of \\"Disco Blood\\"/\\"I Know Kung Fu\\" the band toured extensively in the UK and Europe, even playing as far afield as Bangkok and Istanbul. In 2007 they signed to Sony Music in Japan and Dim Mak Records in America. The members of the group produced two tracks for Japanese new-wave unit 80_pan's 2008 album, Disco Baby. Jan Lee left the band in January 2008 to concentrate on his career as an illustrator, and later also entered the restaurant business. He was replaced by Tom Straughan, similarly on keyboards and backing vocals. In 2009 the band split after mutual agreement. Members went on to form the bands Age of Consent and Ubre Blanca, while drummer Darren Cullen has also pursued a career in political art. Album The band began recording their debut album Kingdom of Fear at The Premises recording studio in London with former Clor guitarist turned producer Luke Smith. He had previously worked with the band producing remixes for \\"Disco Blood\\" & \\"Reactor Party\\". The album was to be recorded in two sessions, with the 2nd session taking place after the band had completed the NME New Rave Tour (Oct 2006) supporting Klaxons. During the tour however, after a gig in Birmingham, drummer Darren Cullen fell from the roof of the band's tour bus, breaking his right wrist, requiring an operation and the fitting of a metal plate. For the second recording session Kieron Pepper, live drummer for The Prodigy, was brought in to play on two tracks, \\"Fear of the Future\\" and \\"Dream of Infinity\\". The album also featured the song \\"Reactor Party\\" which was produced by Alan O'Connell. Kingdom of Fear, named after the last book by American writer Hunter S. Thompson, was released on 16 April 2007 on Fierce Panda Records. DJ career In addition to live performances, the band have become well known for their regular DJ sets, playing from the likes of Bugged Out, Gatecrasher & Modular parties in the UK to Judgement Sundays in Ibiza, a recent North American DJ tour and extensively in the Far East.

Most common arrangement In the classic arrangement, occurring with a frequency of approximately 70%, a singular cystic artery originates from the geniculate flexure of the right hepatic artery in the upper portion of the hepatobiliary triangle. A site of origin from a more proximal or distal portion of the right hepatic artery is also considered relatively normal. After separating from the right hepatic artery, the cystic artery travels superiorly to the cystic duct and produces 2 to 4 minor branches, known as Calot‚Äôs arteries, that supply part of the cystic duct and cervix of the gallbladder before dividing into the major superficial and deep branches at the superior aspect of the gallbladder neck: * The superficial branch (or anterior branch) passes subserously over the left aspect of the gallbladder. * The deep branch (or posterior branch) runs between the gallbladder and gallbladder fossa, terminating at the peritoneum attached to the liver surface. Anatomic variation =Double cystic artery= When superficial and deep branches of the cystic artery do not share a common origin it is defined as a double cystic artery occurring with a frequency of 15%. The deep branch consistently arises from the right hepatic artery which is generally also the source of origin of the superficial branch, however in some cases it has been found to initiate from the anterior segmental artery, middle hepatic artery, left hepatic artery, superior mesenteric artery, gastroduodenal artery or retroduodenal artery. Approximately half of superficial cystic arteries have been shown to enter through the hepatobiliary triangle, while deep cystic arteries are often quite small in length and diameter. Tripling of the cystic artery is very rare, occurring in between 0-0.3% of cases. =Aberrant origin of the right hepatic artery= Unusual anatomy of the right hepatic can itself affect the path and form of the cystic artery, with the most frequent variation resulting from an aberrant origin of the right hepatic artery which is described in between 2-16% of cases. Generally this anomalous source is the superior mesenteric artery or more rarely the abdominal aorta, producing what has been described as a \\"replacing right hepatic artery\\", passing through the hepatobiliary triangle and running posterior and parallel to the cystic duct. Because of the close proximity to the gallbladder to the (replacing) right hepatic artery a \\"caterpillar\\" or \\"Moynihan's\\" hump may form and this artery generally produces multiple short cystic branches rather than a single cystic artery. =Left hepatic artery= The cystic artery can arise from the left hepatic artery, and in such a case it usually travels through a passage of liver parenchyma, approaching the neck of the gallbladder, before bifurcating into ascending (or superior) and descending (or inferior) branches. This situation is found in roughly 1% of cases. This form of the cystic artery does not pass through the hepatobiliary triangle and has been found located both anteriorly and posteriorly to the common hepatic duct. =Recurrent cystic artery= In less than 1% of patients a form known as a recurrent cystic artery is found ‚Äì the cystic artery arises from the left hepatic artery and passes through either the cholecystoduodenal or cholecystocolic ligaments (connecting the gallbladder to the duodenum and transverse colon respectively), follows the right edge of the hepatoduodenal ligament, and connects to the fundus of the gallbladder before descending to supply the body and neck. =Low-lying cystic artery= When a single cystic artery arises from gastroduodenal artery it forms a configuration is known as low-lying cystic artery, as it passes inferior to the cystic duct through the cholecystoduodenal ligament, and therefore remains outside the hepatobiliary triangle. This condition has alternatively been described as an inferior cystic artery and transposition of the cystic artery and duct with a prevalence at approximately 5%. In 25% of these patients with this course there will be a secondary arterial supply to the gallbladder, with the low-lying artery acting as the equivalent of the posterior branch. Clinical significance It must be identified and ligated in operations that remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomies).

It is native to coastal regions of western North America, including the Pacific Ocean and the southern Gulf of California, as far north as British Columbia and southern Alaska, but is replaced in the inland regions by the Cordilleran flycatcher. These two species were classified as a single species, commonly called the western flycatcher, by the American Ornithologists‚Äô Union until 1989. In winter, both species migrate south to Mexico, where they are virtually indistinguishable from one another. Description In plumage, the Pacific-slope flycatcher is virtually identical to the Cordilleran flycatcher, and differs only subtly from most Empidonax flycatchers in North America, but its breeding habitat and call are different. Its call can vary slightly by different regions and the bird itself. Habitat The Pacific-slope flycatcher inhabits either coniferous or deciduous forests. In its range it enters mixed woods, Douglas fir forests, redwood forests, and many other wooded environments including riparian woodlands. As of November 2019, there has been one case of these West Coast birds showing up on the East Coast, in Palmyra, New Jersey. Diet As a flycatcher it will wait on a perch and when it sees a flying insect it will chase it without any apparent effort. They also enter swarms of gnats, mosquitos and wherever such insects congregate. They fulfill an important role in keeping insect populations in check, particularly mosquitoes, and they also eat caterpillars and spiders.

He was extensively educated in law, humanities, theology, military science, natural sciences, and even studied under Galileo. He also traveled over much of Europe.  Biography  Rafa≈Ç started his political career in the Sejmik of the Sandomierz Voivodeship. He was an opponent of king Sigismund III Vasa, but he never rose up in open rebellion like the participants in the Zebrzydowski Rebellion. He was Protestant, and was a defender of Protestant rights and religious tolerance in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, dedicating most of his political influence to matters of religion. He provided shelter for Czech Brethren and refugees from Silesia during the Thirty Years' War. He sponsored many new Protestant churches and schools, and developed existing ones, like the school in Leszno, under Czech pedagogue Jan Amos Kome≈Ñski. He was called the \\"Pope of Calvinists in Poland.\\" In foreign politics, he supported cooperation with both Catholic France and Protestant countries like Sweden. He corresponded with Gabor Bethlen of Transylvania and George William, Elector of Brandenburg. George William of Brandenburg gave him a yearly donation of 3000 zloty, in exchange for his support for Protestant cause. After 1629 he also corresponded with Axel Oxenstierna, the Swedish chancellor. He was a strong supporter of the marriage between W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Waza and a Protestant (Calvinist) princess. He took part in the 1635 negotiations with Sweden, where he worked with the French ambassador, count Claude d'Avaux. He advised the king against hostilities with Sweden, and after the peace of 1635, he wanted to direct Polish foreign policy towards Silesia. During his life he gathered substantial wealth: 17 towns and over 100 villages in Wielkopolska, Baran√≥w and nearby lands in Sandomierz Voivodeship, W≈Çodawa in Polesia, Woronczyn, Roman√≥w and Beresteczko on Wo≈Çy≈Ñ and Ru≈õ.

He is also the executive editor of the journal Critical Inquiry. Davidson is a recent Guggenheim Fellowship recipient. Philosophical work Davidson's scholarship concentrates in contemporary Continental Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, the History of Theology, and Historical Epistemology and the History of the Human Sciences. His publications (books, articles and essays) cover a wide array of ranging from the Moral Philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas, Vladimir Jank√©l√©vitch, and Pierre Hadot to Georges Canguilhem's Philosophy of Science. Many of Davidson's publications are written in French and Italian and published by European presses. Much of Davidson's scholarship focuses on the theory of Michel Foucault. Davidson is the editor of several books on or by Foucault including: Foucault and His Interlocutors, Society Must Be Defended, Abnormal, and The Hermeneutics of the Subject. In Davidson's recent book, The Emergence of Sexuality: Historical Epistemology and the Formation of Concepts, he applies and develops Foucauldian archeological and genealogical methodological innovations in the development of a method he calls \\"Historical Epistemology\\". This work consists of essays on epistemology, the history of sexuality and scientific concepts, and the interpretation of Foucault. Bibliography * A. I.
