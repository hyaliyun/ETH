Mr. Makovsky's commentary on U.S. policy towards the Middle East and Middle East peace process has been broadcast on the PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. His writings can be found in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and Foreign Affairs. Education, career and personal life David Makovsky received his bachelor's degree from Columbia University and his master's in Middle East studies from Harvard University. From 1989 to 2000, David Makovsky extensively covered the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, in his roles as executive editor and editor-in-chief (1999-2000) of The Jerusalem Post, and diplomatic correspondent for Israel's major daily Haaretz. During this time, he also served as special Jerusalem correspondent to U.S. News & World Report, for which he subsequently served as contributing editor. He was recognized for his accomplishments in journalism in 1994, when he was awarded the National Press Club's Edwin M. Hood Award for Diplomatic Correspondence, in recognition for his cover story on PLO finances that he co- wrote for the magazine. In July of that year, Mr. Makovsky became the first journalist writing for an Israeli publication to visit Damascus. This had been made possible with the personal intervention of then Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Mr. Makovsky would go on to make five trips to Syria. In the last of these trips, in December 1999, he accompanied then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Mr. Makovsky also made history in March 1995 when he was given unprecedented permission, with the help of U.S. officials, to file reports from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for an Israeli publication. Mr. Makovsky currently lives in Maryland with his wife, Varda, and his three children, Tani, Josh, and Elliana. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy Currently, David Makovsky is Senior Fellow and the Ziegler distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP). The Washington Institute was founded in 1985 with the goal of helping advance U.S. interests in the Middle East. The Washington Institute has a senior research staff whose expertise cover a wide variety of the issues relevant in the Middle East, including political, military, security, and economic issues. Most speak the native languages of the Middle East, have lived and worked there, and frequently are from the region themselves.\\"Our History\\". 20 August 2009. http://washingtoninstitute.org/templateC11.php?CID=20&newActiveSubNav;=Our%20History&activeSubNavLink;=templateC11.php%3FCID%3D20&newActiveNav;=aboutUs The experts of the Washington Institute are often quoted in major American and international media, interviewed on network television and radio programs, and featured as authors of op-eds in influential newspapers. In addition, the Institute publishes material that is generally recognized by journalists, officials, and diplomats as \\"must reading\\". Both in and out of Washington, the Institute's policy briefs, monographs, and other publications are read by those seeking immediate analysis of current events and long term assessments of trends in Middle East issues. At its inception, the Institute's main focus was on Arab-Israeli issues and overall U.S. Middle East policy. In the 1990s, the scope of the Institute's research grew as the Soviet Union fell and the first Gulf War took place. This expansion included a particular focus on Turkey and the rise of Islamic politics in understanding the political trends in the post-Soviet Middle East. The range of issues covered by the Institute expanded once again after September 11, this time driven by the focus of the U.S. on the Middle East as a central foreign policy concern. The Institute has thus dedicated new resources to assist the U.S. government in understanding and countering Islamist extremism, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. The ultimate hope of the Washington Institute is to see a more stable, secure, and prosperous Middle East. It is the work of the Institute to aid the American leadership with the ideas and talents of people who can understand and shape policy. Published work David Makovsky is the author of the books Making Peace With The PLO: The Rabin Government's Road To The Oslo Accord, Engagement Through Disengagement: Gaza and the Potential for Renewed Israeli-Palestinian Peacemaking, and more recently Myths, Illusions, & Peace: Finding a New Direction for America in the Middle East. Myths, Illusions, & Peace, coauthored with Dennis Ross, sets out to prove the many myths about the Middle East false, and help set a new course for American foreign policy in the Middle East. In addition, he is the author or coauthor of several Washington Institute monographs, including Lessons and Implications of the Israel- Hizballah War: A Preliminary Assessment (2006); Olmert's Unilateral Option: An Early Assessment (2006); Hamas Triumphant (2006); Engagement Through Disengagement: Gaza and the Potential for Israeli-Palestinian Peacemaking (2005); A Defensible Fence: Fighting Terror and Enabling a Two State Solution (2004). David Makovsky also wrote Making Peace with the PLO: The Rabin Government's Road to the Oslo Accord (Washington Institute/Westview Press/HarperCollins, 1996); and contributed to a collection on U.S. involvement in the First Gulf War, Triumph without Victory (Random House, 1992).

She was built at Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina and was commissioned on 21 November 1944. LSM(R)-190 took part in the Battle of Okinawa from 7 April‚Äì4 May 1945. She was hit and sunk by a Japanese suicide plane on 4 May 1945 while on the radar picket line. She later received a Navy Unit Commendation for her service off Okinawa. Her commanding officer was Lt. Richard H. Saunders, USNR. Design History (Friedman) The LSM(R)-190 was one of twelve amphibious ships that evolved during World War II as battle experience identified new weapon requirements for the invasion of the Japanese home islands. The origins of the LSM(R) can be traced to a British Admiralty lend lease request for special amphibious transports to land tanks for the invasion of France. This presented two design problems. It required the design of oceangoing ships that could safely and efficiently travel from the US to England and second; include shallow drafts for beach landings. During October 1941 Major R. E. Holloway, Royal Engineers, brought to the attention of the US Navy an idea patented by Otto Popper of Bratislava, Czechoslovakia in 1924 of a barge transporter for use on the Danube River that flooded down to allow barges aboard, then pumped out it tanks to lift them out of the water. Norman Freidman reports that on 4 November 1941 this concept led to the breakthrough design by John C. Niedermair, civilian technical director, BuShips preliminary design section, based on ballasting techniques used on submarines that solved both design problems. This led to the construction of thousands of US Navy amphibious ships including the original LST's and with hundreds of incremental improvements modifications and conversions of LTC's, LCM's and LSM's. British and US visionaries instrumental in supporting the concept include Captain Thomas A Hussey, COHO, and Sir Henry C. B. Weymss of the British mission to the US, Captain Edward Cochrane BuShips, the Army's Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall and Winston Churchill when he personally pushed the project for special amphibious ships and won President Roosevelt's reluctant approval. This decision proved providential a short time later with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The design criteria for the US Navy amphibious forces for the invasion of Japan was already underway. In 1944 with the US Navy BuOrd's mounting of a 5-inch/38 gun and state of the art rocket launchers on the LSM its mission changed and the LSM(R) became the \\"ultimate\\" landing troop fire support out to 4,000 yards beyond the beach, designed for interdiction, harassment, destruction, illumination and high trajectory fire to destroy reverse slope targets for the invasion of Japan. Service History (Turner) During World War II the ship was assigned to the Asiatic Pacific theater. At that time the fleet was under the command of Admiral Spruance and named the Fifth fleet. Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner was Commander of Amphibious Forces Pacific and was to be in charge of operations until the beachhead was established. The Kerama Retto islands were a small chain of islands 15 miles west of the southwest tip of Okinawa. The invasion of the Kerma Retto was an opportunity to break in all twelve of the 188-class LSM(R)s. One of the reasons that Admiral Turner wanted to capture Kerama Retto was his knowledge that the Japanese Sea Raiding Units had suicide boats hidden there. On the morning of 29 March three of these boats attacked the USS LSM(R)-189 but were promptly destroyed. On 1 April 1945 the southern half of the six-mile-wide Okinawa invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 55, commanded by Rear Admiral John Leslie Hall, Jr. The assault troops were under Major General John R. Hodge. The southern support craft included LSM(R)s 189, USS LSM(R)-190, USS LSM(R)-191, USS LSM(R)-192, and USS LSM(R)-193. The northern half of the six-mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 53, under the command of Rear Admiral Lawrence F. Reifsnider. The LSMR's involved in the invasion as part of the Northern Tractor Flotilla included USS LSM(R)-194, USS LSM(R)-195, USS LSM(R)-196, USS LSM(R)-197, USS LSM(R)-198, and USS LSM(R)-199. On 3 May 1945 the 188-class LSM(R)'s were put to the test and were not found wanting. The action at the picket stations proved that the courage and punishment endured by US Navy personnel was unrelated to the size of the ship. The Japanese launched their fifth kikusui attack on 3 May. Picket station 10 was the hardest hit. Shortly before dusk, the destroyer USS Aaron Ward was hit by a series of six kamikazes, suffering 45 killed or missing and 49 wounded. The ship survived, but was later decommissioned because it wasn't worth repairing. About the same time, approximately 20 planes attacked destroyer USS Little. She was crashed by four of them and sank within 12 minutes of the first hit. She lost 30 dead or missing and 79 wounded. USS LSM(R)-195 was also on Picket Station 10 and while rushing to the aid of the Aaron Ward and the Little was likewise crashed by a kamikaze. The crash started her rockets exploding and knocked out the fire main and auxiliary pumps. LSM(R)-195 had to be abandoned and, after being ripped by heavy explosions, sank. The following day the ordeal for the LSM(R)'s reached its tragic climax. The day dawned bright and ominous. LSM(R) 190 was patrolling at Picket Station 12. Not long after sunrise the anticipated kamikazes arrived and were met by American combat air patrol. Several of the Japanese planes managed to get through and attack the ships on this station. Three kamikazes crashed LSM(R) 190. The ship that had seen so much previous action and had been credited with rescuing 180 survivors of other stricken ships was herself sunk. In the same attack the destroyer USS Luce was sunk, carrying 126 of her 312 officers and men with her. At the same time as LSM(R) 190 was fighting her final battle, USS LSM(R)-194 was facing the same fate at Picket Station 1. This was the most critical station on the picket line. The capture of the Kerama Islands did not come without a price. On the night of 28 March, Japanese planes from Okinawa airfields made a special attack on the small patrol craft assembled between the islands and Okinawa. About a dozen were shot down, but one crashed into USS LSM(R)-188. There were 15 men killed and another 32 wounded. The badly damaged ship survived, but she was sent back to Pearl Harbor and saw no further combat. No one realized at the time that this was a preview of what this class of ship would suffer six weeks later on the picket line. Small Boys With Twice the Striking Power Of The Battleship Iowa(Stewart) The LSM(R) was heralded in the 16 April 1945 Life Magazine with a centerfold picture. \\"Each of these tiny ships had amazing firepower, greater at short range than the combined firepower of two mammoth Iowa class battleships\\", ran the caption. The interim group of 12 LSM(R)s transited the Panama Canal and via San Diego, Honolulu, and the Philippines, headed for battle against Japan in March 1945. Unaware of their destination, the crews were nonetheless well equipped and trained. In a preliminary assault on 26 March 1945, they laid down a rocket barrage at dawn on Kerama Retta, a small cluster of islands off the southwestern shore of Okinawa. Their objective: to allow the 77th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army to swiftly land and secure the islands and the harbor for protection of the hospital, supply and communication ships, and floating drydocks. The early dawn assault surprised the Japanese. The marines took control with a minimum of casualties and established this area as a haven for damaged ships. Okinawa Radar Picket Line ( C.T.G. 52.21) The American defense against the kamikazes was to have fighters intercept the Japanese as early as possible. Sixteen radar picket stations were established around the island, in some cases almost 100 miles out, to give early warning of the Japanese planes which might be coming from any direction. Each station was manned around the clock by a handful of ships ranging from destroyers down to minesweepers. Their job was to sound the alarm and vector fighters to intercept before the Japanese could attack the fleet anchored off Okinawa and the Allied forces and supply dumps ashore. Unfortunately, some of the eager-to-die Japanese wanted to attack the first American ships they saw: the pickets. Dennis L. Francis LSM Commander, Flotilla Nine for the period 2 April - April 20, Action Report indicated that . . .\\"these ships are not particularly suited for picket duty. Since their primary function is to deliver rockets during invasion operations, it seems feasible that subjecting them to continual enemy air attack will allow this secondary duty to seriously effect their ability to perform their primary function due to damage. They have no great value in combating enemy air craft due to the absence of air search radar, adequate director control for the 5\\"/38 main battery, and director control for the 40mm single guns. The fact that they carry a considerable quantity of explosive rockets in their magazines presents another hazard. In general, it is believed that assigning them to picket duty should be avoided since it means risking the operation of a limited number of specialized ships which could be performed by any number of other landing craft whose primary function is more closely coincident with screening operations.\\" Before these recommendations were implemented the USS LSMR-195 was sunk by Kamikaze aircraft on 3 May 1945 with 9 killed and 16 wounded, the USS LSMR-190 was sunk by Kamikaze aircraft on 4 May 1945. Sinking of USS LSM(R)-190 (MacKay) May 4, 1945 Radar Picket Station 12 off the coast of Okinawa, as reported by Lt.(jg) George T. Harmon, Executive Officer. The attack on LSM(R) 190 began at 0808 with a Dinah flying over the stern dropping a bomb which missed. This plane was hit by our automatic weapons. Thereupon the plane turned over, returned and dived into the 5\\"/38 mount, setting it on fire. Shrapnel resulting from the plane crash severely injured the CO, Lt. Richard J. Saunders USNR, rendering him prostrate and immediately killed the Gunnery Officer, Ensign Stuart C. Bjorklund. As their wounded skipper slipped in and out of consciousness, the LSM(R) 190 continued steaming under the last order given to the helm prior to the crash‚Äîfull right rudder at flank speed. Reacting quickly, Radioman William J. Nuber, standing Phone Talker watch on the bridge, took over the Wheelhouse and conned the ship until relieved by the wounded Communications Officer Ensign Lyle Tennis. The 5\\"/38 mount was practically knocked off its foundation and set on fire that spread to the Handling Room and After Storage Space. The sprinkler system to the magazines and the after rocket assembly room were ordered turned on and fire hoses broken out from amidships and played on the 5\\"/38 mount. However, as the fire mains had been ruptured, pressure was negligible, and the Damage Control Parties commenced breaking out lines from the auxiliary fire pump. A second kamikaze attacker approached low above the water from the port beam, then crashed into the upper level of the engine room. Wreckage of this plane remained stuck into the side of the ship. Fires broke out in the engine room and the crash disabled the auxiliary fire pump. Smoke was so thick that it was impossible to see engine controls. Lt.(jg) Engineering Officer Gordon Etter, remained in the engine room until and permission was granted to abandon the area as fires turned it into a virtual blast furnace. A third Japanese plane came after the LSM(R)190 about 0824 as the ship attempted evasive maneuvers and zigzagging at flank speed. The twin engine fighter crossed from port to starboard about mast head height, it dropped a bomb that missed widely by some 700 yards. By now the ship was all but defenseless with every gun out of action except the starboard abaft 20mm. Two minutes later a fourth plane attacked in 'sneak' fashion releasing a bomb which hit the Mk. 51 Director tub. A fifth plane, a Val, dove from a considerable height pursued by Corsairs of the CAP which arrived on the scene. This plane crossed from port aft of the starboard 20mm causing no damage. As the fires were now beyond control and ship had developed a decided port list it was decided to abandon ship. The body of Ensign Bjorklund and the wounded CO were carried down from the Conn by officers Etter and Tennis and placed in life rafts. Twenty minutes later (0850) approximately the ship went down. As the abandoned, burning LSM(R)190 sank beneath the waves those in the water felt the violent explosions from the rocket ship. USS LSM(R) 190 Lost 14 killed and 18 wounded was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, for meritorious service in action against enemy Japanese Kamikaze aircraft. Operating on the advanced flank at Okinawa on radar picket stations, heroically repelled numerous suicide attacks, being responsible singly for the destruction of several enemy aircraft. It participated in the rescue of survivors from sinking ships to a total of one hundred eighty. When finally succumbing to Kamikaze attacks, which directly hit the ship, fought gallantly until she sank. Her courageous determination and effort were keeping with the highest traditions of the US Naval Service. Tribute To Those Who Served (Turner) The victory at Okinawa was never in doubt, but the price paid was very, very high. The numbers for American casualties were the highest of any campaign against the Japanese. Total casualties were 49,151, of which 12,520 were killed or missing and 36,631 were wounded. Of this number the Navy casualties were 4,907 killed or missing and 4,824 wounded. The ship losses were 36 sunk and 368 damaged, with many of the damaged ships never being returned to combat readiness. Approximately 110,000 Japanese were killed. These numbers rung up during the last campaign of World War II, may seem appalling, but in hindsight would have seemed small in comparison to the casualties on both sides had the invasion of Japan taken place as planned.

As president of the Tennessee Electric Power Company (TEPCO), he became one of the staunchest and most outspoken opponents of the newly formed Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the 1930s. With the help of attorney Wendell Willkie, Guild waged a legal battle that questioned the constitutionality of TVA, culminating in a U.S. Supreme Court case dismissal that forced TEPCO to sell its assets to the new federal agency.Timothy Ezzell, Jo Conn Guild. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 20 August 2009. Working for his father's Chattanooga and Tennessee River Power Company as a young engineer in the early 1900s, Guild helped build Hales Bar Dam, the first dam on the main channel of the Tennessee River and the first hydroelectric dam on a navigable channel in the United States. After his father's death, he helped the company expand, eventually merging it with several other companies to form TEPCO in 1922. Guild served as vice-president of TEPCO throughout the 1920s, and by the time he was named president in 1933, the company was the state's largest electric power company, controlling plants such as Hales Bar Dam, Ocoee dams No. 1 and No. 2, Blue Ridge Dam, and Great Falls Dam. Although eventually forced to sell TEPCO's power division, Guild continued operating the company's streetcar holdings, eventually transforming these holdings into the Southern Coach bus lines. Biography Early life Guild was born in Chattanooga in 1887, the son of Josephus Conn Guild, Sr. (1862-1907) and Mary Orr. Guild's grandfather, George Guild, served as mayor of Nashville in the early 1890s, and his namesake great-grandfather Josephus Conn Guild (1802-1883) was a prominent Sumner County judge and author. The name \\"Conn\\" was the maiden name of Guild's great-great-grandmother (Judge Guild's mother), Elizabeth Conn. Guild's father, who moved to Chattanooga in 1885, has been described as \\"the most capable engineer of his day.\\" In the 1890s, he designed the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway, which at the time of its construction was the steepest railway in the world.John Trotwood Moore (editor) and Austin Foster, Tennessee the Volunteer State, 1769-1923 (Nashville, Tenn.: S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1923), pp. 66-73. Guild attended the Baylor School (his father was a friend of the school's founder) from 1897 to 1905, after which he received technical training at the University of Virginia and studied engineering at Vanderbilt. In 1904, Guild accompanied his father and his father's business partner Charles James to what would eventually be the Hales Bar Dam site, where they met with Nicholas Brady (son of New York financier Anthony N. Brady) and utilities expert Thomas E. Murray to secure funding for the dam's construction. Guild, Sr. and James established the Chattanooga & Tennessee River Power Company that same year to oversee the dam's construction.Gilbert Govan, The Chattanooga Country, 1540-1962: from Tomahawks to TVA (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1963), pp. 445-8, 456-460. TEPCO and TVA After receiving his engineering degree in 1909, Guild joined his late father's company and aided in the completion of Hales Bar Dam. The dam went into operation in November 1913, after which the title was turned over to the federal government, with Chattanooga & Tennessee Power retaining rights to the power generation profits for 99 years. In 1915, Guild was named Chattanooga & Tennessee Power's general manager, and in 1922 he helped oversee the merger of several Tennessee power firms to form the Tennessee Electric Power Company (TEPCO). The merger included Chattanooga & Tennessee Power, the Tennessee Power Company (which had built Great Falls Dam on the Caney Fork in 1917), and the E.W. Clark & Co. subsidiaries Chattanooga Railway & Light (which controlled Chattanooga's street lights and street cars) and the East Tennessee Power Company (which had built Ocoee dams 1 and 2 on the Ocoee River). In the 1920s, with Guild as its vice president, TEPCO expanded rapidly, eventually acquiring control of 45 Tennessee power and utilities firms.James B. Jones, Towards an Understanding of the History and Material Culture of Pre-TVA Hydroelectric Development in Tennessee, 1900-1933, Part I . Posted 2004-01-17. Retrieved: 2009-08-20. Blue Ridge Dam, which was advanced enough to require just six employees for its operations, was completed in the early 1930s by a TEPCO subsidiary. In 1933, Guild was selected as TEPCO's president. As part of President Roosevelt's New Deal initiatives, the federal government created the TVA in 1933. TVA was given oversight of the entire Tennessee River watershed and the power to use eminent domain to seize privately owned dams in the watershed. Guild vehemently opposed the agency's creation. In 1936, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of TVA in the Ashwander case, TEPCO and several other private firms sued TVA, challenging the agency's constitutionality. The private utilities were represented by Wendell Willkie (Willkie's Commonwealth and Southern Corporation owned interests in several of the power firms) and Newton D. Baker, while TVA was represented by attorneys James Lawrence Fly and John Lord O'Brian. The federal district court ruled in favor of the private utilities, but the decision was overturned by the Court of Appeals in early 1938. The private utilities appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which dismissed the suit in January 1939, claiming the utilities lacked standing. On August 15, 1939, TEPCO sold its assets to TVA for $78 million. Later life Guild retained control of TEPCO's Chattanooga street car division, which he reorganized as Southern Coach Lines in 1941. The company operated street cars until 1946, when it focused on bus travel. Guild retired as company president in 1961.John Shearer, Remembering Jo Conn Guild. The Chattanoogan.com, 2008-05-06. Retrieved: 2009-08-20. The company was purchased by the Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority in 1973. Guild owned a large house on Lookout Mountain, and even in his later years, it was not uncommon to see Guild driving down the mountain in one of his custom-made sports cars. Guild also owned a cattle and hog farm near Columbia, Tennessee, where he cured hams and sausages using old family recipes. Guild married his first wife, Sarah Nichols, in 1912, and they had one daughter, Virginia (1915-2001). Guild died on June 26, 1969, and is buried in the Forest Hills Cemetery.

Her mother, Ruby, was of Swiss-German origin. For most of Julia's life she lived in England, where she worked as a model at Poiret, as a photographer and as a publisher's reader, before she embarked upon a career in novel-writing. She is perhaps best remembered for her work Cheerful Weather for the Wedding. Early life A young Julia Strachey in 1913 at the suffrage parade in Littlehampton Julia Strachey spent the first six years of her life in India before travelling to London. After her parents' divorce, she moved in with her aunt Elinor Rendel in Melbury Road, off Kensington High Street. Four years later, Julia was sent to Brackenhurst boarding school; and it was during this time that Oliver Strachey began a new romance with Rendel's close friend Ray Costelloe, the niece of Alys Pearsall Smith, then the wife of the British philosopher Bertrand Russell. Julia in turn developed an intimate friendship with Alys, whom she affectionately referred to as 'Aunty Loo'. Smith's unusual and often wicked sense of humour was to have a lasting effect on Julia's literary style. Bloomsbury and Beyond In 1932 the eccentric and witty Cheerful Weather for the Wedding was published by the Hogarth Press. Virginia Woolf wrote: 'I think it astonishingly good - complete and sharp and individual.' Both through the connections of her uncle Lytton, and the name she made for herself through her writing, Julia soon became integrated into the Bloomsbury Group, frequenting many of its social events. These unique experiences had a strong influence on her fiction. Until 1964, Julia was also an avid member of Bloomsbury's Memoir Club, where she and its other members discussed and wrote about their shared memories. In 1927 Julia married the sculptor Stephen Tomlin, who created busts of Lytton Strachey and Virginia Woolf. They separated in 1934. During this period, Julia made a living by writing short stories for magazines. It was also the beginning of her novel-writing career. In 1939, she met the artist (and later critic) Lawrence Gowing, who was, at the time, only 21 years old. The couple went on to spend thirty years together, fifteen of them married, in Newcastle and in Chelsea, before Gowing fell in love with another woman. Strachey died in 1979 after a long illness.

King Yeongjo sent a diplomatic mission to Japan (Joseon Tongsinsa) in 1764. This embassy to court of Tokugawa Ieharu was led by Jo Eom. This diplomatic mission functioned to the advantage of both the Japanese and the Koreans as a channel for developing a political foundation for trade.Walker, Brett L. \\"Foreign Affairs and Frontiers in Early Modern Japan: A Historiographical Essay,\\" Early Modern Japan.

However, he took away all power by accusation. After his return to court, Jo Eom was appointed Daesagan (ÎåÄÏÇ¨Í∞Ñ, Â§ßÂè∏Ë´´) and Ijo panseo. In 1777, he was entrapped and banished to Wiwon, northern Pyongan region, by Hong Guk-yeong's faction. Later, he was transferred to Gimhae, southern Gyeongsang region, and died there.

Plot  The archeologist Sir Pericles Pemberton-Smythe has disappeared while exploring the mysterious ruins of an ancient city in the forests of South America. The player must lead the rescue party to the missing scientist and then escape the haunted city and its sinister guardians.  Gameplay  The player controls the four members of the party, each of whom have different abilities #Daphne Pemberton-Smythe, daughter of the missing archeologist (good at finding things) #Professor Roger Kite (clever but naive and prone to getting lost) #Patrick \\"Legless\\" O'Donnell, a journalist with a drink problem (strong but clumsy) #Frozbie the dog (can find buried objects) The characters are controlled via the keyboard or joystick in Mobile Mode. Pressing \\"fire\\" activates Selection Mode: a menu system which is navigated by the \\"right\\" and \\"left\\" commands. The \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" commands return the player to Mobile Mode. Selection Mode allows the player to choose another character to control, use objects, or toggle the character mode between \\"SOLO\\" and \\"LEAD\\", the latter option causing the computer controlled characters to follow the player's character. Useful objects are scattered about the city, and can be picked up by simply walking over them. Certain objects can be thrown as weapons by selecting them in the inventory window, and then pressing \\"fire\\" while moving in Mobile Mode. This procedure is also used to drop unwanted items. Different characters use objects in different ways (e.g. Patrick and the Professor can throw further than Daphne.) Many different monsters can be found guarding the city. Some will ignore the party unless approached. Others will actively pursue interlopers on sight.  Development  Mark Goodall, one of the game developers: > \\"The game was an idea of Andrew Hewson's.

It powered most of the electricity-powered machinery in the 1000-employee zinc smelter plant until the plant closed in 1973. It was later donated to the Oklahoma Steam Thresher Association, disassembled, and restored in its own building on the Pawnee County Fairgrounds.

The application states that the significance of this engine is:\\"...(1) its position of pre-eminence in the history of American technology, (2) its role in the Industrial development of Oklahoma, and (3) its survival as one of the country's few remaining functional Corliss Engines.\\" History of Corliss steam engines A steam engine fitted with rotary valves and having variable valve timing was invented by and named for an American Engineer, George Henry Corliss, in 1849. Engines fitted with Corliss valve gear offered the best thermal efficiency of any type of stationary steam engine until the refinement of the uniflow steam engine and steam turbine in the 20th century. Corliss engines were generally about 30 percent more fuel efficient than conventional steam engines with fixed cutoff.Rosenberg and Trajtenberg, A General Purpose Technology at Work, The Journal of Economic History, 64, 1 (March 2004) page 75 This increased efficiency made steam power more economical than water power, allowing industrial development away from millponds.Diana Muir, Reflections in Bullough's Pond, University Press of New England, p. 173. Description of the Pawnee engine The Corliss engine now displayed in Pawnee was part of an Allis-Chalmers steam electric generating plant. It is a large piece of machinery in every respect, being long by wide and weighing 110 tons. The flywheel is in diameter and weighs 10 tons. The cylinder has a bore with a stroke. This engine uses separate valves for the steam and the exhaust to allow natural drainage. It also has a Reynolds trip gear, which uses a spring to cause the engagement of the hook with the catch plate. Sudden unequal pressure buildups were prevented by having a space between the outer surface of the boiler and the inner surface of the steam regulator. At the time of the NRHP application, the system was assessed in good operating condition.

While critics complimented the sharpness of the graphics and great amount of detail, they generally found that the sensitive controls, the high density of vehicles on the road, and the rotation of the camera when the player's car turns make the game disorienting and sometimes frustrating to play. Rob Allsetter wrote in Sega Saturn Magazine, \\"Although Crimewave has its moments, it's let down by gameplay that's too repetitive and controls that are often frustrating.\\" GamePros Coach Kyle similarly described it as \\"an average driving/shooting game that's neither varied enough nor thrilling enough to offer great gunplay.\\" Shawn Smith and Crispin Boyer of Electronic Gaming Monthly were slightly more positive, with Boyer opining, \\"Crime Wave doesn't offer revolutionary graphics or especially innovative gameplay. It's just a fun title that delivers plenty of arcade action.\\" Co- reviewers Dan Hsu and Sushi-X fell more in line with the majority; Hsu said the game made him throw his controller down in frustration. Ryan MacDonald of GameSpot concluded that CrimeWave \\"isn't bad\\", but that the gameplay is limited and average enough that it becomes dull after a relatively short time.

His success continued over the years that followed, with Ikeda making the top eight of one premier event each season from 2000-01 and 2005. His breakout performance on the Pro Tour came at Pro Tour Yokohama in 2003. Ikeda made the top eight, and finished third, losing to countryman Masashi Oiso in the semifinals. The following season, Ikeda reached the finals of the team Pro Tour in Seattle. Alongside teammates Itaru Ishida and Jin Okomoto, Ikeda lost the finals to von Dutch, consisting of Jelger Wiegersma, Kamiel Cornelissen, and Jeroen Remie. After 2005, Ikeda took a break from the game, only to come back in 2008 better than ever. After having top eighted two Grand Prix that season, Ikeda made his third Pro Tour top eight at the World Championship in Memphis, Tennessee. A semifinal loss to Jamie Parke saw him finish third. Ikeda's renewed success continued through 2009. Ikeda won a premier level event for the first time that season at Grand Prix Niigata. To follow up on his win, Ikeda made another top eight at Pro Tour Austin. Like in Seattle five years earlier, Ikeda lost the finals again, this time to Brian Kibler.

It was released on 14 August 2009 by Young Turks, an imprint label of XL Recordings. After signing a record contract with XL, the xx recorded the album from December 2008 to February 2009 at the label's in-house studio in London. The audio engineer Rodaidh McDonald worked with the band during the recording sessions and attempted to reproduce the intimate, unembellished quality of their demos. The band's Jamie Smith produced xx on his laptop and created electronic beats for the songs, which he then mixed in a detailed process with McDonald. Although the xx had been strongly influenced by R&B; acts, the album also drew comparisons from critics to alternative rock, electronica and post-punk sounds. The melancholic songs on xx feature minimalist arrangements and are built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employed reverb in her lead guitar parts. Most of the songs are sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss and desire. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom named it one of the year's best records. It sold steadily over its first few years of release, becoming a sleeper hit in the United Kingdom and the United States. Although major media outlets had largely ignored the band at first, and none of its singles became hits, xx benefited commercially from the licensing of its songs to television programs and the band's Mercury Prize win for the album in 2010. When Qureshi was dismissed from the group shortly after the album's release, the xx continued to play as a trio on a protracted concert tour that helped increase their fanbase, reputation in the press and confidence as performers. The record proved highly influential in subsequent years, as its distinctive stylistic elements were incorporated by many indie bands and top-selling pop acts. In 2013, xx was ranked number 237 on NME magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.  Background  Elliott School in London, where the xx studied and formed While students at South London's Elliott School in 2005, childhood friends Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim formed the xx with Jamie Smith and Baria Qureshi. Croft and Sim played guitar and bass, respectively, and dueted as the band's vocalists, while Smith programmed electronic beats for their songs and Qureshi doubled as a keyboardist and additional guitarist. During late nights, Croft and Sim either shared lyrics with each other through instant messaging or rehearsed quietly with Smith and Qureshi in their bedrooms so they would not disturb the rest of the household.; . The xx were greatly influenced by American R&B; producers such as The Neptunes and Timbaland, whose minimalist productions incorporated vocal harmonies, clapping percussion, unconventional samples and pronounced beats. The band covered Aaliyah's \\"Hot Like Fire\\" (1997), Womack & Womack's \\"Teardrops\\" (1988) and other past R&B; hits when they performed live and recorded their demos.; . After posting the demos on their Myspace page, the xx drew the interest of Young Turks, an imprint label of XL Recordings. They submitted the demos to XL's head office at Ladbroke Grove and were subsequently signed to a recording contract. The group worked with producers such as Diplo and Kwes, to no success before they were introduced to the audio engineer Rodaidh McDonald by the xx's manager Caius Pawson, who gave him three CDs of demos titled \\"Early Demos\\", \\"Recorded in Rehearsal Space\\" and \\"What Producers Did Wrong\\".; . McDonald was impressed by the intimate quality and use of silence on the demos, which both he and the band felt may have challenged other producers who wanted to incorporate their individual tastes: \\"They'd worked with about four other producers before then that had ‚Äì and no discredit to them ‚Äì I guess they'd seen a lot of space to add a kind of stamp on. There was a lot of empty space in the xx's music, even then, in the 'Early Demos'. But we just found that the best stuff was the most sparse.\\"; .  Recording and production  The headquarters of XL Recordings in Ladbroke Grove, London At the behest of XL's owner Richard Russell, the xx recorded their debut album at the label's small, in-house recording studio ‚Äì XL Studio ‚Äì making them the first act to record there. It was once the head office building's rear garage before Russell transformed it at the beginning of 2008 into a makeshift writing, rehearsal and demo space for XL's artists. McDonald was assigned in September to manage and properly equip the room, which he liked because it was soundproof and \\"isolated from the rest of the office, so it wasn't like you were working in the record company's presence.\\" Croft, on the other hand, called it a \\"pretty confined space\\" the size of a bathroom. Over the next few months, McDonald and Pawson prepared a budget for the label to fund the studio's preliminary setup, which would have recording equipment specifically suited for the xx, including a modestly sized soundboard ideal for recording a small group. The xx started to record the album in December 2008 with McDonald, who engineered the sessions. They would usually record at night after XL's staff had left, which Croft said made it feel \\"isolated and quite creepy\\". To reproduce the sound he had heard on the band's demos, McDonald had them write down their instruments' settings and test different areas of the studio to determine where he should record each member. Sim, who played a Precision Bass manufactured in the 1970s, was often recorded in the hallway outside the studio with a Fender Bassman, one of several amplifiers McDonald experimented with for xx. Some of Qureshi and Croft's guitars were also done in the hallway. Qureshi played a Gibson SG with a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe or Blues Deluxe amplifier, while Croft played an Epiphone Les Paul on most of the album and a Gibson ES-335 on a few songs. For her lead guitar parts, Croft used a delay pedal and a Roland Micro Cube amplifier with a reverb setting, which McDonald felt would best replicate her \\"icy\\", echo- filled sound on the demos. Romy Madley Croft in 2012 with an Epiphone Les Paul, her guitar for xx After all the instrumental elements had been tracked, Croft and Sim recorded their vocals together, rarely singing backup to one another on any of the songs. McDonald believed it was important for the singers to be \\"in sync\\" and share the same mental state or mood when performing full takes of songs, some of which he said benefited from when they were both \\"quite tired and emotional\\". He had Croft and Sim sing into Neumann microphones on most of the songs in order to make their vocals sound as \\"intimate\\" and conversational as possible. The microphones were among the more expensive items he borrowed for the studio's preliminary setup so XL would not be overwhelmed with a costly budget. Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx had been encouraged to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen by the rest of the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units.; . He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.; . The album was mixed and produced by Jamie Smith (2010). Most of xx was recorded from late December 2008 to late January 2009 before McDonald and Smith began an exhaustive mixing process, which lasted two weeks. For each song, they mixed one or two tracks of each instrument and used Waves Audio components to equalise the recordings. Having enjoyed how the demos captured unintended background noises such as street sounds, McDonald deliberately left certain sounds that would have otherwise been unwanted in the final mix. \\"I wanted it to sound like people in a room, rather than this polished kind of perfect crystalline thing\\", he explained. \\"It was all the small details that we really liked.\\" In February 2009, the group wrote and recorded \\"Fantasy\\", \\"Shelter\\" and \\"Infinity\\" before finishing xx, possibly by month's end according to McDonald; the album's liner notes credited the final date of recording as April.; . Sim sang his vocals for \\"Infinity\\" on the side of the studio opposite from Croft after his microphone had been unintentionally moved there, which resulted in a distant-sounding vocal exchange on the song. While recording \\"Shelter\\", a mechanical part from the guitar amplifier loosened and caused it to make a clattering sound, which McDonald and the xx chose to retain. \\"It was just like this missing piece of percussion that the track needed!\\", McDonald recalled.  Music and lyrics  The songs on xx are composed around a framework of basslines and beats, while incorporating simple guitar riffs for melody, rhythm and texture; their melodic notes are separated by rests. Croft said the band's style of instrumentation became defined by the limited equipment they originally used: \\"My guitar sound pretty much came from discovering there was reverb on my little practice amp and really loving the mood it created.\\" The loudest song, \\"Intro\\", is a largely instrumental recording with double-tracked beats, distorted keyboard, non-lexical vocables and a guitar riff. Songs such as \\"Crystalised\\" and \\"VCR\\" begin with a melodic ostinato and some understated sounds, including a xylophone on the latter, before leading to quietly sung verses.; . Croft and Sim exchange verses on \\"Crystalised\\" while backed by the sound of drum stick clicks and basslines before the beat is heard. On the austerely arranged \\"Night Time\\", Croft sings its first two minutes over only guitar and bass before its beat develops. \\"Fantasy\\" is highlighted by a shoegazing guitar sound. While McDonald observes a predominant R&B; element, Russell feels the xx's music evokes the early hip hop records he listened to when he was young, as they are often limited to vocals, samples and beats. Music journalists, however, infer from xx that their influences are alternative rock acts such as Portishead, Young Marble Giants and Cocteau Twins, the last of which Croft said she had never heard before the album was released. The Scotsman describes xx as a minimalist, melancholic indie pop record that draws on elements from electronica and R&B;, as well as The Cure and other alternative groups. According to Sarah Boden of The Observer, the album's unadorned, dream pop love songs are reminiscent of Cocteau Twins and Mazzy Star, because they feature low tempos, moody melodies and rhythms influenced by R&B; and dubstep. Their arrangements have what Neil McCormick calls \\"a very British, industrial aspect\\", somewhat similar to the dub- inflected post-punk sound of the English producer Martin Hannett and his work with the band Joy Division. Both Croft and Sim said their combination of seemingly disparate influences could be attributed to the variety in each band member's music collection.; . Oliver Sim (left) and Croft (right), the band's lyricists, in 2008 On xx, Croft and Sim touch on themes of love, desire and loss in their songwriting, which Croft said has \\"always been based around emotions, right from the start. My favourite songs are usually quite sad and I think heartbreak is something that so many people can connect with.\\" Like Croft, Sim said he wrote much of his lyrics at night when his emotions ran \\"a bit higher\\". Because of their reserved personalities, Robert Christgau believes they rely on a low-key, vulnerable style and exchange \\"ideas about intimacy as contemporaries, comrades, prospects, lovers, ex-lovers and friends\\".; . According to NME magazine's Emily Mackay, all of the songs deal with the consuming emotions associated with first love, including the tacit intimacy on \\"VCR\\", the yearning expressed on \\"Heart Skipped a Beat\\" and the premature affection warned of on \\"Crystalised\\". Petra Davis from The Quietus argues that the thematic crux of xx is in the succession of songs from \\"Islands\\" to \\"Shelter\\", each of which sees \\"a radical shift in perspective on a similar ‚Äì perhaps a single ‚Äì love story.\\" The album's Roman numeral title refers to each of the band members having turned 20 years old by the time xx was released. Because of their age, many critics interpret the songs as nocturnal depictions of adolescent lust. Philip Sherburne writes in Spin that xx brims with a \\"young lust\\" often found in rock music, and recordings such as \\"Fantasy\\" and \\"Shelter\\" express a jaded yearning, particularly in a lyric from the latter song: \\"Can I make it better with the lights turned on\\". Croft vehemently denied this: \\"We were writing these songs when we were 17. I can honestly say I've never thought this is about my sex life.\\" Croft and Sim, who were both gay, did not intend for the songs to be heard as romantic duets; she said they are singing \\"past each other\\" rather than to each other. Having combined their individually written lyrics, they could not definitely explain what their songs were about, although Croft said Sim's lyrics resonated with her nonetheless and enjoyed the personal interpretation it offered. \\"You can put them into your own life\\", she explained, \\"like, 'Oh, this is my song. The romantic situations Sim wrote of had been inspired by other people. \\"I hadn't really had any relationships to be working off, but I had a huge interest in life, and looking at other people's relationships around me\\", he said.; .  Marketing  Major UK media outlets largely ignored the xx at first, including BBC Radio 1 (logo pictured). \\"Crystalised\\" was released as the xx's debut single on 27 April 2009 and helped build interest in the band among listeners and journalists.; . It was part of a series of singles from xx, which included \\"Basic Space\\" on 3 August, \\"Islands\\" on 26 October and \\"VCR\\" on 25 January 2010.; ; ; . The band's music was largely ignored by BBC Radio 1 in the United Kingdom, and other major media outlets also believed they did not warrant strong attention; one editor from NME said at the time that the band was not ideal for their magazine's front cover. In the United States, the group benefited from the word-of-mouth marketing of blogs, beginning when they performed six consecutive sold-out shows at New York City clubs such as Pianos and the Mercury Lounge months prior to the album's release. Several of the songs from xx were licensed by XL to television programs in the UK and North America. \\"Intro\\" became widely used as theme music in television, including sports highlights, episodes of series such as Law & Order and Cold Case, an advertisement for AT&T; and BBC's coverage of the 2010 British general election.; . Along with their placement in television, songs from the record were used by North American chain stores such as Starbucks and Urban Outfitters as background music at their locations. According to McCormick in 2010, these marketing strategies helped the xx develop enough media presence to garner \\"over half a million sales around the world without ever having anything as vulgar as a hit\\". Kris Chen, XL's A&R; senior vice president, believed the exposure was desired and necessary for promoting an album that was not \\"driven by pop radio\\". Although the band realised their music had to be marketed somehow, Croft expressed reservations about \\"putting our music on everything, just to put it to anything just for the sake of money\\".  Critical reception  xx was released by Young Turks in August 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 25 reviews. According to Alexis Petridis, it was the most acclaimed album of the year. Critics particularly praised the xx's sound on the album; Simon Price wrote in The Independent that they were being universally lauded for their \\"atmospheric indie rock, and rightly so\\".; . The Daily Telegraphs Jack Arnhold regarded xx as \\"one of this year's most beautiful and original debut albums\\". Reviewing for The New Yorker, Sasha Frere-Jones remarked that the album rewards repeated listens because of the band's disciplined playing, while Mark Edwards of The Sunday Times said it succeeds with simple but \\"very near perfect\\" pop songs.; . AllMusic's Heather Phares called the instrumentation impeccable and was impressed by how poised and refined such a young group sounds. In The Irish Times, Jim Carroll said the exceptional chemistry of Croft and Sim's melancholic duets is the highlight of \\"this drop-dead gorgeous dream-pop symphony\\". Matthew Cole from Slant Magazine believed their rapport gives an emotional weight to the music, which he said sounds timeless and capable of appealing to both indie and popular tastes. Christgau, writing in MSN Music, was somewhat more impressed by the music than by the lyrics, although he said the underlying force behind the singers' charmingly minimalist songs is a \\"spiritual dimension\\" offered by their ability to \\"shift roles without ever seeming hostile, cold or even unsupportive\\".; . Some reviewers had reservations. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times felt the singers are too disengaged and reticent to reveal any genuine emotion. \\"Though they're singing to each other, it rarely feels intimate\\", he wrote, \\"more like two shy teenagers, eyes cast downward, awkwardly talking to the ground\\". In the opinion of PopMatters critic Ben Schumer, the consistent structures and tempos of the songs makes them sound somewhat monotonous on what is an otherwise affecting nocturnal mood piece. Conversely, Joshua Errett from Now found the music and singing mesmerizing but lamented the lyrics, which he deemed emotionally immature and \\"overwrought\\". At the end of 2009, xx appeared on several critics' lists of the year's best albums, including rankings of ninth by Rolling Stone, sixth by Uncut, third by Pitchfork, second by NME and fourth by the Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot. The Guardian named it the year's best record in their annual critics poll and Tim Jonze, the newspaper's editor, hailed it as not only \\"the sound of 2009, [but also] a distinctive musical statement of the like we may never get to hear again\\". It also finished seventh in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop poll of American critics and third in HMV's Poll of Polls, an annual list compiled by the British music retailer HMV and collated from best-album nominations made by journalists in the English and Irish music press.; . In decade-end lists of the greatest records from the 2000s, The Sunday Times and its sister paper, The Times, ranked xx seventy-seventh and thirtieth, respectively.; . The record was also included in the 2010 edition of Robert Dimery's music reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.  Sales and legacy  xx was not an immediate chart success, but eventually became a sleeper hit.; . It debuted at number 36 on the UK's Official Albums Chart and sold 4,180 copies in the first week after it was released, while in the United States it did not chart higher than number 92 on the Billboard 200.; . The album sold steadily for the next 44 weeks until July 2010, when it experienced a sharp increase in sales and a jump from number 44 to 16 on the British chart following its announcement as a nominee for the Mercury Prize, an annual award given to the best album from the UK and Ireland.; ; . By then, it had sold more than 150,000 copies in the UK and 179,000 copies in the US. Before the nominations shortlist had been announced, bookmakers and critics considered the xx as favorites to win the award over the more high-profile artists Corinne Bailey Rae, Paul Weller and Dizzee Rascal. The album remained in the top 20 of the UK chart in the weeks leading up to the Mercury Prize ceremony in September. Immediately after its win that week, it climbed from number 16 to 3 on its highest weekly sales ‚Äì 28,666 copies ‚Äì and reached a total of 212,835 copies sold.; . McCormick, one of the critics who predicted its victory, explained that it \\"seemed the record that most represented Britain\\" with its charmingly intimate style and unique take on modern pop tastes, while citing its win as \\"a rare example of the Mercury Prize doing music lovers a service\\". By December 2010, xx had sold 325,000 copies in the UK and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. In the US, the album reached 350,000 copies sold by June 2012 with consistent weekly sales during its first two years of release, which Time magazine's Melissa Locker said was \\"quite a feat\\" in an era of music piracy, media streaming and YouTube.; . Adding to its commercial success, songs from the album were covered by a variety of major recording artists, including Shakira, Gorillaz and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. Although xx had been highly anticipated by XL, the album's success exceeded expectations in the press. McDonald said their direction and sound would have been entirely different had expectations been higher, while Croft was \\"baffled\\" by the acclaim given to what she viewed as an album they had made \\"for themselves\\".; . Sim had mixed feelings about its success, believing it could affect his songwriting in the future: \\"This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were. When I was writing the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so many people will. I might feel I have to be a bit more private.\\" At the Mercury Prize ceremony, Sim said the time since the album's release had \\"felt like a haze\\", but that the event served as \\"a moment of clarity\\". In their acceptance speech, the xx announced they would use the ¬£20,000 prize money to build their own studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album Coexist. When Coexist debuted in September 2012, xx was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on NMEs list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by Rolling Stone, who found its music radical as \\"an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence\\" during popular music's period of maximalism.; . In subsequent years, xx proved highly influential as many indie bands and mainstream pop acts incorporated the record's distinctive musical characteristics into their own songs. Petridis later wrote that to his surprise much of 2016's best-selling singles \\"sounded oddly but irrefutably\\" like the album: \\"You can hear its muted, echoing guitars on everything from the Chainsmokers' 'Don't Let Me Down' to Shawn Mendes' 'Stitches' to Zara Larsson's 'Lush Life'.\\" Ryan Tedder, who wrote hit songs for such top-selling singers as Beyonc√©, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande, said the xx's \\"hauntingness\\" on the record \\"gets referenced in at least every other [writing] session\\". By January 2017, xx had reached 562,400 copies sold in the UK, and in September 2019, its sales there were reported at 612,000.; . That same month, it placed 26th on The Guardians poll of 45 music writers ranking the 100 best albums from the 21st century. In an essay accompanying the list, the newspaper's music editor Ben Beaumont-Thomas said the album features \\"the most compelling duets of the period: rather than singing to each other, it was as if two people were going through the same thing without the other knowing it ‚Äì the perfect mood music for the disconnected interconnection of dating apps and social media.\\" Based on such listings, the aggregate website Acclaimed Music ranks xx as the 19th most acclaimed album of the 2000s decade and the 226th most acclaimed album in history.  Touring  Reading Festival in August 2009 After xx was released, the xx toured Europe and North America through the end of 2009. Their first show in August was at Hoxton Hall in London, which Sim recalled was attended by only 112 people. When Pitchforks positive review of the album elicited greater interest among American listeners, the xx were booked as the supporting act for the Friendly Fires's tour of larger club venues in the US. The difficulties of touring early on exacerbated the growing tensions between Qureshi and the rest of the group, which culminated in her dismissal after a difficult stay at an October music festival in New York.; . It was reported that she had become fatigued and left the group after they cancelled several concerts. Sim disputed those reports and said her departure had been the band's decision: \\"We've grown up to be very different people. It wasn't working any more musically or as a friendship.\\"; . Croft told NME in November, \\"I guess 'personal differences' would be the standard way to say it. I guess it's just the intensity of being on tour, things are so much heightened.\\" Rather than find a replacement for Qureshi, the xx continued to tour as a smaller line-up of guitar, bass and percussion. They also reduced their already minimalist arrangements for songs in concert, although Sim jokingly said Smith \\"needs another few arms so he can work everything\\" after Qureshi's departure.; . In their shows, Croft abandoned playing solos and chords in favor of less defined figures and motifs, while Smith performed beats and ambient sounds from his synth pad as an accompaniment to Croft and Sim's playing. Because their style had been suited to the small venues they first played, the xx focused more on the production value of their concerts and performing for larger audiences while on tour. They dressed in dark clothing and illuminated the stage with light boxes displaying their x-shaped, white-on-black logo.; . After Baria Qureshi's departure, the xx toured as a trio (at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in December 2009). With a growing fanbase, the xx made commitments to more concerts and extended their tour for the album. They toured intermittently for 18 months, including most of 2010. That year, they embarked on their first US tour and played high-profile festivals such as South by Southwest, Coachella and Bonnaroo.; ; ; . They were also a supporting act for fellow English group Florence and the Machine. Recalling the xx's show at Coachella, where they performed for 30,000 people, Croft said: \\"That was the moment when I was, like, Oh, my God, I think people might be into this.\\" By touring frequently, the xx broadened their reputation among listeners and the press. In March 2010, they played two consecutive nights at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London to capacity crowds and appeared on the cover of NME, who proclaimed them \\"the most underrated band in Britain\\". In April and May, they toured the southern US and Japan, which Croft said was most demanding part of the tour because \\"none of us had been away from home continuously for so long.\\" They were accompanied during this six-week period by the photographer Jamie-James Medina, who later published his photos of the group in his book The Tourist (2010). While on tour, the xx acclimated themselves to the increased attention and became considerably more sociable and confident. As Sim recounted, \\"If you'd have put me onstage at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire a few years ago, I'd have run away. I couldn't have done it. We used to be terrified.\\" In June 2010, the band played the Glastonbury Festival in Somerset and, according to the journalist Jude Rogers, displayed a newfound confidence through the rest of their summer and \\"post-Mercury [Prize] autumn\\" concerts: \\"Croft would sing more boldly, Sim developed an onstage swagger and Smith began experimenting with different rhythms and textures.\\"  Track listing   Personnel  Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes.

Unlike most other EF-mount lenses, it does not provide autofocus. Overview The TS-E 17 mm 4L provides four degrees of freedom, allowing ¬±6.5¬∞ tilt with respect to the film or sensor plane and ¬±12 mm shift with respect to the center of the image area; each movement can be rotated ¬±90¬∞ about the lens axis. Shifting allows adjusting the position of the subject in the image area without moving the camera back; it is often used to avoid convergence of parallel lines, such as when photographing a tall building. Tilting the lens relies on the Scheimpflug principle to rotate the plane of focus away from parallel to the image plane; this can be used either to have all parts of an inclined subject sharply rendered, or to restrict sharpness to a small part of a scene. Tilting the lens results in a wedge- shaped depth of field that may be a better fit to some scenes than the depth of field between two parallel planes that results without tilt. Unlike most view cameras, the shift mechanism allows shifts along only one axis, and the tilt mechanism allows tilts about only one axis; however, the rotation of the mechanisms allows the orientations of the axes to be changed, providing, in effect, combined tilt and swing, and combined rise/fall and lateral shift. The TS-E 17 mm 4L uses the same barrel design as the TS-E 24 mm f/3.5L II, which allows the tilt and the shift mechanisms to be rotated independently of each other.

It flowers from late April to mid-June and in cultivation even earlier, e.g., March in Istanbul. The peak flowering period is mid-May and in earlier years it was sold in some quantity by street florists in Ankara. It is mainly bee-, bug- and beetle-pollinated. Ants play an important role in seed dispersal and the fully ripe fat achenes are a delight for pigeons which settle down to feed in large flocks. The species is of taxonomic interest as it has some rather unusual and unique features not existing in any other Centaurea. For example, the marginal florets are funnel- shaped with crenate margins. The anther-tube is provided with glands at the tips of the appendages. Boissier (1875) established it as belonging to the genus Melanoloma Cass., proposing the combination Melanoloma tchihatchewi (Fischer & C.A. Meyer) Boiss. However, the type species of Melanoloma is Centaurea pullata which has no affinities at all with C. tchihatcheffii. The species was placed in Centaurea sect. Cyanus (Mill.) W.D.J. Koch by Wagenitz (1975) and currently in Cyanus Mill. (Cyanus tchihatcheffii (Fischer & C. A. Meyer) Wagenitz & Greuter. Three annual members of this section with which C. tchihatcheffii has a superficial resemblance are Centaurea cyanus L., the nomenclatural type, with the chromosome number of 2n = 24 (x = 12), Centaurea cyanoides Wahlenb. with 2n = 18 (x = 9) and Centaurea depressa M. Bieb. with 2n=16 (x=8), (Wagenitz and Hellwig 1996). However, C. tchihatcheffii has 2n=20, with x=10 (G√∂m√ºrgen and Adig√ºzel 2001), the same number as occurring in the derived species of the perennial section C. sect. Protocyanus (Dobrocz.) Czerep. Centaurea tchihatcheffii Fischer & C.A. Meyer was first described in Ann. Sci. Nat. s√©r. 4, 1: 31 (1854). Tchihatcheff‚Äôs original material from his travels to Asia Minor was deposited with the Soci√©t√© botanique de France which collections were later included in Paris (P). As the novelties from Asia Minor were described by Fischer & C.A. Meyer it would seem more likely that the specimens on which the descriptions were based were those duplicates sent to LE (thus potential holotypes) and not those remaining at P (part of the original set). Thus the holotype of Michauxia tchihatchewii Fischer & C.A. Meyer is stated as deposited in LE, and the late Jaakko Jalas (Helsinki) typified Thymus fallax with the specimen deposited at LE (holo. LE, fragm. W) and Thymus pectinatus collected by Tchihatcheff from the same locality as the Michauxia, as holo.? LE; iso. W. However, only the fragments at W, not at LE, have been seen by Jalas.

It was created in 2002 by George W. Bush.  History  August 16, 1940 marked the first official Army parachute jump, validating the innovative concept of inserting United States ground combat forces behind a battle line by parachute. On August 14, 2002 President George W. Bush issued the following proclamation: > The history of airborne forces began after World War I, when Brigadier > General William Mitchell first conceived the idea of parachuting troops into > combat. Eventually, under the leadership of Major William Lee at Fort > Benning, Georgia, members of the Parachute Test Platoon pioneered methods of > combat jumping in 1940. In November 1942, members of the 2nd Battalion, > 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, conducted America's first combat jump, > leaping from a C-47 aircraft behind enemy lines in North Africa. This > strategy revolutionized combat and established airborne forces as a key > component of our military. > During World War II, airborne tactics were critical to the success of > important missions, including the D-Day invasion at Normandy, the Battle of > the Bulge, the invasion of Southern France, and many others. In Korea and > Vietnam, airborne soldiers played a critical combat role, as well as in > later conflicts and peacekeeping operations, including Panama, Grenada, > Desert Storm, Haiti, Somalia, and the Balkans. Most recently, airborne > forces were vital to liberating the people of Afghanistan from the > repressive and violent Taliban regime; and these soldiers continue to serve > proudly around the world in the global coalition against terrorism. > The elite airborne ranks include prestigious groups such as the 173rd > Airborne Brigade Combat Team, \\"Sky Soldiers,\\" 82nd Airborne Division, \\"All > American,\\" and the \\"Screaming Eagles\\" of the 101st Airborne Division (Air > Assault). Airborne forces have also been represented in the former 11th, > 13th, and 17th Airborne Divisions and numerous other Airborne, glider and > air assault units and regiments. Paratroopers in the Army's XVIII Airborne > Corps, the 75th Infantry (Ranger) Regiment and other Special Forces units > conduct swift and effective operations in defense of peace and freedom. > Airborne combat continues to be driven by the bravery and daring spirit of > sky soldiers. Often called into action with little notice, these forces have > earned an enduring reputation for dedication, excellence, and honor. As we > face the challenges of a new era, I encourage all people to recognize the > contributions of these courageous soldiers to our Nation and the world. > Now, therefore, I, George W.

As we commemorate the first official Army parachute jump on > August 16, 1940, I encourage all Americans to join me in honoring the > thousands of soldiers, past and present, who have served in an airborne > capacity. I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate > programs, ceremonies, and activities. > In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of > August, in the year of our Lord two thousand two, and of the Independence of > the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-seventh. > George W.

Established and offering its first miniatures in 2005, the company is owned by Nathan Caroland and Eric Johns.Georgia Secretary of State Corporations Division, entered 13.2.2013. The first years the company focused on casting miniatures for the wargaming and miniature painting market. According to Eric Johns, it started with Nathan putting together a few fun minis after having gotten friendly with a sculptor. It was only in 2007 he and Nathan decided to push forward as a real company and started developing their own game rules to go with their miniatures line.Interview on Livingdice June 6, 2009, retrieved February 13, 2013. After the release of Malifaux in 2009, which incorporated most of the miniature range, came a time of rapid expansion, and in March 2011 the company moved for the second time in 16 months allegedly to accommodate its growth, settling into a larger office and warehouse facility.Press release on Tabletop Gaming News March 21, 2011. In 2012 the partnership with Ghost Studio led to Wyrd introducing a new line of plastic miniatures for Malifaux using an all-digital manufacturing workflow, the so-called Freeform 3D solution from Geomagic. According to Geomagic, their platform for designing organic shaped products can sculpt, texture or emboss products with detail and articulation that traditional geometric CAD solutions simply cannot handle.Press release from Geomagic August 15, 2012.Article on Platicstoday August 22, 2012  Games   Malifaux  In 2009, Wyrd published its first game, Malifaux, set in a dystopian city in a parallel world. Currently utilizing the Third Edition of its rule-set, this skirmish miniatures game sees two players fighting over control of the mysterious Malifaux City and its surrounding areas. With its introduction, Malifaux introduced the primarily conflict system used in many of Wyrd's products‚ÄîThe Fate Deck. Fate Decks are standard Poker Decks (54 cards, 13 cards of four suits, with two Jokers) that are used to determine the outcome of any conflicts within a game of Malifaux.  Through the Breach  Following a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013, the tabletop role-playing game Through the Breach puts players into the world of Malifaux, the setting established by Wyrd's miniature games. Players, referred to as Fated, are guided through this world by a Fatemaster, fighting against the inhabitants of Malifaux in order to pursue their character's destiny. A second edition of the Core Rules for Through the Breach was published in 2017.  The Other Side  In 2017, once again using Kickstarter, Wyrd published its second miniatures game, The Other Side. Acting as a counterpart to Malifaux, The Other Side is a company-scale wargame, often pitting miniature armies of 40‚Äì50 combatants against each other in a fast-paced wargame. The game takes place within the same history as Malifaux, focusing on the conflicts of Earth and an alternate history 1908 where the world is tearing itself apart in war, fighting against amphibious hordes of monsters from the depths of an alien ocean and cultists worshiping a being of chaos floating through the skies of earth.

Life  Goeckingk was born in Gr√∂ningen (Landkreis B√∂rde) and went to school in Halberstadt, where he became friends with Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim. He continued his schooling at Halle, where he was a fellow pupil of another noted poet, Gottfried August B√ºrger. He went to the university of that city and studied book-keeping and jurisprudence. After finishing his studies in 1768 he became Referendar in the War and Territorial Chamber in Halberstadt. From 1770 he was chancellery director in the Prussian settlement of Ellrich, found the time to begin a career as a writer with Lieder zweier Liebenden (\\"Songs of Two Lovers\\"), and met his future wife Ferdinande Vogel (d. 1781). Between 1776 and 1779 he helped edit the G√∂ttinger Musenalmanach, and in 1783 he founded the Journals von und f√ºr Deutschland. In 1786 he became a councillor in the War and Territorial Chamber in Magdeburg, in 1788 an agricultural tax commissioner in Wernigerode and Prussian commissar, and in 1793 upper privy councillor of finance in Berlin. Goeckingk was ennobled in 1789 as a reward for successfully putting the affairs of the Royal Abbey of Quedlinburg in order. From this point on he styled himself Goeckingk auf Daldorf und G√ºnthersdorf. After the General Directory in Berlin was dissolved following the Treaty of Tilsit (1807), he made his resignation in 1808 and turned back to poetry. He lived for several years in Wernigerode. In 1814 he withdrew from his remaining official responsibilities and went into retirement. He lived at first in Berlin, then moved in with his daughter at Gro√ü Wartenberg, now Syc√≥w, where he died on 18 February 1828. Goeckingk belonged to the Halberst√§dter Dichterkreis (\\"Halberstadt Poets' Circle\\") and was one of its most outstanding representatives. He was also a member of the Berliner Mittwochsgesellschaft (\\"Berlin Wednesdays Society\\"), and the Illuminati in G√∂ttingen.

It was the first Fender amplifier to incorporate on-board reverb which became a standard feature on many high-end Fender tube amps during the 1960s and 1970s.  Brownface, brown Tolex-the 1963 Vibroverb  The original (6G16 circuit) Vibroverb was introduced in February 1963. The speaker lineup and the output transformer were based on the Fender Super amp of the time and the circuit based on the Fender Vibrolux of the time, with no presence control and only one 12AX7 tube for the tremolo effect. It sported typical \\"brownface\\" cosmetics, with brown \\"Tolex\\" covering (introduced by Fender in 1959), and wheat-colored speaker cloth. The 40-watt amplifier boasted two channels (NORMAL and BRIGHT). Both channels had VOLUME, TREBLE and BASS controls; the single-control REVERB affected only the BRIGHT channel. The tremolo effect (labeled VIBRATO by Fender, see \\"VIBRATO or TREMOLO?\\" section of the article vibrato unit) had two controls, SPEED and also INTENSITY, which affected the bias of the output tubes and therefore both channels. To make room for the reverb circuitry (not found on the Super amp) the company used the direct- coupled oscillator vibrato circuitry found on Fender's previous generation tweed amplifiers (which used two tubes fewer than the Super's brownface vibrato circuit). The TREBLE control was the same as found in many Fender amplifiers of the time (i.e., Pro Amp -6G5A-, the Super -6G4A-, the Showman -6G14-, the Vibrolux -6G11-). It was fitted with a \\"tapped\\" treble circuit, meaning that the treble control is \\"flat\\" at setting \\"5\\"; cutting or boosting the treble was possible by turning the knob down (below \\"5\\") or up (above \\"5\\"), respectively. It had two ten-inch speakers manufactured by the Oxford Speaker Company. This incarnation of the Vibroverb was made for only a few months, and it is thought that fewer than 600 of these units were made. Tube complement: Power:............6L6GC (Two) Wattage?

Several models were introduced or greatly modified from their previous incarnation. The Super had two additional ten-inch speakers and a reverb circuit added; it became the much-sought-after blackface Super Reverb. The Twin was given two twelve-inch speakers and reverb; it became the legendary blackface Twin Reverb. The Vibroverb, likewise, was given the new blackface cosmetics and somewhat different circuitry (AA763). Still rated at 40 watts, the new design possessed the new blackface \\"optical coupler\\" vibrato circuit (in place of the tweed-style vibrato found in its immediate predecessor), and a bright switch. Gone also were the two ten-inch Oxford speakers; in their place was a single fifteen-inch speaker. Jensen speakers were used, with JBL available as an extra cost option. Production on the blackface Vibroverb was discontinued in late 1964. Tube complement: Power:............6L6GC (Two) Wattage? Preamp:...........7025 (Two) Phase Inverter:...12AT7 Rectifier:........GZ34 Tremolo/Vibrato:..12AX7 Reverb Driver:....12AT7 Reverb Recovery:..12AX7  Historic Fame  Due to low production numbers and their use by Stevie Ray Vaughan, 1964 (blackface) Vibroverbs have become highly collectable. Vaughan acquired two 1964 blackface Vibroverbs in the late 1970s or early 1980s at two different times and locations, thought to have sequential serial numbers, but were sequential production numbers (#5 and #6). The Vibroverbs used by Vaughan were also modified by Cesar Diaz in a number of ways (see \\"'64 Vibroverb Custom\\" below).  '63 Re-issue Vibroverb (1990‚Äì1995)  As demand for vintage Fender tube amplifiers had increased, several re- issue models were introduced in 1990, beginning with the tweed '59 Bassman amplifier, the brownface '63 Reverb unit and the brownface '63 Vibroverb. Fender made great efforts to reproduce the tone and look of the original unit. A \\"direct-coupled\\" oscillator circuit was used for generating the vibrato (albeit with different components). The noticeably \\"warmer\\" reverb sound of a vintage brownface Vibroverb (due to the original reverb send and recovery circuit unique to the Vibroverb) was also present. The cosmetics incorporated the brown \\"Tolex\\" and wheat-colored \\"Ecru\\" grill cloth used in 1963, as well as the \\"flat\\" Fender logo plate found only on the brownface amps. Although cosmetically and‚Äîmore importantly‚Äîtonally accurate, there were several notable differences to be found (solid-state rectifier, printed circuit boards, ¬º\\" reverb/vibrato footswitch jack, 3-prong power cord). Fender used the original templates, molds and blueprints from the Oxford company archives to manufacture Oxford-style loudspeakers. The Fender '63 Reissue Vibroverb listed for $900 (US) when it was released in 1990. Notable users of the '63 Re-issue Vibroverb include Richard Thompson, Jeff Buckley, and the Screamin' Armadillos frontman Matt Abney.

The amp debuted in early 2003. Several modifications were made. A toggle switch mounted on the back of the amplifier chassis allows switching between tube (the original) and solid-state rectification; in the latter mode, output is boosted to 50 watts.

Family  Leonid Punin was born Ataman Pumin in 1892, to military doctor Nikolay Michajlovitch Punin and an unnamed actress. His elder brother, Nikolay Punin, became a famous Soviet art critic who later died in a concentration camp as a result of his opposition to Stalin's regime. Alexander Punin, Leonid's second eldest brother, fought in the First World War and later became a biologist. His younger brother Lev Punin also went into the military. Zinaida, the only sister, married Jusef Bulack-Balakhowitch and moved to Poland where she died in 1983.  Military career, 1914‚Äì1915  Ataman Punin graduated from Pavlovskoje's Voennoe Uchilische (a military school) then joined the 8th Finnish shooters regiment, with whom he fought German and Austrian troops in the first half of 1915. Punin then was made the head of rager's squad of that regiment. For his courage, this officer was awarded with St. George's cross (4th class), St. Vladimir's cross (4th class with swords and bow), and many other military orders.  Ataman Punin's squad  In September 1915 Punin (then commanding officer) started a project for a partisan squad. That project received support from members of the Russian Royal Family and by November 1915 he had begun to put together the squad. By November 26 the completed squad consisted of 10 officers and more than 300 soldiers. Among them there were 37 Latvians (from the 2nd Latvian shooters battalion), and about 50 people who knew Polish and German. The squad became a school for the future White Generals. Among the officers of Punin's squad were Baron Ungern-Shternberg (commander of the 3d squadron and in the Russian Civil War, the first White General), Stanislaw and Jusef Bulack-Balakhowitch (Polish Bu≈Çak-Ba≈Çachowicz who then fought for the independence of Belarus), Georghij Dombrovsky (Polish Jerzy DƒÖmbrowski, a famous partisan known as \\"Lupaschka\\"), Illarion Stavskij (commander of a battalion of the Talabaski regiment in the Civil War), and Nikolay Zujev –ó—É–µ–≤, –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–µ–≤–∏—á (called a \\"Russian James Bond,\\" a double agent who worked both for Stalin and the White Army). Punin's squad was the only partisan regiment on the Russian Northern Front. It fought against German troops near Riga (Kemeri), taking part in the battles of Mittaw (December 1916) and Riga (Summer 1917). The regiment worked so well that the Grand Dukes and commanders awarded its members with military orders and medals. He was shot and killed in a battle with German troops on September 1 of 1916 near Anticiems. He was buried in the town of Pavlovsk (near St. Petersburg, Russia). His brother Alexandre succeeded him as leader of the squad. In March 1917 the squad received a new official name: \\"Ataman Punin's Special Squad.\\" The squad remained active until disbanding in February 1918.  References  * Olga Khoroshilova.

A. P. De Zoysa was born in Randombe, Ambalangoda in the Southern province of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). His parents died in an epidemic when he was eleven, and thereafter he was brought up by his grandmother. He started his education in the nearby historic temple, the Maha Samudraramaya, and then attended the Wesleyan school in Randombe. He continued his secondary education at Mahinda College, Galle, where he came under the influence of its principal, the famous Theosophist and Pali scholar Frank Lee Woodward. Later he moved to Wesley College in Colombo. De Zoysa was not only a good student but also a keen cricketer, artist and actor. Then he taught for a few years at Ananda College, Colombo and at Royal College Colombo. In 1921 he went to England and continued his higher education. In London he supported himself by coaching overseas students, and his wide social circle included the artist William Roberts, who painted his portrait. After taking an external London degree, in 1927 he was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn, and in 1929 he obtained a PhD in anthropology at London University for a dissertation on 'Observances and Customs in Sinhalese Villages'. With his wife, n√©e Eleanor Hutton, whom he had met at the Buddhist mission in London and married in 1929, in 1934 de Zoysa returned to Sri Lanka, and began work as a lawyer. He was elected to represent Colombo South in 1936, and he continued to serve in the State Council (as an independent) until 1947. Causes which he supported included opposition to the death penalty, anti-dowry legislation, and improved state education. For many years he was also a municipal councillor in Colombo, taking up local issues and campaigning to improve the city's amenities. In 1939 de Zoysa bought a printing press, and began to produce a series of educational books in Sinhala; he also edited a weekly paper, the Dharmasamaya. But his greatest project, which took over twenty years, with help from Buddhist scholars, was to publish a translation of the whole Tripitaka canon of Buddhist scripture into simple Sinhala; this eventually ran to forty-eight volumes. A concise edition, in about ten volumes, was incomplete at his death. He also compiled and printed English‚ÄìSinhala and Sinhala-English dictionaries. He died, aged seventy-eight, on 26 May 1968. He and his wife had one child, the feminist scholar Kumari Jayawardena. In March 2009 Sri Lanka Post issued a postage stamp commemorating A. P. De Zoysa's life as a social reformer and as a Buddhist scholar. A biography by Kumari Jayawardena, A. P. de Zoysa: Comabative Social Democrat and Buddhist Reformer in 20th Century Sri Lanka (Sanjiva Books, Colombo, Sri Lanka), was published in 2012.

They either block the pores in the concrete to reduce absorption of water and salts or form an impermeable layer which prevents such materials from passing. Research from major concrete authorities, including American Concrete Institute, Portland Cement Association, and US National Ready Mix Concrete Association; confirm that most concrete damage is attributable to surface moisture intrusion. The most pervasive form of concrete damage is surface scaling from freeze/thaw. Other forms of damage include alkali-silica reaction (ASR), chemical intrusion, and corrosion of steel reinforcements.  Types  In past decades attempts to protect concrete have included sealers ranging from wax to linseed oil. Today, high quality concrete sealers can block up to 99% of surface moisture. There are two main sealer categories: topical sealers (coatings) and penetrating sealers (reactive). Topical Sealers: Topical Sealers can provide visual enhancement as well as topical protection from stains and chemicals. They require a dry, clean surface during application to gain adhesion. Topical sealers may alter the coefficient of friction which can make substrates slick when wet ‚Äì a condition that can be remedied by adding anti-skid materials. Life span is generally 1-5 years, although high-end epoxy/urethane systems can last significantly longer. Penetrating Sealers: Penetrating sealers can be applied to dry or damp surfaces and should be properly matched with substrate porosity in order to effectively penetrate the surface and react. The chemical reaction bonds active ingredients within the substrate blocking surface moisture. Penetrating sealers generally do not significantly modify substrate appearance or traction. Lifespan is generally 5 years or more.  Major concrete sealer chemistries commonly used in 2014  Acrylic Resins: Acrylic resins form a topical film membrane on the substrate surface. They are available in both water-based and solvent-based formulas, affordable, and generally simple to apply. They are well known to increase perceived visual enhancement (sometimes described as a ‚Äúwet look‚Äù) and can provide good UV protection for colored substrates. Despite being the softest and least lasting of the major sealer categories, price and convenience make acrylic resins a very popular choice for decorative concrete such as stamped concrete and exposed aggregate. Acrylic resins are also commonly used as curing agents for new concrete, and many comply with ASTM C309. Epoxy/Urethane Systems: Epoxy/urethane systems are also topical film membranes. They share many of the same characteristics as acrylics, but the performance levels and life span are superior and commensurately more costly with more complex installation requirements. Novolac epoxies are particularly noted for chemical resistance and acid resistance. High-end urethanes are known to be extremely abrasion resistant. Epoxy/urethane systems are frequently used in demanding applications such as factory floors, garage floors, and restaurants, and water-based versions are often used to seal concrete countertops. Epoxy/urethane systems are generally applied only to fully cured existing concrete, although certain epoxy products can comply with ASTM C309. Silane: Silane is the smallest molecular compound of commonly available penetrating sealers. Chemically, Silane forms a covalent bond within porous masonry that clots surface pores. Silane is known to be hydrophobic and oleophobic and will only wear away if the concrete surface itself wears away. Noted for very low viscosity, silane is frequently used for sealing dense concrete, such as parking decks, concrete facades, and dense brick. Silane is generally applied only to fully cured existing concrete. Silicates: Silicates are another small molecular compound ranging from premium lithium silicates to economical sodium silicates. Chemically, silicates form calcium-silicate hydrate crystals which can densify concrete surfaces and be burnished to develop a polished appearance. Silicates are known to be hydrophobic and oleophobic and will only wear away if the concrete surface itself wears away. Noted for crystallization, silicates are frequently used for polishing concrete floors popular in large format retail outlets. Silicates can be applied to new and existing concrete, although they do not comply with ASTM C309 as a curing agent. Siliconates: Siliconates are moderate-size molecular compound. Chemically, Siliconates form a repellent cross-linking membrane barrier within the surface of porous concrete and other masonry. Siliconates are known to be hydrophobic and oleophobic and will only wear away if the concrete surface itself wears away. Noted for extreme water repellence and stain repellence siliconates are frequently used for sealing exterior concrete such as roads and driveways, tilt-up walls, porous brick, and porous stone. Siliconates and organo-siliconates have also been shown to be affective as curing agents for new concrete and certain products can comply with ASTM C309. Siloxane: Siloxane is the largest molecular compound of commonly available penetrating sealers. Although not highly reactive, chemically siloxane forms a bond within porous masonry that clots surface pores. Siloxane is known to be hydrophobic. Noted for large molecular structure, siloxane is frequently used for sealing exterior concrete, porous concrete block and porous brick. Siloxane is generally applied only to fully cured existing concrete. In summary, all major concrete sealer chemistries can have valuable and practical applications. Topical sealers generally require higher application standards and maintenance, but the decorative appeal and potential stain and chemical resistance can make them a superior choice for many applications. Penetrating sealers should be matched with substrate porosity for long lasting low maintenance water repellence and freeze/thaw protection.

Life He was born at Burton-Overy, Leicestershire, about 1505, and educated at Balliol College, Oxford, migrating to Lincoln College. He graduated B.A. on 18 July 1530, M.A. on 14 January 1533, B.M. on 30 May 1537, B.D. on 2 May 1539, and D.D. in July 1540, being incorporated D.D. at Cambridge in 1554. On 16 July 1533 he was elected one of the officials of Oxford market, and in 1537 was proctor. On 8 January 1538 he was elected Rector of Lincoln College, and in 1540 was appointed Lady Margaret professor of divinity. On 15 September 1541 he was collated rector of St. Nicholas Olave, and on 19 May 1544 rector of St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate. On 17 October 1547 he was appointed archdeacon of Cornwall, and in the same year he became rector of Burton-Overy. Early in 1549 his Catholic views brought him into collision with the university visitors; he was ejected from his professorship, and on 11 September following Alexander Seymour was paid for arresting Weston in Leicestershire and conveying him to the Fleet prison. How long he remained in confinement is uncertain, but he retained all his offices except his professorship, and received further preferment on Queen Mary's accession. On 18 September 1553 he was installed dean of Westminster, and on 22 January 1554 was collated to the archdeaconry of Colchester; he also received the living of Cliff-at-Hoo, Kent, on 2 April 1554, resigning the rectorship of Lincoln in 1555. His services as a controversialist were in great demand. He acted as confessor to Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk and Sir Thomas Wyatt at their execution, was prolocutor of the convocation that met on 16 October 1553, and preached at St. Paul's Cross four days later, and before the queen on Ash Wednesday (7 February 1553-4) during Wyatt's rebellion. He examined Thomas Philpot, had disputations with Nicholas Ridley and John Bradford, and presided over Thomas Cranmer's trial in St. Mary's, Oxford, on the 14th, and over the disputation between Latimer and Richard Smith on 18 April 1554. In 1556, when it was decided to restore Westminster Abbey to its monastic character, Weston was induced to resign his deanery in favour of John de Feckenham, receiving instead the deanery of Windsor. In Aug. 1557 he was deprived by Cardinal Pole of his deanery and the archdeaconry of Colchester for gross immorality, but retained, through Edmund Bonner's complaisance, his parochial preferments; his moral delinquencies (he was caught committing adultery) are detailed by various Protestant writers of the time, and especially in \\"Michael Wood\\"'s preface to the 1553 edition of Stephen Gardiner's 'De Vera Obedientia'. He determined to appeal against Pole's decision to the Roman curia, but was arrested at Gravesend when setting out, and lodged in the Tower of London. He was released on plea of sickness on 3 December 1558, and died at the house of one Winter in Fleet Street on 8 December, being buried in the Savoy. By his will, dated 26 November 1558, he provided for masses for his soul at Balliol and Lincoln Colleges, at St. Mary's, Oxford, at Burton-Overy, and at Islip, of which he is said to have been rector. His Oratio coram Patribus et Clero habita 16 October 1553 was published in that year (London), and disputations are printed in John Foxe's Actes and Monuments. Edward Weston was his great-nephew.

The Noord starts at the city of Dordrecht where the Beneden Merwede river forks into the Oude Maas and the Noord. It joins the Lek at the city of Ridderkerk and Kinderdijk, and the combined stream is thereafter known as the Nieuwe Maas. The distance is about nine kilometres. The direction of its water flow depends on the tides. The Noord River separates IJsselmonde island from the Alblasserwaard mainland to the east. There are two connections between them: * Bridge over the Noord (motor vehicles, cyclists) * Noord Tunnel (motor vehicles) History During the early Middle Ages the river was considered to be the continuation of the Merwede river (itself a distributary branch of the Rhine) and was named accordingly. However, as a result of the St. Elizabeth's floods the Merwede found a new and shorter path to the sea (the current Hollands Diep) and the stretch leading north changed into a brackish estuary. From that moment on it was called the Noord. When the flow of the Merwede was better distributed among its lower branches (due to artificial means), the Noord returned to its former state as a tidal freshwater river, but the name remained Noord.

The pampering of Bulls begins a day or two before Pola. , farmers and farming families celebrate this festival in praise of their bulls. There is a holiday on the occasion of Pola in rural regions of Maharashtra in schools. Farmers don't do any work with bulls this day. It is a very important festival for farmers. They dedicate the whole day to their bulls. Women make Rangolis outside in front of their house, tie Toran on top of doors, they prepare puja thalis with kumkum, water, and sweets and an earthen lamp with ghee to do puja, aarti of bulls.The whole family take blessings from their Bulls, touch their feet, do Namaste them. Farmers wash their bulls, colour their horns, change their old year-long ropes, tie new ropes with bells, serve them different kind of grains like Jowar, wheat and lentils, perform their arti (Hindu ritual of respecting of God by moving clay lamp in front of him) and give them naivadya (food offered by devotees to God) to eat. It also celebrates in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Northern parts of Telangana as Polala Amavasya. Pola is a Hindu festival. On the day of Pola, the farmers decorate and respect their bulls. It falls on the day of the Pithori Amavasya (the new moon day) in the month of Shravana (usually in August). Oxen are decorated with such ornaments on the pola.  Celebrations  Pola is mainly a farmer's festival, wherein farmers respect their bulls and oxen, to thank them for their support in farming. It occurs after the monsoon sowing and field work, typically in late August or early September. On the day of Pola, the bulls are first given a bath, and then decorated with ornaments and shawls. Their horns are painted, and their necks are adorned with garlands of flowers. The bulls do not work that day, and they are part of procession where farmers celebrate the crop season. The work of decorated bulls, accompanied by the music and dancing, are carried out in the evenings. The first bullock to go out is an old bullock with a wooden frame (called makhar) tied on its horns. This bullock is made to break a rope of mango leaves stretched between two posts, and is followed by all the other cattle in the village. The festival is found among Marathas in central and eastern Maharashtra. A similar festival is observed by Hindus in other parts of India, and is called Mattu Pongal in south and Godhan in north and west India.

It is the first feature-length documentary about laughter. The documentary makes the case that laughter is the original peace signal and the human ability to share and transmit laughter may have been key to the rise of human civilization. The film chronicles unusual laughter phenomenon such as Holy Laughter, Laughter Parties and the Tanzanian Laughter Epidemic. The film is produced by Elevator Films which operates out of Lac Brome, Quebec, and Cache Film and Television. The film made its world premiere at HotDocs Film Festival in Toronto.Indiewire Inspiration Nerenberg is reported to have conceived the project after a personal tragedy, his then-pregnant partner lost her father to leukemia, leaving them gripped with sadness. They started the Laughology project because they didn't want to pass along their depression to their baby. Synopsis Laughology tells the story of how Nerenberg became a Laughologist following a family tragedy and reveals new information about the nature of laughter. Nerenberg travels from Canada to the United States, India, London, and Tanzania in search of his laugh. Some of the elements of the film were chronicled in Nerenberg‚Äôs popular series in the Montreal Gazette on Positivity. The film also claims to have found the man with the world's most contagious laugh, Doug Collins. In the film, Collins travels with Nerenberg to London England where the science behind his laugh is tested by the neuroscientific team responsible for proving that laughter is contagious.NBC News Laughology makes the case that the laughter fitness trend has scientific basis.

He appeared in only four Major League games as a relief pitcher for the 1952 Boston Braves, but fashioned a 14-year playing career in the minor leagues (1947‚Äì59; 1961). Born in Marion, Wisconsin, he threw and batted right-handed, and stood tall and weighed . Thiel's MLB trial occurred at the outset of the 1952 season. He split two decisions, allowed 11 hits, four bases on balls and six earned runs, and compiled an earned run average of 7.71 over seven innings pitched. He struck out six. He earned his victory in relief on April 19 at Shibe Park. Entering the game in the seventh inning with Boston trailing 7‚Äì6, Thiel hurled two scoreless innings, allowing only one hit and one walk to hold the opposition Philadelphia Phillies at bay until he exited in the top of the ninth for a pinch hitter, Jack Daniels, whose single ignited a three-runs Braves' rally. Boston forged ahead 9‚Äì7; Lew Burdette came on for the save, and Thiel had secured his first and only MLB win. As a minor league hurler, however, Thiel won 145 games and lost 108 for a .563 winning percentage and compiled an earned run average of 3.76.

The expedition was part of Winfield Scott's overall Anaconda Plan, which aimed at closing blockade-running ports inside the Outer Banks. The amphibious operation was carried out primarily by New England and North Carolina troops under Brig. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside and assisted by the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron under Captain Louis M. Goldsborough. Expedition General Ambrose Burnside. Photo by Mathew Brady In August 1861, Major General Benjamin F. Butler and Flag Officer Silas H. Stringham captured Forts Hatteras and Clark guarding an entry point into Pamlico Sound. It took several months before the Union high command would capitalize on this success. Butler and Stringham were able to persuade the Secretary of Navy Gideon Welles to maintain a force at Hatteras Inlet to keep the possibility of further operations open. The Lincoln Administration did not agree with invading North Carolina from the sea, but General-in-Chief George B. McClellan was in favor of such an operation. McClellan was able to persuade President Lincoln to authorize the operation and choose Brigadier General Ambrose E. Burnside to lead the expedition. Coast Division Being careful not to ask for reinforcements from McClellan's own Army of the Potomac, Burnside set about recruiting regiments from states along the North Atlantic sea coast intending to make use of their familiarity with the sea.Battles and Leaders of the Civil War: The Opening Battles p.660 Burnside's army, known as the Coast Division, was divided into three brigades, each commanded by a friend of Burnside's from his days at West Point.The Burnside Expedition The first brigade was commanded by Brig. Gen. John G. Foster, the second by Brig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno and the third by Brig. Gen. John G. Parke. In January, 1862 Burnside set out from Fort Monroe and rendezvoused with Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough at recently captured Hatteras Inlet where the two assembled their forces. Burnside's first objective was the Confederate fortifications on Roanoke Island guarding Albemarle Sound. District of Roanoke Brigadier General Henry A. Wise commanded the District of Roanoke and had a mere 1,400 men and few artillery pieces to defend his district. Besides a lack of infantry and artillery, the Confederates also lacked a significant naval force. A group of 8 work boats were converted into gunboats commanded by William F. Lynch. Wise contemptuously referred to the boats as the \\"mosquito fleet\\". Wise pleaded with his superior, Benjamin Huger in Virginia to send reinforcements. Huger declined to give aid but eventually Wise's reserves and a battalion of the 2nd North Carolina from Norfolk bolstered the defenses.Chaitin p.21-22 The Union expedition was having problems of its own. Severe weather hampered progress so much at times it seemed as if the whole mission would have to be scrapped.Chaitin p.21-23 The expedition, accompanied by 63 navy vessels, finally arrived off the coast of Roanoke Island.McPherson p.60 Roanoke Island By the time Burnside arrived, Roanoke Island was guarded by 3,000 Confederate troops under the command of Colonel Henry M. Shaw. District commander Henry Wise remained in overall command of the forces but was confined to his sickbed at Nag's Head. Burnside and Goldsborough defeated the Confederate force and took roughly 2,500 prisoners. A few days later, the Federal navy destroyed the remnants of the Confederate \\"Mosquito Fleet\\" which had escaped from Roanoke Island. New Bern Burnside then returned to Hatteras Inlet and was reinforced by more ships from the navy for his next objective, the railroad town of New Bern along the Neuse River. New Bern would also serve the Union Army as a base for any further movement into the interior of North Carolina. Brigadier General Lawrence O'Bryan Branch commanded the Confederate forces at New Bern. Once Roanoke Island fell, Branch braced himself for the inevitable attack upon his command. Branch had about 4,500 green troops from North Carolina. The Confederates prepared a line of breastworks straddling the Atlantic & North Carolina Railroad south of the town. Fort Thompson anchored the defenses along the Neuse River. Believing the main attack would come from the water, Branch's men faced most of Fort Thompson's guns toward the river.Chaitin p.35 Burnside's main attack did not come from water. Instead he marched his three brigades up along the railroad and attacked New Bern from the south. After fighting along his breastworks, Branch's defeated Confederates fled into New Bern. Hundreds of troops continued on to the railroad depot in town and boarded an outbound train. Branch ordered the rest of his troops to fall back to Kinston to regroup.Chaitin p.37 Fort Macon Burnside's next objective after New Bern was the terminus of the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad at Morehead City and Beaufort along the southern end of Pamlico Sound. Fort Macon guarded both cities. Burnside dispatched John G. Parke's brigade to capture the fort. Using handcars as a communications link between New Bern and Fort Macon, Parke's forces invested the fort's 500 man garrison under Lt. Col. Moses J. White. While Fort Macon was besieged the Union forces in North Carolina received additional infantry reinforcements, enough for Burnside to organize 6 brigades. Now in command of two brigades, Jesse L. Reno was dispatched to destroy the Dismal Swamp Canal locks to prevent Confederate ironclads from moving down from Norfolk. Reno's division was halted by Colonel Ambrose Wright's Confederates near Camden at the Battle of South Mills. Although the fighting was inconclusive, Reno abandoned the expedition. It was the first setback at the hands of the Confederates during Burnside's whole campaign. On April 26 Fort Macon surrendered. End of the Expedition By June 1862, Burnside had occupied Roanoke Island, New Bern, Morehead City, Beaufort and Washington, North Carolina. Colonel Robert Brown Potter was placed in command of the Union garrison at Washington. Potter ordered a reconnaissance from the garrison under Lt. Col. Francis A. Osborne. Osborne's men ran into the 44th North Carolina under Col. George Singletary. After a brief fight, the Confederates retreated and Osborne returned to Washington. It was a small fight with no far reaching consequences but it was to be the last battle of Burnside's expedition. Confederate President Jefferson Davis's new military adviser, Robert E. Lee, saw the importance of North Carolina and now Confederate reinforcements were pouring into the region. Burnside was preparing for a drive against Goldsborough, his next major objective, when he received orders to return to Virginia with any reinforcements he could spare to aid in the withdrawal of General McClellan's forces after being defeated attempting to capture the Confederate capital.Chaitin p.38 Burnside departed on July 6, 1862 with 7,000 troops and returned to Virginia. These troops would become the nucleus of the IX Corps. Aftermath Burnside left behind General Foster in command of 8,000 troops. Foster mounted an expedition against the railroad at Goldsborough, which he destroyed at the end of 1862. The fighting in North Carolina would then devolve into a series of raids and skirmishes. In 1864, the Confederates assumed the offensive in North Carolina, trying to recover some of the territory lost to Burnside's expedition. They failed to retake New Bern, but reconquered Plymouth and held it for 6 months. The next major campaigns in North Carolina were the capture of Fort Fisher and the march of William T. Sherman's armies in 1865.

Betty Fibichov√° (16 March 1846 ‚Äì 20 May 1901) was a Czechoslovak opera singer and the wife of composer Zdenƒõk Fibich. The greatest Czech operatic contralto of her day, she enjoyed close artistic partnerships with both Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k and Bed≈ôich Smetana in addition to collaborating frequently with her husband. Biography Born Betty Hanu≈°ov√° in Jilemnice, Fibichov√° made her professional opera debut at the Provisional Theatre in 1868. Later that year Bed≈ôich Smetana became her artistic manager, and she became highly involved with his group of artists that would later be established at the Prague National Theatre. She notably sang at the opening of the theatre on 11 June 1881 as Radmilla in the world premiere of Smetana's Libu≈°e; a performance given in honor of the visit of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. Sadly a fire broke in the new theatre on the following 12 August 1881 which destroyed the copper dome, the auditorium and stage of the theatre. The theatre was repaired and reopened on 18 November 1883 with a reprisal of Libu≈°e with the same cast. Fibichov√° sang in two more premieres of operas by Smetana at the New Czech Theatre during her career. On 18 September 1878 she portrayed Panna Roza in the world premiere of The Secret at the Nov√© ƒåesk√© Divadlo (New Czech Theatre). She then appeared as Z√°vi≈° in the first production of The Devil's Wall on 29 October 1882. Fibichov√° also sang in a number of world premieres of works by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. On 17 April 1876 she sang the role of Homena in the premiere of Vanda. She sang the role of Veruna in the first performance of The Cunning Peasant in Prague in 1878. On 2 October 1881 she starred as ≈ò√≠hov√° in the first production of The Stubborn Lovers. In 1887 she portrayed Anna in the first performance of the revised version of King and Charcoal Burner, a role she had previously sung in the work's premiere on 24 November 1874. In 1875 Fibichov√° married Zdenƒõk Fibich who, while less known than Dvo≈ô√°k or Smetana, was one of the greatest Czech composers of the day. She sang in the premieres of a number of operas by her husband, most notably Isabella in The Bride of Messina in Prague on 28 March 1884. Other roles she originated for her husband were Eli≈°ka in Bukov√≠n and Perchta in Blan√≠k. The couple separated in 1895, after which point Fibich lived with his lover and frequent artistic collaborator, librettist Ane≈æka Schulzov√°. Fibichov√° also sang works from the French, Italian, German, and Russian opera repertories during her career. She was also an active concert soloist. She retired from the stage in 1900, the same year that her husband died. She died in Prague in May the following year at the age of 55.

This process is different from cast coinage, and can be classified in hammered coinage or hammering and milled coinage or milling. A coin die is one of the two metallic pieces that are used to strike a coin, one per each side of the coin. A die contains an inverse version of the image to be struck on the coin. Striking a coin refers to pressing an image into the blank metal disc, or planchet, and is a term descended from the days when the dies were struck with hammers to deform the metal into the image of the dies. Modern dies made out of hardened steel are capable of producing many hundreds of thousands of coins before they are retired and defaced.  Ancient coin dies  Prior to the modern era, coin dies were manufactured individually by hand by artisans known as engravers. In demanding times, such as the crisis of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, dies were still used even when they became very worn or even when they cracked. The die that was on the hammer side, usually the reverse (back), tended to wear out first. The planchets were usually hot prior to striking. On some Roman provincial coins, some believe the tongs used to move the heated planchet left permanent center indentations on the finished coins. Others attribute these marks to surfacing tools used as a part of planchet preparation. Reverse die for the coinage of Demetrius I of Bactria, 200‚Äì185 BCE. Experimental archeology suggests that a lower die could be expected to last for up to 10,000 strikes depending on the level of wear deemed acceptable. Upper dies seem to have a far greater range of lives with usable lives ranging from just over 100 strikes to nearly 8000 being reported. Combining archaeological evidence with historic records suggests ancient coin producers (in this case the Amphictions at Delphi) could get as many as 47,000 strikes out of an individual die.  Medieval coin dies  Medieval engravers were guild members who created coins. The vast majority of medieval coins were cold struck; the planchets were not heated. While medieval coin dies were largely made of iron, some dies have been discovered with a small region at the face of the die which is made of steel. As technology and the economy changed over the course of the Middle Ages, so did the techniques used to create coin dies. While most ancient coin dies used engraving very heavily, early medieval coinage was dominated by dies created mostly from punches, which displace the metal of the die instead of removing it. There is evidence of medieval die cutters using engraving tools to lay out designs, and to create detailed punches. However, engraving on the face of the die did not become commonplace until the early Renaissance. Very detailed records exist for the Venetian mint. In the late Middle Ages, the dies used to create tornesellos lasted as follows: \\"hammer\\" die, ~17,000 strikes; \\"anvil\\" die, 36,000 strikes. The mint made an average of 20,000 coins per day, so they were making one hammer die a day and one anvil die every other day. The \\"hammer\\" dies wore out more quickly because they tended to be smaller and were hit directly with a hammer, leading to severe mushrooming on the tops. Modern die production First, an artist creates a large plaster model of the coin. The plaster model is then coated with rubber. The rubber mold is then used to make an epoxy galvano. All of this takes place on a scale of around eight inches. Next, a reducing machine takes several days to reduce the image onto a steel master hub. The master hub is then heat treated to make it hard. The master hub is then used to make only a few master dies via hubbing, which involves pressing the master hub into a steel blank to impress the image into the die. The master die is then used to form as many working hubs as needed through the same process, and then the working hubs are put through the same process to form the working dies. These working dies are the actual dies which will strike coins. The process of transferring the hub to the die can be repeated as many times as necessary in order to form the number of dies needed to make the number of coins required. The difference between a hub and a die is that the hub has a raised image and a die has an incuse image, so one forms the other. When making working dies, the Mint has found that by using a lower amount of pressure in the hubbing press, they can prolong the life of the hubs and dies used. In between each hubbing, however, the die being made must be subjected to an annealing procedure to soften the steel, making it easier to force the hub's image into the die. As the die is being cold forged in the hubbing press, work hardening makes the hubbed die harder and stronger than in its original state (an advantage over engraving the die). If, when the die is subjected to another hubbing, it is not lined up exactly with the hub, the result is a secondary image, or doubling. This is called die doubling, and results in such spectacular coins as the famous 1955 doubled die cent.  The third side of the coin  On the edge of the US dime, quarter and half dollar, and many world coins there are ridges, similar to knurling, called reeds. Some older US coins, and many world coins have other designs on the edge of the coin. Sometimes these are simple designs like vines, more complex bar patterns or perhaps a phrase, as on the United States dollar coin, on which are the date, mintmark, and motto, E Pluribus Unum. Historically these kinds of designs are imparted into the coin through a multisectioned third die called a collar, whose inner edge diameter is the same as that of the edge of the coin. When the obverse and reverse dies strike the planchet the planchet expands to fill the collar, impressing the collar design into the edge of the coin. The collar sections are then separated to allow the coin to be removed. When the collar is missing, it results in a type of error called a broadstrike. A broadstruck coin is generally a bit flatter and quite a bit bigger around than the regular non-error coin of the same denomination. A second and faster process by which a design is applied to the edge of a coin is by use of an edge incusing machine. The struck coin is fed into the machine and the machine then pressed the design into the edge of the coin. Sometimes a mint will use both methods to apply an edge design. The U.S. Mint, for example, used an edge incusing machine to letter the edges business strike presidential dollars and a collar for the proof versions of these coins. Die marriage During a typical production run, or coining process, (particularly when heavy presses are used for large production runs) a die is selected out of a group of several dies for the front and another die is selected from a different group of dies for the back of the coin to be made. The mint employee then places each die into the minting press for operation. When the run is complete, the dies are removed from the press. This procedure is repeated for each production run. Coins minted by each mint for each year may have several production runs in order to complete their orders. If there is more than one die used for either the front or the back, then minute differences between each die can be identified. This is usually only for Early U.S. coins, as modern coin dies are made using computers, so unless there is an error coin die, all of the dies are identical. In addition, the relative positioning between the back and the front can also be used to determine which dies were used for the run that produced a particular coin. In the United States, coins are typically minted head to tail; that means the \\"top\\" of one side of the coin is on the exact opposite side of the coin as the \\"bottom\\" of the other, resulting in the coin's features being presented right side up when the coin is rotated on a horizontal axis. This is called a \\"coin turn\\" alignment. Correct alignment for a \\"coin turn\\" is exactly 180 degrees; however due to realities of machine process, this can vary by a fraction of a degree. In rare cases, this deviation can be up to several degrees, and very easily noticeable. However, even very small deviations can establish the production run in which a coin was minted. When this is done, it is called a die marriage. Die marriage is particularly important with regards to the US half dollar minted at the New Orleans Mint in 1861, since it establishes if a coin was minted with the mint facility under Union, State of Louisiana, or Confederacy control.  Use  In modern presses, a die strikes approximately 120 coins a minute. This rapid coining causes wear on the dies. Nickel alloys are among the main metals used in today‚Äôs coins but they are harder than other legacy coinage metals such as silver and gold alloys and therefore they cause even quicker die wear. Copper and copper alloys have been used in coinage for centuries because of their malleability and the ease with which they can be coined: however, these too wear the dies when the dies are used for too long. An infamous example is the 1955 \\"poorman's double die\\". This coin is sold as a replacement for the 1955 doubled die, but it is no more than die-deterioration doubling, caused by wear on the dies. When a coin is struck, the planchet is not heated. Although the planchet would be softer and more malleable, the extra time and expense would prove too great for the mint. Thus, the metal cold flows into the die under the high pressure. Mistakes can happen at any stage of this manufacturing process, and these mistakes are something that certain collectors look for. Coin errors that occur on the die are generally more desirable than errors made at the time of the strike. For example, a doubled die, where a date or another device appears twice slightly offset, is often a highly desired error. Strike errors are generally unique, whereas all coins struck with an error die will have the same characteristic. This makes them more easily collectible. The most famous doubled die in the past hundred years is the 1955 doubled die Lincoln cent. These trade for hundreds of dollars because the error can easily be seen by a casual observer. Many doubled die errors require at least a jeweler's loupe to be seen. Doubling can occur at the hub stage as well. Some more recent errors are hub doubled. Most famously, there is a 1995 doubled die cent that is hub doubled.  Terminal die state  The terminal die state, as the name would seem to indicate, is the last state in which any die is used. This is the state of a die that is starting to develop serious structural failures through cracks. A die in such a state would, if not removed from service, become unserviceable by breaking apart. Like any metallic part, dies are subject to failure from the enormous pressures used to impress the image of the die onto the blank planchet. Some dies were removed when even a microscopic defect is observed, while others were used until they literally broke into pieces. The Bass Foundation has a particularly noteworthy example of an 1806/4 Quarter Eagle ($2.50 gold US coin) in which a piece of the die has broken away, resulting in a heavy rim break over the \\"LI\\" in \\"LIBERTY\\" on the front. http://www.harrybassfoundation.org HBCC-3014 More typically, a terminal die state will result in crack-like structures appearing on the coin. A good example can be observed on an 1839 Liberty Seated Dime. A crack-like feature is clearly seen going through the date, the shield, and the second star. http://www.seateddimevarieties.com/date_mintmark/1839_105cpage.htm This crack- like structure appears like material that is overlaid onto the surface of the coin; this is because the crack on the die allowed the planchet materiel to flow into it during stamping, just like a deliberate design feature. Some coins exhibit multiple crack-like features, indicating a die that is very close to the end of its serviceable life. Coins that do exhibit such features can be labeled as ‚ÄúTerminal Die State‚Äù examples.  Coin die represented in other coins  A coin die itself, has been the main motive for many collectors coins and medals. One of the most recent and famous one, is the Austrian 700 Years City of Hall in Tyrol coin, minted on January 29, 2003. The reverse side of the coin shows the Guldiner silver coin. However, the design is negative, representing a coin die, as a reference to Hall‚Äôs history as a significant centre for minting coins.

She told DiManno she and her family lived for 18 years in the United States. The Contender Biography published by Pajhwok Afghan News has her living in the United States from 1990 to1 1994, and living in Pakistan for the remainder of the period 1986 to 2001, where she administered relief to other Afghan expatriates. David Williams, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, in 2005, when she first ran for Afghanistan's National Assembly, said her husband had been killed in factional fighting. Rosie DiManno, writing in the Toronto Star during her presidential campaign, wrote that Ata was the target of a smear campaign alleging the murder of her husband as well as one of her daughters. Ata pointed out to Dimanno that all five of her daughters were still alive. According to DiManno, Ata's husband died in the US in 1992 of natural causes. Dismissing the murder claims, Ata declared: \\"So, I'm alleged to have killed my husband and my daughter, then I ran back to Afghanistan to avoid American justice? This is what they write in the newspapers. I wish we had a functioning court system so I could sue.\\" All five of Ata's daughters live currently in the United States. Family and career A descendant of the Afghan Royal Family she's related to the former President of Afghanistan, Sardar Mohammad Daoud Khan, himself, a cousin of Mohammed Zahir Shah, Afghanistan's last Monarch. Ata is a widow and she has five daughters living in the United States. Ata was a Registered Nurse and a trained psychologist, before becoming a Politician. Elected to the upper house of the Afghan National Legislature Wolesi Jirga in 2005, she represented Kabul and served on the Jirga's commission for counter-narcotics and its monitoring commission. Shahla Ata and Frozan Fana were the only two women candidates in the 2009 Afghan presidential election. Ballot results placed her in the fourteenth place in a field of thirty-two with 11412 votes. During the presidential campaign she has said that if elected, she will carry the policies of President Mohammed Daoud Khan in the 1970s. Death On March 12, 2015, Ata's lifeless body was discovered in her house and an investigation has been opened by Kabul Police Department's Criminal branch.

He established a Kshatriya SabhƒÅ to instill Brahminical values and practices in people of his own caste. Barma was born as Panchanan Sarkar, originally came from a jotedar family of Cooch Behar. He was born on 11 February 1866 at Khalisamari village, Mathabhanga Sub-division, in erstwhile Cooch Behar State, to Mr. Khoshal Sarkar (d. 1890) and Mrs. Champala Sarkar. He graduated from a Kolkata college, with an honours in Sanskrit, in 1893. He later privately completed his M.A. in Mental and Moral Philosophy in 1896 from the University of Calcutta, and later took his LL.B. degree from Surendranath Law College, Kolkata, in 1900. In the early years of his career, he started practicing law at Rangpur court. In Rangpur he was shocked by the refusal of a high caste lawyer to use a toga (lawyer's gown), previously used by him. In the following years, he led a kshatriyazation movement among Rajbanshi community of Bengal. In order to be respected and accepted by the upper caste Bengalis Panchanan felt the Rajbanshis must get organized and educated, which he tried to achieve through the Kshatriya Samity. Understandably, the Samity tried to prove that Rajbanshis were Kshatriyas with a royal lineage, suggesting a historical link with Biswa Singha, the king of Cooch Behar. Based on Sanskrit literature and Brahmin pundits, they also claimed to be Kshatriyas, hiding their true identity for centuries. In support of this claim the movement involved a ceremonial kshatriyaisation process - brahminical rituals were performed to convert thousands of Rajbanshis to ‚ÄòKshatriya Rajbanshi‚Äô in the villages of North Bengal. In 1921, Panchanan was selected to the Bengal Legislative Assembly after winning the general election. Panchanan Sarkar died in Kolkata on 9 September 1935. The name of the Cooch Behar Panchanan Barma University commemorates his legacy.

Statement of the inequality If we let : \\\\overline{x} = \\\\frac{x_1+\\\\cdots+x_n}{n} be the sample mean and : s = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\\\overline{x})^2 } be the standard deviation of the sample, then : \\\\overline{x} - s\\\\sqrt{n-1} \\\\le x_j \\\\le \\\\overline{x} + s\\\\sqrt{n-1}\\\\qquad \\\\text{for } j = 1,\\\\dots,n. Equality holds on the left (or right) for x_j if and only if all the n ‚àí 1 x_is other than x_j are equal to each other and greater (smaller) than x_j. Comparison to Chebyshev's inequality Chebyshev's inequality locates a certain fraction of the data within certain bounds, while Samuelson's inequality locates all the data points within certain bounds. The bounds given by Chebyshev's inequality are unaffected by the number of data points, while for Samuelson's inequality the bounds loosen as the sample size increases. Thus for large enough data sets, Chebychev's inequality is more useful. Applications Samuelson's inequality may be considered a reason why studentization of residuals should be done externally. Relationship to polynomials Samuelson was not the first to describe this relationship: the first was probably Laguerre in 1880 while investigating the roots (zeros) of polynomials.Laguerre E.

Laguerre failed to notice this relationship with the means and standard deviations of the roots, being more interested in the bounds themselves. This relationship permits a rapid estimate of the bounds of the roots and may be of use in their location. When the coefficients a_1 and a_2 are both zero no information can be obtained about the location of the roots, because not all roots are real (as can be seen from Descartes' rule of signs) unless the constant term is also zero.

The website was co-owned by Ten Alps (75%) and ITN (25%). In October 2010, Ten Alps announced that the Department for Education was cancelling the ¬£10m annual Teachers TV contract for 2011. As of April 2018, content produced by Teachers TV remains freely available at the TES website. Programming General programming included a weekly half-hour news programme, documentaries on the educational issues and controversies of the day, and guidance on topics such as behaviour management. It covered all National Curriculum subjects, as well as specialist programmes for headteachers, managers, newly qualified teachers (NQT), teaching assistants (TA), and governors. It also had an educational news service supplied by ITN. Charter While it was funded by the DCSF, Teachers TV was editorially independent of government. This was a requirement of the Communications Act 2003 and Ofcom, the regulator for the UK communications industries. To ensure accountability for its funding, a governance process was established, managed by the Teachers TV Board of Governors. Operations Teachers TV (TTV) was a government-funded, advertisement-aided programme for teachers. It was initially an online TV channel, then just a web vehicle for specific professional training ‚Äî Continuous Professional Development, or CPD, mainly via video experiences across all curricula, age groups and other school based issues, specifically aimed at teachers. It was run by a highly professional group of individuals, at extremely high costs, managed by Ten Alps. 2011 saw the launch of Teaching Channel, a US initiative to deliver professional development videos for teachers over the Internet, public television, cable and other digital outlets.Gates Foundation Gives Grant To Teaching Channel Decline and closure In March 2010, Ed Balls, then Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) axed the broadcast deals in place with Freeview, Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media in a bid to save the channel around ¬£1m in carriage costs annually. It closed on Freeview first on 21 July, and Freesat, Sky and Virgin followed on 31 August 2010. Online availability was unaffected by the change. On 15 October 2010, Ten Alps announced that the Department for Education was cancelling the ¬£10m annual Teachers TV contract from April 2011. The contract was due to run until 2013, but the government invoked a six-month break clause. The service had 400,000 registered users. It provided 783,000 training day sessions online in 2009 and claimed to have saved schools an estimated ¬£235m. In 2011 a number of providersTeachfind.com Launches to Save Decommissioned Govt Education Sites gained a licence from the Department for Education to distribute the Teachers TV videos. Only those videos which were commissioned by the Teachers TV service are available under the terms of the licence. Reception Deemed 'successful', Teachers TV gained a wide audience of teachers, heads, assistants and governors, with over 3,500 best practice videos and further raw material for up to 6,000 with investment into new content regularly. Government funding was withdrawn April 2011, and Teachers TV ceased to exist, but all the content was made available for those organisations that would be able to provide free access to all the material for teachers nationally in the UK. Popular videos included those by behaviour experts John Bayley, Sue Cowley and The Scary Guy, as well as teachers and other school workers who showed hands-on examples of good practice.

He became so enchanted with North Africa and its culture, that he converted to Islam, and was proficient in Arabic. In addition to his paintings, he translated Arabic literature into French. Biography Born in Paris, Alphonse-√âtienne Dinet, was the son of a prominent French judge, Philippe L√©on Dinet and Marie Odile Boucher.Benjamin, in Edwards and Wood (2004) p. 88 In 1865 his sister Jeanne, who would be his biographer, was born.Jeanne Dinet Rollince, La Vie de E. Dinet, GP. Maisonneuve, 1938 From 1871, he studied at the Lyc√©e Henry IV, where the future president Alexandre Millerand was also among the students. Upon graduation in 1881 he enrolled in the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts and entered the studio of Victor Galland. The following year he studied under William Bouguereau and Tony Robert-Fleury at the Acad√©mie Julian. He also exhibited for the first time at the Salon des artistes fran√ßais. Dinet made his first trip to Bou Sa√¢da by the Ouled Na√Øl Range in southern Algeria in 1884, with a team of entomologists. The following year he made a second trip on a government scholarship, this time to Laghouat. At that time he painted his first two Algerian pictures: les Terrasses de Laghouat and l‚ÄôOued M‚ÄôSila apr√®s l‚Äôorage.

There he was eulogized by the former Governor General of Algeria Maurice Viollette. Work Compared to modernist painters such as Henri Matisse, who also visited northern Africa in the first decade of the 20th century, Dinet's paintings are extremely conservative. They are highly mimetic, indeed ethnographic, in their treatment of their subject.Benjamin, in Edwards and Wood (2004) p. 90 Dinet's understanding of Arab culture and language set him apart from other orientalist artists because as an Arabic speaking visitor, he was able to find nude models in rural Algeria where the 'rule of the veil' was less frequently observed.Edwards, S. and Wood, P. (eds), Art of the Avant-gardes, Yale University Press, 2004, pp 88-89 Before 1900, most of his works could be characterized as \\"anecdotal genre scenes\\". As he became more interested in Islam, he began to paint religious subjects more often.

It is a privately held corporation that focuses on the development of geothermal energy resources and Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). AltaRock has filed patent applications and holds exclusive licenses for related intellectual property related to EGS. In 2008, it started its first project near The Geysers to demonstrate the ability of EGS to be a reliable, renewable and clean source for the production of electric power. AltRock's efforts to expand EGS technologies are supported by a 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) report that concluded EGS has the potential to provide 100 GWe (gigawatts of electricity) or more for the U.S. by 2050. Co-founded in 2007 by Andrew Perlman, Susan Petty, and other business partners, AltaRock has received backing from investors such as Google.org, Advanced Technology Ventures , and Vulcan Capital, as well as demonstration grant funding from the United States Department of Energy (DOE). Projects The Newberry EGS Demonstration The company currently has a demonstration project underway about 30 miles south of Bend, Oregon in the Deschutes National Forest. The Newberry EGS Demonstration is located on an existing Federal lease designated for geothermal use and is supported by a committee that includes representatives of the community, environmental groups, government and the geothermal industry. AltaRock's Newberry EGS Demonstration will create an EGS reservoir in the high-temperature, low- permeability resource present on the northwest flank of the Newberry Volcano. The Demonstration will use hydraulic shearing (as opposed to hydraulic fracturing) and other stimulation techniques to induce and sustain fluid flow and geothermal heat extraction, culminating in the conceptual design of a commercial-scale well field and power plant. Water usage and induced seismicity analyses for the demonstration site have been completed and conclude the project poses little risk to the area or local communities. The Geysers Demonstration In 2008, AltaRock started a demonstration project at The Geysers geothermal field. The Geysers field has hundreds of megawatts of unused electric power generating capacity due to the lack of steam caused by several decades of reservoir depletion. At The Geysers demonstration, AltaRock intended to re-drill a well originally drilled in 1988 and used for years to inject water to produce steam for the existing geothermal power plants. Three attempts were made to re-drill the well from various depths but the drilling assembly became stuck each time in unstable serpentinite formation. Drilling at The Geysers demonstration site has been suspended while the company evaluates a number of alternative well locations at the Geysers and elsewhere for demonstrating this technology.  Blue Mountain  Blue Mountain is a traditional geothermal energy site in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada that opened in 2009 but has since underperformed. AltaRock Energy was originally hired by EIG Global Energy Partners in 2014 to help bring the site up to full capacity with its technology. In order to bring capacity at the site up to 50 megawatts, the company plans to first use hydroshearing and then possibly drilling. Hydroshearing, a technology developed by AltaRock to improve the performance of existing geothermal wells, involves pumping cold water and other particles into a reservoir in order to block parts of the well and allow small cracks to form. The materials injected then biodegrade, allowing the new cracks to open up. These cracks permit new water to flow that can be used to generated steam and thus energy. The acquisition marks a turning point for the company and the future of geothermal power in the US, as it will test the viability of a business model that relies on raising revenue from upgrading existing geothermal sites in order to finance new enhanced EGS sites in the future.

He espoused a strongly conservative world view.Howard J. Wiarda, Iberia and Latin America: New Democracies, New Policies, New Models, 1996, p. 18 Early politics Sardinha graduated in law from the University of Coimbra in 1911.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 344 During his student years, he was a supporter of Republicanism and even flirted with anarcho-syndicalism but by 1911 he had shifted his opinions, under the influence of his highly conservative mother and became a strong advocate of monarchism and Catholicism.Douglas L. Wheeler, Republican Portugal: A Political History, 1910-1926, 1999, p. 70 He was also influenced in this regard by the Spanish conservative Juan V√°zquez de Mella, who was a close friend of Sardinha from the early 1900s.Marek Jan Chodakiewicz & John Radzilowski, Spanish Carlism and Polish Nationalism, 2003, p. 39 Integralism He was the founder of Integralismo Lusitano in 1913 along with Jos√© Hip√≥lito Raposo and Alberto de Monsaraz.Anna Klobucka, The Portuguese Nun: Formation of a National Myth, 2000, p. 83 He would serve as a deputy for a time under the Presidency of Sid√≥nio Pais, who was vaguely sympathetic towards Integralism. Sardinha was this group's foremost ideologue and his programme was outlined in his 1925 work, A Alian√ßa Peninsular, which called for a regression in Iberia and a new Catholic corporatism that recalled the work of Charles Maurras. This highly nationalist and ruralist work was seen in Spain as the basis of Hispanidad.Nicholas Perry & Loreto Echeverr√≠a, Under the Heel of Mary, 1988,p. 183 His writings revealed a strong affinity for the agricultural as a historical and economic basis as well as support for anti-Semitism.Sharon R. Roseman & Shawn S. Parkhurst, Recasting Culture and Space in Iberian Contexts, 2008, p. 218 This anti-Semitism was influenced by Action Fran√ßaise, from whom he also took a strong strain of anti-liberalism.Rees, Biographical Dictionary, p. 345 He added to this a hard-line racism in which he strongly criticised miscegnation although this element of his ideology was rejected by some within the movement, most notably Jos√© Hip√≥lito Raposo.Rees, Biographical Dictionary, p. 314 Further to this Sardinha also grafted elements of the works of Georges Sorel, adopting his theories of revolutionary validity and the social value of myth to his own ideology. Under Sardinha's direction the movement converted from being a group of monarchist nostalgics into a coherent ideology that hoped to establish a new era in Portuguese history under the leadership of a strong centralised monarchy. Unlike some of his contemporaries Sardinha considered a close relationship to Spain to be of central importance for Portugal and he also took an internationalist view in general, hoping to see similar integralisms develop elsewhere, particularly in Brazil where that proved to be the case. His early death in 1925 saw Integralismo Lusitano lose its most celebrated thinker and as a movement it failed to recover from the blow.Tom Gallagher, Portugal: a Twentieth-Century Interpretation, 1983, p. 31 Drawing from traditional monarchism, Hispanidad, ruralism, Integralism, scientific racism, fascism and national syndicalism he had created a complex syncretic ideology that inevitably fissured into various factions after his death. Historian As well as his political activism Sardinha was also noted as a somewhat controversial historian. Much of his work was given over to a historical revisionism that sought to counter liberal interpretations of history. Amongst his pet theories was that Ant√≥nio de Ara√∫jo e Azevedo, 1st Count of Barca had collaborated with France during his time as Minister of Foreign Affairs during the Peninsular War.Marcus Cheke, Carlota Joaquina, Queen of Portugal, 1969, p. 20 Similarly he rejected the widely celebrated Portuguese discoveries as ushering in an era of capitalism and cosmopolitanism and thus flying in the face of his ruralist ideals.Clare Mar-Molinero & Angel Smith, Nationalism and the Nation in the Iberian Peninsula, 1996, p. 49 References Category:1887 births Category:1925 deaths Category:People from Monforte, Portugal Category:Integralismo Lusitano Category:Portuguese historians Category:University of Coimbra alumni Category:20th-century historians ","title":"Ant√≥nio Sardinha"},{"id":"24057645","text":"A Hard Act to Follow is an extended play by American country music singer Keith Whitley.

Construction and commissioning Destroyer escort USS Register (DE-233) is launched at Charleston Navy Yard, on 20 January 1944, prior to her conversion into high-speed transport USS Register (APD-92). Register was laid down as the USS Register (DE-233) on 27 October 1943 by the Charleston Navy Yard, and launched as such on 20 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Ethel L. Register, widow of the ships namesake, Lieutenant Commander Paul J. Register. The ship was reclassified as a and redesignated APD-92 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, the ship was commissioned on 11 January 1945 with Commander J. R. Cain, Jr., in command.  Service history  World War II Following shakedown in the British West Indies, Register departed the United States East Coast on 11 March 1945 and headed via the Panama Canal for San Diego, California, where she arrived on 26 March 1945. She continued on to Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, which she reached on 3 April 1945. Training with underwater demolition teams followed and on 27 April 1945 she got underway, with 100 passengers embarked, for Ulithi Atoll. Arriving there on 13 May 1945, she departed as an escort of an Okinawa-bound convoy on 15 May 1945 for service in the Okinawa campaign. Register anchored off the Hagushi beaches at Okinawa on 19 May 1945. On 20 May 1945 she got underway for screening station Baker-13. At 19:25 hours a flight of ten Japanese Mistbishi A6M Zero fighters was sighted approaching from the west, directly out of the sun. Register increased her speed and made radical course changes. The Japanese formation split up, but four of the planes headed for Register. Two came in from starboard, one from ahead, one from astern. Register shot down two, one of the starboard attackers and the one closing in astern; the plane attacking from ahead, however, began a low, gliding run in an attempt to crash Registers bridge. Passing down Registers port side, the kamikaze suicide plane was deflected overboard by the kingpost, which buckled and crashed over No. 3 40-millimeter gun, wounding 12 of Registers crew, including her commanding officer, and causing considerable damage to her hull. The fourth plane though damaged, escaped. Relieved the following morning, 21 May 1945, Register retired to Hagushi, thence proceeded via Saipan in the Mariana Islands to Leyte in the Philippine Islands, where repairs begun at Okinawa were completed. By 29 June 1945 she was ready for action again. Assigned to escort duty, Register escorted 20 tank landing ships (LSTs) to Okinawa, then accompanied a nine-ship convoy to Ulithi Atoll before returning to Leyte on 16 July 1945. At the end of July 1945 she escorted two escort aircraft carriers to Ulithi Atoll and, while en route back to Leyte, joined in the search for survivors of the sinking of the heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis (CA-35). On 3 August 1945 she picked up 12 of the heavy cruisers crew. Transferring them to the hospital at Peleliu on 4 August 1945, she returned to the scene of the rescue, but found only life rafts and floater nets. Postwar At Leyte when hostilities ended on 15 August 1945, Register screened the battleships and cruisers of Task Group 95.7 to Okinawa from 20 August 1945 to 26 August 1945, then returned to the Philippines for the month of September 1945. In October 1945 she escorted transports carrying occupation troops to Japan, then served as harbor entrance patrol ship at Wakayama, Japan.

He was one of the central figures in the Integralismo Lusitano that dominated the far-right of Portuguese politics during the early years of the twentieth century. Early years Born in Lisbon, he was the son of the poet Ant√≥nio de Macedo Papan√ßa, who became the first Conde de Monsaraz in 1910.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 267 In 1907 the young Monsaraz began studying law whilst also writing for the right-wing journal P√°tria Nova. As a result of his involvement in monarchist politics it would be 1915 before he finally graduated. Integralism Like many young monarchists at the time Monsaraz fell in behind Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro and took part in his monarchist incursion in 1911. He was exiled to Paris for his involvement and fell in with other like-minded individuals in the French capital who had also been expelled from Portugal. He was the founder of Integralismo Lusitano in 1914 along with Jos√© Hip√≥lito Raposo, Jos√© Adriano Pequito Rebelo and Ant√≥nio Sardinha.Anna Klobucka, The Portuguese Nun: Formation of a National Myth, 2000, p. 83 Independently wealthy due to coming from a leading family, Monsaraz was involved in funding a number of journals associated with the new movement, including Na√ß√£o Portuguesa, Ideia Nacional and A Monarquista. Monsaraz took part in Paiva Couceiro's second rebellion of 1919 but was wounded in this conflict and lost a kidney, a fact that impaired his health for the rest of his life. Nonetheless he continued his involvement in Integralism and sat on the Junta Central of the movement. He would become closely associated with Lu√≠s de Almeida Braga in their support for Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 8 The issue of succession proved a divisive one, with different elements within the movement supporting different candidates for the throne, and in 1925 Monsaraz resigned from the Junta Central as part of these problems. National Syndicalism Following his resignation Monsaraz began to read the works of Georges Sorel and his disciple Georges Valois and soon became converted to national syndicalism as a result. He went on to become a leading figure in the Movimento Nacional-Sindicalista, becoming Secretary-General of the blue-shirted movement in 1933. However Monsaraz was exiled to Republican Spain along with Francisco Rol√£o Preto in 1935 when Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar stepped up his persecution of the National Syndicalists.Ant√≥nio Costa Pinto & Maria In√°cia Rezola, 'Political Catholicism, Crisis of Democracy and Salazar‚Äôs New State in Portugal', Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions, Volume 8, Issue 2, 2007, pp. 353‚Äì368 Later years Monsaraz initially became even stronger in his national syndicalism and for a brief spell looked to Nazism, declaring Adolf Hitler to be his political idol. However this fervour did not last long and by 1936, when he returned to Portugal, Monsaraz had come full circle and was once again advocating Integralism. He remained a strong critic of Salazar, refusing to even mention his name and instead referring to him as \\"the orator of Sala do Risco\\", although by this time Monsaraz's political influence had all but ended.

The band is currently signed to Relapse Records. -(16)- has been cited, along with fellow pioneering acts such as Eyehategod, Crowbar and Acid Bath, as one of the subgenre's seminal outfits.J. Bennett, \\"Hazardous Prescription\\", Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces, Albert Mudrian, ed., Da Capo Press, p. 177. In June 2020, the band released their eighth full-length album, Dream Squasher. History Formation and Curves That Kick (1992-1994) 16 was formed in Santa Ana, California by Bobby Ferry (guitar), Cris Jerue (vocals), and Jason Corley (drums) in 1992. According to Ferry, he and Jerue bonded as part of the Southern California skate scene. Ferry has stated band was originally called 15, but changed their name when they were made aware of a previously existing group called Fifteen, who had been signed to Lookout Records. Ferry also named some of the band's early influences, including 7 Seconds, Bad Brains, and Metallica, as well as the \\"wave of [Amphetamine Reptile] bands, Helmet, Jesus Lizard, Unsane and Tar.\\" The band's first full-length album, Curves That Kick, was released in 1993 on Bacteria Sour, an independent label owned by renowned artist, Pushead. Following the album's release, -(16)- toured Japan in 1994. Drop Out and Blaze of Incompetence (1995-1998) The band's next record, Drop Out, was released by Pessimiser/Theologian records in 1996 (after being shelved for nearly two years). In spite of Drop Out's critical acclaim, -(16)- did not tour heavily, opting instead to focus on performing locally. Jason Corley was ejected from the band at the end of 1994, and replaced by Andy Hassler. Phil Vera was also added as a 2nd guitarist. The band released Blaze of Incompetence in 1997 (again on Pessimiser/Theologian), and did a US tour with Grief in 1998. Andy Hassler was fired shortly after the tour. R.D. Davies replaced Andy, and then he was replaced by Mark Sanger 6 months later. Zoloft Smile and hiatus (1999-2004) 16's next album, Zoloft Smile, was recorded in 1999/2000, but wasn't released until 2002 by At A Loss Recordings. By the time the album was released, Bobby and Tony had both quit the band. The rest of the guys carried on with Phil being the lone guitar player. Nial McGaughey and later, Rafa Martinez handled bass duties. Phil took over vocal duties in 2003, after Cris was forced to go to rehab for alcohol and drug dependency. Addiction issues have plagued the band throughout their career, with Jerue remarking in a 2012 interview with Invisible Oranges, \\"there have been 14 dudes in this band and not one has been stable mentally or chemically.\\" The band then toured the US and Japan as a three-piece (Phil, Mark, Rafa), until calling it quits in 2004. Reformation, Bridges to Burn, and Deep Cuts From Dark Clouds (2007-2014) Ferry, Jerue, Corley and Tony Baumeister reformed -(16)- in 2007, subsequently securing a deal with Relapse Records. Their Relapse debut, Bridges to Burn, was released in January 2009. The band parted ways with Corley again, and recruited Mateo Pinkerton as their new drummer. In 2010, Relapse Records released The First Trimester, a compilation of non-album material. Deep Cuts From Dark Clouds followed in 2012. In 2012, Last Hurrah Records also released Lost Tracts of Time, a compilation featuring b-sides from the Zoloft Smile era.

He served as Bishop of Manchester from 1960 to 1974. Primeau was born in Chicago, Illinois, and there studied at Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary. He was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal George Mundelein on April 7, 1934. After serving at parishes and schools in the Archdiocese of Chicago, he spent twelve years in Rome, and was rector of Mundelein Seminary, Chicago's Archdiocesan seminary. In 1958 he was named pastor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Chicago. On November 27, 1959, Primeau was appointed the sixth Bishop of Manchester, New Hampshire, by Pope John XXIII.Bishop Primeau He received his episcopal consecration on February 13, 1960 from Cardinal Albert Gregory Meyer, with Bishops Martin Dewey McNamara and Raymond Peter Hillinger serving as co-consecrators. He was installed at Cathedral of St. Joseph on March 15, 1960. During the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), Primeau was one of the more influential and articulate voices among the Council Fathers. He spoke out in support of the empowerment of the laity, once declaring, \\"Let this talk of their duty of subjection cease.\\" He also founded the first foreign mission of the diocese in 1963 in Cartago, Colombia. During Primeau's tenure, the number of Catholics increased by 43,000 and the number of parishes by 11; however, weekly Mass attendance declined from over 70% to below 50%. After thirteen years as bishop, he retired on January 30, 1974 at the age of 65. He had often advocated that bishops should retire at that age and so he became the first Bishop of Manchester to resign from office. Primeau died in 1989 at age 79.

D-Lightsys products are based on optoelectronic components. The company headquarters are located in Aubervilliers, near Paris, France. Products are manufactured in Isle d‚ÄôAbeau, near Lyon, and are sold through the Radiall sales network under the D-Lightsys brand. History In 2002, D-Lightsys won the French award for the most innovative high-tech start-up. It was founded that year by Mathias Pez and Fran√ßois Quentel, two fiber optic interconnection specialists who previously worked for the Thales Group Advanced Research Center. On April 15, 2005, Radiall announced its acquisition of a 40% stake in D-Lightsys On January 8, 2008, Radiall announced an increase in its shareholdings of the start-up D-Lightsys to 95 percent. Research Many products use vertical- cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) technology.  Point to point VCSEL- based free space optical data link  D-Lightsys considers free space optical links for intermediate communication distances ranging from a few centimeters to one or two meters. In a 2006 paper, they presented the initial simulations and the first experimental characterizations of a VCSEL-based point-to-point free space interconnect on distances ranging from 16 cm to 40 cm targeting bit rates up to 10 Gbit/s. High-throughput optical interconnect technology Alcatel Space and the CNES have investigated High-throughput optical interconnect technology for future on-board digital processors optical interconnects as an enabling technology that may offer the high-throughput data communication capabilities required to the future on-board processors and digital equipment. D-Lightsys cooperated on this research with the development of the optoelectronic modules. Spatiotemporal and thermal analysis of VCSEL High-speed optoelectronic modules using VCSEL] coupled to multi-mode optical fibers are used for 10 Gigabit Ethernet in short-distance optical links. A complete model of the spatiotemporal behavior of multimode VCSELs, through static and dynamic response, noise, thermal effects, and its coupling to MMF has been investigated. The two founders of D-Lightsys took part in this study.Spatiotemporal and Thermal Analysis of VCSEL for Short-range Gigabit Optical Links Relative intensity noise shows modal dependence and can be affected by spatial filtering due to coupling and fiber propagation. Simulations permit to evaluate critical parameters, such as modulation formats, launching conditions, and operating temperature for global bandwidth and eye diagram optimization up to 10 Gbit/s. Simulation results are compared to measurements on prototype optoelectronic modules. VHDL-AMS model  In a 2004 study, in which Matthias Pez of D-Lightsys contributed, is presented a methodology based on VHDL-AMS modeling for taking into account the thermal effects of an optical emission module combined with electronic and optic behavior. The thermal transfer is due to the self-heating on one side and the interaction between the components of the other side. This methodology is implemented and simulated with ADVanceMS.

Fana described being ignored by security officials, when asked for security details when she scheduled public meetings, so much of her campaign revolved around inviting guests to her home. DiManno described Fana's concerns that her husband had been murdered by elements within Karzai's administration, who saw him as a potential candidate for president. DiManno quoted Fana on the difficulties Fana enoountered acting as high-profile woman who could serve as a role-model to other women: \\"These men don't even want me to practise as a doctor.

It is notable for being the first lens with an aperture of 2.8 and a focal length of 500mm. This combination allows very distant objects to be photographed at high shutter speeds in dimmer light, compared to other telephoto lenses. It also allows for very narrow depth-of- field and diffuse bokeh. The main markets for such long, fast lenses are wildlife and sports photographers. The lens is available in Canon, Nikon, and Sigma mounts. Due to the size and weight of the lens, there are some unusual usage considerations.

The game uses simple pixel art and 8-bit sound to replicate the style of 1980s arcade games. Expanded and improved versions of the game were later released for Macintosh, PC, and Linux under the titles Dino Run SE and Dino Run DX. Two additional games, Dino Run: Marathon Of Doom and Dino Run: Enter Planet D were released as stand-alone titles. Gameplay The object of the game is to escape a \\"wall of doom\\" also known as \\"the apocalypse\\" which resembles a pyroclastic surge.IGN: Dino Run Meteors strike the ground as the player runs from left to right through landscapes populated by panicking dinosaurs of many species. Success is achieved by reaching a \\"sanctuary\\" alive.The 12th Annual Independent Games Festival Along the way, the player can choose to collect eggs and devour bones for additional points and, in reaching milestones, to advance their dinosaur's individual evolution using accumulating \\"DNA\\" (enhancing attributes like jumping height, strength, rate of acceleration and top running speed). There are four levels of difficulty: easy, medium, hard, and insane. Throughout the challenge levels the player can collect \\"super eggs\\" which grant additional points and DNA. There are a total of 10 Super eggs that can be obtained. Originally, the game only featured a single Challenge game mode. Later versions featured a Speedrun mode, where the player was able to unlock numerous unique levels by exchanging bones collected during previous plays. In 2010, a new mode for the game was announced - Planet D, a set of \\"weird\\" levels, which are similar to the levels in the Challenge mode, but alter the physics of the game in various ways. Before the release of Dino Run DX (September 2015), the difficulty level for Planet D could not be changed. Later that same year (2010), a multiplayer mode was added. In 2013, upon the official release of Dino Run SE, the game became a commercial release. In July or August 2015, a new version entitled Dino Run DX, was released, along with the campaign for it in August 28, 2015 In September 2015, it was released on the Steam platform, and has received further updates, including a set of special Halloween-themed levels, freerun mode, being able to have 6 players in one multiplayer race, improved sprites, multicolored dino NPCs, and 60 new hats based on other indie games.http://www.pixeljam.com/dinorun/ Milestones When the player completes a certain milestone or goal, they receive awards of bones, DNA, and points for their stats, as well as a trophy. Trophies can be viewed in the awards section of the stats menu, and they come in three levels depending on the level of skill the trophy was achieved with: bronze, silver, and gold.  Reception  In the first three months following its release in the Steam marketplace, Dino Run DX was reported by Steam Spy to have accrued between 5,000 and 9,000 owners.

Johnson from 1965 to 1969 and was Johnson's chief speechwriter from 1966 to 1969. McPherson's A Political Education, 1972, is a classic insider's view of Washington and an essential source for Johnson's presidency. A prominent Washington lawyer and lobbyist since 1969, McPherson was awarded American Lawyer magazine's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008. He died February 16, 2012, in Bethesda, Maryland. Early life, education, military service McPherson was born and raised in Tyler, Texas. He attended Southern Methodist University and received his B.A. in 1949 from the University of the South. Intending to be a poet and a writer, he enrolled at Columbia University for a master's degree in English literature. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, however, he enlisted in the Air Force. McPherson served in Germany as an intelligence officer, studying Russian troop deployments and plotting targets. As soon as the Korean War ended, McPherson enrolled at the University of Texas School of Law. > This was the era when McCarthyism was at its peak. I was very upset about > Joe McCarthy and decided that I wanted to be a lawyer to defend people > against the likes of McCarthy. I was worried that he was going to usher a > period of totalitarianism in the United States. I wanted to fight that. He received his LL.B. in 1956. Shortly afterwards, he was invited to Washington by a cousin who worked for Lyndon Baines Johnson. Johnson, who was at the time the Senate majority leader, was seeking a young lawyer from Texas to work for the Democratic Policy Committee, which Johnson chaired. Early public service in Washington McPherson served as assistant general counsel (1956‚Äì1959), associate counsel (1959‚Äì1961) and general counsel (1961‚Äì1963) to the Democratic Policy Committee, the Democratic Party's key legislative policy organ on the Senate side. His duties included summarizing bills coming before the Senate for members of the Calendar Committee. An outspoken advocate for civil rights, he helped draft legislation that became the Civil Rights Act of 1957, whose goal was to ensure that all African Americans could exercise their right to vote. After Kennedy was elected with Johnson as his vice president, McPherson continued to serve as counsel to the Democratic Policy Committee under Senator Mike Mansfield. From 1963 to 1964, McPherson served as deputy under secretary of the Army for international affairs and special assistant to the secretary for civil functions. His responsibilities included settling civilian disputes in the Panama Canal Zone and Okinawa, and overseeing the Army Corps of Engineers. The following year (August 1964-August 1965) he served as assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which arranged for thousands of foreigners to study at American universities, for foreign officials and cultural groups to visit the United States, and for American orchestras and dance companies to travel abroad. Counsel to President Lyndon B. Johnson McPherson with President Johnson. Photo courtesy Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum. In August 1965, McPherson became special assistant and counsel to the president, and then special counsel to the president (1966‚Äì1969). McPherson was one of Johnson's most trusted advisers, influencing his support for equal employment and Medicare legislation. In Flawed Giant, his massive biography of Johnson, Robert Dallek notes: > Though he worked as the President's personal lawyer for the next two years, > he principally served as Johnson's top speech writer. An evocative writer > with a keen feel for Johnson's style of speaking and desire for terse, spare > prose that included \\"a little poetry\\" and some alliteration, McPherson > crafted all the President's major addresses beginning in the summer of > 1966.Flawed Giant pp. 297‚Äì8, citing Lichtenstein, ed., Political Profiles, > pp. 396‚Äì7. In 1966, McPherson and his colleague Berl Bernhard organized the White House Conference on Civil Rights, whose 2,400 participants included Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, and representatives of almost every major civil rights group. According to Kevin L. Yuill, \\"This conference, promised in Johnson's famous Howard University speech in 1965, was to be the high point of Johnson's already considerable efforts on civil rights.\\" McPherson came to believe the Vietnam War was unwinnable, and along with Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford helped persuade Johnson to scale back the bombing of North Vietnam. McPherson drafted Johnson's landmark televised address of March 31, 1968, announcing the policy turnaround in Vietnam as well as the fact that he would not seek reelection. McPherson's A Political Education, covering the years 1956 to 1969, concludes as follows: In a 1981 interview, McPherson called Johnson \\"a vehement, dominant, brilliant man ‚Äì not intellectually brilliant in the sense of having a vast store of reading and knowledge about world history, certainly not the historian that Harry Truman was. But brilliant in sheer wit, in sheer intellectual mental horsepower. The smartest man I ever saw.\\"http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:85e8db76e75ad84059609458c04355c5a5000f9b He reiterated this admiration in 1999: \\"To this day, Johnson is still the smartest man I've ever met, although maybe not the wisest.\\" Private law practice in Washington, D.C. Soon after Johnson left office, McPherson joined the Washington-based law firm Verner, Liipfert, and Bernhard, which he helped turn into one of the capital's best-known lobbying firms. (In 2002 the firm merged with DLA Piper.) McPherson has counseled businesses, nonprofit organizations, foreign governments, and individuals on a range of matters involving Congress, the executive branch, and regulatory agencies. Notable cases include: * Represented a major television network in the successful struggle to repeal the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules (the \\"fin-syn\\" rule), imposed by the FCC in 1970 and abolished in 1993, which prevented major television networks from owning any of the programming aired in primetime.http://www.ufoclawyers.com/harry_mcpherson/ * Brokered the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement in 1998 between Big Tobacco and 46 states, which gave tobacco companies some immunity from class action suits in exchange for limiting nicotine levels and paying antismoking groups about $250 billion. * Represented more than 2,500 Czech-Americans in obtaining compensation for assets seized by the Communist government of Czechoslovakia. McPherson has served on several presidential commissions. President Jimmy Carter appointed him to the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island (1979). President Ronald Reagan appointed him vice chairman of the United States Cultural and Trade Center Commission, which planned a facility in the Federal Triangle. Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton appointed him a member of the 1993 U.S. Base Realignment and Closure Commission. He has also been active in cultural, civic, and political organizations. From 1969 to 1974 he was a member of the board of trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Smithsonian Institution. He was on the Board of Directors of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1974 to 1977, and was chairman of the Democratic Advisory Council of Elected Officials Task Force on Democratic Policy (1974‚Äì76). After serving as vice-chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, he served from 1976 to 1991 as its general counsel. From 1983 to 1988 he was president of the Federal City Council, a civic organization of business, professional and cultural leaders in Washington. From 1992 to 1999, he served as president of the Economic Club of Washington. Recently McPherson helped the board of DLA Piper's international pro bono division institute a program that sends Northwestern University Law School professors to teach at Ethiopia's underfunded Addis Ababa University School of Law. McPherson married Clayton Reid in 1952; the couple had two children, Coco and Peter. He was divorced in 1981 and married in 1981 to Mary Patricia DeGroot, with whom he has a son, Samuel. Publications and awards A Political Education (originally published 1972) is McPherson's insider view of the nation's capital from 1956 to 1969. Anatole Broyard of The New York Times described the book as \\"fascinating to read\\" and McPherson as \\"refreshingly candid in both his praises and his criticisms.\\"Anatole Broyard, \\"Of Heroes and Horse Traders,\\" The New York Times, June 5, 1972. See also Ronnie Dugger, \\"A Political Education,\\" The New York Times, July 30, 1972. A Political Education has become a political classic and is considered essential reading for understanding of LBJ and the Johnson administration. It is frequently cited in two definitive biographies of Johnson, Caro's Master of the Senate and Dallek's Flawed Giant. McPherson is the author of numerous articles on foreign policy and political issues published in The New York Times, the Washington Post, and elsewhere. He served on the Editorial Advisory Board of Foreign Affairs and the Publications Committee of The Public Interest. In 1994, McPherson was recipient of the Judge Learned Hand Human Relations Award. In 2008, he was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by American Lawyer magazine.

Mystery Incorporated (2010-13) and Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters (2017‚Äì2018). Victor Cook is Executive Producer of Disney Junior's TOTS. Cook's other Disney credits include: Producer/Director for Lilo and Stitch the series and 101 Dalmatians the series, Director for Buzz Lightyear of Star Command,The Legend of Tarzan, Atlantis 2 and Mickey Mouse Club House. Victor started at Disney as a Storyboard Artist for Tail Spin, Darkwing Duck and Gargoyles among others shows. Cook was also Producer/Director of Scooby- Doo!Stage Fright (DVD movie), Supervising Producer/Director of Ben 10 Destroy All Aliens (CG made for TV movie), and Director of Director of Young Justice episode \\"Cold Hearted\\", Dante's Inferno (DVD) and 2007's Hellboy: Blood and Iron, the second of two Hellboy Animated films. The Spectacular Spider-Man Cook was called by Sony Entertainment to develop a DVD project about Spider- Man. Cook developed it with Greg Weisman, they wanted to base it on the early comic book publications of the character that showed him younger, which Cook had never seen done before in any adaption. The idea was reformatted to an animated television series, but they still kept a similar chronicle style where, as Cook describes, \\"each episode stands alone as its own story, but like the comic book itself it's a saga. Then each three episodes is a story and those three episodes are what would be on the DVD releases.\\" The original title for the series was The Amazing Spider-Man, based on the comic series of the same name, but by mid-2007 the name was changed to The Spectacular Spider- Man, as well a Spider-Man comic series. Cook wanted the animation to be squash and stretch style, and the action to be as good as the first two live action movies Sam Raimi, director of the Spider-Man films, as it had \\"set the bar\\" for the fluid movement for Spider-Man. As they were on a specific budget, they wanted to allow the animation to \\"move\\" more than anything, giving it simple and stylistic designs. He also looked back on Blood and Iron, which had a \\"fresh, young, look to it\\" that appealed to him visually. Cook wanted to make an \\"iconic\\" Spider-Man for both new and older generations and \\"really wanted this to be a two dimensional Spider-man that moved like we've never really seen him move in animation before.\\" The Spectacular Spider-Man became very successful in its first season on Kids WB! and entered its second season in America in 2009 on Disney XD. Subsequent works After The Spectacular Spider-Man, Cook moved onto Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated and Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters and Weisman on Young Justice for Cartoon Network and eventually the DC Universe streaming service. According to Weisman, the show's version of the character Artemis was partially based on Victor's daughter who is also Half Caucasian and Half Asian.

He played for Heart of Midlothian, Woolwich Arsenal, New Brompton, Queens Park Rangers and Liverpool, and made a total of 45 appearances in The Football League, scoring 17 goals.  Career  White signed for Heart of Midlothian on 30 May 1896 and made his debut for the club in a friendly on 17 August against Leith Athletic in which he also scored. He made his league debut a month later on 19 September against Dundee and went on to make a further 2 league appearances. He scored his only other goal for Hearts on his last appearance for the club in a friendly against Blackburn Rovers on 26 April 1897. He was then sold to Woolwich Arsenal, playing in the Second Division, on 1 July 1897 and made his debut and also scored on 1 September against Grismby Town. Across his 3-year stay at the club, White made 39 league appearances and scored 16 times, including a hat- trick against Newton Heath on 3 December 1898. After playing his last match for Arsenal on 4 March 1899 against Small Heath, White signed for New Brompton, who were playing in the Southern League Division One, and made 3 appearances in the remaining season. On 7 September, White signed for Scottish team West Calder, before then signing on 2 November for Queens Park Rangers, who had just turned professional and were playing in the Southern League. He was part of the team that beat Wolverhampton Wanderers, who were playing in the First Division, 1-0 in the FA Cup in a first round replay on 31 January 1900. On 30 May 1901, White signed for Liverpool, but was ineligible to play until 1 September. He made his debut on 14 September against rivals Everton and he scored in the second minute, becoming the first Liverpool player to score on his debut in the Merseyside derby. This was a feat that was not matched until 117 years later, when Virgil van Dijk scored on 5 January 2018. White went on to make a further 5 appearances for Liverpool. White left Liverpool at the end of the season and signed for Dundee on 9 July 1902. On 2 May, he signed for Middlesbrough after initially wanting to sign for a London club. He made his debut in a 4-1 loss to Sheffield Wednesday on 5 September 1903 and went on to make a further 6 league appearances. White then signed for Aberdeen on 2 May 1904; however, this was then voided by the Scottish Football Association.

He served as president of the Mattachine Society and in the 1950s, was one of the first gay activists to speak publicly on television. Call founded printing presses for LGBT publications and later opened gay adult shops and pornographic film screening venues. He received a Purple Heart for his service in the Pacific War.  Early life and education  Born and raised in Grundy County, Missouri, Call enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1935 on a scholarship. He studied journalism. Call enlisted in the United States Army in June 1941 as a private. He was promoted to sergeant within the year and, after completing Officer Candidate School, was promoted to lieutenant. He saw combat in the Pacific War, where he was wounded and received the Purple Heart. Returning to the United States in 1945, Call left the army at the rank of captain and returned to the University of Missouri to complete his journalism degree.Bullough, p. 152  Career and activism  After graduating, Call worked for several news outlets, including the Kansas City Star. In August 1952, while working for the Star, Call was arrested for \\"lewd conduct\\" and paid an $800 bribe to have the charges dismissed. Call resigned his job and he and his lover Jack moved to San Francisco.Bullough, p. 154 With his arrival in the city, Call became involved with the Mattachine Society, the first sustained gay rights group in the United States. Following the resignations of the original leadership in 1953, Call became president of the Society.Loughery, pp. 228‚Äì29 Call frequently appeared on local television programs in the 1950s, as one of the few openly gay men who spoke about gay issues, and appeared both in The Rejected, the first-ever television documentary on homosexuality,Casta√±eda, et al., p. 259 and \\"CBS Reports: The Homosexuals\\", the first network broadcast on the subject. In 1955 Call co- founded Pan Graphic Press, which printed The Mattachine Review, The Ladder and other homophile publications. He also founded Dorian Book Service, a gay and lesbian literature clearinghouse.Bullough, p. 155 With the liberalization of obscenity laws beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Call began marketing gay erotica through the Adonis Bookstore, the first gay adult shop in San Francisco. He later expanded the business to include peep shows, eventually opening the Circle J club as a venue for screening pornographic films and hosting \\"circle jerk\\" parties. Call also began filming pornographic \\"loops\\" of men masturbating on a gold couch in his office. These Gold Couch Capers became collector's items. The June 1964 Paul Welch Life article entitled \\"Homosexuality In America\\" was the first time a national publication reported on gay issues; Life 's photographer was referred to the gay leather bar in San Francisco called the Tool Box for the article by Call, who had long worked to dispel the myth that all homosexual men were effeminate. The article opened with a two-page spread of the mural of life size leathermen in the bar, which had been painted by Chuck Arnett in 1962. The article described San Francisco as \\"The Gay Capital of America\\" and inspired many gay leathermen to move there. Call died of congestive heart failure in San Francisco on December 18, 2000, at the age of 83. He was survived by three brothers who did not approve of him.

Adolf Kr√∂ssing (5 January 1848 ‚Äì 28 January 1933) was a German Bohemian operatic tenor, stage director, and actor of both the stage and film. Possessing a smaller voice, Kr√∂ssing impressed audiences not with his vocal prowess but with his dramatic gifts. A master of improvisation and comic timing, he excelled in character roles. He is particularly remembered for creating roles in several world premieres by Bed≈ôich Smetana and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. Biography Kr√∂ssing was born in Prague, the son of a German father and a French mother. He was brought up in an entirely German environment, being schooled by German tutors and speaking primarily German at home. His father wanted Kr√∂ssing to become a lawyer, but his own proclivities lay towards the theatre. Under the advice of a friend, he began taking singing lessons with Franti≈°ek Vogl in Prague. Shortly thereafter he began appearing in stage plays in that city. Kr√∂ssing made his first singing appearances in concerts at the Pilsen Theatre. His performances attracted the attention of Franti≈°ek Saak, the director of the Provisional Theatre in Prague. Saak offered him an opera contract and in December 1870 Kr√∂ssing made his professional opera debut in Gaetano Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia. In September of that same year he played Wenzel in the premiere of the final version of Bed≈ôich Smetana's opera The Bartered Bride, a role which he would repeat often throughout his career. His portrayal in this production impressed Smetana, and Kr√∂ssing was soon invited to join his group of artists that would later be established at the Prague National Theatre. Kr√∂ssing performed with Smetana's group of artists at the Nov√© ƒåesk√© Divadlo (New Czech Theatre) up until 1881 when the National Theatre opened. He continued to appear at that house in operas, operettas, plays, and even the occasional ballet up until 1914. While there he portrayed over 300 roles, both large and small, in well over 4,000 performances. He was also active as a stage director for plays and operas at the theatre from 1890 until his retirement. Kr√∂ssing notably appeared in several world premieres during his career. He sang in two premieres of operas by Smetana, singing Sk≈ôiv√°nek in The Secret (1878) and Mich«élek in The Devil's Wall (1882). He also sang in the premiers of five operas by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k; the roles of Jean in The Cunning Peasant (1878), Ton√≠k in The Stubborn Lovers (1881), Benda in The Jacobin (1889), the Gamekeeper in Rusalka (1901), and Sven in Armida (1904). He also portrayed the role of Adam Ecl in the first production of Karel Kovarovic's The Dogheads on 24 April 1898. In his advanced age, Kr√∂ssing performed in five Czech silent films. His first role was of one of his signature stage roles, Wenzel in The Bartered Bride, for a silent film version of the opera. He also worked as a voice teacher both during his opera career and after. His most famous pupil was soprano R≈Ø≈æena Maturov√°. By his early 80s, Kr√∂ssing was seriously ill with a severe case of diabetes. The disease caused his death in 1933 at the age of 85. He is buried at the Vy≈°ehrad cemetery in Prague.

Catalytic hydrogenation Catalytic hydrogenation can be used to reduce amides to amines; however, the process often requires high hydrogenation pressures and reaction temperatures to be effective (i.e. often requiring pressures above 197 atm and temperatures exceeding 200 ¬∞C). Selective catalysts for the reaction include Copper chromite, Rhenium trioxide, and Rhenium(VII) oxide. Non-catalytic routes to amines Reducing agents able to affect this reaction include metal hydrides such as lithium aluminium hydride, or lithium borohydride in mixed solvents of tetrahydrofuran and methanol, :Reduction of amides to amines Non-catalytic routes to aldehydes N,N-disubstituted amides can be reduced to aldehydes by using an excess of the amide: :R(CO)NRR' + LiAlH4 ‚Üí RCHO + HNRR' With further reduction the alcohol is obtained.

While working in housing and road construction to support himself, he studied for a degree in Middle-Eastern studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Career For a period, he lived amongst Bedouins near Amman, Bet She'an, and Kuneitra in order to learn their lifestyle. Part of his motivation for this endeavor was to understand why many of the ancient Kings of Israel were originally shepherds. During this period he wore traditional Bedouin clothing and went by the name Aziz Effendi. During the 1929 Palestine riots and the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, he was an active member of the Haganah Jerusalem. Later he also took part in the Aliyah Bet. In 1932 he participated in one of the first movies made about the Jewish Yishuv in Palestine, called \\"Sabra\\", directed by Aleksander Ford. In 1939, he married Dorothy Kahn, an American journalist who fell in love with the Land of Israel, and the two moved to the Blumenfeld house in Moshav Merhavia. She died in 1950 at age 43.

Etymology The province (formerly a historical region) shared its name with the Khatagin Turco-Mongol tribal of that area. Historian William Maley stated that the removal of the term \\"Qataghan\\" upon the division of the area was part of a deliberate process to remove ethnic identities from administrative names, drawing a comparison with the division and renaming of Hazarajat, homeland of the ethnic Hazara people.

He was the son of the mathematician Jacques Mathon de la Cour (1712‚Äì1777). He wrote distinguished works such as L'√âtat des finances de la France (\\"The state of French finances\\", 1758), the Lettres sur les peintures, sculptures et gravures expos√©es au salon du Louvre (\\"Letters discussing the paintings, sculptures and engravings exhibited at the Louvre\\", Paris, 1763‚Äì1767, 3 vol. duodecimo), L'Op√©ra d'Orph√©e et d'Eurydice (\\"The opera Orph√©e et Eurydice\\", 1765) as well as Dissertations and Discours such as Discours sur les meilleurs moyens de faire na√Ætre et d'encourager la patriotisme dans une monarchie (\\"Essay on the best methods of kindling and fostering patriotism in a monarchy\\", Paris: Cuchet et Gatty, 1788, octavo), etc. He took an interest in charitable works and created the Soci√©t√© Philanthropique de Lyon. In the 1760s he considered starting a music journal called Le Rossignol, but instead helped Sautreau de Marsy with his Almanach des Muses (\\"Almanac of the Muses\\"), and in 1773 briefly edited Nicolas Framery's Journal de musique. He founded the Journal de Lyon in 1784 (12 vol. octavo). Mathon de la Cour's generosity and distinction could not protect him during the Revolution; after the siege of Lyon he was guillotined. Fortun√© Ricard In 1785 he caught the attention of Benjamin Franklin, whom he greatly admired, with his friendly parody of Poor Richard, Testament de M. Fortun√© Ricard (\\"Last Will and Testament of Fortunate Richard\\"), in which the main character leaves five lots of 100 livres in his will on the condition that each be allowed to compound for 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 years, the resulting billions and trillions of livres then to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects. Amused, Franklin responded by leaving ¬£1,000 ($4,444) to each of Boston and Philadelphia on the condition that the money be cautiously lent at 5% interest to young men finishing their apprenticeships and continue to gather interest for no fewer than 100 years. He estimated that after a century each fund would total ¬£131,000 ($582,000), and that ¬£100,000 of each could then be spent on public works that he specified in detail. The remaining ¬£31,000 could then be reinvested for another 100 years, by which time it would, he thought, be worth ¬£4,061,000. Of this three million would be left to the government and the rest distributed among the city's inhabitants. In fact in July 1891 the Philadelphia fund was $90,000 and the Boston fund was $391,000; by that time, the assumptions of the will were very out-of-date and the public works he had described had already been completed.Carl Van Doren. Benjamin Franklin. Garden City Publishing, 1941. Page 762. Nevertheless, despite an attempt by several of Franklin's heirs to obtain the money in 1890,\\"Franklin's will in court.\\" The New York Times. 30 September 1890. The suitor was Albert D.

Biography Early life  Kinahan Cornwallis early life not well-documented. Biographers have unquestionably accepted Cornwallis' writings as factual when they are questionable at best. A volume titled My Life and Adventuires; An Autobiography is a work of fiction. He appears to have been born in London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and attended school in Liverpool. He states that he had studied for the ministry and medicine before leaving England for Australia. On his arrival in Melbourne, Australia in 1853 he sought employment as a clerk in a mercantile house and by July had been named as a customs clerk in the colonial government. He later claimed continued employment in the British Colonial Civil Service but this is doubtful. Cornwallis spent two years in Australia and claimed to have visited the Philippines, Singapore, Ceylon, Egypt, Japan, Africa, South America, Canada, and the United States over the next five years but these claims are suspect. Books in 1858 and 1859 on travels to British Columbia and Japan have been shown to have been largely plagiarized and there is doubt that he visited either country. He was back in England in 1856. Writing career His first published work was Yarra Yarra or Tales of a Traveller, a lengthy poetry work which appeared in England under his true name in 1856 and which received largely negative reviews both in England and in Australia. Later editions of this volume and all his subsequent writings bore the name Kinahan Cornwallis which he used for the remainder of his life. Between 1857 and 1862 he produced four novels, several of which appeared in multi volumes. These included Howard Plunkett, or Adrift in Life, The Crossticks; or, A Medley in the Gittens Family, Wreck and Ruin: or, Modern Society and Pilgrims of Fashion : A Novel. During the same period he also wrote a series of travel accounts detailing visits to Australia, South America, Japan and other countries. These received kinder reviews but some critics voiced suspicion that the accounts of his activities were embellished with material from other writers or were simply made up. In 1860 Cornwallis worked as a correspondent for the New York Herald covering the visit of the Prince of Wales to North America for the newspaper. The accounts were gathered and released as Royalty in the New World; or The Prince of Wales in America. This work features full descriptions of the principal cities and towns, and chief natural features of British North America and the United States, together with accurate geographical and statistical information respecting the country generally, and a traveller's reflections upon the manners and customs of the people. On 16 November, the New York Herald included the following: \\"We are glad that Mr. Cornwallis, who accompanied the royal party throughout their tour, is about to supply a popular want, by the publication of a complete narrative of the royal progress. We feel assured that no one is more capable, both from literary talent and personal observation, of doing entire justice to the subject as a matter of history, and of producing a lively, agreeable, and entertaining book withal, than the gentleman to whom we refer. And there is no doubt the work will prove a pleasant souvenir of the New World travels of the eldest son of Queen Victoria, and have a large circulation not only in this country but on the other side of the Atlantic, where it is announced to appear simultaneously with the American edition.\\" Cornwallis continued to work for the Herald for about nine years. At the same time he was noted as editor of the Knickerbocker Monthly and after leaving the Herald, he became owner of the Knickerbocker Magazine and the Albion. In 1886, he assumed control of the Wall Street Daily Investigator, later the Wall Street Daily Investor. In 1862 Cornwallis had been admitted to the New York bar and from then until his death he practiced law in addition to his editorial activities. He was the author of legal treatises on contempt of court and international law. In the 1890s he returned to the writing of poetry and novels but without distinction. At the time of his death his he was regarded as a prominent lawyer with little mention of his literary output. Personal life Kinahan Cornwallis was father to Kinahan Cornwallis, the diplomat.

R√©csey countersigned his own appointment, neglecting the Diet of Hungary. He resigned when an uprising broke out in Vienna in the effects of the Hungarian Revolution. He was the only Hungarian Prime Minister, who was born in the 18th century. Biography Military career √Åd√°m R√©csey de R√©cse was born into a Transylvanian noble family in S√°rd (today »òard, part of Ighiu in Romania) on 10 February 1775 to J√≥zsef R√©csey and Erzs√©bet Kapronczai. He entered the Imperial Army as a cadet in 1789, and participated in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars against France. Inter alia, he fought in the battles of Dresden, Kulm and Leipzig in 1813. For his service and loyalty, he was created Baron by Emperor- King Francis I of Austria. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, he was promoted to Colonel within the Imperial Army and was also awarded the highest order for Habsburg imperial soldiers, the Military Order of Maria Theresia. He was appointed commander of a brigade in Italy in 1820, holding the rank Major General. He was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1831 and became a Division Commander in the Italian Peninsula. In 1839, he was ordered to transfer to Galicia, commanding Austrian forces there. R√©csey was promoted to Feldzeugmeister in 1846 and was appointed Vice-Captain of the Hungarian Noble Guard. Revolution of 1848 During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, R√©csey remained a loyal supporter of the imperial court at Vienna. On 1 October 1848, Austrian Minister-President Johann von Wessenberg-Ampringen, negotiating with Hungarian Prime Minister Lajos Batthy√°ny, tried unsuccessfully to reach the appointment of R√©csey as Minister besides the King (i.e. Foreign Minister) in the Hungarian cabinet. Following the resignation of Batthy√°ny, Ferdinand V appointed R√©csey as Prime Minister in an unconstitutional manner on 3 October, neglecting Lajos Kossuth's Committee of National Defence (OHB), which took the role of government after the dissolution of the Batthy√°ny cabinet. Some argue that R√©csey reluctantly accepted the position in return of the forgiveness of his massive debt of 16 thousand forints towards the Austrian royal court. As \\"Prime Minister\\", R√©csey countersigned his own appointment and Ferdinand's imperial rescript to dissolve the Hungarian Diet, to place Hungary under martial law and to appoint Josip Jelaƒçiƒá as Military and Civic Imperial Commissioner in Hungary. On 5 October, R√©csey, resided in Vienna, sent a document to the Hungarian Diet, in which he notified MPs to take the role of head of government and also sent Ferdinand's manifesto. However, the Vienna Uprising broke out on 6 October, when the crowd rebelled against the imperial family, and Ferdinand fled with his court to Olm√ºtz (now Olomouc, Czech Republic) on 7 October. R√©csey immediately resigned from his position on that day. The Hungarian Diet decided to launch a lawsuit against R√©csey at the plenary session of 7‚Äì9 October.

(1980) Murat Halstead and the Cincinnati Commercial. Boca Raton: University Presses of Florida. He was a war correspondent during three wars. Biography Born in Paddy's Run (now Shandon), Ohio, in Butler County, Ohio, he was the son of Griffin Halstead, a farmer. With his mother's help, he was a reader by the time he was four, and during his boyhood read works such as Plutarch's Lives, Josephus, Revolutions in Europe and Charles Rollin's Ancient History. He spent the summers on his father's farm and the winters in school until he was nineteen years old, and, after teaching for a few months, in 1848 entered Farmer's College, near Cincinnati, where he graduated in 1851. He then decided to study law. He had begun writing for newspapers when he was 18, writing for The Hamilton Intelligencer and The Roseville Democrat, two Butler Country papers. While a student near Cincinnati, he contributed to the Commercial and especially to the literary department of the Gazette. After leaving college, he became connected with the Cincinnati Atlas, and then with the Enquirer. He afterward established a Sunday newspaper in Cincinnati, and from 1852‚Äì1853 worked on the Columbian and Great West, a weekly. He began work on the Commercial on March 8, 1853, as a local reporter, and soon became news editor. The following year, he acquired a pecuniary interest in the paper, which began rapidly to increase in circulation and influence. He personally reported several battles during the Civil War. He was also a war correspondent for the Franco-Prussian War, where he sided emphatically with the Germans. In 1867, he acquired a controlling interest in the Commercial. After pursuing for a time a course of independent journalism, he allied himself with the Republican Party. The Cincinnati Gazette was consolidated with his paper in 1883, and he became president of the company that published the combined journal under the name of the Commercial Gazette, also a recognized organ of the Republicans. In 1890, he moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he edited the Standard Union, though he continued to write for the Commercial Gazette. President Benjamin Harrison nominated him for Minister to Germany, but the nomination was rejected by the Senate, perhaps due to editorials he had written accusing some senators of purchasing their seats. At the start of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he became a war correspondent and went to the Philippines. His later years he spent writing books, mainly biographies, and contributing articles to magazines. He died in Cincinnati, being survived by his wife and nine children. His son Marshall, at one time United States consul in Birmingham, England, predeceased him.

Biography and writing Robert Sullivan is of MƒÅori and Irish Galway descent. He belongs to the MƒÅori tribes NgƒÅ Puhi (NgƒÅti Manu/NgƒÅti Hau) as well as to KƒÅi Tahu and describes himself as multicultural. He graduated from the University of Auckland with a PhD and worked as Associate Professor of English and Director of the Creative Writing Programme at the University of Hawai'i.Green, P., and Ricketts, H., 99 Ways into New Zealand Poetry, Vintage, 2010. Sullivan led until recently the creative writing programme at the Manukau Institute of Technology before becoming the Deputy Chief Executive MƒÅori there from 2018-2020. Robert Sullivan's nine books include the bestselling Star Waka, reprinted five times and shortlisted in 2000 for the Montana New Zealand Book Awards. Maui: Legends of the Outcast, illustrated by Chris Slane, the first New Zealand graphic novel, was shortlisted for the LIANZA Russell Clark Medal. His book-length poem Captain Cook in the Underworld was long-listed for the Montana New Zealand Book Awards in the Poetry Category. It is also the libretto for an oratorio by noted composer John Psathas which has been performed at the Wellington and Auckland Town Halls by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and the Orpheus Choir of Wellington. His first collection, Jazz Waiata, won the PEN (NZ) Best First Book Award, and his children's retelling of MƒÅori myths and legends, Weaving Earth and Sky, illustrated by Gavin Bishop, won the non-fiction category and was Children's Book of the Year in the 2003 New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards. The Polynesian poetry anthology he coedited, Whetu Moana, won the reference and anthology category in the 2004 Montana New Zealand Book Awards. The MƒÅori poetry anthology he coedited, Puna Wai K≈çrero, won the 2015 Creative Writing category in the NgƒÅ Kupu Ora MƒÅori Book Awards{{Cite web|url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/nga-kupu-ora-aotearoa-maori- book-awards/} His wide ranging work explores dimensions of MƒÅori tradition as well as \\"contemporary urban experiences, including local racial and social concerns.\\" His writing has a post modern feel and shows acute awareness of important Aotearoa/New Zealand issues while linking them in a complex way back to the cultural past.JENSEN, K. ‚ÄûSullivan, Robert.‚Äú The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature. R. Robinson & N. Wattie (Hg.). Melbourne: Oxford UP, 1998, 519. In the poetic narrative Star Waka (1999) for example, Sullivan employs traditional MƒÅori story-telling techniques (oral tradition) in order to link contemporary and traditional topics from Aotearoa/New Zealand with concepts and ideas from a European background. This approach allows him to study the identity relation between MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ within transcultural themes of voyaging, personal and national, of the poet and of MƒÅori. In a sense, the poems in Star Waka \\"themselves function like a waka.\\" \\"Star Waka\\" was \\"lauded for its poetic flair\\". He is \\"widely seen as one of the most important contemporary MƒÅori poets.\\"\\"SULLIVAN, R.‚Äú Cambridge Guide to Literature in English. D. HEAD (Hg.). Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2006, 1078. Writing style Robert Sullivan's Shout Ha! is heralded as a stunning symphony of love, politics, tenderness, confession, sharpness and insight which should be in every New Zealand school library as it accounts for the history and politics of the country. Sullivan uses a wide-ranging voice who makes complex content, simple in execution. His book Cassino City of Martyrs, in part is a song for Sullivan's grandfather who fought in Italy. Cassino is inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy with its various descents, ascents, spirals and authorial intrusions. Like Dante, Sullivan brings together life on many levels - from the personal to the cultural, from the political to the emotional. Like the Italian poet, he favours a cheeky vernacular as well as an elegant phrasing. Sullivan draws upon his own loves and losses in a way that refreshes our engagement with all things human.\\"2011. Poetry Reviews: Fossicking in the past\\".

Design Pegasus Plaza, looking northwest The overall Main Street redevelopment project was created by a consortium of architects and engineers led by Good Fulton & Farrell Architects, the Slaney/Santana Group and Cardenas-Salcedo and Associates. Artist Brad Goldberg was responsible for the design of the Pegasus Plaza itself. Although the plaza sits in the shadow of the 50-year-old namesake neon sculpture atop the Magnolia Building, the idea for the plaza and its crowning jewel heavily references Greek mythology. The design retells the story of when the warrior Perseus slew the serpent-haired monster Medusa and Pegasus sprang from her severed head. He stamped the earth with his hoof, creating the Fountain of the Muses. A limestone fountain and winding stream anchor the design of the plaza. The fountain is connected to a natural mineral spring below the Magnolia Building and is the source well for water in the plaza.

Up until 2010, the poem was studied by English school children as part of the GCSE AQA Anthology. Description The poem describes four people stuck at traffic lights in downtown San Francisco - two are garbage collectors and two are an elegant couple in a Mercedes. The poem is about the contrast between these people and the gap that is developing between the rich and poor even in the USA which is meant to be a 'democracy'. The description of the couple as \\"Beautiful People\\" is perhaps ironic as the term was first used to describe those had held countercultural ideals during the 1960s. The poem questions whether America can be called a Russian scam given the disparities in wealth between those, rich and poor.

If an individual requires further education to progress within their firm that is difficult to obtain for any reason, this can result in the occupation being classified as a dead-end position. Based on human resources and career strategist Toni Howard Lowe, some individuals who have worked for the same company for several years may not be privy to the signs that they are currently employed in a dead-end job.  Possible indicators   Within a large company as a subordinate  * Lacking any passion or feeling no challenge in the daily activities of a job, which compromises job performance and efficiency due to a lack of motivation. * Being hampered by the presence of a glass ceiling that prohibits advancement in a firm. * Not being able to visualize any opportunities for growth in a current position. * Working at a firm in financial distress. * The responsibilities of the position have not changed within the last three years. * One is not actively chosen for high-profile projects, committees, and is passed over for a promotion or has experienced a demotion in your title. * The strategic direction of the company has changed and, in turn, one's function within the firm has been minimized or phased out. * The relationships with management and fellow co-workers are continuously deteriorating, regardless of attempts to rectify the scarred relationships. * There is much turnover in one's position. * Complaints of job dissatisfaction within the firm fall on deaf ears. * There is risk of one's occupation being made obsolete by automation.  Within a small firm  A dead-end job is not only experienced on a subordinate level within a large firm but can also be experienced as an entrepreneur overseeing their own establishment. When a company is created by an individual, it is started with high expectations, good intentions and a personal set of priorities. Initiating a thorough analysis biannually of one's current position within their career can help detect if their firm itself is a dead-end job or is experiencing career lag. Some questions to assist with this detection of a dead-end career include: * Does the material you currently work on align with the matters you worked on when you began your company/position? * Has the material or topics grown in complexity as you gained more experience within your field and can you predict their complexity in the short term? * Do they match your preference on complexity based on your current experience level? * How do your clients and customers perceive your business and what improvements could be made to adjust any negative experiences? * Are you working with the expected clientele and specific industries that you envisioned? * Have you created a system of support consisting of staff and procedures that complement your working habits? * Are you always putting out fires? Or do activities proceed smoothly? * Does your business interfere with your personal life to the point where you are experiencing regret or unhappiness?  Examples   Occupations   Miscellaneous occupations  Dead-end work is usually regarded as unskilled and the phrase usually applies to those working as shelf stackers, cleaners, call center agents, clerks, or in other menial jobs where the pay is low, and the hours are long. Furthermore, positions not regarded as menial may nonetheless qualify as dead- end jobs and forms of underemployment. A specialized employee working in a small firm in an underdeveloped local market, for example, might have few opportunities for advancement within the company while simultaneously facing a dearth of opportunities outside it. Most dead-end jobs offer little to no transferable skills and may \\"trap\\" workers. Dead-end jobs such as an internal auditing position within a firm, according to CFO.com, should only be considered and accepted if an individual has a pre-calculated exit strategy so that one is not stuck permanently within a position of no opportunities. Law librarians and individuals who join firms that are enlisted into estate or trust work consist of low paying occupations which translate to dead-end jobs with no opportunities of growth. Few fast-food franchise employees receive any type of work benefits and their wages are so low that they are unable to make enough income to supply themselves with life's basic necessities, especially if they are employed part-time. Part-time employees often need to work two to three jobs to make ends meet or require government assistance in the form of food stamps at the expense of other taxpayers to live. Most of these fast-food positions are considered dead-end jobs because of the traits listed above, in addition to the lack of opportunities within the fast-food realm, and the inability to organize to improve their working conditions. Presently, any positive modification to the wages and benefits for low paid fast-food employees to make the occupation more appealing could signal a movement consisting of a mass firing of employees in favor of kiosks and robots. As Andrew Puzder, former CEO of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, stated: \\"Robots and kiosks are always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case.\\" Dead-end jobs are not limited to menial labor, retail or fast food roles. Professional positions in call centers, loss-mitigation underwriting, administrative and clerical work may offer almost no advancement potential.  Medical field occupations  A survey was conducted in Scotland to obtain feedback on issues regarding education and professional topics. The results revealed that only one out of 25 Registered Mental Nurses (RMNs) would recommend other individuals in pursuing their profession. Over half of the participants in the survey mentioned that they have reached their career's highest level. Additionally, 'reprofiling exercises' and skill mix activities conducted within this profession has led to a decrease of registered nurses within the industry. 66% of the respondents also stated that their organizations provide no opportunities to grow despite being interested in progressing within their career. One out of six participants exclaimed that the position of a Register Mental Nurse is a dead-end job due to the reasons above in addition to there being no clear direction for their career path. Because of these downfalls, nurses who have reached their highest capacity demonstrate more signs of despondency about their career path compared to their counterparts employed at lower increments. A job residing within the realm of medical inspection is also considered a dead-end job. There is an absence of progression in the areas of status, responsibilities, and salary for this current field of work. SMOs or School Medical Officers have experienced dissatisfaction with the lack of progression as described above, in addition to the redundancy of work-related activities. The responsibility of medical inspection of school children encompasses mainly of the routine inspection of a large population of children and presents very little to no feature of the greater interest in medicine. The starting salary of these workers is low and inadequate, and they are not supplemented with any substantial raises to compensate their low starting salaries. Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), also known as Long-term care workers, represent the frontline workers who assist individuals with disabilities with instrumental activities such as using the phone and daily activities such as bathing or eating. It is a challenge to recruit them and retain them as employees. According to the American Health Care Association, in 2002, there was a turnover rate for this occupation in nursing homes of 71% per year. CNAs earned a median hourly wage of only $10.04 in 2004 which is slightly higher than other occupations such as grocery cashiers ($7.90 in 2004) and fast food cooks ($7.07 in 2004). They also receive very few fringe benefits. Approximately 16% of CNAs do not have health insurance provided by their firms. Inadequate training provided to the CNAs in addition to low levels of education also can affect job tenure within their position, causing a lack of opportunities to grow and learn new material. Because of the reasons above, the position of CNA is also considered a dead-end occupation.  Temporary employment/short-term contracts  In Europe, temporary employment is utilized frequently and represents the heart of political and economic debates. These temporary contracts and job positions allow an increase in labor market flexibility and providing employers with the ability to dodge strict government regulations regarding the firing and hiring of employees as well as avoid regulations concerning fringe and pay benefits. Previous research confirmed that a wage penalty existed with the utilization of fixed- term contracts. This wage penalty was applied to young workers entering an occupation with low human capital investments and lasted for the first few years of employment but could lead to a pay off if the worker is viewed as highly productive in their occupation when pursuing a permanent contract. This is known as the learning effect and can be quite large. This form of contract can be a considered a dead-end job if the worker is unable to meet the demands necessary by the employer or company. A study was performed within the United Kingdom and Germany on the topic of temporary employment conducted by fixed- term contracts. The study indicated that for fixed-term contracts, some jobs consisting of a fixed-term contract can lead to permanent employment with good benefits and exist as a stepping stone, while others lead employees within a series of different fixed-term contracts and positions with little room for improvement which, in essence, is another form of a dead-end job. In countries such as Italy, Spain, and France, there is a dramatic increase of temporary positions and short-term contracts due to the benefit of being able to lay off temporary employees without restrictions or incurring statutory redundancy payments. Because of this, the number of temporary workers within the workforce has doubled between the years of 1985 and 1997. Temporary jobs do come at a cost. There is concern about lack of opportunities for career advancement for temporary workers in addition to the quality of these types of occupations. Case study information has been discovered confirming that employer enthusiasm within the workplace has decreased due to the utilization of temporary jobs with dead-end characteristics which resulted in low levels of motivation and retention of such employees within a firm. A study was conducted by Alison L. Booth, Marco Francesconi and Jeff Frank which concluded that individuals participating in seasonal, casual or fixed-term employment report that they have not received the work-related training necessary for the occupation and experience lower levels of job satisfaction in comparison to permanent ones. The study concluded that there is evidence that temporary jobs can be a stepping stone to a permanent job within a firm. The median time within a temporary position before such a switch is between 18 months and 3 and a half years and depends upon the gender of the individual and the type of contract (whether it is a fixed-term or seasonal contract). Seasonal/casual positions yield very little chance of obtaining a permanent position and can be categorized as dead-end positions. Fixed-term contracts have a larger potential of being transitioned into a permanent one, however, males suffer a permanent earning loss during the transition in comparison to males who started in a permanent position from the beginning. Females, however, within a fixed-term position fully catch up to the wages of their permanent position counterparts. History Since the 1970s, occupations within many industrialized nations such as the United States have become less secure. As the traditional job hierarchies within a firm deteriorate and companies downsize due to unexpected circumstances such as a recession, or employer changes both involuntary and voluntary, the reduction in security in firms become more frequent. Instead of residing under one employer and being promoted within the one company, employees are climbing the corporate ladder by switching between employers. Because of this, many employees cannot expect to reside within the same firm for the next 15 to 20 years. Based on research results conducted by Anne-Kathrin Kronberg within the Emory University, the externalization of job mobility affects gender disparities depending upon whether individuals work in bad or good occupations in addition to whether they leave their firms voluntary or not. If an individual leaves a job voluntarily, then the gender gap closes the fastest within a benign occupation, while a dead-end job has stagnant results. If a worker leaves a job involuntarily, gender disparities run narrow within bad jobs. For good jobs, the gender gap closes initially but opens again swiftly in the 1990s. The study's definition of \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" was whether the occupation provided pension plans and health insurance to their employees in addition to whether the individual's earnings were above the federal poverty threshold of 120 percent. Before 1990, individuals with disabilities were subject to discrimination by being denied equal job opportunities, companies failing to provide such individuals with reasonable accommodations, being assigned to dead-end classified occupations and underutilization as a whole. The phrase an \\"individual with a disability\\" references a person who has either a mental or physical impairment that severely limits the ability to perform one or several major life activities, or is regarded to have or has had a record of an impairment or disability. On July 26, 1992, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) was implemented and took effect to assist individuals with disabilities by eliminating such employment barriers so that they could fully participate in society and receive the same job opportunities that any other individual would receive. Psychological effects One possible side effect of being stationed in a dead-end job for too long is the feeling of a lack of motivation and boredom. These characteristics often cause an individual to spread negative vibes to other co-workers which, in turn, can create problems within the workplace. The negative vibes can lead to an individual becoming short-tempered, replacing the patience that the worker once had when first starting the position. The lack of motivation experienced by individuals within a dead-end job can lead to discouragement in the direction of their career path and can cause their level of performance to suffer by either taking longer to complete a certain activity or task and/or making more mistakes than usual due to a lack of concentration. All of these characteristics can lead an individual to an occupational crisis state. Occupational crisis consists of an individual demonstrating a state of mixed negative thoughts and emotions consisting mainly of work-related anxiety and frustration, feelings of reaching a dead-end within their career, negative interpersonal relationships and experiences within the workplace, and the consistent consideration of a career change due to making previous incorrect job choices. The Occupational Crisis Scale was created to assist employees in identifying whether they were in a dead-end in their career. Three studies were performed to confirm the validity of the Occupational Crisis Scale with an assorted number of Finnish workers (53% of them female) in various occupations such as police officers, firemen, private caretakers, labor welfare advisors and nurses. 58% of individuals were ranked within the occupation crisis state based on this study and a preliminary study amongst vocation counseling clients. To remedy these psychological issues stemming from dead-end jobs and their related work stress, vocational help can be obtained so that problems do not continue to escalate or accumulate. For some individuals, more time may be needed to consider what they desire in their work life and the utilization of occasional sick time, education or vacation could help remedy their occupational crisis state. For other workers, it may require a change in their work tasks, occupation within their firm, or a completely different job for them to experience a more satisfying life. Vocational help can also assist workers with developing better coping skills which aid the individuals in handling their stresses and anxieties in all facets of life. No job necessarily has to be a dead-end completely. There are various routes and detours that an individual can proceed with, whether it be making the most of what is available, utilizing vocational help, or learning new skills such as coping skills or worked related ones, these actions can help advancing in the current occupation or achieving a new one in a different firm. no.

This mushroom can be distinguished by a white cap that bruises pinkish-red when injured, a scaly lower stipe, and a conifer habitat. Similar to Agaricus californicus and A. xanthodermus, the cap discolors brown in age. A distinguishing feature of A. californicus and A. xanthodermus, however, is a thickened annulus at the margin, a phenolic odor, and a yellowing bruise, instead of red. In the case of Agaricus xanthodermus, it occurs quickly, though faintly to not at all in the case of A. californicus. Another similar species, Agaricus bernardii, also stains red and has white flesh, but differentiates on its larger bulk, a sheathing veil, briny odor, and different habitat, namely grass. Description The cap is broad; it has a convex shape which, in age, becomes flat. The flesh is white, moderately thick, and firm. The odor is pungent, even though the mushroom has a mild taste. When injured, it turns a pinkish-red. The surface is white, dry, and innately fibrillose. At the margin, it is finely scaled, though it discolors into a brownish shade in age. The stem is tall and thick. The stem extends to the enlarged base. At maturity, the stem is stuffed. The surface is white, and turns smooth at the apex, while it is finely scaled below. The partial veil is white, membranous, and two layered. The upper surface is striate, while the lower surface is composed of scaly patches, forming a small, superior annulus. The flesh is white, though it stains red quickly when injured.Kibby, pg. 41 The gills are initially unattached to the stem, packed close together, and are pinkish- brown; in age they become blackish-brown.

Biography Charles Menninger was born in Tell City, Indiana on July 11, 1862. He was the sixth of August Valentine and Katarina (n√©e Schmitberger) Menninger's eight children and their youngest son. Menninger obtained a bachelor's degree from Central Normal College in 1882 and after graduating he accepted a teaching position at Campbell College. Menninger married Florence Vesta Knisley, on January 15, 1885 and together they had three children: Karl, Anna, and William. Florence died on February 9, 1945, and he married Pearl Boam on June 15, 1948. He died on November 28, 1953. Menninger completed his medical training at Chicago's Hahnemann Medical College in 1889 and moved to Topeka, Kansas where a small medical school, affiliated with Washburn College, was operated by members of the local medical community. He was taken on as a junior partner by Henry Roby, who influenced his pursuit of additional medical training focused on internal medicine and metabolic issues. Menninger graduated from the Kansas Medical College in 1906 and was elected to the faculty of the medical college. In 1919, upon completion of his son Karl's medical training at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital, the two formed a professional partnership and opened the Menninger Clinic. His other son William C. Menninger joined them in 1925 and the facility was renamed the Menninger Sanitarium. It eventually evolved into the Menninger Foundation, a national institution for the study and care of people suffering from mental illnesses.

Messerschmidt was convicted in 2002 for publishing material that attempted to link Islamic societies to rape, violence and forced marriages.  Political career  Before taking his seat in the European Parliament, he was a member of the Danish parliament () from 8 February 2005, having won his seat with 3,812 personal votes. In August 2016, Messerschmidt resigned as EU parliament group leader for the DPP, as a result of a scandal involving the related foundations FELD and MELD that he had managed. OLAF launched an investigation into misuse of EU funds, and Messerschmidt was reported to the police for identity theft by MEP Rikke Karlsson, who had left the DPP in 2015 in protest against Messerschmidt's alleged withholding of information about the foundations. Karlsson and then- fellow DPP MEP J√∏hrn Dormann had been elected to the board of MELD without their knowledge.

He has played/collaborated with Greep, The New Seekers, Charlie, John Miles, Yes offshoot Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, and Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett. He also worked as a session player on numerous recordings, including the debut Vitamin Z album, produced by Alan Parsons, with whom he would later collaborate on the 2009 DVD set, Alan Parsons' The Art & Science of Sound Recording. His business specialties include: Analysis of the music technology industry, past, present, future, and MIDI recording. His goal has always been to preserve, champion, and enhance the music experience in all music technology endeavors.  Early life  Born in 1952 in Aldershot in Hampshire, Colbeck began boarding school in Malvern, later attending Monkton Combe School in Bath, where he played in the band 'Springtime Child'. He began playing piano at age 8 when his parents purchased a 1910 Broadwood upright piano, on which he composed more or less everything he has ever written. He still owns it to this day. Colbeck later attended Inchbald School of Design 1970-1971  Music and bands  In 1973 after a brief stint in college, and a spell in the left-wing rock choir Co-operation, Colbeck was fortunate enough to sign a record deal with Charisma Records with the band ‚ÄòGreep‚Äô. After releasing a number of singles, the group disbanded and Colbeck found himself working in fringe theater, London‚Äôs Albany Theatre, Deptford. The New Seekers needed a keyboard player and Colbeck landed the gig, playing many live concerts and TV shows in UK and Europe including the group‚Äôs famed Drury Lane concert in 1974. During this time he met their lighting director, who coincidentally was also the manager for a band called ‚ÄòCharlie.‚Äô Hired initially as a session player for the recording of the group‚Äôs No Second Chance album at Trident Studios, London, he was subsequently asked to join the band as a full-time member. Charlie Colbeck was called upon to replace the Charlie keyboard player Martin Smith and began what would be almost five years of constant touring and music making. He co-produced three Charlie albums: Lines, Fight Dirty, and Here Comes Trouble. He left the band in 1980 amid turmoil. He writes \\"Finally, the touring band line-up of Terry Thomas, John Anderson, Eugene Organ, Steve Gadd, and myself ceased operations once Arista refused to release Here Comes Trouble, and our caring, sharing management company immediately cut off all our money in 1980. That's a whole other story but, for the record, our final gig was in 1979 at the Civic Center in Providence, RI on Monday 29 October, alongside Foreigner\\" After Charlie, Colbeck moved to Los Angeles, worked a bit with The Doors‚Äô Robby Krieger, almost broke into film music (‚Äúthe industry was just not quite ready for synthesizers at the time‚Äù), and was the Musical Director for ‚ÄòCaptain Crash vs The Zzorg Women, Chapters 5 &6,‚Äô written by Steve Hammond, Dave Pierce, and Rick Jones. Nearly starving, Julian was saved when he was picked up by a band named Tropical Madness, the name ‚Äúsums up that particular experience‚Äù. Moving back to UK in 1982 Colbeck undertook several tours of the UK and Europe with British pop star John Miles. ABWH In 1989, Colbeck joined YES super group 'Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe‚Äô and played every date during 1989-1990. He also appeared on two albums Symphonic Music of Yes and Live at Mountain View, the latter also released as the DVD An Evening of Yes Music Plus. He also appeared on Watching the Flags, a Jon Anderson solo record on which he played and co-wrote extensively. He also recorded with Steve Howe and Bill Bruford on a number of solo projects. Steve Hackett Earlier in 1989, Colbeck began what would become a long-term association with Genesis' Steve Hackett, appearing on a live-recorded TV show that would become the album and DVD Time Lapse. Over the next seven years he appeared on 10 or more Steve Hackett albums and countless North and South American tours. In 1996, whilst on stage with Genesis' Steve Hackett and Chester Thompson along with Asia/King Crimson's John Wetton and Ian McDonald, Colbeck had a cathartic moment. ‚ÄúI looked around stage and saw a bunch of old men, including (if not especially) me‚Äù. He made a conscious decision and determined to ‚Äúget the hell out‚Äù of performing onstage and has yet to return. He continues to hold a firm belief that live rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll music is a young man‚Äôs game. Back to Bach In 1991, Colbeck released a solo album Back to Bach, [EG/Virgin] collaborating with concert pianist Jonathan Cohen, plus Steve Hackett, Milton McDonald, John Keeble, Mary Hopkin, and the Irish poet Brian Keenan.

He subsequently published several keyboard buyers guides, a Frank Zappa biography, music related and even assisted his then brother-in-law Raymond Blanc, with a cookbook. Here is a list of publications: * Keyfax, A Buyers Guide To Electronic Keyboards (Virgin) * Keyfax 2 (Virgin) * Keyfax 3 (Music Maker Publications) * Keyfax 4 (Music Maker Publications) * Keyfax 5 (Music Maker Publications) * Keyfax Omnibus Edition (Mix Books) * How To Make A Hit Record (Anaya) * RockSchool 2 (BBC Publications) * Rock Talk (WH Allen) * Zappa - A Biography (WH Allen) * What MIDI (Music Maker Publications) * Recipes From Le Manoir Aux Quat' Saisons (with Raymond Blanc) (Macdonald / Orbis)  Keyfax  Keyfax Software was founded in 1993, taking its name from Colbeck's keyboard and synthesizer guides. Initially created to market the original concept of ‚ÄòMIDI Samples‚Äô under the name Twiddly.Bits, the company since developed into a multifaceted business offering music technology distribution and support (DVDs/Websites), MIDI samples, Steinberg music software, and is also the exclusive distributor for the revolutionary Yamaha Tenori-On. ‚ÄúMy role as CEO is divided between providing our creative direction and ensuring that this direction is both invigorating for those who work here and economically sustainable for the company.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt beats rock 'n' roll only in that I get to spend way less time at Denny's.‚Äù ‚Äì Julian Colbeck Twiddly.Bits When Colbeck was asked to review some particularly dismal standard MIDI song files, he realized that there were no MIDI samples available on the market that actually sounded good. He then enlisted help from programmer Dave Spiers to create Twiddly.Bits MIDI samples in 1993. Today there are over 20 Twiddly.Bits MIDI sample libraries available, all generated by professional musicians playing MIDI instruments. PhatBoy As he was delving into the MIDI scene, he again filled a vacant niche by creating the design concept for the first MIDI performance controller, called affectionately, PhatBoy. Yamaha Connection Yamaha approached Colbeck to create content library for the Yamaha RM1x. Its success led to preliminary work on the Yamaha Motif Keyboard (including content licensing). For the next several years (and counting) Yamaha would time and time again approach Colbeck and Keyfax to create content, instructional videos/DVDs and websites for their products. DVDs/Videos Colbeck has been the driving creative force behind several music-related DVDs and videos, often taking on dual roles of director and script writer, including: *Analogue Heaven *Getting the Most Out Of Series (Korg M1, and Home Recording Vols 1,2,3) *Get Motifated Series, For the Yamaha Motif Classic & Yamaha Motif ES, Volumes 1, 2 & 3) (Winning a Videographers award) *The O1xperience (a guide for the Yamaha O1x mixer/interface) *Exploring Sound Reinforcement (How- to on live sound set up) *The Complete Guide to the Motif ES *S90 Under Control (Yamaha S90 Master Class) *Go Mo (Yamaha MO 6/8 Keyboard) *World of Motif XS *Motif XS Master Class *Making Beats on the Yamaha MM6 (Top honors at 2008 Aurora Awards in Art / Culture Instructions) *Using Cubase 4 Recording the Band *Sound Advice (with host sound programmer Dave Polich) * Universal Audio Studio On Screen *Alan Parsons Live in Madrid *Drum Programming Secrets *Steve Hackett The Tokyo Tapes, Camino Records, crown studios, 16-18 Crown Road, Twickenham, UK, tw1, 3ee, UK *Alan Parsons‚Äô Art and Science of Sound Recording (2010) * Motif XF Fully Loaded (2011) * Discovering The Yamaha MOX (2012)  Personal life  Colbeck has two children Abi, born 1988, and Cameron born 1992.

As it consists of a small ruined temple on a basement, overgrown with vegetation, it is one of less visited temples of Angkor. It was dedicated on Thursday 28 April 1295 CE,Freeman, Jacques 2006, p.120 according to its four sided inscribed stele, and its importance is all about being the last of the known Angkor monuments dated with precision. It was built in sandstone during the reign of Jayavarman VIII,Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, in honour of a Brahmin scholar called Mangalartha, assimilated to Vishnu. It's cruciform in plan and opens to east, while on the other cardinal points there are blind doors. The sanctuary chamber sheltered two statues, one of Mangalartha and the other of his mother, whose pedestal is still in place. Mangalartha essentially is the Vaman Avatar (incarnation) of Lord Vishnu. The legend has it that in this Avatar, The Lord blessed Bali, the Rakshasa (demonic people) King by asking three vows from the latter in which the Lord took three giant steps and covered the entire Earth, The Heaven and then in order that He could bless the King, put his third step on the vituous King's head.

It had a French language equivalent, LaBanqueVideo/Boutique video Bell. It started in Beta mode on 4 May 2007 and offered movies, television shows and music videos/concerts for $1.99 and up, with a pricing structure similar to that of iTunes by Apple Computer and Unbox by Amazon. A purchase included a full resolution video file with the rights to download on up to 4 devices. The Bell Video Store ceased operations on 15 July 2009. Movies were not available for purchase or rent after 15 June 2009. Compatibility The Video Store player was compatible with the Windows XP family of operating systems and Windows Vista. The content could be viewed using the Bell Video Player, Windows Media Player, a Media Centre compatible computer and a PlaysForSure portable device (May 2008). With the Media Centre capability, content could then be streamed to a television using a Windows Media Center Extender such as an Xbox 360 console from a PC running Windows XP Media Center Edition or Windows Vista (Home Premium or Ultimate). Downloaded videos could be burned to a DVD for storage purposes, but the resulting DVD would not play on a DVD player. Social networking The Video Store had a social networking component, partnered with Broadband Mechanics to deliver a series of \\"widgets\\" that allowed users to interact with content on the site. Examples of this included 5-star ratings, reviews, comments, adding friends, sending messages and more. Video quality The content delivered by Bell Video Store was \\"DVD and above quality\\". Bit rates ranged from 1.5 to 2.5. The encoding rate used created a file size which made one hour of programming roughly equal to one gigabyte (1 GB) of file space in a computer. In comparison, a typical DVD makes a 2-hour movie about 4.7 GB. Due to the large size of the files being downloaded, the service required a broadband internet connection capable of sustaining transfer speeds of 800 kbit/s. A 2-hour filme might have taken 7 hours and 20 minutes to download using a 750 kbit/s DSL/cable connection or 1 hour and 50 minutes with a 3.0 Mbit/s DSL/cable connection. For Bell Video Store users with a high speed connection, the service delivered a progressive download feature which aimed to have any Bell Video Store files playing within 5 minutes. Requirements For display on a computer or transfer to portable device, the service required the installation of a client application (Media Player) which managed playback and the transfer of video to devices. Criticism Video Store videos would only play in desktop applications that supported Windows Media DRM, of which none exist for Mac OS X and Linux. When portable capability was launched in May 2008, the Bell Video Store only supported portable devices that supported the Microsoft PlaysForSureformat, thereby excluding popular devices such as the Apple iPod. Bell launched this service shortly after beginning to throttle the popular bit torrent protocol. Similar services such as Azureus's Vuze & BitTorrent Inc's DNA Platform have been effectively stopped from entering this market in Canada.

Stop changes Construction of the outbound bulbout in January 2019 Until 2019, inbound trains stopped on 9th Avenue at Irving, and outbound trains on Irving at 9th Avenue. This required many trains to wait for the traffic signal to change after making their station stop, and prevented the deployment of transit signal priority at the intersection. In March 2014, Muni released details of the proposed implementation of their Transit Effectiveness Project (later rebranded MuniForward), which included a variety of stop changes for the N Judah line. The stop locations at Irving and 9th Avenue were to be moved to the far side of the intersection (to allow trains to pass through before stopping) and transit bulbs constructed to allow passengers to board directly from the sidewalk. The eastbound bulb would be adjacent to 8th Avenue, and the westbound bulb north of the existing bus stop, to allow trains to fully clear the intersection before opening their doors. Two subprojects - accessible platforms at 28th Avenue, and improvements on Irving Street between 9th Avenue and Arguello - were selected for early implementation in coordination with rail replacement and seismic refitting of the Sunset Tunnel. The latter project (the Inner Sunset Streetscape Project) began construction during weekend shutdowns of the line in September 2017. It included construction of the bulbouts proposed in 2014. The new platforms opened on September 14, 2019.

It is a broader view of roughness because it is more strictly defined as \\"the irregularities whose spacing is greater than the roughness sampling length\\". It can occur from machine or work deflections, chatter, residual stress, vibrations, or heat treatment... Waviness should also be distinguished from flatness, both by its shorter spacing and its characteristic of being typically periodic in nature. Parameters There are several parameters for expressing waviness height, the most common being Wa & Wt, for average waviness and total waviness, respectively. In the lateral direction along the surface, the waviness spacing, Wsm, is another parameter that describes the mean spacing between periodic waviness peaks. There are numerous measurement settings which influence these resultant parameter values, which are mentioned below. One of the most important is the waviness evaluation length, which is the length in which the waviness parameters are determined. Within this length the waviness profile is determined. This is a surface texture profile that has the shorter roughness characteristics filtered out, or removed; it also does not include any profile changes due to changes in workpiece geometry that are either unintentional (flatness) or intentional (form). Waviness is included in the ISO standards ISO 4287ISO 4287, Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS) -- Surface texture: Profile method -- Terms, definitions and surface texture parameters and ISO 16610-21ISO 16610, Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Filtration -- Part 21: Linear profile filters: Gaussian filters as well as the U.S. standard ASME B46.1,ASME B46.1, Surface Texture (Surface Roughness, Waviness, and Lay). and it is part of the surface texture symbol used in engineering drawings.. Measurement The measurement of the waviness can be done with a variety of instruments, including both surface finish profilometers and roundness instruments. The nature of these instruments is continually progressing and now includes both stylus-based contact instruments as well as optical & laser-based non-contact instruments. In earlier instruments, the measurement output was inherently linked to the instrument itself, whereas there is now emerging some divergence between the instrument that collects the surface profile data and the analytical software that is able to evaluate this data. Examples of two earlier generation instruments are the waveometer or a microtopographer. A waveometer uses a plastic tip that is connected to an electronic pickup which then measures the surface variations. The measurement is recorded as an electronic signal which is amplified and split into two signals: a high band and a low band. For measuring a ball bearing, the low band signal records variations that occur every four to seventeen times per revolution and the high band signal records variations that occur seventeen to 330 times per revolution; the low band is the waviness. These bands are transmitted to an oscilloscope for analysis... Use Waviness measurements are not as common as roughness measurement however there are important applications. For example, waviness in bearing balls and bearing races is one of the reasons for vibrations and noise in ball bearings. Other application examples are waviness in flat milled sealing surfaces, \\"orange peel\\" on painted surfaces, and chatter on round shaft surfaces...

The film had the strapline \\"No Crime Stays Hidden Forever\\". Produced by Christopher Granier-Deferre and John Schwab. Plot The film is set in and around a bird-hide on the Suffolk marshes owned by Roy Tunt (Macqueen). Roy is a middle-aged, obsessive bird watcher, who needs just one more sighting (of the sociable plover) to complete the entire British list of birds. He is unexpectedly joined by a dishevelled and tattooed stranger, who introduces himself as Dave John (Campbell). After an awkward start, the pair build up a rapport, share lunch, have a drink and discuss a wide variety of subjects. Roy tells David that he used to work in a poultry factory and that his wife left him for another man. Roy's walkie-talkie picks up a police message about a local murder by someone fitting David's description. Dave is armed but his gun falls out of his pocket when he falls asleep and Roy takes it. Roy then confesses that he is the man wanted for murder; that the victims were his wife and her partner. He sickens David by describing how he disposed of the bodies in a poultry factory mincer, turning them into a paste which he has fed to David in the sandwiches they had shared earlier. Roy intends to blow up the police helicopter that is looking for him on the marsh. David tries to reason with Roy but the pair end up fighting. In the struggle, David steals his gun back and kills Roy.

She performed on Broadway for over fifty years and occasionally did films in the 1920s. She appeared in a large number of Broadway hits over the course of her years as an actress. Early Life Margaret Rosendale was born on March 6, 1876 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, although some sources give her birth year as 1880. Her father was Julius Rosendale, a wealthy physician, jeweler and translator who died in 1911. She was interviewed in Munsey's Magazine in 1903 where a brief noting of her career had her living in Germantown at one time and was currently single and living with her mother.Munsey's Magazine, Vol.29 1903 page945 Theater Career She began her career in Charles Frohman acting company in 1898, often in support of the leading actors such as Henry Miller. She became the leading lady of John Drew from 1902 to 1905. Dale performed with George Arliss in the long running play Disraeli, 1911 to 1917.George Arliss: The Man Who Played God by Robert Fells c.2004 In the mid-1920s she was part of an ensemble cast that included Mary Boland, Edna May Oliver, Humphrey Bogart, Raymond Hackett and Gene Raymond in the popular play The Cradle Snatchers.Margaret Dale - North American Theatre Online Motion Pictures In 1920 Dale appeared in her first movie The World and His Wife, directed by Robert G. Vignola. She would appear in six films between 1920 and 1934 preferring the theater. She rejoined Arliss in 1921 for the film version of Disraeli which was produced by his production company Distinctive and released through United Artists. Dale did not return to Arliss when he made his talking version of Disraeli in 1929 for Warner Brothers. In 1922 Dale appeared in D. W. Griffith's One Exciting Night, a haunted house melodrama. This movie had all the spirit of a Mary Roberts Rinehart story, then gaining popularity, but was an original story by Griffith. One Exciting Night was shot at Griffith's Mamaroneck studios on Long Island. The 1921 version of Disraeli is a lost film with one reel in existence at the George Eastman House. However a complete print is rumored to exist at Gosfilmofond in Russia. One Exciting Night was on home video (VHS) briefly in the 1990s. In 2014 it is available on DVD from Alpha VideoOne Exciting Night at silentera.com Dale's last film and only talkie was The Man with Two Faces starring Edward G.

His father, Hans Jacob Terwesten or Zurwesten, was originally from Augsburg while his mother Catharina came from Berlin. They had married in The Hague in 1648, where Hans Jacob worked as a goldsmith. The marriage produced ten children, of whom three sons and two daughters survived. Augustinus was the oldest son. Ezaias, the middle son of the family, also worked temporarily in his father's workshop and settled later in Rome as a flower and fruit painter. The youngest brother Mattheus later followed in Augustinus footsteps and often worked together with him on commissions.Michael Lausberg, ‚Äò‚ÄôPrunkschl√∂sser: Schloss Charlottenburg‚Äô‚Äô Young woman with flower garland In his father's workshop Augustinus learned the art of engraving, goldsmithing and wax modelling. This was followed by two years of apprenticeship with the history painter Nicolaes Willingh, who became court painter to the Great Elector in Berlin in 1667.

It was programmed by Costa Panayi and is a development of the earlier 3D games Highway Encounter and Alien Highway.  Gameplay  The player controls a bouncing ball on a series of superimposed levels, each consisting of an array of square tiles, on which are arranged a number of puzzles. Each puzzle consists of two black cubes that turn temporarily white when touched by the player's ball, before turning black again. To solve the puzzle, both cubes must touched in rapid succession so that they both turn white simultaneously. There are nine levels in total. When all the puzzles on one level are complete the player ascends to the next. The height of the ball's bounce is controlled by the \\"fire\\" button, while the direction controls steer it around the map. The player must take care not to fall off the edge of the level, or through the gaps between tiles. Flying platforms, conveyor belts, adhesive surfaces, spiked balls, and other structures may help or hinder the player in his attempt to solve the puzzles. The player has five balls. There is also a time limit that must be beaten.  Background  Mark Haigh-Hutchinson: > \\"The result of Costa's efforts was REVOLUTION, an abstract isometric puzzle > game.

The show involves short humorous sketches with household items and food, virtually all of which have googly eyes stuck on, hence the show's title. The show first aired on 10 August 2009 on both CBBC and BBC HD. The commission was for two series of 13 shows, each 15 minutes long. The shows were produced in a block over five months in Glasgow. Voices are provided by Tim Dann, Peter Dickson and Shelley Longworth. The series was created and written (\\"set free\\") by Nick Hopkin, Tim Dann and Austin Low. The show returned in 2015 as OOglies Funsize. Recurring gags There are groups of characters who appear with similar gags multiple times, and sometimes the characters meet each other. Episodes begin with a mock safety announcement (voiced by Peter Dickson): \\"Attention all humans. The stunts you are about to witness have been performed by trained OOglies. Under no circumstances should children or silly adults attempt to do any of the actions you see in the programme.\\" (with \\"It's time for OOglies!\\" added after it for Funsize) * The Playful Grapes and Melonhead - A group of green grapes try out an activity (such as sliding or skipping) until a clumsy watermelon tries to join them, usually ending up squashing the grapes. Usually the pre-opening sketch in Series 1. * Boo Potato - a sprouting potato often lays \\"traps\\" for a random OOglie character to come and observe. When it is close enough, the potato jumps out with a \\"BOO!\\" and scares the OOglie in a comical fashion. Usually the pre-opening sketch in Series 2. * Strawberry Lovers - A pair of amorous strawberries meet across a gap in the counter and the male lover tries to get across, but ends up being squashed. * The Cherry-aiders - Four cherries make up an air ambulance team and go to help another OOglie who is hurt by wrapping them up in bandages, normally causing more problems for the injured OOglie. * Lonely Sprout - A Brussels sprout tries to join in with or save other OOglies but ends up failing as no one seems to like him. * Stunt Tomato - A tomato in a cape and mask tries to do impressive tricks for three cherry tomatoes, however ends up squashing himself at the end. * Slippery Nana - A Banana skin tries to do something but keeps slipping over, usually breaking objects around it.

It escapes from the bun, but it ends up backfiring (such as being sprayed with water or ketchup). * Zombie Vegetables - An OOglie food is tossed into a bin where a rotting Parsnip and Potato live. Although seemingly menacing at first, the \\"zombies\\" quickly show their friendship to newcomers through flatulence, which often backfires on them when their \\"visitors\\" try and copy them. * The Stapler Dogs - A stapler pranks three dogs (staple removers) by getting them to jump off their shelf, such as giving them a bowl of staples then throwing some off the shelf. * The Baby Blocks - Three blocks, a blue cube, a pink cylinder and a yellow triangular prism are babies, and go off to investigate something which ends up scaring them, causing them to cry and run back to the safety of their toybox. * The Fruit Bunch and Devious Blender - An orange sees something interesting and tells a banana, an apple and a pear about it.

He comes across an object he cannot get through so uses the laser to make a doorway, though ends up being squished or otherwise. * Zip Face and Pencil - a cheeky pencil escapes from a pencil case, who constantly tries to recapture him. The pencil, however, uses a sketchbook to draw pictures that come to life and bring comical harm to the case. * The Scramblers - a trio of motor biking eggs who attempt daredevil stunts (with a slab of Red Rind Edam Cheese as a ramp). However, one of the eggs has training wheels on his bike, and it is usually him who attempts the stunts last and, somehow, ends up smashing himself and his bike. In the penultimate episode, he finally manages to complete a stunt without smashing himself. * The Cheeky Carrots and Torch - a torch tries to get some sleep in a basement; but whenever his light is off, a band of nocturnal carrots get up to mischief in the darkness, until the torch puts them straight. * Sugar Cube - a small sugar cube goes sledging with husky dog tea bags, until she becomes knocked off her \\"sledge\\" (a spoon) and winds up coming into contact with water where she melts, much to her dogs' displeasure. * Strictly Come Grating - similar to \\"Strictly Come Dancing\\", a male grater dances with various female contestants (a carrot, an orange, a corn on the cob) until the female dancers are accidentally grated by their partner. * Alarming Clock - a cheeky alarm clock disturbs a sleeping OOglie (such as a balloon) by her noisy ring, which usually backfires on the clock herself. * The Party Box Gang - a group of Christmas Decorations play a needless game of musical chairs in their box.

In the final episode, while trying to throw a hammer she flings herself into the audience and decides to watch the games instead. * Two pineapple rings try to wake up their \\"dad\\" - a whole pineapple - with various loud devices, which usually backfire on the two rings, leaving the pineapple to sleep. * A quiet Spanish Cactus tries to avoid fragile OOglies (such as a balloon or dartboard) but always looses her spines when given a nasty shock. * A high-speed strip marker races around the household, leaving behind his long yellow trail of sticky tape.

At the end of the series, the jelly gets her own back on the fingers. * Extreme Soap Bars - two bars of soap (one yellow, the other black) start from the bathroom and skid around in sporty fashion, finishing up from a long jump off the stair banisters.

N. Barlow House is on South Clinton Street in Albion, New York, United States. It is a brick building erected in the 1870s in an eclectic mix of contemporary architectural styles, including Second Empire, Italianate, and Queen Anne. Its interior features highly intricate Eastlake style woodwork. It was the home of a prominent local architect who designed many major buildings in Albion. In 1983 it and an accompanying barn, since converted into a garage, were added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of two houses in Albion so designated (the other is the Greek Revival Tousley-Church House). Buildings and grounds The house is located on a lot on the east side of South Clinton Street, one block south of West Avenue (state highway NY 31) and a block west of South Main Street (NY 98). The terrain is generally level. The surrounding neighborhood is residential, with many late 19th- and early 20th-century houses that retain less integrity. To the north and west are industrial areas. A woodlot separates the houses on Clinton from those on South Main to the east. The building itself is a two-story brick structure on a Medina sandstone foundation. On the west (front) facade is a projecting pavilion with two-and-half-story tower. It is topped with a mansard roof pierced by gabled dormer windows. There are porches on the north and east sides. On the north side the porch features turned posts and a decorative balustrade. The plainer east porch has wooden columns. Near it a gabled hood with scalloped edges shelters the rear entrance. A similar but more decorative porch shelters the main entrance at the base of the tower. It has a gabled hood with return projecting from a shed roof above an elliptical arch with keystone. Two turned wooden fluted columns support the arch. From them project two brackets with drop pendants, supporting the gable. The base has latticework and more turned columns supporting the porch deck. Above the main entrance is another window similar to those on the projecting bays, then a steeply pitched cross-gabled roof with a window in the west field. The dormer windows feature pediments with molded circular and diamond motifs. On the south side the chimney is corbeled at the roofline. Double walnut doors lead to the interior, with much of its original Eastlake style woodwork. Most prominent among this is the main staircase, also of walnut, with turned balusters. A large two-tone newel has a niche for a gas light and intricate carvings in a floral pattern. The gas fireplace has a walnut frontispiece with more floral carvings, geometric forms and an intricate cast iron grill. The inside of the front bay, in the living room, has louvered shutters and decorative surrounds. That room, the central hall and stair hall all have vertical beadboard wainscoting. Walnut sliding doors separate the living and dining room. In the rear of the house is one of the few remaining water wells, with hand pump, left in Albion. At the end of the driveway, near the rear of the property, is the former horse barn, now a garage, the other contributing resource to the property's historic character. It is a one-and-a-half-story frame gabled structure with exposed rafter ends, sided in clapboard with vertical flushboard between the two floors. Its front gable window has a pedimented hood with cut-out design, and the side windows have uneven panes. History Shortly after his 1810 birth in Madison County, Barlow's parents moved the family west to the Monroe County town of Sweden. After apprenticing to a carpenter in Brockport, he moved to Albion in 1833 and began his career as architect and builder. Over the next half-century, he designed some of the village's most significant buildings, such as the Swan Library and the county courthouse, earning the nickname \\"High-Rickety\\" for the many cupolas on them. He also the chapel and entry archway to Mt. Albion Cemetery outside the village, also listed on the National Register. The significant buildings in Albion that he did not design, he built. His own house was built in the later phase of his career, around 1875. His earlier works had been solidly within their stylistic traditions, in contrast to the eclecticism demonstrated by the house. It has touches from three common styles of the time: an engaged square Italianate tower, a Second Empire mansard roof and a Queen Anne Style projecting polygonal bay. The exterior and, especially, the interior, reflect a love of surface decoration as espoused in the works of Charles Eastlake. The house has remained a private home since his death in 1909. At some point in the ensuing years the wood cresting and finials were removed from the roof and dormers. The original walnut doors between most of the rooms on the first floor were replaced with French doors in the 1920s. Five decades later, in 1975, the woodshed was converted into a family room using materials similar to the original house. The only other change to the property has been the replacement of wood with cement on the garage floor.

Life and career Tohjiro, whose real name is , was born in 1956 in the Roppongi district of Tokyo. He started out as an independent film director. He wrote and directed the film , which was released theatrically in October 1987 and later as a DVD. The film won him the Best New Director award at the 1988 Yokohama Film Festival. Early AV career Tohjiro made his first AV in 1989 (released in January 1990) titled and starring early AV Idol Nao Saejima for Kaoru Adachi's recently founded studio V&R; Planning. His December 1991 video for V&R; Planning, New Female Teacher Special: Dangerous Sailor Story After School, was the first of a long and popular series. In the first half of the 1990s decade, in addition to V&R; Planning, Tohjiro also directed for several other early AV studios including VIP, Cosmos Plan, Alice Japan, Max-A and Kuki. During this period, Tohjiro made videos covering most of the common styles and genres popular in Japanese pornography including cosplay (Uniform Connection 13 & Uniform Connection 16), anal sex (Fall of the Virgin), simulated rape (Ayano Kotobuki in Sexy Teacher Hunt) and vibrator and vegetable play (Erotic Sensuality, Shocking Fuck). He also made some early works with bondage themes for CineMagic including an entry in the CineMagic \\"Immoral Angel\\" series, the September 1996 Immoral Angel 25, and one for the \\"Slave Secretary\\" series, Abnormal Privacy: Slave Secretary 16, in January 1997. Tohjiro celebrated his 200th video as a director with Incomplete, Chisato Aihara for Shy in July 1997. He twice won an award from the Tokyo- based AV magazine Orange Communications („Ç™„É¨„É≥„Ç∏ÈÄö‰ø°) which ended its long publishing history in 2009. SOD Up to 1997 Tohjiro had been mainly working for the older major rental-video oriented studios but in that year he joined the recently formed independent or \\"indie\\" studio Soft On Demand (SOD) which sold its videos to the general market and had looser content standards. Beginning in December 1997, SOD released a series of Tohjiro branded videos on their Hamlet label beginning with Real Fetish labeled as TJ-001. This VHS tape, which was released as a DVD in 2002, has actress Sanae As≈ç in a variety of bondage and S&M; fetish situations including having sex while covered in animal entrails. Tohjiro also continued directing for other studios, including Yuri Komuro's first video for Alice Japan, Sexy Butt from January 1998 where she plays an alien from outer space who has sex with earthmen, and two entries in h.m.p.'s S&M; genre Kitan Club label in April and June 1998. Tohjiro is credited with launching the career of AV Idol Kurumi Morishita at SOD, the actress most closely associated with his work for many years. He directed her first video Ubu released in September 1998. In December 1999, Ganari Takahashi, the founder and chief at SOD, banned Tohjiro from making porn videos with SOD for a year, telling him to \\"go away and fix your porn-addicted brain! Your recent movies have lost their edge!\\" For that year, Tohjiro worked on softcore V-Cinema films for SOD including the May 2000 VHS production Lovely Woman Teacher (ÊÑõ„Åó„ÅÆÂ•≥ÊïôÂ∏´) starring Mirei Asaoka and the October 2000 Nude Hostess (ÂÖ®Ë£∏Ëã•Â•≥Â∞Ü) with Kurumi Morishita. This was followed in December by nana („Å™„Å™) starring Chinatsu It≈ç. All three VHS videos were later released by SOD in DVD format Dogma After a year Tohjiro returned saying \\"I'm going to start a revolution at SOD!\\" In February 2001, he formed the Dogma label as part of the SOD group. His first release under the Dogma label appeared in April 2001, Innocent Desire, with his favorite actress Kurumi Morishita. A year later Tohjiro separated Dogma from SOD to form an independent company. When Dogma became a separate company, Morishita left SOD to join Dogma and Tohjiro as a contract actress. Under Tohjiro, Dogma has been successful as a company specializing in extreme fetish videos which include bondage, forced fellatio and various S&M; themes. In December 2005 Tohjiro and Morishita returned to make peace at their old studio SOD with Stripper, a lesbian love story with SOD star Nana Natsume. In addition to Morishita, other AV Idols who have worked extensively at Dogma with Tohjiro are Mayura Hoshitsuki, Chihiro Hasegawa, Maki Tomoda and Marin Izumi. With a few other actresses, they make up the group known as Tohjiro's M (Masochist) Women. Tohjiro instituted a separate hardcore S&M; themed label, CORE SM, in December 2005 with its first release being Maki Tomoda - Bound Masochistic Slave. Beginning in 2005, Dogma sponsored the D-1 Climax (D-1 „ÇØ„É©„Ç§„Éû„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ) awards as a competition for directors inside and outside of the Dogma studio. Tohjiro won the 1st Place award in 2005 and 2006 but finished 9th in 2007, the last year of the contest. Tohjiro entered one of his Dogma videos, Vomit Enema Ecstasy X in the 2009 AV Grand Prix competition and made some waves by declaring all-out war by his small \\"indie\\" company to defeat the favorite, top studio S1 No. 1 Style. S1 did take the GrandPrix prize and several others, but Tohjiro made good on part of his boast by winning the Digital Sales Award and the 2 million yen (about $20,000) prize money.

As early as 1783 (with Johann Erich Biester as secretary), intellectuals associated with the Late Enlightenment had gathered in a Gesellschaft der Freunde der Aufkl√§rung, or Society of Friends of the Enlightenment. It was established by Wilhelm Abraham Teller. Members included the Prussian finance minister Carl August von Struensee, the finance councillor Johann Heinrich Wloemer (1726‚Äì1797), the poet Leopold Friedrich G√ºnther von Goeckingk, Christian Konrad Wilhelm von Dohm, the theatre director and writer Johann Jacob Engel, the Supreme Court councillor Friedrich Wilhelm von Beneke, Friedrich Gedike, Karl Franz von Irwing, the jurist Ernst Ferdinand Klein, Franz Michael Leuchsenring, the physician Johann Carl Wilhelm Moehsen und Christian Gottlieb Selle, the preachers Johann Joachim Spalding and Johann Friedrich Z√∂llner, and Karl Gottlieb Suarez. Moses Mendelssohn was an honorary member. It was through this scholarly semi-secret society, as well as through the longer-lived Montagsclub, which had a more social character, that the Berlin Enlightenment spread its ideas, using the Berlinische Monatsschrift as an outlet. Nearly every member wrote in this paper, and Werner Krauss, in his studies of the period, called it the movement's most important forum. In 1798, Frederick William III of Prussia closed down the society as a threat to public order. With the short-lived Berliner Bl√§tter and Neue Berlinische Monatsschrift (which lasted until 1811), Biester continued to promote their ideas, the enthusiasm for which philosophical Idealism had threatened to quench; but the standards of previous years (when Kant had made contributions) were never quite matched, and Biester died in 1816, with no-one left to replace him.

Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste (in English, Northwest Treeplanters and Farmworkers United), more commonly known by the acronym PCUN, is the largest Latino union in the U.S. state of Oregon. PCUN is located in Woodburn. According to the Statesman Journal, the meetings that led to the formation of PCUN were held at Colegio Cesar Chavez, the nation's first fully accredited and independent Latino college.Thelma Guerrero (September 29, 2006). \\"Short-lived college offers lessons\\". Statesman Journal. PCUN was founded in 1977 by Cipriano Ferrel, who graduated from Colegio Cesar Chavez and worked closely with Cesar Chavez himself.Farmworkers Housing Development Corporation Ferrel was motivated to create the organization after an increase in immigration raids in Oregon. PCUN has organized the creation of migrant housing and farmworker housing. Cipriano Ferrel worked closely with Cesar Chavez.  History   Founding of the PCUN  Cipriano Ferrel was born to farmworkers in Delano, California in 1949. Ferrel attended school with Cesar Chavez's daughters and was known to have an early activist spirit. While in high school, Ferrel joined the Chicano Movement by founding a chapter of the Brown Berets. He also helped start a community periodical called La Fuerza and was a counselor for young men who faced the draft during the Vietnam War. Ferrel joined the United Farm Workers (UFW) after high school and was involved in the Grape Boycott campaigns with Chavez. In 1975, Ferrel moved to Eugene, Oregon to study at the University of Oregon but, shortly after enrolling, he transferred to Colegio Cesar Chavez in Mount Angel the first accredited, independent four-year Chicano/Latino college in the United States. Ferrel received his bachelor's degree in 1977, the same year he co-founded the Willamette Valley Immigration Project (WVIP) with Larry Kleinman in response to an increase in raids in Oregon by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). WVIP was the precursor to the PCUN and focused on providing legal representation and consulting to undocumented farmworkers, particularly with regard to deportation. The WVIP combated the INS through a legal strategy to slow down deportations. Between 1984 and 1985, WVIP‚Äôs staff, reforestation workers, and farmworkers had meetings to discuss strategies in Colegio Cesar Chavez, and on September 15, 1985, WVIP agreed upon the formation of a new labor union. Thus, the Pi√±eros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, or PCUN, was formed with 80 initial members. The WVIP was subsequently terminated but PCUN created \\"Centro de Servicios para Campesinos\\" (Service Center for Farmworkers), to provide immigration services.  1980s  The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for residency under certain conditions. The PCUN helped 1,300 immigrants apply for residency under this Act and 98% of the immigrants were approved by the INS. In 1988, PCUN worked on the \\"Project to Stop Pesticide Poisoning\\". This project focused on educating farmworkers of the dangers of pesticides, offered them resources, documented farmworker exposures to various pesticides on different farms in Oregon. PCUN also focused on improving farmworker conditions and wages this year under the leadership of Cipriano Ferrel (president), Ramon Ramirez (vice president), and Larry Kleinman (secretary-treasurer). In September 1989, PCUN partnered with Oregon's AFL‚ÄìCIO and filed a lawsuit against Governor Goldschmidt's \\"Stranger's Picketing Law\\", which resulted in its ruling as unconstitutional, a victory for the union. It is during this time that PCUN also moved its headquarters to a former church home. On June 9, a strike fund was announced at a joint conference with PCUN, the Oregon Public Employees Union (OPEU/SEIU), and Clergy and Laity Concerned.  1990s  In 1990, the PCUN started its minimum wage campaign, or \\"Red Card\\" campaign after the discovery that cucumber and berry farmers were losing an estimated $2,000,000 due to minimum wage violations after Oregon raised its minimum wage the year before. PCUN instructed the workers to keep track of their hours and earnings on red cards and were able to collect $155,538 in back wages. The first farmworker strike in Oregon was organized by PCUN and workers at Kraemer Farms who demanded pay raises in 1991. On September 13, 1992, after Kraemer failed to meet the demands of the strikers, PCUN called for a nationwide boycott on a co-owner of Kraemer Farms, NORPAC Foods, Inc. to pressure Kraemer. By March 1993, the boycott had been endorsed by 23 organizations, including the UFW. In 1994, Kraemer raised the wages for workers and the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) fined Kraemer for covering the scales used to weigh harvested fruit. In 1995, PCUN targeted the strawberry harvest in its Tenth Anniversary Organizing Campaign to raise wages for strawberry workers. They managed to increase the wage per pound of harvest through a series of strikes and organizing. That year also saw an effort to focus on the demands and issues faced by the women in farmworker communities. Thus, the Farmworker Women's Leadership Project was created to give these women a safe space to talk among themselves, learn public speaking skills, learn other practical skills such as driving and project planning, and set up a co-op for them to sell handcrafted goods. In 1988, Nature's Fountain Farm and PCUN established a contract that included novel protections for farmworkers such as overtime pay and seniority. In 1999, the NORPAC boycott was prominent in college campuses nationwide and resulted in Gardenburger's separation from the corporation.

During the battle, a small British squadron attacked and defeated a Dutch force defending a valuable convoy, which was also captured. The British force‚Äîconsisting of the frigate HMS Greyhound and brig-sloop under the command of Captain Edward Elphinstone‚Äîwas initially wary of the Dutch, mistaking the Dutch East Indiaman merchant ship Victoria for a ship of the line. Closer observation revealed the identity of the Dutch vessels the following day and Elphinstone led his frigate against the leading Dutch warship Pallas while Harrier engaged the merchant vessels and forced them to surrender. Only the corvette William escaped, taking no part in the engagement. The battle was the first in a series of actions by the Royal Navy squadron based at Madras with the intention of eliminating the Dutch squadron maintained at Java. Greyhound had been sent to the Java Sea and the Molucca Islands to reconnoitre the Dutch ports in preparation for a raid on Java by a larger force under Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew later in the year. Elphinstone's success was followed by a second frigate action by Captain Peter Rainier in which the Dutch ship Maria Riggersbergen was captured. In November 1806, Admiral Pellew led the main body of his squadron against the capital of the Dutch East Indies at Batavia and a year later eliminated the last vessels of the Dutch East Indies squadron at Griessie. Background The Dutch squadron in the Dutch East Indies was a constant threat to the British system of trade routes during the Napoleonic Wars. The Dutch‚Äîunder the guise of the Kingdom of Holland and ruled by the French Emperor Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte‚Äîhad joined the war against Britain following the end of the Peace of Amiens in 1803. Although the primary function of the Dutch East Indies squadron was the suppression of piracy, their presence threatened British shipping in the Malacca Straits, in particular the lucrative trade with China. At the start of every year, the \\"China Fleet\\"‚Äîa large convoy of British East Indiamen merchant ships‚Äîsailed from Canton and passed through the South China Sea and the Malacca Strait on their journey to the Indian Ocean and eventually to Britain. Worth millions of pounds, these convoys were vital to the British economy, but they faced considerable danger in passing through waters that were within easy reach of the Dutch ports in Java.Clowes, p. 336 In 1804, a French squadron under Rear- Admiral Charles Linois used Batavia on Java as a base to attack the China Fleet, although the attempt ended in failure at the Battle of Pulo Aura.Clowes, p. 336 Java presented a clear threat to British maritime interests in the South China Sea, but the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean was too weak in 1805 to consider operations so far from its main base at Madras while Linois remained active. By the start of 1806, Linois had sailed into the Atlantic and an expeditionary force had seized the Dutch base at the Cape of Good Hope, securing the western Indian Ocean and providing reinforcements that allowed Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew to begin operations against the Dutch forces in the East Indies.Gardiner, p. 81 Pellew's first action, during the spring of 1806, was to deploy several frigates to the Java Sea with instructions to reconnoitre the Dutch squadron and its main port at Batavia. The first British ship to reach the Java Sea was the 32-gun frigate HMS Greyhound under Captain Edward Elphinstone, which arrived in July 1806. In company with the brig-sloop under Commander Edward Troubridge, the two vessels cruised in search of Dutch activity in the area. On 4 June they successfully destroyed the armed brig Christian Elizabeth at Manado and two days later captured the Belgica at Tidore. During the evening of 25 July, lookouts spotted four sails passing through the Selayar Strait that separates Selayar Island from the southern tip of Celebes. These four vessels were a Dutch convoy from the Molucca Islands, consisting of: The Dutch national frigate Pallas, of 36 guns, under Captain N. S. Aalbers; Dutch East India Company corvette William, of twenty 24-pounder guns and 110 men, under Captain P. Feteris; Dutch East Indiaman Victoria (or in some sources Vittoria), of about 800 tons burthen (bm), under Captain Klaas Kenkin and Dutch East Indiaman Batavier, of some 500 tons (bm) under Captain William De Val.James, p. 251 Battle On observing the Dutch ships, Elphinstone immediately gave chase. Aalbers responded by forming his ships in a line of battle and retaining close formation as the convoy passed the Celebes coast close to the small Dutch trading posts at Borthean and Balacomba. At 21:00, Aalbers ordered his force to anchor offshore and prepare for the British attack. Elphinstone was cautious however as Victoria was a particularly large ship, with two decks and the appearance of a ship of the line. Aware that such a large vessel could easily destroy his frigate Elphinstone halted his advance and Greyhound and Harrier stopped to observe the Dutch convoy during the night, maintaining a position to windward of Aalbers' force. At dawn, lookouts on Greyhound were able to establish that Victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and Elphinstone was encouraged to resume the attack. Aalbers sailed shortly afterwards, his ships tacking away from the shore in line of battle ready for the British advance. In doing so, Pallas drew ahead of the next ship in line, creating a gap through which the British attack could be directed. At 05:00, Elphinstone raised French colours in an effort to confuse the Dutch officers and indicated that he wished to speak with the Dutch commander. Aalbers was not fooled, and when Elphinstone opened fire on Pallas at close range at 05:30, the Dutch frigate replied immediately. With the frigates engaged, Harrier cut between Pallas and Victoria, Troubridge discharging his carronades into Victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at the deck of Pallas. In response, Victoria and Batavier pulled out of the line to engage Harrier, which continued its fire against Pallas, while William, bringing up the rear of the Dutch line, pulled out completely and sailed for the coast.Clowes, p. 387 Elphinstone rapidly took advantage of the confusion Harriers attack had created, passing Aalbers' bow and raking his ship. Elphinstone then threw his sails back, halting his ship and allowing Greyhound to maintain a position across Pallas bow from which he could inflict severe damage on the Dutch frigate without coming under fire himself. As the damage and casualties mounted on Pallas, Harrier joined the attack. Gunfire from the Dutch ship gradually slackened, and finally stopped at 06:10, the Dutch flag was struck from the mast and Pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 (including 50 local recruits).Clowes, p. 386 Throughout the engagement, Victoria and Batavier had kept up a constant but inefficient fire on Harrier, Troubridge waiting until the Dutch flagship surrendered before counterattacking.James, p. 252 With Troubridge in pursuit, the Dutch merchant ships were unable to escape Harrier, and at 06:30 Victoria surrendered. Sending a boat to take possession, Troubridge immediately turned away towards Batavier. Elphinstone too was sailing towards the isolated merchant vessel and at 06:40 Captain De Val surrendered rather than fight the superior British force. William successfully escaped in the aftermath of the battle, rapidly outdistancing a weak chase from the battered Harrier. All three captured ships were taken over by prize crews and brought to Port Cornwallis on South Andaman Island. Casualties on Pallas were heavy, with eight men killed outright and 32 wounded, including Aalbers and three of his lieutenants. Six of the wounded later died, including the Dutch captain. There were also four men killed on the East Indiamen and seven wounded, one of whom died later. British losses by contrast were light, with one man killed and eight wounded on Greyhound and just three wounded on Harrier. Aftermath The prizes were sold in India. The Royal Navy took Pallas into service as HMS Celebes.Clowes, p. 564. However, it sold her in 1807.Winfield (2008), p.215. Elphinstone did not long survive his victory: he was ordered back to Britain in early 1807 and took passage on Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Troubridge's flagship . He was presumed drowned in February 1807 along with the entire crew, when Blenheim disappeared during a hurricane in the western Indian Ocean. For Pellew, the victory was an encouraging sign of the weakness of the Dutch squadron. In October, Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour itself and the following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid on the port that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron. Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but they were old and in a poor state of repair, and so were unable to defend themselves when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.Gardiner, p. 82 Citations References   Category:Naval battles involving the Netherlands Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Conflicts in 1806 Category:July 1806 events ","title":"Action of 26 July 1806"},{"id":"24059924","text":"The Jackson Blood Cobblestone House is located on South Main Street (state highway NY 63) in Lyndonville, New York, United States. It is a Greek Revival house built in the middle of the 19th century. Blood, a prominent citizen of the surrounding Town of Yates in its early years, built the house with cobblestones he and his family personally transported down to the site from Lake Ontario to the north. Its former chimney arrangement suggests that it was one of the first houses in the area to be heated with stoves instead of fireplaces. During the first half of the 20th century it was subdivided into three rental units, and much of the interior renovated. Later it was restored to a single-family dwelling. In 2005 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the only property in Lyndonville so far listed, and the northernmost entry on the Register in Orleans County. Building The house is located on a three-quarter‚Äìacre (3,200 m¬≤) lot on the west side of the street south of the village's center, where Route 63 crosses Johnson Creek. The neighborhood is residential, with the houses dating to the late 19th and 20th centuries. Mature trees dominate the lots, giving way to worked fields on either side of the highway. The terrain is level. A modern, non-contributing garage is located at the rear of the lot. Three sections comprise the house. The main block is a large rectangular three-by-three-bay two and a half stories tall. Two one-and-a-half-story wings extend to the north and west (rear). All are sided in rows of lake-washed medium-sized cobblestones set beads of V-profile lime masonry. All trim ‚Äî lintels, sills, quoins and water table ‚Äî is limestone. That material is also used for an unusual decorative feature on the east (front) facade: a semi-elliptical stone arch with keystone that springs from the lintels of the second story windows. Above it the shallow pitched gabled roof is set off by a very deep plain frieze and molded cornice with returns. The six-over-six double-hung sash windows are original. A mid-20th century porch with square posts is on the east face of the north wing. The recessed main entrance, on the northern bay of the main block, contains a large paneled door with sidelights. It opens into a vestibule where a stair with a simple Colonial Revival railing climbs to the second story. A single large room is to the south; the north wing contains a dining room with marble fireplace, and the kitchen. The rear wing is a family room. Upstairs, the layout is similar, with a large bedroom above the large first-floor main room. Most of the house's finishings were added later. The ceilings of the main rooms are modern coved plaster. The most significant original elements are the wooden doors and their shouldered surrounds. On the second floors of the wing the small sash windows slide up into the wall. History Jackson Blood came to the area before Orleans County had even been formed, in 1815, as a young man. He bought a farm near the lake and later acquired large tracts of land around today's Lyndonville. When the town, named after Governor Joseph C. Yates, was formed in 1823, he was named one of its first three commissioners of common schools. Local tradition holds that the Blood family themselves collected the cobblestones from the lake and brought them down to the house starting with Blood's purchase of a farm in the area in 1830, reflecting Lyndonville's increasing importance within the town over Yates Center due to its proximity to the Erie Canal and its location along a creek that powered a mill. It was completed in 1846, its tight rows a hallmark of the middle and late years of the cobblestone trend. Originally it had four chimneys, three of which were purely decorative, to maintain a symmetrical exterior appearance. The fourth was at the southeast corner of the main block. Its extant flue angles to the east wall, suggesting along with the construction date that the builder was using the new technology of stoves to heat the house, instead of relying on fireplaces. Blood lived in the house until 1875. A few years before his death, one of his sons, C. Jackson Blood, served as town supervisor for a term. In the 20th century, the house was subdivided into three rental units. The dining room fireplace was added during this period, as was much of the interior decor. In the 1950s, another renovation reunified the house. There have been no other significant changes.

It has been a national holiday since 1991, when a referendum for Independence took place. Then SR Macedonia gained its independence from Yugoslavia, where it was a federal state, and became a sovereign parliamentary democracy. On 8 September 1991, over 95.5% of the 75.8% turnout voters on the Referendum voted for the independence of the Republic Macedonia. \\"Dear citizens of Macedonia, allow me tonight to you and to all citizens of Macedonia to congratulate the free, sovereign and independent Macedonia!\\" - said the President of the then Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov on the evening of 8 September, addressing the citizens who spontaneously gathered at Macedonia Square in the capital Skopje, to celebrate the successful referendum. The people's will for an independent state was confirmed with the Declaration of the referendum results on 18 September 1991, by the first multi-party Macedonian Parliament. Finally, on 25 September 1991, the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Macedonian Parliament. Next, the new Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia was adopted on 17 November 1991. Due to Greek opposition to a new state containing the term 'Macedonia', the sovereign status of the state was not recognized until 8 April 1993, with an acclamation of the UN General Assembly, when Republic of Macedonia was admitted as 181st full-fledged member in the world organisation under the provisional reference Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

History Rotherham Phoenix was started in 2005 to bring back amateur rugby to Rotherham Titans Rugby Club, who though successful in the upper echelons of the game recognized the importance of re-establishing a thriving junior rugby section. Phoenix was founded using a core of players from the old Wickersley rugby club along with old Rotherham colts players who returned. These were added to by several players coming from nearby Dinnington and Wath rugby clubs. Phoenix started out playing in the Yorkshire merit table in the 2005/2006 season finishing a creditable second in the league. This then led to entry into the Yorkshire Leagues in Division Five South East where a fourth- placed finish was reward for the team's efforts in 2006/2007. In the 2007/2008 campaign Phoenix successfully achieved promotion to Yorkshire Four via a hard- fought play off game against Sheffield Medics. In the same season they reached the final of the Yorkshire Silver Trophy only to lose against Hullensians from two divisions higher. The 2008/2009 season saw Phoenix push the top teams in the league taking a few scalps along the way but disappointingly finished mid table. However the establishment of a 2nd XV helped compensate. The 2009/2010 season brought promotion from Yorkshire Four as League champions with just three league defeats in the season. The 2nds went from strength to strength and field a team on each Saturday of the season. The 2010/2011 season will see the 1st XV will play the majority of their home games on Clifton Lane, home of the Rotherham Titans, when the Titans will be playing their away games.

It is an 1830s cobblestone house in the Greek Revival architectural style. Of the six cobblestone buildings in the Town of Shelby, it is the most accomplished stylistically. In the late 19th century the interior was renovated into a more contemporary style. In 2008 the house, two barns, and a milk house on the grounds were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Buildings and grounds The house is located near the southwest corner of an lot at the northeast corner of the junction of South County Line and West Shelby roads. The area is rural, with large lots consisting primarily of worked fields with some scattered second-growth trees, a large wooded area to the south- southeast, and houses at the roads. It is generally level with a slight slope to the north. In the rear are the three contributing outbuildings. The main house has two sections, a two-story five-by-two-bay main block with a two-by- two-bay wood frame two-story wing on the northeast corner. The slope of the ground exposes the basement at the rear, giving the house the appearance of three stories. Both sections are topped by shallow pitched gabled roofs shingled in asphalt. The main block is pierced by a single brick chimney at the south end. A shed-roofed porch with wooden Tuscan columns and balustrade covers the centrally located main entrance, the two bays to its west, and the east elevation of the main block. The cobblestone siding consists of four horizontal rows per limestone quoin of medium-sized field stones with lime mortar between. Windowsills and lintels are of cut stone. Wooden louvered shutters flank the six-over-six double-hung sash windows; on the west facade the two northern windows are shuttered and the south window on the first story longer than the other three. The two bays east of the entrance have large plate glass windows. At the roofline a molded wooden frieze sets off an overhanging cornice with returns. Blind lunettes are located in the gable fields. A screen door protects the paneled front door, set off by sidelights. It opens into a central hallway with a natural-finish oak staircase rising two flights to the second story. Oak is also used for the paneled spaces below the stair's balustrade, which incorporates a small bench. All interior woodwork on the first floor is similar natural-finish oak. The door and window surrounds are flat pilasters with ogee-profile moldings at the entablature. In the basement is the original kitchen fireplace, with bake oven. The milk house is a single-story single-bay frame structure with gabled roof, a door and two windows. The main barn is on a rubblestone foundation, with an earthen ramp providing entrance. Both it and the two-story gabled carriage barn, where sliding doors provide access to both levels, are sided in vertical board and batten. History Shelp, a Schoharie County native who married Mary Ann Cone, daughter of an early Shelby landowner, bought the where the house now stands in 1828. Five years later, in 1833, he bought another . In 1836 he moved his family into the new house. Originally, it had four chimneys. Three were decorative, one was functional. Its flue angles to the space between the windows, suggesting along with the date of construction that the owner was using heating stoves, then a new technology, to heat the house rather than the fireplaces. Shelp stayed at the house until his death in 1868. He and his descendants were prosperous and productive farmers who expanded and improved the property. Around 1900, apparently after a stove fire in the dining room, renovations were made that brought the interior into that time period. The wooden staircase is consistent with the Queen Anne style, and the porch reflects emerging Colonial Revival tastes. In the middle of the 20th century the house was abandoned and fell into some disrepair. The current owners bought and restored it to its 1900 appearance in the mid-1960s, finding the evidence of the dining-room fire in the process. There have been no other alterations to the property.

According to the traditions of this community, they emigrated from Kanpur, in what is now Uttar Pradesh some five centuries ago. They claim to be descended from Amar Singh Rathore, a Rajput nobleman from Jhansi, on whose conversion to Islam was disowned by his caste. The community thus took up the occupation of cattle rearing, and settled in Midnapur.Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 295-305 The community is now divided between those who still engage in the selling of milk, and the rest of the community who are now small and medium-sized farmers.

The collection was first written around 1938 (there were ca. 125 fables then) but was never published as a whole. More than 40 had been published in journals and magazines such as Prairie Schooner, Kansas Magazine, Rocky Mountain Review, and New York Post. Not long before his death in 1954, March returned to the collection and edited it, leaving 99 fables in all. March's manuscripts of the fables were further edited in 1959 by William T. Going, and published in 1960 by the University of Alabama Press, with illustrations by Richard Brough. The cover won an award at the 1960 Southern Books Competition. 99 Fables in March's oeuvre Although the collection is among the most obscure of March's works, 99 Fables stands as an almost complete picture of the world March inhabited: many of the complex themes that populate much of March's work are here restated in a more simplistic form. The editor of the collection, William T. Going, says, \\"The fables, then, come close to providing as personal a summary of March's world as we are likely to have. Here are all his favorite ideas, the epitomes of the themes of his fiction.\\"From William T. Going's introduction, in \\" Critical reception What few reviews there are (Simmonds lists only three in his William March: An Annotated Checklist) are mixed. According to Allen King, writing in the South Atlantic Bulletin, March \\"emphasizes the platitudes of life by the platitudinous nature of his fables.\\" Harper Lee, in a review of the book, compares March's career with that of Ambrose Bierce: :\\"As one reads the fables, one is haunted by the resemblance of William March to his natural predecessor, Ambrose Bierce. The two men had much in common: their work is criss-crossed with similar themes; both were ridden with personal demons; both viewed life with bitterness; each was a minor genius; and each was the most neglected writer of his time.\\" Canonical status 99 Fables has not yet achieved the status its editor thinks it deserves,Going, \\"Introduction\\" to 99 Fables, p. xviii-xix. though occasionally the book, which was never reprinted and is a relatively rare university press publication, has received significant mention a few times. Leonard Feinberg referred to its \\"poignant cynicism\\" in his Introduction to Satire. An example of March's cynicism is found in the fable, \\"The Unspeakable Words,\\" which was included in a reader on rhetoric. In the fable, a committee investigates linguistic corruption in \\"the Brett language,\\" wishing to eradicate four particular offensive words. They find a five-year-old girl who was raised by deaf and dumb parents, and so can not have learned the four offensive words they hope to ban: :On the morning they visited her, they said solemnly, \\"Do you know the meaning of poost, gist, duss, and feng?\\" :The little girl admitted that she did not, and then, smiling happily, she said, \\"Oh, you must mean feek, kusk, dalu, and liben!\\" :Those who don't know the words must make them up for themselves.

History and key objectives In 2008 Yale University was the first university the Foundation started working with and in 10 months it expanded the network to include the National University of Singapore, Durham University and McGill University. Two years later the Foundation developed an associate university programme which seeks to foster the study of faith and globalisation in a broad range of higher education institutions. The institutions were selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the Initiative, but also to ensure that they have a geographic and cultural spread that lends multiple perspectives to the discipline. Key objectives of the FGI are the following: * Develop multi-disciplinary teaching courses on Faith and Globalisation * Advance knowledge in the field of Faith and Globalisation * Disseminate university research related to Faith and Globalisation * Engage policy-makers and the general public on the topic of Faith and Globalisation * Support the implementation and development of the Foundation's Face to Faith and Faiths Act projects.

He composes music for television and film and is an accomplished guitarist whose work has been noticed in the smooth jazz charts. He has scored a wide variety of reality shows, animation, television commercials, and documentary movies. He has also played guitar on thousands of cues and backed up a number of commercial artists as guitarist and or arranger. He released his first jazz single in 2009, \\"So Cal Drivin\\"; the album of the same name was released later that year. His second album, Outside In, contains the song \\"Ease Up\\", which reached number two on the Billboard Smooth Jazz chart.  Biography  Born in New York City, Sharmat attended Syracuse University as a music major. He transferred to The University of Arizona, finishing his studies at G.I.T. (now called Musicians Institute). Sharmat's early professional years were filled playing gigs and occasional sessions, moving to Las Vegas to play showroom gigs by 1983. Craig returned to Los Angeles in 1985, where he quickly landed the role of guitarist for saxman Ronnie Laws. A tour with singer Randy Crawford soon followed, though Sharmat later moved away from touring to score his first TV series, Disney's Kids Incorporated, arranging and composing the final 3 years of the series. During the same time frame, Sharmat scored the background music to the American TV series Xuxa. Since 1995, Sharmat has written music for America's Most Wanted. This show led to his finding work with Sirens Media, for which he has written the main titles and background music for The Real Housewives of New Jersey among many other shows. He also wrote the opening for the 2007 MTV Movie Awards featuring Sarah Silverman. In 2008, Sharmat scored the movie Gotta Dance, and in 2011 scored Carol Channing Larger Than Life, which was produced and directed by Tony award winner Dori Berinstein. Sharmat is a graduate of Spud Murphy's \\"Equal Interval System\\" (EIS) music composition course.

She responded from Duluth at full speed through a gale and high seas to the scene of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald sinking in 1975. In 1980, she took part in a rescue rated in the top 10 USCG rescues when she helped to save the passengers and crew of the cruise ship Prinsendam after it caught fire in position 57¬∞38\\"N 140¬∞ 25\\"W then while being towed sank off Graham Island, British Columbia. She was one of the first vessels to respond to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. She was decommissioned on 2 March 2001 and sold to the Republic of Ghana to serve in the Ghana Navy. Construction and design Woodrush was built by the Zenith Dredge Company in Duluth, Minnesota as a , Iris or C-Class tender. Her keel was laid on 4 February 1944, and she was launched on 28 April 1944. Like the \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" class tenders in the class, she was constructed of welded steel with a notched forefoot, ice- belt at the waterline, a reinforced bow for icebreaking capabilities. The superstructure was extended to the ship's sides for increased interior volume above the main deck. Her finer lines in the bow and stern and deeper draft were designed to increase seaworthiness. The utilitarian design allowed the vessel to serve as a search and rescue (SAR) or naval platform. Twin diesel generators powered an electric motor that turned a single propeller. As a C-Class tender, Woodrush carried more fuel than the \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Class tenders. She was \\"fitted with power vangs that attached to the bridge wings and manipulated the cargo boom\\" that were used on \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" tenders. Commissioning Woodrush was commissioned on 22 September 1944 under the command of LCDR F. D. Hagaman, USCG. In keeping with the Lighthouse Service practice of naming tenders after foliage, she was named after the Woodrush plant. She was assigned general aids to navigation (ATON) and icebreaking duties with Duluth, Minnesota as her home port. History Woodrush performed many duties and missions in the Duluth, Minnesota district until 31 July 1978. She was part the icebreaking fleet of buoy tenders that kept the shipping lanes open on the Great Lakes a month longer in the winter and months earlier in the spring. This was considered key to the economy of the Great Lakes region. A former commanding officer of Woodrush reported that he deliberately grounded her many times during her buoy tending duties because that was the only way some of the buoys could be set. The Woodrush conducted many rescues during her long U.S. Coast Guard career. She rescued three lightkeepers in the early 1960s who were stranded for three days after an explosion at the remote Stannard Rock Light in Lake Superior. As the only available U.S. Coast Guard cutter available to respond to the Fitzgerald sinking on 10 November 1975, Woodrush was ordered from Duluth at \\"full speed\\" through a \\"gale and high seas\\" and arrived on scene within 24 hours.Wolff, Julius F. (1979). \\"Lake Superior Shipwrecks\\", p. 221. Lake Superior Marine Museum Association, Inc., Duluth, Minnesota, USA. .Stonehouse, Frederick (2006, 7th Ed.). \\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\\", pp. 46‚Äì48, Avery Color Studios, Inc., Gwinn, Michigan. She combed the area along with the SS William Clay Ford and the SS Arthur M. Anderson until daybreak, when debris and oil were finally located. The following summer, Woodrush served as a support vessel for the United States Navy ROV, the CURV, that was used to survey the Fitzgerald wreck.Hemming, Robert (1981). \\"The Gales of November: The Sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald\\", pp. 195‚Äì204. Thunder Bay Press, USA. A few years later, Woodrush was called out to help break ice for some freighters near the Soo Locks. Woodrush eventually got trapped in the ice, and was floated by the ice until it managed to get free, passing right over the Fitzgerald wreck site.Interview with Woodrush skipper Captain Jimmie Hobaugh, 12 September 1994. From 31 July 1978 to 31 March 1980, Woodrush underwent a major renovation at U.S. Coast Guard Yard Curtis Bay, Maryland. She received new diesel engines, a thorough overhaul of her main electrical motor and its control systems, installation of new electrical wiring and switchboards, new water piping and sewage handling systems, and a bow thruster to improve her maneuverability. The crew's living spaces were upgraded and the furnishings were modernized. On 3 June 1980, Woodrush replaced USCGC Clover (WLB-292) in Sitka, Alaska where she home ported for the rest of her U.S. Coast Guard career performing aids to navigation (ATON), icebreaking, and search and rescue (SAR) duties. In 1980, Woodrush helped rescue the passengers and crew from the cruise ship MS Prinsendam that caught fire and sank off Graham Island, British Columbia. The Prinsendam rescue is rated by the U.S. Coast Guard as one of the ten most successful rescues because the nearest airstrip was from the disaster, operations were coordinated with other vessels in the area and Canadian helicopters, and the crew and 520 passengers were rescued without loss of life or serious injury. In 1993, she went to the assistance of the grounded cruise ship, the MV Yorktown Clipper. After serving the U.S. Coast Guard for 57 years, Woodrush was decommissioned on 2 March 2001 and sold to the Republic of Ghana to serve in Ghana Navy as GNS Anzone P30.

It was started as a joke in 1996 by Ottawa, Canada, software developer \\"Natalie P\\", satirizing the stereotype that all assertive, strong women are \\"heartless bitches\\". It is now a repository of thousands of articles, primarily dealing with the expectations and stereotypes that society tries to enforce on men and women, the problems they cause, and how to overcome them. The website particularly rejects \\"sappiness\\" and women considered excessively emotional. Heartless Bitches International claims it does not celebrate being insensitive, manipulative, selfish, cruel, or man-hating; it celebrates the positive qualities in people, like assertiveness, self-reliance, and an unwillingness to be a martyr, which led to them being stereotyped as \\"heartless bitches\\". Apart from admiring these qualities, Heartless Bitches International does not have a party line or rigid set of beliefs, preferring its members to be open-minded and to trust themselves enough to make their own judgments. The website uses \\"bitch\\" to mean the backronym \\"Being In Total Control Honey\\". It was one of the earliest websites catered specifically toward women at a time when the World Wide Web was largely a male domain. It was nominated for a Webby Award in 2002 in the humor category. In 2001 it had over 6,500 members and about 65,000 page views per week. Content Regular columns The majority of HBI's content is user-submitted, but there are a number of semi-regular writers and columns: *Bitchitorial ‚Äì An editorial written by Natalie, who also runs the site and gets most of the mail. *Weak of the Week ‚Äì JadeSyren, the site's \\"bitch-bouncer\\", riffs off the rejected membership applications for the enjoyment of all. The rejected application is presented in full with Jade's commentary in bold. *I'M NOT BITTER ‚Äì A personal column by The Morrigan *Auntie Dote ‚Äì An advice column User-submitted The majority of the articles on Heartless Bitches International are submitted by the readers, and are archived under the heading \\"Deal With It!\\" *Rants ‚Äì Self-explanatory. *Collected Quotes ‚Äì An archive of Heartless Bitches International's \\"quote of the week\\". The quotes all somehow relate the Heartless Bitch philosophy.

Also contains a list of \\"Red Flags\\" to help identify manipulators before they do too much damage. *Nice Guys? BLEAH ‚Äì The biggest 'self saucing' section; It attacks the beliefs of men who think they (\\"nice guys\\") deserve female attention because they act \\"nicely\\"‚Äînot out of the goodness of their hearts or because they care, but because they want something in return‚Äîand then spend their time whining about the \\"fact\\" that women only want to date jerks. As the site says:http://www.heartless- bitches.com/rants/niceguys/ng.shtml : :The section is updated very frequently because of the large amount of mail received from \\"Nice Guys\\" who feel they are misunderstood, as well as people who have had to deal with them. *Sappy Site of the Week ‚Äì Marlene (\\"the queen of mean\\") profiles websites considered laughably sappy, stupid, or both. Similar to Something Awful's \\"Awful Link of the Day\\". *Pukefest ‚Äì Another long and frequently updated section, Pukefest is where readers chime in with lists of things that make them want to puke. It is received and sorted by Natalie. *MaleBag ‚Äì Comments from male readers divided into \\"Signs of Intelligent Life\\", \\"Free Time at the Psychiatric Hospital\\" and \\"They JUST DON'T GET IT\\". There is also general comments from both men and women. *Unclassified Comments ‚Äì Reader mail, positive and negative, some with commentary, some without. Pop culture Examples of Heartless Bitchiness in popular culture. *Honorary Heartless Bitches ‚Äì Examples of women who upheld the Heartless Bitches ideals throughout history, such as over-70s women's rights crusaders The Raging Grannies or the Iceni warrior-queen Boudica. *Adult books ‚Äì Books with Heartless Bitch-style themes and characters for adults. *Children's books ‚Äì Books for children with strong female role models, a lack of princesses needing rescuing and messages about getting off your ass and doing something instead of waiting for things to somehow work out all right in the end. *Movies ‚Äì Movies with Heartless Bitch-style themes and characters. Other There is also a shop selling \\"Heartless Bitch Meanies doll\\" as well as clothing.http://www.heartlessbitches.com/store/stuff2.shtml Membership HBI also has a membership section.

Its habitat includes primary and secondary forests, as well as surrounding grasslands. This species is moderately common within its limited range, but is at risk due to heavy hunting because of its valued scales and meat.Manis culionensis in A synopsis of the mammilian fauna of the Philippine Islands. The Field Museum. This species is distinguished from the closely related Sunda pangolin by its smaller body-to-tail ratio, smaller scales, and a shorter head.

Retrieved on 2016-06-22. Taxonomy Taxidermied Philippine Pangolin displayed at Philippine National Museum.

Itis.gov. Retrieved on 2016-06-22. Five distinct morphological characteristics involving the skull and the scales have been identified which separate it from the closely related M. javanica. Both M. javanica and M. culionensis are grouped in subgenus Paramanis. Paramanis in Wilson and Reeder's Mammal Species of the world: 3rd Edition Genetic isolation leading to the speciation between these species is hypothesized to have been caused by rising sea levels severing a land bridge from Borneo in the Early Pleistocene. The generic name Manis is from the Greek chthonic deity Manes, while the specific name culionensis refers to the island of Culion in Palawan. The local name balintong (also halintong or malintong) means \\"one who rolls over\\" or \\"one who somersaults\\" in the Visayan Cuyonon language. Other names in Cuyonon include balekon or balikon and goling, with the same meaning. In the Palawan language, it is also known as tanggiling (also spelled tangiling), also with the same meaning.  Description  The Philippine pangolin is roughly long, plus a tail. It weighs . Philippine pangolins in captivity can live up to approximately 20 years. It is covered in small triangular scales made of keratin everywhere except the underbelly and face, making up at least 20% of the body weight. It regrows new scales when they are lost and always has the same number of scales throughout their lifespan. The scales come in shades of brown, yellow and olive, making for adequate camouflage at night. Newer offspring have much softer scales than adults and tend to weight about . Areas of the body without scales are covered in a layer of hair. The Philippine pangolin has five sharp claws per foot and powerful appendages used for digging. However, these claws are not used as weapons for attacking or defending other animals. Pangolins can also run solely on their hind legs for a duration, using their tail for balance. Its tail is prehensile, allowing it to grab onto branches or stand on its hind legs, despite being covered in scales. The tail also aids the species with climbing and standing upright or to be used as a weapon to puncture enemies using its sharp scales. The Philippine pangolin's tongue can stretch up to 25 cm (10 inches) long and is coated in an adhesive saliva that is helpful for catching insects. Its head is cone shaped with a long snout and no teeth. Diet The Philippine pangolin is a myrmecophage, so has a diet consisting mainly of but not limited to termites and ants. It has in incredible sense of smell that it uses to find its food. The Philippine pangolin is seem to have strong preferences when it comes to the insects they eat, selectively consuming a certain species of ant or termite they like, or even actively avoiding certain species when there is enough of a food abundance to be picky. Its forefeet are used to dig into mounds and logs while its tongue harvests insects. The pangolin will only ever eat a portion of a termite or ant colony, leaving most of the mound/hill intact for the colony to regrow and act as a continuous food source for the pangolin later down the line. It consumes sand and small stones to help grind food in their stomachs.Philippine Pangolin. The Animal Files. Retrieved on 2016-06-22. Behavior A Philippine Pangolin rolled in a ball, defending itself with its scales A Philippine Pangolin pup nudges its mother, rolled up into a protective ball. The Philippine pangolin is nocturnal and reclusive, tending towards being solitary or in pairs. Because they are mainly active at night, their eyesight is below average. While their hearing is still only about average, they make up for their lack of vision with their extraordinary sense of smell. It generally travels slowly, but can move in a short burst towards safety when it becomes startled, and even has a limited ability to swim. Occasionally, it can be seen standing on its hind legs, balancing on its tail, to help detect nearby predators. While some of their time is spent on the ground foraging, Philippine pangolins are arboreal, and tend to stay in the tree canopy. When sleeping, they prefer to take refuge inside hollow trees. When threatened, they, like all pangolins, secrete a foul odor and roll into a ball, relying on the protection provided by their scales. Many even sleep rolled up into a ball to protect themselves while they are unaware.> They are not known for being territorial animals, but they may be seen leaving their scent to let others know they've taken refuge there for a while. Reproduction While little is known about the reproduction of Philippine pangolins, their mating habits are thought to be similar to those of the Sunda pangolin. Like most pangolins, Philippine pangolins mate in the spring. The same odorous secretion used as a self-defense mechanism is also used in mating habits. The secretion is used by males to assert against other males, attract a mate, and are used by the mother while nurturing their young. The young are born after a gestation period around 18 weeks and are suckled by their mothers about four months.Helmsworth, A. (2011). Manis culionensis. Animal Diversity Web. Usually only one offspring is born at once, and they are carried around on the mothers back for a time. When sleeping or threatened, the mother tends to roll in a ball for defense like usual, but with the young cradled in a ball of their own, encompassed in the mother's ball. At the age of about 5 months, young will separate from their mother. Female pangolins even adopt lone young that have lost their own mother.  Hunting and conservation  The Philippine pangolin, much like every other species of pangolin, is considered threatened due how sought after they are to hunters. Other than the meat, which is a delicacy in certain Asian cultures, the Philippine Pangolin is hunted for their scales, organs, and skin, which are used in traditional medicine. In 2016, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) had to ban the export of pangolin parts, due to how much illegal exporting influenced pangolin hunting. The Zoological Society of London has listed the mammal as an EDGE species.http://www.edgeofexistence.org/species/philippine- pangolin/ References Category:Manis Pangolin, Philippine Category:Mammals of the Philippines Category:Endemic fauna of the Philippines Category:Fauna of Palawan External links * IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group ‚Äì Philippine pangolin ","title":"Philippine pangolin"},{"id":"24060330","text":"Judah and 9th Avenue is a light rail stop on the Muni Metro N Judah line, located in the Sunset District neighborhood of San Francisco, California.

Breau's mastery of an impressionistic Bill Evans style has him pulling ideas and emotion from country music that a pure honky-tonker could never realize.\\" John Kelman of All About Jazz praised the album and called Breau \\"a bolt of lightning when he emerged in the '70s out of Manitoba, Canada\\". Of the album, Kelman wrote: \\"Breau may not have broken any turf in terms of pushing jazz out of the mainstream, but his interpretive skills and ability to retain a tune's essence while reimagining it in a pure jazz context remains evocative to this day.

It is a brick house in the Federal style built around 1830. It was renovated after the Civil War, which brought some Italianate touches to it. Originally it was a tavern along one of the Western New York region's busier transportation routes, renovated into a house by a wealthy local farmer after that business ended. It is a rare surviving Federal-style brick tavern in Orleans County. It is currently vacant and in a state of disrepair, although some restoration efforts have been made. In 2004 it and a nearby barn were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Buildings and grounds The house and barn are located on a lot at the northwest corner of the roads, on the hamlet of Barre Center. The hamlet is a small group of buildings on small lots grouped along the highway in the midst of the surrounding rural area. To the immediate south is a commercial building and church; a general store is located across the street and to the southeast. The land in the area is flat. Exterior At the northeast corner of the lot, the house is a two-story five-by-two-bay structure faced in brick laid in Flemish bond on a stone foundation topped with a gabled roof currently covered in tar paper, pierced by two brick end chimneys. A one-and-a-half-story brick wing with similar roof projects from the south face; from its west projects a frame wing of similar height sided in clapboard. Between the main block and south wing is a small wooden addition in a visible state of disrepair. In the center of the south wing is the entrance to the cellar. A two-brick water table runs across the front of the main block at door sill level. Steps that would lead up to the centrally located main entrance are missing. All windows on the east (front) facade have wide stone lintels and sills; the main entrance has a round-arched stone lintel with keystone, filled with a wooden fan. The center lintel on the second floor has \\"1829\\", the date of the house's construction, carved into it. The wide overhanging eaves at the roofline shelter a wide plain frieze and are supported by wooden brackets. On the north and south sides the brick is laid in common bond instead. The gable fields have blind lunettes with their original wooden fans. The west (rear) elevation has more of the foundation visible, exposing limestone blocks laid in a random ashlar pattern. Only the sills are stone on its windows; flat brick arches top the windows. The south elevation of that wing has one centrally located window on each story. The larger one on the first story has a similar treatment to the eastern first-story windows on the main block; the one above it has a stone sill and flat brick lintel. The west wing's foundation is coursed ashlar on the south elevation, and coursed rubble on the other two. Its cornice is bracketed only on the south side, the side visible from Maple Street. A one- story concrete block addition with gabled roof extends further west from that side. Interior The front door is framed with its original semicircular limestone arch with keystone and impost blocks. It opens on a large square room filling the building's southeast corner and extending two-thirds of its depth. A fireplace with original mantel is on the south wall; a narrow stair goes to the upper story behind the west wall while a door opens onto the rear porch. The past presence of a chair rail in the room is evident from the plaster behind where it was. The original baseboard and some window trim remains. In the north end of the wing are two rooms. The larger one, in the northeast corner, has its black marbleized mantel on its fireplace on the north wall, as well as its original architrave and window moldings. The smaller room, in the northwest, no longer has its mantel but its chimney cupboards remain. The south wing has a single room. A former fireplace has been closed up. From the room a door and former window, now converted into shelving, open into the west wing. In it are two large rooms separated by a core with pantry, closets, and vestibule. The inside of the concrete addition has a track in the ceiling, a water supply and floor drain, attesting to its use as a slaughterhouse. On the second floor of the main block are three bedrooms, all with their original finishes. A steep, narrow stair leads up to the attic, where the original roof framing is visible. It consists of three heavy beech king post trusses with purlins and common rafters, about below the current roof. The two chimneys corbel together and form a common flue. At the south end are the remains of a small brick room. The south wing has a single room upstairs, matching the one below. The ceiling rafters slope down from the collar ties; there is no attic. A cellar, accessed via the bulkhead door on the south side, runs under the entire brick portion of the building. Three more Medina sandstone steps lead into the large room under the south wing, which has the stone cistern parged with mortar in its western half. A load- bearing stone wall with two brick arches supporting brick fireplaces on the north side sits under the divide to the main block; the large room beyond is divided by a wooden partition. Stairs corresponding to the ones on the first floor rise below them to the now-closed opening. The entire cellar is floored in brick; a still-functional perimeter drain empties into a hole in the northwest corner. There is no cellar in the west wing. Instead, there is a crawl space. In the southeast corner is a stone-line well deep. History Original landowner Stephen Skinner had first bought the on which the house now stands from the Holland Land Company, original owners of most of Western New York, in 1827, but did not make any payments after his down payment and the land reverted to the company. He repurchased it the next year and built the main block of the tavern. On several other properties he built a blacksmith's shop, coal house, sawmill and paint shop. This time he was able to make his payments, albeit at some points in cattle rather than cash, and received full title in 1832. At the time of construction, in 1829, there were only two other houses in Barre Center, both modest wooden structures built when Barre Center had been the main stop between Albion and Batavia along the Oak Orchard Road, today Route 98. Among them, a brick house, especially one of that size and stylistic sophistication, stood out. The hamlet grew in the prosperous early 1830s as it developed an agricultural economy, since the travel-related business was being displaced by Benton's Corners, at the junction of Route 98 and what is now NY 31A two miles (3 km) to the north, as the Erie Canal linked Albion with the rest of the state. Skinner sold the house in 1836 to two other men, who soon lost it to foreclosure in the Panic of 1837. Several of Skinner's other properties also went into default, and there is no mention of him or his large family in records from the 1840 census. In 1839 the property was bought by an Edward Rowlandson, who continued its use as a tavern. He was able to operate it successfully, and maps of the area from the 1850s identify it as his tavern. The late Greek Revival molding on some of the interior architraves suggests some of the subdivisions of the interior rooms in the main block occurred under his ownership. Doors were grained as well, and some of the fireplaces may have had stoves added at that time. In 1865 Relly Tinkham, discharged from the Union Army due to a serious illness contracted while guarding hospitals in Baltimore, bought the property. A Barre native who had already acquired other properties originally developed by Skinner, a successful local farmer who had expanded into barrel making before the American Civil War. It is likely that he converted the tavern into a house, as the rise of the railroads had finished the decline in Barre's importance as a transportation stop, and by 1875 no hotels are listed in local business directories. The conversion left the first floor's tavern layout alone, but raised the roof and built the frame western wing with its more modern kitchen. On the front facade he added the Italianate decorative touches to the windows and doors. It is likely that he also had the barn, the property's other contributing resource, built with its denticulated cornice. This may have taken place around 1874 since tax records show a large jump in the property's assessment that year, which may also be due to outbuildings no longer extant. In 1884 he sold the property and moved to another home nearby. Property records for the next two decades are scarce, but during the later years of the 19th century it is likely that some changes were made to the house. Most significant among them were the installation of larger, taller front windows, and the subdivision of the large upstairs room that had previously only had a removable wooden partition. Carl and Sarah Hakes bought the property in 1913. They owned it for another four decades, the longest tenure of any of the house's owners. Their changes consisted of adding modern plumbing, including a bathroom behind the old public room, and heating to the house. In 1957 they sold to their son Wilson, who had been renting the property. He sold it in 1964. From that year on the house was occupied by a series of tenants, most of them farmworkers. The frame wing filled up with furniture, clothing and other discarded items. The main block continued to be occupied, but less frequently maintained. By the end of the 20th century it had become vacant for a few years. Andrea Rebeck, Historic Sites Restoration Coordinator for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, moved into the house to oversee those efforts in preparation for listing on the National Register. An archeological dig was also undertaken.

E. F. Britten \\"The Lotos-Eaters\\" is a poem by Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, published in Tennyson's 1832 poetry collection. It was inspired by his trip to Spain with his close friend Arthur Hallam, where they visited the Pyrenees mountains. The poem describes a group of mariners who, upon eating the lotos, are put into an altered state and isolated from the outside world. The title and concept derives from the lotus-eaters in Greek mythology. Background In the summer of 1829, Tennyson and Arthur Hallam made a trek into conflict-torn northern Spain. The scenery and experience influenced a few of his poems, including Oenone, The Lotos-Eaters and \\"Mariana in the South\\".Thorn 1992 p. 67'' These three poems, and some others, were later revised for Tennyson's 1842 collection.Kincaid 1975 p. 17 In this revision Tennyson takes the opportunity to rewrite a section of The Lotos Eaters by inserting a new stanza before the final stanza. The new stanza describes how someone may have the feelings of wholeness even when there is great loss. It is alleged by some that the stanza refers to the sense of loss felt by Tennyson upon the death of Hallam in 1833.Hughes 1988 p. 91 Poem The mariners are put into an altered state when they eat the lotos. During this time, they are isolated from the world:Kincaid 1975 p. 40 :Branches they bore of that enchanted stem, :Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave :To each, but whoso did receive of them :And taste, to him the gushing of the wave :Far far away did seem to mourn and rave :On alien shores; and if his fellow spake, :His voice was thin, as voices from the grave; :And deep-asleep he seem‚Äôd, yet all awake, :And music in his ears his beating heart did make. (lines 28‚Äì36) The mariners explain that they want to leave reality and their worldly cares: :Why are we weigh‚Äôd upon with heaviness, :And utterly consumed with sharp distress, :While all things else have rest from weariness? :All things have rest: why should we toil alone, :We only toil, who are the first of things, :And make perpetual moan, :Still from one sorrow to another thrown; :Nor ever fold our wings, :And cease from wanderings, :Nor steep our brows in slumber‚Äôs holy balm; :Nor harken what the inner spirit sings, :'There is no joy but calm!\\"‚Äî :Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of things? (lines 57‚Äì69) The mariners demonstrate that they realise what actions they are committing and the potential results that will follow, but they believe that their destruction will bring about peace:Kincaid 1975 p. 39 :Let us alone. Time driveth onward fast, :And in a little while our lips are dumb. :Let us alone. What is it that will last? :All things are taken from us, and become :Portions and parcels of the dreadful past. :Let us alone. What pleasure can we have :To war with evil? Is there any peace :In ever climbing up the climbing wave? :All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave :In silence‚Äîripen, fall, and cease: :Give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease. (lines 88‚Äì98) Although the mariners are isolated from the world, they are connected in that they act in unison. This relationship continues until the very end when the narrator describes their brotherhood as they abandon the world:Kincaid 1975 pp. 40‚Äì41 :Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind, :In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined :On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind. :For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl‚Äôd :Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl‚Äôd :Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world; :Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands, :Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands, :Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and praying hands. :But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song :Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong, :Like a tale of little meaning tho‚Äô the words are strong; :Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil, :Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil, :Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil; :Till they perish and they suffer‚Äîsome, ‚Äôtis whisper‚Äôd‚Äîdown in hell :Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell, :Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel. :Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore :Than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar; :O, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more. (lines 154‚Äì173) Themes The form of the poem contains a dramatic monologue, which connects it to Ulysses, St. Simeon Stylites, and Rizpah. However, Tennyson changes the monologue format to allow for ironies to be revealed.Hughes 1988 pp. 7, 12 The story of The Lotos-Eaters comes from Homer's The Odyssey. However, the story of the mariners in Homer's work has a different effect from Tennyson's since the latter's mariners are able to recognize morality. Their arguments are also connected to the words spoken by Despair in Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, Book One. With the connection to Spenser, Tennyson's story depicts the mariners as going against Christianity. However, the reader is the one who is in the true dilemma, as literary critic James R. Kincaid argues, \\"The final irony is that both the courageous Ulysses and the mariners who eat the lotos have an easier time of it than the reader; they, at least, can make choices and dissolve the tension.\\" Tennyson ironically invokes \\"The Lover's Tale\\" line 118, \\"A portion of the pleasant yesterday\\", in line 92 of The Lotos-Eaters: \\"Portions and parcels of the dreadful past\\". In the reversal, the idea of time as a protector of an individual is reversed to depict time as the destroyer of the individual. There is also a twist of the traditionally comic use of repetition within the refrain \\"Let us alone\\", which is instead used in a desperate and negative manner. The use of irony within The Lotos-Eaters is different from Tennyson's \\"The Lady of Shalott\\" since \\"the Lady\\" lacks control over her life. The mariners within The Lotos-Eaters are able to make an argument, and they argue that death is a completion of life. With this argument, they push for a release of tension that serves only to create more tension. Thus, the mariners are appealing yet unappealing at the same time.Kincaid 1975 pp. 3, 12, 31, 39 In structure, The Lotos-Eaters is somewhere between the form of Oenone and The Hesperides. In terms of story, The Lotos-Eaters is not obscure like The Hesperides nor as all-encompassing as Oenone but it still relies on a frame like the other two. The frame is like The Hesperides as it connects two different types of reality, one of separation and one of being connected to the world. Like Oenone, the frame outlines the song within the poem, and it allows the existence of two different perspectives that can be mixed at various points within the poem. The perspective of the mariners is connected to the perspective of the reader in a similar way found in The Hesperides, and the reader is called to follow that point of view to enjoy the poem. As such, the reader is a participant within the work but they are not guided by Tennyson to a specific answer. As James Kincaid argues, \\"in this poem the reader takes over the role of voyager the mariners renounce, using sympathy for a sail and judgment for a rudder. And if, as many have argued, the poem is 'about' the conflict between isolation and communality, this meaning emerges in the process of reading.\\"Hughes 1988 pp. 87‚Äì89 The poem discusses the tension between isolation and being a member of a community, which also involves the reader of the poem. In the song, there are many images that are supposed to appeal to the reader. This allows for a sympathy with the mariners. When the mariners ask why everything else besides them are allowed peace, it is uncertain as to whether they are asking about humanity in general or only about their own state of being. The reader is disconnected at that moment from the mariner, especially when the reader is not able to escape into the world of bliss that comes from eating lotos. As such, the questioning is transformed into an expression of self-pity. The reader is able to return to being sympathetic with the mariners when they seek to be united with the world. They describe a system of completion, life unto death, similar to Keats's \\"To Autumn\\", but then they reject the system altogether. Instead, they merely want death without having to experience growth and completion before death.Hughes 1988 pp. 89‚Äì90 Critical response Tennyson's 1832 collection of poems was received negatively by the Quarterly Review. In particular, the April 1833 review by John Croker claimed that The Lotos-Eaters was \\"a kind of classical opium-eaters\\" and \\"Our readers will, we think, agree that this is admirable characteristic; and that the singers of this song must have made pretty free with the intoxicating fruit. How they got home you must read in Homer: ‚Äî Mr Tennyson ‚Äî himself, we presume, a dreamy lotos-eater, a delicious lotus-eater ‚Äî leaves them in full song.\\"Thorn 1992 qtd. pp. 106‚Äì107 In music The British romantic composer Edward Elgar set to music the first stanza of the \\"Choric Song\\" portion of the poem for a cappella choir in 1907-8. The work, \\"There is Sweet Music\\" (op. 53, no. 1), is a quasi double choir work, in which the female choir responds the male choir in a different tonality. Another British romantic composer Hubert Parry wrote a half-hour- long choral setting of Tennyson's poem for soprano, choir, and orchestra.BBC Radio 3's The Choir program, broadcast 22 January 2012 In the song \\"Blown Away\\" by Youth Brigade, lines from the poem are used, such as \\"Death is the end of life; ah, why/Should life all labour be?/Let us alone. Time driveth onward fast\\" and \\"let us alone; what pleasure can we have to war with evil? is their any peace\\" The poem inspired, in part, the R.E.M. song \\"Lotus\\". \\"There‚Äôs the great English poem about the lotus eaters, who sit by the river and ‚Äî I guess it‚Äôs supposed to be about opium ‚Äî never are involved in life. Maybe there‚Äôs a bit of that in there,\\" said Peter Buck.Q magazine, June 1999 See also * Lotos Club Notes References * Hughes, Linda. The Manyfac√®d Glass.

Dragoslav or Ion Dragoslav (), pen names of Ion V. Ivaciuc \\"Dragoslav Ion\\" , biographical note in Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914) database, at the University of Florence's Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved August 21, 2009 or Ion Sumanariu IvanciucCƒÉlinescu, p.726 (; June 14, 1875 ‚Äì May 5, 1928), was a Romanian writer. His presence on the local literary scene meant successive affiliations with various competing venues: having debuted with the traditionalist and nationalist magazine SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul, he later connected the eclectically conservative Convorbiri Critice group of Mihail Dragomirescu with the Romanian Symbolist movement leaders Alexandru Macedonski and Ion Minulescu, before moving close to the modernist trend of Eugen Lovinescu and his SburƒÉtorul. Noted for his contributions to fantasy, children's literature and memoir, Dragoslav defied inclusion in the genres illustrated by his public commitments. His work, often described as picturesque but mediocre, is primarily indebted to Ion CreangƒÉ, through him, to folkloric tradition. Biography A native of FƒÉlticeni to a peasant family, Ivaciuc-Dragoslav completed his secondary studies in the city, where he was in the same class as future writers Lovinescu and Mihail Sadoveanu. Alex Mitru, \\"Patriarhul cuv√Æntului rom√¢nesc se √Æntoarce √Æn amintiri, la Casa din deal\\", in Evenimentul, November 5, 2004 Largely an autodidact, he made his debut in writing in 1903, when his contribution was hosted by the leading traditionalist venue, SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul. He is known to have been studying Letters and Law at the University of Bucharest during 1904. Enache Puiu, \\"Restituiri. Un simbolist dobrogean: Al. Gherghel\\" , in the Ioan N. Roman Library of Constan»õa's Biblion, Nr. 8/2003 During those years, he published his first volumes, the lyric poetry collection Pe drumul pribegiei (\\"On the Path of Wanderers\\"), followed by the short story volumes Facerea lumiii (\\"The Origin of the World\\") and La han la Trei ulcele (\\"At the Three Pitcher Inn\\").Eugen Lovinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne contemporane, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1989, p.160. I. Dragoslav's works made an impression on two rival literary men, Mihail Dragomirescu and Alexandru Macedonski. As he himself recalled in a 1920 article, he found an early mentor in Macedonski, who guided his early literary career and provided him with advice upon their first meeting in Bucharest.Vianu, p.390 Also before 1910, Dragoslav began contributing to Covorbiri Critice magazine and attending its club, which Dragomirescu was hosting at his Bucharest home. Lucian NastasƒÉ, Intelectualii »ôi promovarea socialƒÉ (pentru o morfologie a c√¢mpului universitar) , Editura Nereamia Napocae, Cluj-Napoca, 2002, p.136; e-book version at the Romanian Academy's George Bari»õ Institute of History Previously a follower of the conservative literary society Junimea, Dragomirescu had been directing his efforts toward assembling together some of his former colleagues, alongside writers from traditionalist and Neo-romantic groups like FƒÉt Frumos (Emil G√¢rleanu, Anastasie M√¢ndru, Corneliu Moldovanu and D. Nanu among them), and more eclectic ones‚ÄîPanait Cerna, Gheorghe V√¢lsan, as well as Dragoslav himself.Z. Ornea, Junimea »ôi junimismul, Vol. II, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1998, p.137. In addition to these authors, people who frequented Dragomirescu's circle before its 1910 disestablishment included Symbolist figures (Minulescu, Dimitrie Anghel, Al. T. Stamatiad) or writers of various other orientations (Cincinat Pavelescu, Liviu Rebreanu), joined by visual artists Iosif Iser, Costin Petrescu and George Talaz. The eclectic circle became a post-Junimist venue and a center of opposition to SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul, but, according to literary historian Z. Ornea, failed to impose the \\"new literary school\\" imagined by Dragomirescu. Dragoslav was still living mostly in FƒÉlticeni, where, according to literary historian George CƒÉlinescu, he lived the life of a bohemian and treasured the drinking culture, profiting from the fact that a relative of his was a tavern owner. He was a regular presence at the pub La Plosca Verde (\\"At the Green Wineskin\\") in Ia»ôi. Gina Popa, \\"ToamnƒÉ √Æn c√Ærciumile Moldovei\\", in Evenimentul, September 8, 2007 CƒÉlinescu also notes that, although he boasted a rustic lifestyle, Dragoslav's townhouse was \\"far from a miserable mud hut\\", and that Dragoslav raised ducks, geese and pigs. Dragoslav made frequent trips outside FƒÉlticeni \\"with a giant satchel of manuscripts\\", seeking out fellow writers and addressing them, coarsely, as mƒÉi frate-miu (\\"brother o' mine\\"). Dragoslav pursued a diverse activity in the literary press, and also published his work in, among others, FƒÉt Frumos, FlacƒÉra, LuceafƒÉrul, Ramuri, Universul daily and Via»õa LiterarƒÉ. In 1909, having published Fata popei (\\"The Priest's Daughter\\") and Povestea copilƒÉriei (\\"The Story of Childhood\\"), he joined the Romanian Writers' Society, a professional association founded by Anghel, G√¢rleanu and Pavelescu in 1908. Cassian Maria Spiridon, \\"Secolul breslei scriitorice»ôti\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, April 2008 In 1910, he put out the collections Novele (\\"Novellas\\") and Povestiri alese (\\"Selected Stories\\"), followed in 1911 by Povestea trƒÉznetului (\\"The Story of Thunder\\"). For a while in 1912, Dragoslav was affiliated with the Symbolist and modernist venue Insula, edited by Ion Minulescu. According to critic Paul Cernat, Dragoslav was by then \\"a dissident SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist\\", and, with Constantin Beldie, the only person from the Insula group not to have been a Symbolist.Paul Cernat, Avangarda rom√¢neascƒÉ »ôi complexul periferiei: primul val, Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Bucharest, 2007, p.27. That same year, the writer was among those who welcomed Macedonski back from his extended trip to France (itself caused by literary scandals).Vianu, p.378-379 He viewed the event as an opportunity for restoring Macedonski's prestige, and, in a Rampa article, stated: \\" 'Macedonski has arrived'; this word is on everyone's lips and sounds as if the man has risen from the dead.\\"Vianu, p.379 Together with Stamatiad and M√¢ndru, Dragoslav was instrumental in bridging the gap between Macedonski's Literatorul and Convorbiri Literare, successfully urging Dragomirescu to give his colleague a positive review.Vianu, p.379-380 His volumes followed each other in quick succession: Flori »ôi pove»ôti (\\"Flowers and Stories\\") in 1911; Volintirii (\\"The Volunteers\\") and √émpƒÉratul RogojinƒÉ (\\"Emperor Doormat\\") in 1912; Pove»ôti de sƒÉrbƒÉtori (\\"Holiday Stories\\") in 1913; Pove»ôti de CrƒÉciun (\\"Christmas Stories\\"), in 1914. In 1915, he put out the selected stories volumes SƒÉrƒÉcu»õul (\\"Poor Little Fella\\"). Several of these books saw print in OrƒÉ»ôtie, a town then outside the Kingdom of Romania, in Austro-Hungarian-ruled Transylvania. At an early stage of World War I, when Romania had not yet joined up with the Entente, Dragoslav affiliated with Libertatea, a gazette put out by the controversial agitator and Symbolist poet Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti, which campaigned in favor of the Central Powers and was reportedly financed by the German Empire.Lucian Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\". Elita intelectualƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ √Æn anii Primului RƒÉzboi Mondial, Humanitas, Bucharest, 2010, p.103. However, as the Central Powers occupied the Romanian south and the Romanian front drew close to FƒÉlticeni, Dragoslav reportedly spend much time at the local high school, reading to wounded soldiers. Eugenia Mihalcea, Florina ZƒÉinescu, \\"Casa criticului, 'sf√¢»ôiatƒÉ' √Æn douƒÉ de comuni»ôti. Colegiul lui Vasile T. Lovinescu\\", in Jurnalul Na»õional, July 23, 2009 During the early interwar period, Dragoslav affiliated with Eugen Lovinescu's SburƒÉtorul modernist club, and, in 1921, put out his definitive selection of novellas and sketch stories. By the 1920s, he had fallen severely ill with a disease of the liver, argued by CƒÉlinescu to have been the result of binge drinking. He was hospitalized for ascites, and his peritoneal cavity was drained of over 6 liters of bodily fluid. He was again hospitalized at the Col»õea Hospital, in the care of physician Ioan Nanu-Musceleanu, but died soon afterward in FƒÉlticeni. Critical reception and legacy Critics have traditionally described Dragoslav's stories as picturesque works evidencing some talent, but overall mediocre. His prose is thought to have been heavily influenced by Ion CreangƒÉ, a celebrated late 19th century raconteur, who, like Dragoslav, borrowed inspiration from rural culture and Romanian folklore. The impact of other works on Dragoslav's work was reviewed with severity by CƒÉlinescu, who concluded that the object of his criticism was \\"far from being a writer.\\" Including Dragoslav's work among an \\"eclectic\\" tendency, he rejected most of it as \\"garrulous\\" and \\"adulterous\\" versions from themes provided by other authors, and called the memoir Povestea copilƒÉriei a \\"disgraceful pastiche\\" of CreangƒÉ's Childhood Memories. Lovinescu provides a similar verdict, noting that Dragoslav was an inauthentic peasant, who tried to adapt a \\"popular epic\\" to modern urban subjects, using the comedic work of Ion Luca Caragiale as a template. This results in \\"loose productions\\", in which the better parts are echoes from CreangƒÉ. Dragoslav's works often employ other various narrative motifs found in earlier literature. With La han la Trei ulcele, the author illustrated the pretext of protagonists meeting in inns, a common theme in 19th- and 20th-century Romanian literature (also used by Caragiale, Nicolae N. Beldiceanu, Ioan Alexandru BrƒÉtescu-Voine»ôti, Mihail Sadoveanu, Constantin Sandu-Aldea and Ioan Slavici). Dumitru MihƒÉilescu, \\"Hanul - loc de popas »ôi interferen»õƒÉ a diferitelor destine umane (cu referire la Moara cu noroc de I. Slavici)\\", in the Vasile Goldi»ô West University of Arad's Studii de »ôtiin»õƒÉ »ôi CulturƒÉ, Nr. 4/2008, p.84 CƒÉlinescu deemed Facerea lumii, Dragoslav's main work in the fantasy genre, a \\"sort of glib fairy tale.\\" The story is structured on a biblical model (the Book of Genesis), and introduced by the words: \\"In the beginning of beginnings there was darkness, there was no light, there was no time\\". As noted by Lovinescu, its mythopoeia samples residual Bogomilist beliefs, found among dwellers of the mahala (rather than being \\"truly peasant\\"), and is \\"evidently prolix\\", without \\"plasticity\\". However, the SburƒÉtorul critic also sees such pieces as Dragoslav's \\"most accomplished\\": \\"aside from his ever-present na√Øvet√©, one may identify here a kind of literary styling.\\" Assessments of Dragoslav's literary work divided the literary circles he frequented. An especially supportive voice among literary promoters was that of Mihail Dragomirescu: he described Dragoslav as a new CreangƒÉ, and found some of his works to be masterpieces‚Äîan enthusiasm which Ornea attributes solely to the imperative need of finding new and distinctive works that would impose a dissident aesthetic guideline. Although himself affiliated with Covorbiri Critice, literary reviewer Ion Trivale commented: \\"What is the baggage of Dragoslav the short story writer? Sheer poverty, as far as the artistic sphere is concerned.\\" Liviu GrƒÉsoiu, \\"Redescoperirea unei promisiuni\\", in Convorbiri Literare, May 2006 Nevertheless, CƒÉlinescu saw one of Trivale's major mistakes as being his \\"excessive leniency\\" for both Dragoslav and comediographer Alexandru Cazaban.CƒÉlinescu, p.644 Dragoslav was identified by CƒÉlinescu as the main source of inspiration for PitarcƒÉ, a secondary character in Mihail Sorbul's novel M√¢ng√¢ierile panterei (\\"The Panther's Caresses\\").CƒÉlinescu, p.725 His appearance is also recorded in a portrait drawn by Iosif Iser.

It was the largest battle between underground anti-Nazi resistance and German occupation forces in occupied Europe. Prelude In the Spring of 1944 numerous partisan units operated in the Lublin region, including those associated with the Home Army (AK), Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie (BCh), National Military Organization (NOW) as well as the communist Armia Ludowa (AL) and Russian partisans. These fighters kept being pushed westward by the Germans, as the front approached from the east. The activities of the partisan units mostly consisted of attacks on German supply lines and convoys. As a result, in May 1944, the Germans developed a detailed plan of an anti-partisan action, code named \\"Sturmwind\\" (Storm-wind) which they put into effect in early June. The purpose of the operation was the elimination of Polish and Russian partisan units from the area of Jan√≥w Forests. The German commander in charge was General Siegfried Haenicke. The Russian partisans were under the command of Nikolai Prokopiuk. The NOW-AK forces were commanded by Boles≈Çaw Usow (the top commander of the unit, Franciszek Przysiƒô≈ºniak was not present until later) and the AL units by Stanis≈Çaw Szelest. There were also several \\"mixed\\" units under various commanders. The battle On 14 June the Polish and Russian partisans, numbering around 3,000 in total, found themselves tightly surrounded by German forces. The German units consisted of between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers, with artillery, tanks, armored cars and air support. After an artillery and mortar barrage, the Germans managed to make two breaks in the partisans' line of defense. However, these attacks were eventually driven back, although at a high cost to the Poles and Russians. The Germans, relying on their superior numbers and armaments, managed to take control of a small wood nearby from which they could keep the partisans under constant fire, causing high casualties among them. Using this as a base for further attacks, German forces managed to seize the western side of the Porytowe Hill which breached the main line of defense. However, the Poles and Russians soon counterattacked, recovered the lost positions and, that night (of 14 June), made an attempt to break out from the trap. The main columns of partisans, after fierce fighting, many casualties and a forced 40 kilometer march, managed to reach the relative safety of the Solska Forest. Partisan casualties were about 250, including around 125 killed or missing. 495 Wehrmacht soldiers also died, as well as an unknown number of German police and auxiliary forces. Aftermath While the partisans managed to break out of the trap and effectively win a temporary victory, the Germans had already planned a follow up operation, \\"Sturmwind II\\", centered on the Solska Forest, which led to the Battle of Osuchy at the end of June. The Wehrmacht managed to accomplish in Sturmwind II/Osuchy what they failed to do in Sturmwind I/Porytowe Wzg√≥rze.

PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares. Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Once completed it was turned over for use by the Twelfth Air Force 417th Night Fighter Squadron between 23 July-5 August 1944, flying Bristol Beaufighters.

Management by Mgr. Gendron Mgr. Odore Joseph Gendron was criticized for his management of sexual abuse cases among the clergy. He assigned Rev. Paul Aube to a Rochester parish and put him in charge of a youth program even though Aube had confessed to molesting a minor and requested to be kept away from children. Aube allegedly abused at least seven minors at Rochester. Destroying documents Gendron was accused of destroying documents detailing child sexual abuse by Revs. Philip Petit and Gordon MacRae during the 1980s. 14 priests named for abuse In early 2002, Bishop John McCormack publicly announced the names of 14 priests in the diocese who had been accused of sexually abusing children. In April of that same year, he was removed from his post as chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse. McCormack later admitted to reassigning pedophilic priests, but claimed poor file-keeping had kept him from knowing the full extent of the problem. Calls for resignation Despite repeated calls for his resignation, including from the New Hampshire Union Leader, he has refused to do so, stating, \\"Pope John Paul II appointed me to be your shepherd...I will remain [to] toil ceaselessly on your behalf as bishop of Manchester.\\" Accusation of lying about abuse During a Mass in October 2002, several members of the congregation accused McCormack of lying about a priest he assigned to the parish without disclosing the latter's affair with a teenage boy, leading the Bishop to shout, \\"I'm not lying!\\" 2002-03 Settlement of Abuse Cases In 2003, the diocese reached a settlement with the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office, which was investigating the child sex abuse scandal. The settlement spared the diocese from being criminally charged. In all, in the period of 2002-03, the diocese agreed to a $15.5 million settlement involving 176 claims of sex abuse. The May 2003 settlement of 61 abuse claims for $6.5 million handled by Manchester attorney Ovide M. Lamontagne as counsel for the Manchester Diocese prevented the diocese from being criminally prosecuted. In December 2002, the diocese had admitted that its failure to protect children from sexual abuse may have been a violation of criminal law, becoming the first diocese in the United States to do so. Under threat of indictment by the New Hampshire Attorney General, McCormack signed an agreement acknowledging that the Attorney General office possessed evidence sufficient to win convictions as part of the settlement. Lamontagne claimed that McCormack and other prominent church members wanted a speedy settlement and, in an example of behaving \\"pastorally\\" rather than as a litigant, instructed their attorneys to take a moderate stance and eschew hardline legal tactics. Lamontagne said of the diocese's legal strategy, \\"That is not typical in terms of client requests.\\" Student petition against the bishop In 2005, McCormack spoke at a baccalaureate service at Trinity High School despite a student petition asking him not to attend because of his role in the sex abuse scandal.

In the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Fiscal Year (FY) 2007, Congress expanded the operational incidents a WMD-CST could be used to include the intentional or unintentional release of CBRN and natural or man-made disasters in the United States that result, or could result, in the catastrophic loss of life or property. Overview The WMD-CSTs are National Guard units designed to provide a specialized capability to respond to a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) incident primarily in a Title 32 operational status within the United States, the District of Columbia, its territories and possessions, as established by 10 USC ¬ß12310. Congress, the President, and DoD recognized that the WMD-CSTs, {responding under the authority of the Governor (Only for the National Guard)}, provide significant capabilities to assist local and state agencies that may be overwhelmed by a large-scale terrorist attack or where specific technical capabilities to identify CBRN materials are required. In October 1998, Congress authorized and funded the fielding of the first 10 WMD-CSTs. With this fielding began the development and evolution of new capabilities and concepts to ensure that DoD could support evolving interagency response plans. Since 1998, Congress has authorized and funded the fielding of WMD-CSTs in the remaining States and territories. The WMD-CST consists of 22 National Guard Soldiers and Airmen, in Full-Time duty status; also known as Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) status. The unit consists of six (6) sections: command, operations, administration/logistics, medical/analytical, communications, and survey. The WMD-CST is required to maintain a level of readiness that will allow for a rapid response within established timelines. The unit is specially trained and equipped to assist local, tribal, state, and Federal emergency response organizations with state of the art equipment. They also have a technical and analytical reachback capability to other experts who may assist the local response. The certified WMD-CSTs provide unique capabilities, expertise, and technologies to assist the governors in preparing for and responding to a CBRN situation. These WMD-CSTs are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for rapid deployment for response operations. The WMD-CST complements and enhances local and State capabilities. In order to ensure that the WMD-CSTs are capable of a sustainable, rapid response in support of a validated request for assistance, the following response management plan outlines a standardized approach to provide WMD-CST support anywhere in the United States. The WMD-CST is manned, trained, and equipped to conduct continuous operations for a minimum of 72 hours using organic table of distribution and allowances (TDA) assets. If extended operations, past 72 hours are required, additional WMD-CSTs will be alerted to provide augmentation or relief. Codified as the Response Management Plan (RMP), this document ensures that a designated number of WMD-CSTs are always ready to respond to a national need, or to fill a request of a State without an available WMD-CST. A primary planning assumption is that each JFHQ-State is best informed to create contingency plans for WMD-CST coverage within its jurisdiction. Therefore, this plan is intended to be activated only when a specific support request is received at the NGB Joint Coordination Center (JoCC). NGB initiated operational support requests will be the exception. WMD- CSTs support over 2500 events annually conducting counter WMD activities.

Curriculum Secular The Elementary and Middle School curricula include all the basic secular studies: English, Math, Social Studies and Science. The High School curriculum includes Algebra (1&2), Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, World History, American History, English, and Jewish History (1&2). Advanced Placement courses that TA offers, include Physics, American History, European History, and English Literature. Seniors may optionally take college courses for English 101 and Psychology 101 provided by Baltimore City Community Community College (BCCC) Religious Talmud study begins in 5th grade at an introductory level. Talmudic study in earnest begins in 8th grade with its division into Bekius and Iyyun. Tractates that are studied with the Bekius method include Rosh Hashanah, Sotah, Ta'anit, Megillah, Chagigah, Succah, Brachos and others. Shorter tractates are usually chosen as Bekius tractates. The mesivta has a five-year cycle of Biyun mesechtos to finish. The five year time period ensures that the same tractates are not studied by the same students. The bekies tractates are chosen by the rabbi of the class, and unless circumstances force otherwise, that rabbi will learn the same tractates every year. Mishna is studied until 5th grade until the primary focus becomes Talmudic studies. The learning of Tanach is encouraged by most rabbis on the faculty, though it is not a primary subject after the fifth grade. Most set aside time in the morning for the study of halakha (Jewish law), however in most classrooms this is not a main focus of time and effort. Beis medrash Until 1998, a beis medrash-level shiur was given by Rabbi Yosef Rottenberg. When he became too ill to continue giving the shiur, the beis medrash was discontinued. At the end of 2004, Rabbi Yisrael Asia was brought in to lead the beis medrash, which he did for the 2004‚Äì05 and 2005‚Äì06 school years. During the 2005/06 year, Rabbi Avrohom Notis also gave shiur to the beis medrash. In 2006‚Äì07, the beis medrash was resurrected yet again by Rabbi Bentzion Mellman and Rabbi Dovid Hoffman. Mellman acted as rosh beis medrash and instructor of Iyyun (a slower, in-depth Talmudic analysis) and Hoffman as the \\"Sho'el u-Maishiv\\" (study-hall mentor) and instructor of B'kius (a faster, less in-depth method of Talmudic study). The inaugural class consisted of seven members; however three more students joined the program in the middle of the year. The program continued through the 2008‚Äì09 year, but has been discontinued. Extra-curricular activities TA used to have a varsity basketball team called the Fighting Davids in the '70s and '80s. In the '90s they became the Tigers. The team reached its zenith in the Tamir Goodman era, which was in the late '90s and early 2000s. The team name was then changed to the \\"Thunder\\". Torah Youth Association (TYA) is loosely connected with TA. The Association, headed by Gavi Cohn, serves as an outlet for teenage boys to play sports and hang out in an environment that is acceptable for Orthodox Jewish groups. The TYA sponsors a flag football league based in a public park near TA, and tennis and pizza nights on Motzei Shabbos , as well as an annual Super Bowl party. TYA also hosted shabbatons at the Pearlstone Center in Western Maryland, as well as Camp Shoresh. A Mishmar program for 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students takes place on most Thursdays, in which additional hours of Talmudic study occur. After the learning the 6th and 7th graders have a raffle and pizza is served. The 8th graders begin and end much later than the other students and have a basketball league afterwards followed by cholent. TA sponsors many informal sports and other leisurely activities, such as the (now defunct) chess club, debate club, and the 'tag club' of the mid-1990s. TA also sponsors scholarly and religious programs for students and Jewish residents in the community, such as the small kollel they ran (which recently closed). There was a short-lived varsity baseball team, led by Paul Blitz, a U.S. Army Reserve soldier. In the late 1970s, National Football League player Mike Collier briefly served as gym teacher. Notable visitors TA has hosted a number of famous roshei yeshiva (deans) and other scholars of repute.

On September 29, 1959, 23 minutes into the 41-minute flight from Houston to Dallas Love Field, the aircraft disintegrated in mid-air approximately southeast of Buffalo, Texas, killing everyone on board. Identifying the cause of the disaster proved difficult, as the accident had occurred before the age of cockpit voice recorders. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigated the accident and, after interviewing numerous eyewitnesses and examining the debris field, were able to conclude that the initial failure of the aircraft had begun in the left wing. However, even though it was determined that the wing was destroyed by \\"cycles of reverse bending\\" or \\"flutter\\", the investigation failed to determine how the flutter was caused, and the investigation stalled. In the six months following the accident further progress towards identifying the cause of the flutter was unsuccessful and the case remained unsolved. The breakthrough into unlocking the cause of the accident came after the crash of Northwest Airlines Flight 710 on March 17, 1960. This aircraft, another Electra, had disintegrated in mid-air after losing its wings in a similar fashion to the Braniff aircraft. The investigation into the Northwest crash discovered a new phenomenon of harmonic coupling within the wings of aircraft, which in the end was ultimately identified by the CAB as being the cause of both break-ups. The final accident report for Flight 542 was issued on April 28, 1961.  Aircraft and crew history  Flight 542 was a Lockheed L-188 Electra equipped with four Allison 501-D13 engines. The plane was eleven days old, having come off Lockheed's California manufacturing line on September 18, 1959, and had only 132 hours of flight time. All six crew members ‚Äì two pilots, a flight engineer and three flight attendants ‚Äì had little experience with the Electra, having only recently completed their transition training.  Accident  Flight 542 was originally scheduled to depart Houston for Dallas at 22:15 Central Standard Time (CST) but only managed to depart the ramp at 22:37, 22 minutes late. The delay was due to a minor mechanical discrepancy with the number three generator. The plane was given clearance for takeoff at 22:40 and the crew reported they were airborne by 22:44. Following takeoff, Houston Departure Control handed responsibility of the aircraft over to San Antonio. The crew of Flight 542 reported to San Antonio as being over the Gulf Coast intersection at at 22:52. The flight reached its assigned altitude of at 22:58. The crew subsequently reported to San Antonio that they had passed the Leona omni at 23:05 and then reported via the Braniff company radio that maintenance was required on the number three generator, which they believed had been insufficiently insulated in Houston. Final communication with the aircraft occurred at 23:07. At 23:09, as the aircraft was on course to the Trinidad Intersection, the left wing and number one (left outboard) engine separated from the aircraft. Pieces of the wing, blown back by the wind‚Äìblast, struck and dislodged the horizontal stabilizer. The right wing's planking then broke away and the number four (right outboard) engine tore away. The right wing outboard of the number four engine broke away as well, causing structural damage to the fuselage and triggering the breakup of the aircraft. The fuselage continued to break apart as it fell from the sky. Those who were not killed during the initial break-up of the aircraft were either ejected from the fuselage or trapped within it as it fell. The crash was unsurvivable. Debris from the aircraft was spread out over with many of the larger sections of aircraft landing in a potato field southeast of Buffalo, Texas.  Investigation  NASA employees testing a scale model of the Electra during the early 1960s. Civil Aeronautics Board investigators arrived on the scene the morning following the accident. The left wing was found a mile away from the potato field in which most of the other pieces of aircraft lay, and the pieces of the right wing were scattered in a widespread debris field across the countryside. Investigation determined that the break- up of the plane had begun in the left wing and progressed in a catastrophic sequence which ultimately destroyed the aircraft. However, the reason for the disintegration of the left wing proved to be elusive. Tests found that \\"flutter\\" had destroyed the wing, however the Electra's wings were supposedly flutter-free. Further tests attempting to re-create the accident by weakening the wing and exposing it to loads greater than any which would conceivably have occurred in the actual flight failed to cause a break-up similar to the one that occurred in Flight 542. Help from teams at Boeing, Convair, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also failed to determine how Lockheed's \\"flutter-free\\" wing had simply ripped away during flight, and the investigation stalled, further progress not being achieved for nearly six months. Renewal of interest in finding the cause for the Braniff Flight 542 crash occurred after Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 710, another Electra model aircraft of the same kind as Flight 542, disintegrated in-flight and crashed near Tell City, Indiana, on March 17, 1960. Following the second crash, CAB Chief Safety Investigator Phillip Goldstein was reported as saying: \\"The structure was subjected to forces greater than it was designed for. We have definite evidence of a wing failure. Why this wing failure occurred, I don't know.\\" Initial investigations into the second crash proved fruitless but after laborious testing investigators were able to find flaws in the aircraft which included an overly stiff wing, and outboard nacelles responding differently than intended in the design briefs. Further experimentation discovered that flutter in a nacelle can be passed on to even a \\"flutter-free\\" wing. Final work in the mystery also found that as the magnitude of the flutter grows, the frequency at which it vibrates decreases. In the case of the two Electra crashes the frequency of the flutter had lowered from five cycles per second to three, the same as the natural frequency of the wing, creating harmonic coupling. This harmonic coupling would have continued to cause ever larger wing vibrations until some part of the structure failed. Contributing to the two aircraft's demise was the stiffness of the wings and severe clear-air turbulence. Final analysis of the CAB, in its official Accident Report: ::Conclusion ::There was in this investigation no positive indication of the cause. For this reason, an attempt has been made in this report to eliminate certain possibilities by application of the available evidence to each of them. Once these possibilities have been disposed of, the only remaining causal factor for which there is some known basis is the condition of whirl mode. The probability that this accident was so caused is supported by the following. ::1. So far as is known, the aircraft was in straight and level flight and at a normal cruise speed with no serious mechanical problems. ::2. A sound identified as a supersonic or high speed propeller occurred 30 seconds prior to fuel ignition (wing failure). ::3. There was structural damage evidence compatible with oscillatory motion of the No. 1 QEC and the left wing. ::4. First stage compressor blades of No. 1 engine rubbed the air inlet housing supports. ::5. The probable cause of a similar accident of another Electra was due to whirl mode. ::If prior damage is a requirement for the necessary reduction in stiffness, it must be assumed that the evidence of such damage was either obliterated in the crash or never existed in a discernible form. ::Probable Cause ::The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was structural failure of the left wing resulting from forces generated by undampened propeller whirl mode. The final reports into the two accidents were released four days apart, on April 24 and April 28, 1961, respectively, with the Braniff crash report being the later of the two. The two reports were similar and blamed the same forces for destroying both aircraft.

The date of 20 November is used to mark the start of the Mexican Revolution, or the uprising and civil war that took place from 1910 to 1920. Presidential contender Francisco I. Madero chose the date in his Plan of San Luis Potos√≠ to begin an uprising against President Porfirio D√≠az who had thrown Madero in jail rather than accept his victory in the elections of 1910. Although violence against the D√≠az regime had already broken out in the name of this Plan, the date is still considered official. Preparations alt= The national committee to organize celebrations for both events was created by decree in March 2006 by President Vicente Fox, after Congress declared that the year 2010 should be dedicated equally to both anniversaries. Eventually, the committee came under the direction of Felipe Calder√≥n. Calder√≥n officially installed the Organizing Committee of the Commemoration of the Bicentennial of the Start of the Movement of National Independence and Centennial of the Start of the Revolution in March 2007. In 2007, at the 97th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution, Calder√≥n presented the Base Program of the Commemoration of the Bicentennial of the Start of Independence and the Centennial of the Start of the Mexican Revolution. Most preparations revolved around construction and reconstruction projects as well as planning for events related to 2010. Many of these commemorations were planned for venues outside of Mexico such as in Mexico's 147 diplomatic missions in the world. Mexico is also involved with the Grupo Bicentenario de Latinoam√©rica (Latin American Bicentennial Group). Programs and activities were coordinated among a number of countries for between 2009 and 2011 as many Latin American countries celebrate their bicentennials. This nations include countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Paraguay and Venezuela coordinating events such as debates, publications, celebrations and festivals. In various cities in Spain, the city sponsored an exposition called \\"Ciudad de M√©xico, Ciudad solidaria, Capital de asilos\\" (Mexico City: Capital of Solidarity, Capital of asylum), consisting mostly of Instamatic photographs. It looked back on the country's role as a refuge for political refugees from fascists regimes of World War II as well as from other Latin American countries. In addition to preparations by the federal government, most state governments began similar preparations as well, especially the state of Guanajuato, which is the site of Dolores Hidalgo and El Grito. On 6 September 2009, Felipe Calder√≥n lit the \\"Fuego Bicentenario\\" or Bicentennial Fire in front of the National Palace. This flame traveled all around Mexico over the next twelve months, ending on the date of the Bicentennial of Independence. Media events to promote the upcoming celebrations as well as to retell the stories of both historical events appeared on Mexican television. One example of this was \\"Expedici√≥n 1808, traves√≠a por los bicentenarios de Iberoam√©rica\\" (Expedition 1808: a journey through the Bicentennials of Latin America) In Mexico State, six cities were declared \\"Bicentennial Cities\\", and slated for improvements in their industrial zones, roadways, parks and public space. In Guerrero, the National Institute of Anthropology and History is working to declare the entire old downtown of Chilpancingo as a historic site, due to the multiple events of both the War of Independence and the Revolution that occurred there. In the Zocalo (main square) in Mexico City a large digital clock counted down to 15 September 2010 and 20 November 2010 dates. Similar countdown clocks were located in the cities of Cuernavaca, Tlaxcala, Chilpancingo, Tepic, Nayarit. and all the other capital cities of the 31 states. Projects associated with the Bicentennial Commemorative routes The most visible preparation to date in Mexico itself is the appearance of \\"Ruta 2010\\" signs on many of the nation's highways and roads in most Mexican states. These routes have been created to link monuments related to the two events as well as movements of armies and other key players of both the Bicentennial and Centennial. The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation is in charge of allocating resources to signal these roads and provide tourist information both on their website and on the roads themselves. These routes connect historical sites like the Casa del Marqu√©s in the historic center of Mexico City, the San Diego Fort Museum in Acapulco, the Museum of the Viceroyalty in Tepotzotl√°n, the National Museum of Anthropology, the National History Museum, the Casa de Allende Museum, the Casa Morelos Museum, the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas and the Museum of the Casa of Padre Hidalgo. These roads are subdivided by the specific event they trace. The Independence Road, which includes the Freedom Route, follows the path of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla from Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, to the state of Chihuahua, passing through a number of other states such as Quer√©taro and Michoac√°n. This road traces the first campaigns of the War of Independence to the site of Hidalgo's execution. The Sentiments of the Nation Route, named after the eponymous document by Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n, follows his campaigns through the states of Michoac√°n, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Morelos, Mexico State, Puebla, Veracruz and Chiapas. The Route of the Three Guarantees maps out the campaigns fought by Agust√≠n de Iturbide, who brought the War for Independence to a successful close in 1821. The runs from Iguala, Guerrero, to Mexico City. Routes following the major events of the Mexican Revolution include the Democracy Route, mostly outlining the road taken by Francisco I. Madero from Ciudad Ju√°rez to Mexico City after being elected president in 1911. The route starts in Parras, Coahuila, his hometown, and passes through the cities of San Luis Potos√≠, Ciudad Ju√°rez, Piedras Negras, Torre√≥n, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes and Le√≥n. The Zapatista Route traces the operations of Emiliano Zapata's forces through the states of Morelos, Puebla and Mexico State. The Constitutionalist Revolution Route is the conjunction of the routes of Venustiano Carranza, √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, Pancho Villa and Pablo Gonz√°lez Garza, four other key players of the Revolution. These routes go through just about all of the northern and central states. Infrastructure projects Physical preparations in the city include a Commemorative Arch on Paseo de la Reforma, the new Mexican Children's Library, a Virtual Museum, the movement of the General Archive of the Nation to a new building. The Turkish government is restoring a clock given to Mexico for its Centennial celebrations by the Ottoman Empire. As of August 2009, most of the preparations consisted of restoring historical buildings and sites related to the Bicentennial or the Centennial. Museums in Guanajuato state such as the Casa de Allende Museum, the Museum of Dolores Hidalgo, and the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas have been remodeled and/or inaugurated at a cost of seven million pesos. In Quer√©taro, the The new \\"Bicentennial Park\\" was inaugurated in the north of the capital. In Mexico State, six cities were declared \\"Bicentennial Cities\\", and slated for improvements in their industrial zones, roadways, parks and public space. In Guerrero, the National Institute of Anthropology and History is working to declare the entire old downtown of Chilpancingo as a historic site, due to the multiple events of both the War of Independence and the Revolution that occurred there. The state of Nuevo Le√≥n had 156 projects related to the two anniversaries and the state of Chihuahua will be celebrating the 300th anniversary of its capital city along with the other two. In the restoration projects, the Casa Allende Museum was the first museum to be restored in the Bicentennial celebration. It took two years and seven million pesos. Its doors closed on October 2007 and started its restoration. This museum, reopened its doors and was reinagurated by the Mexican president Felipe Calder√≥n in April 2009. The museum has now a new water pipe system and a draining system, some electric improvements, a new security system and a new illumination for the whole museum.[9] Another important restoration project is found in the Alondiga de Granaditas which is a building where the first encounter took place in the independence. This place has been restored and it took 5.7 million pesos from Mexico's Anthropology Institute. Is a very symbolic place and it has been improved in many ways. Drain pipes, illumination, security cameras and bathrooms are few of the many improvements made to this museum. It has many galleries and writings from the national heroes.[10] There has been also created a huge infrastructure project to celebrate the Mexican bicentennial. It is called \\"Ruta 2010\\", and it is about six new routes. These routes are for Mexicans to understand the meaning and importance of the historical zones in past years. They are also made for Mexicans to enjoy faster and more efficient access to new places. Three of these routes follow the independence movement took place in 1810 that and the other three follow the revolutionary movement of 1910. This project is a cooperation of many Departments of State. The Transportation and Communication department will destine a big part of its resources to install any necessary sign on the correct roadways. The Tourism Department will cooperate with the correct information for Mexicans and Tourists to be informed. This information will announce all the new strategic access points in the new roadways. The \\"Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia\\" (INAH) will also reinforce its facilities in those places where museums, sites and monuments are located. This is to have a stronger Presence on those places that are historically more significant. Many facts were taken into consideration in order to create these routes. Previously, there was not enough access to these historical zones, since many of them are very remote. There was not access through free roads, not even through \\"private roads\\" in which Mexicans pay a fee to use them. Therefore, Government decided to set out these routes, so that Mexicans can have easier and faster access and visit the most important historical places in the country. There is also a project called \\"Mexico es mi Museo\\", it is an important part of the infrastructure project. This project is about the installation of special signs called \\"Mexico es mi Museo\\" (Mexico is my museum). These signs will be located at the most important historical places. The objective of this is to invite Mexicans and tourists to visit museums and get to know better the place in which they are located. This is also for them to understand the role that the place played during the independence and revolutionary movements. There is historical and geographical information available on the official Mexican Bicentennial website. There is also available information for Communication routes and touristic places. People can also call a free number in order to hear more information about the infrastructure project in just a few minutes. Since many of the historical places had a different name in the past, there are guides with the past names and the current names of these places for better reference. There are also maps with the location of these places.

List of Events Mexico City On the night of 15 September 2010 around a million people gathered at the \\"Zocalo\\" and \\"Angel de la Independencia\\" to celebrate two hundred years of freedom. The Angel of the Independence hosted a parade of popular young musicians like Aleks Syntek, Paulina Rubio, Ely Guerra and Natalia Lafourcade.

After the ritual tree \\"mariachi\\" groups and a theater group arrived and performed typical songs of the Mexican culture. Two different shows were presented after this.

At 11:30 Armando Manzanero appeared with the Yucalpeten Orchestra to perform his hits and closed all the celebrations at the Zocalo. Miguel Hidalgo and Benito Juarez sectors are two of the main celebration points in Mexico City. In Benito Juarez sector, activities start with an official ceremony to Mexico's national flag. At night the sector's governor made the traditional \\"grito de independencia\\" to recall the memory of Mexican independence heroes. The events at this sector of the city consisted of coordinated civic events, which had a military ceremony style. In Miguel Hidalgo sector, there was a vast set of cultural performances: the Mexican dance company \\"Itlatiuh\\", then the \\"Sonora Dinamita\\" and the \\"Zona Rica\\", both popular music bands. The event will have the assistance of the orchestras and folklorikal ballets. Like in every traditional celebration there were mariachis, which come right before the \\"grito\\". The governor of this sector algos gives the \\"grito de independencia\\". The events at Miguel Hidalgo have the style of popular cultural events, so they differ a little from the ones in Benito Juarez. A celebratory military parade took place on 16 September 2010 in the presence of President Felipe Calder√≥n. The parade began at 11:00 am with the free fall of 27 paratroopers, 12 from the Navy and 15 from the army.

Northern Mexico The Bicentennial celebrations of the Mexican War of Independence took place all over the country on 15 and 16 September 2010. Celebrations were different in every state, depending on each one's traditions and culture. Northern states, such as Sonora and Chihuahua, had similar celebrations, as well as Baja California Sur (BCS) and Baja California Norte (BCN). All of the local governments of those states made public works like remodeling historic areas and organizing military parades. For example, in Sonora for the parade they reconstructed the \\"Bicentenario Plaza\\" to make the principal ceremony there. Although all northern states had similar celebrations, each one gave a traditional local touch to the Bicentennial events. For the northern states near the Distrito Federal, celebrations were a bit different from other parts of the country, but as important as the main festivity in the capital. In Morelia, Michoac√°n, after the attack in 2008 of an offender group at the ceremony of \\"el Grito de Independencia\\", the government established severer security measures this year. An example of this was the use of metal detectors and the presence of the Mexican Army. In Quer√©taro, the traditional ceremony was performed without conflicts. Some majors began the ceremonies earlier and also took out the prohibition of alcohol. In Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, which was the Cradle of Independence, the president Felipe Calder√≥n re-acted the traditional \\"Grito\\" by saying the original dialogue that Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla proclaimed two hundred years ago. Finally, Coahuila and Colima organized the traditional ceremony with music, dances, fireworks and parties in all the municipalities throughout these five states. Many states of the northwestern area celebrated Bicentennial festivities by organizing commemorative parades. In places like Aguascalientes, Durango, Jalisco, and Nayarit the members of the Army attended the celebrations, but the participation of schools and security institutions characterized the parades. In Aguascalientes, the civic-military parade was made up by 2,040 elements from different schools, as well as 370 members of the Secretar√≠a de Seguridad P√∫blica y Tr√°nsito. In Durango, there were more than 1,500 students from secondary, high school and professional levels, along with 68 professors. In the case of Jalisco, approximately 3,600 people participated, including soldiers, policemen, some members of the Secretar√≠a de Seguridad P√∫blica, etc. The Governor of Nayarit, Ney Gonz√°lez, emphasized that it was because of children, youths and schools that the parade in the state succeeded. In other northern states, such as Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, San Luis Potos√≠ and Zacatecas, the respective governors started the Bicentennial celebrations with the traditional civic ceremony. First, they took possession of the patriotic symbol (flag) and then proceeded to give \\"el Grito de Independencia\\". In these events, the governors mentioned the names of some characters who participated in the War of Independence by saying: \\"Mexicanos, vivan los h√©roes que nos dieron patria; Viva Hidalgo; Viva Morelos; Viva Allende; Viva la Independencia; Viva M√©xico; Viva M√©xico; Viva M√©xico\\". Later, the celebrations were complemented with fireworks, which lasted from 30 to 45 minutes in most of the federal entities. Finally, the festivity concluded with the inauguration of different monuments, public buildings (hospitals), artistic expositions, and with the military march past. South of the country The south of Mexico includes: Tabasco, Veracruz, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Yucat√°n. In general those states celebrated, like the rest of the country, with the traditional \\"Grito\\"-the 15th- and a military parade-16 September-with a few distinguished traditions of each state; moreover, the celebrations distinguished by the presence of some political, and weather problems that limited the original plans. In the state of Oaxaca, the \\"Grito\\" was given at 10:56 pm, in the Zocalo of the city. After the Mexican National Anthem was interpreted, the lights of fireworks illuminate the Cathedral. 16 September began with the hoisting of flag, on the \\"Alameda de Leon\\". The civic-military parade began at 10 am starting from the park \\"El Llano\\" and ending in \\"Plaza del Zocalo\\". When the parade finished, the Mexican national anthem was sung by the voices of the thousands of people that attended to the Zocalo of the city. In Chiapas the Bicentennial Celebration was very similar to Oaxaca. The \\"grito\\" was given in the night of 15 September and the military parade the following day. Moreover, Chiapas began its celebration before, because they also celebrate the fact that Chiapas had become an official state of the country at 14 September 1842. People get organized to set up a flower memorial in honor o Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. The state that had similar parade as Chiapas was Veracruz which involved ten thousand three hundred participants. There were several marching bands from public school students. Much of the people were wearing the colors of the Mexican flag or were characterized like the significant \\"adelitas\\" (women in the Mexican Revolution). Also there was a live play involving the principal characters of the independence and the appearance of the special police which put up the show of rescuing by helicopter. In M√©rida, Yucat√°n people went to the \\"Monumento a la Patria\\" to celebrate Mexico's Bicentennial. From an early hour, people from Yucat√°n and tourists were walking around the \\"Paseo de Montejo\\" which is the most legendary part in the city to celebrate. The entertainment of the night was in charge of the singer Juan Gabriel, Mariachis and a Rock Band. In the hall event, there was the presence of the local and federal police, the Mexican Army, firefighters and the air force. In addition the mayor, governor, legislator and head chief were at the celebration. In Guerrero the principal celebrations took place at the Plaza Civica were the people was entertained by a folk ballet, a play called \\"Hay que darle libertad al preso\\" (Lets gave freedom to the prisoner), and music from famous bands as La Sonora Dinamita. The \\"grito\\" in Michoac√°n was given one hour and a half before of the rain but the authorities said that it was for the people, so they could see the celebrations on Mexico City. There were about 3000 people there. Since the attack of 2008, there was a big safety device with metal detectors and police dogs. The government distributed raincoats to the people present. Tabasco was affected by Hurricane Karl and produced the overflow of the principal rivers. A lot of municipalities were declared emergency places and the celebrations were affected. Andr√©s Granier, governor of Tabasco, suspended the military parade that was going to take place at 16 September. Reflection The twin events have led to reflections on the country's past and present. Luis Arriaga Valenzuela, the director of the human rights center \\"Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel Agust√≠n Pro Ju√°rez, AC\\" in an article written for the Mexican newspaper \\"El Universal\\", pointed out that the Bicentennial represented an opportunity to make a reflection on the current situation of Mexico and the situation it had 200 years ago at the beginning of its independence. He considers that among the advances that Mexico has had in these 200 years, are: greater participation of the people, integration of marginalized groups, rights' organizations, etc. On the other hand, some problems persist and there are new ones for the list of problems. He says that the country side is abandoned, that the indigenous autonomy has not been recognized to the full, and that there is still imposition of certain projects that differs from the will of the communities. He also says that there is a lack of human right protection policies. CNN reported that Mexico's bicentennial was an event that many people waited for several years. Despite this, they reported that many Mexican citizens felt that it was not a good year for celebration because of the problems Mexico has. Citizens were more concerned about the drug war that was taking place in the northern part of the country. Then, some of the Mexican states canceled celebrations. Mexico faced the economic world crisis, being the most affected country of Latin America. In terms of tourism, the nation is suffering a drop because of the violence and the flu pandemic of the previous year. The Mexican government put all their efforts in this celebration but the citizens just felt that it was because the government wanted them to forget the current situation of the country. Time magazine published that after 200 years of the Mexican independence, Mexico had many reasons for celebration. The country had experienced development in economic, cultural, and political issues. In spite of this, Mexican citizens preferred to celebrate it in their homes and not on the local town squares. They were afraid of the insecurity problems that the nation is facing. In many parts of Mexico this celebration was muted by the different problems, especially the drug trafficking. Mexico hoped that the Revolution's centennial celebration would not be spoilt. Considering the Mexican Bicentennial as a positive event is not correct from the perspective of some people. Mexico is first of all experiencing a drug war that\\" has taken more than 28,000 lives\\" within the last four years. For this reason, several bicentennial celebrations, particularly around the Mexican-U.S. border, have been canceled due to safety concerns. Other people criticize the fact of spending tens of millions of dollars that should \\"be better spent on schools, health care and other pressing social needs\\" the country has. In fact, La Prensa interviewed several people who spoke about the \\"celebrations in an uninhabited nation\\" due to the fear and insecurity existing in a lot of northern and central villages in Mexico. The author also criticized that the bicentennial celebrations did not achieved what the country really needs: respect of the law and authority, the honest payment of taxes by the population and their general commitment to the nation. Even if there are some criticisms about the Mexican's Bicentennial celebrations, some other people who were interviewed by La Prensa think that this event creates a \\"sense of unity\\" at a time where Mexicans are \\"living difficult times\\". They say that Mexicans precisely need these kinds of celebrations to \\"confront the problems\\" they are facing, and to come together. Government authorities reported the assistance of over a million people that attended the celebrations due on 15 September in Paseo de la Reforma and Historic center. There were no incidents reported in all the different stages where shows were presented. Marcelo Ebrad thanked all public servants for their participation. There were no injuries and only 9 persons were arrested for carrying weapons, weed and sharp objects. The Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) discussed the possibility of creating a Museum for the Bicentennial. The National Council for Culture and the Arts known as Conaculta, had been evaluating alternatives to see what to do with all the production of both the parade that took place along Paseo de la Reforma, and the show that was due in the Zocalo on 15 September. The reason why they were trying to create this museum is to show all the 7000 costumes used, 27 floats, more than a hundred puppets, the Colossus of 8 tons, 45 giant screens and more than 11 thousand 800 objects and materials used during the Bicentennial celebration of Independence that are now stored in warehouses of the Federal Government SEP had several meetings with the Administrative Office and with its legal department to specify which actions can be taken, within the bounds of the law. The museum was finally created. The national gallery \\"Galeria de Palacio Nacional\\" was inaugurated on 20 September in the National Palace in Mexico City, during the celebration dates, showing an exhibition called \\"Mexico 200 a√±os. La patria en construccion\\". According to the opinion of the man in charge of restoring and looking after the pieces of the exhibition, whose name is Miguel √Ångel Fernandez, it is the right moment for Mexicans to make a reflection about these 200 years of independent life. When he was interviewed by the news agency Milenium, he said that Mexicans can make this reflection after having contact with the moments that led to the construction of the country. Fernandez also referred to the importance of the building where the exposition takes place, Palacio National, which is the location of the executive power, where the presidents carry on \\"El grito\\", and the bell of the independence is rang. He said that the building itself is emblematic. Then he quoted Diego Rivera on the building Placio Nacional:\\"It is the hearth of the Nation\\". The exhibition was full of symbols and patriotic content. It showed elements related to key moments and key personalities for the independence. It includes more than 550 historical pieces. Some examples are the independence act, the sword of Morelos (Independence leader) the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe that was used as an independence movement banner, and the fundamental document for the declaration of the independence, known as \\"Sentimientos de la Naci√≥n\\". Fernandez made a reflection in reference to the exhibition: \\"The exhibition is an emotive and marvelous way, but the construction of the nation do not ends now, this is why this gallery and this great exhibition exist\\".

PHS was made of an asphalt- impregnated jute rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares. Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available. In addition, tents were used for billeting and support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums; drinkable water and a minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Once completed it was turned over for use by the United States Army Air Force Twelfth Air Force 415th Night Fighter Squadron between 17 June-9 July 1944, flying Bristol Beaufighters.

It was announced on August 19, 2009, and released on August 13, 2010. Virtual Programming published the Mac OS X version of the game on September 17, 2010, which is available on the App Store. The game was localized for Russia by 1C Company and Snowball Studios. Like its predecessor, Victoria II allows for the player to take control of and manage a 19th-century state, including its political, diplomatic, economic, military, and technological aspects. The game has many historical aspects to it, such as the ability to colonize places that, at the time, were not under the control of any European power, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, North-Western Canada, and Asia. The time frame of the game is 1836‚Äì1936.  Gameplay  A preview image of Victoria II showing the political map mode, interfaces, and Northern Italy in 1836. Victoria II spans the globe from 1836 up to the start of 1936 with over 200 playable nations.Victoria II Announcement , Paradox Plaza Like its predecessor, Victoria II focuses on internal management, covering the industrialization and social/political changes in a country with 8 different government types. The game gives a lot of importance to the economy of a country by having a complex market system with over 50 types of goods and factories. While warfare is a component of the game it is not the primary focus as in other Paradox Interactive games such as the Hearts of Iron series. Developer Diary 3 ‚Äì Design Philosophy , Paradox Plaza Nations' populations are divided into cultures, religions, and occupations. There are several different population groups (or \\"pops\\"), such as aristocrats, army officers, clergy, soldiers, labourers, slaves, bureaucrats and others. As in other Paradox titles such as Europa Universalis, historical missions called \\"decisions\\", which are micro-objectives in the larger game, have been added. There are thousands of historical events and decisions as well. These events and decisions can lead to the creation or disintegration of nation states. A Paradox Christmas Carol , Paradox Plaza Victoria II contains a number of changes and improvements from its predecessor. The interface was streamlined when compared to the original game, which was described by producer Johan Andersson as, \\"the interface God forgot\\".Victoria II interview, Youtube Automation of various tasks has been added, including trade and population promotion. The education system has received an overhaul by having clergy educate people of the same religion, and each population group now has their own literacy levels. Education and literacy's importance is reflected in the vast technology system that contains thousands of inventions. Additionally, the functioning of ideology in the game was tweaked such that population groups are more sensitive to changes in their country's situation, as well as inclined to agitate for specific levels of political and social reforms. Developer Diary 11 - PoPs & Issues , Paradox Plaza  Economy  The economic system in Victoria II attempts to simulate the flow of resources in a world market. Every province in the game produces a resource in resource gathering operations (RGOs). Some resources, such as wheat, are demanded principally by the population. Other materials, like iron, are consumed primarily by industry, but are still tradeable. The production and unemployment system from the original Victoria has been revised to better reflect market forces, whereas in the original, the state provided the funds for resources and the player possessed a wide range of options with which to build their economy, provided they had access to the proper raw materials. All resources can be collected or produced by industry. The game also has a cottage production system simulating pre-industrial economies.  Diplomacy  Victoria II contains a deep political simulation reflected in 8 different types of governments, 7 ideologies and a new sphere of influence system, gunboat diplomacy, and a new election system with coalition governments and legislatures. The diplomacy in Victoria II is similar to that of other Paradox titles. Each country has a relation value of ‚Äì200 to +200 which represents how much they like each other. Diplomatic and in game actions shift this relationship around and it factors into the AI's decisions. However, Paradox Interactive has expanded parts of this system. War goals from Heir to the Throne, an expansion for Europa Universalis III have been integrated though they function in a slightly different way. More war goals can be added as the war progresses, although this depends on the population's temperament. Failure to achieve a war goal will increase the population's militancy, which can lead to revolts as well as a loss of prestige. In the game controlling a Great Power, one of the eight countries with highest total score, gives special diplomatic options not available to other countries. Great Powers do not just influence how a country sees them; they have the added ability to use their influence on other countries to change their perception of other Great Powers. The struggle for influence that the Great Powers wage around the world is not a simple bilateral basis but occurs with each other inside different countries, giving an added dimension to diplomacy which was not present in the original Victoria.  Warfare  Warfare is regarded as a lesser priority than politics and economics in Victoria II, though it follows the basic pattern used in other Paradox grand strategy games, with armies moving between provinces and engaging enemy armies and capturing enemy territory. The basic combat system is a combination of the systems used in Europa Universalis III, Europa Universalis: Rome, and Hearts of Iron III. A key component to combat is \\"frontage\\": the number of units in an army at the front line, which decreases as technology improves to simulate the change from the roving armies of the Napoleonic Era to the continuous trench lines of World War I. Several aspects of the military have been changed from Victoria. The base unit has been reduced from a 10,000-unit division to a 3,000-unit brigade, which is no longer raised from a national manpower pool but directly raised from a provincial soldier POP, to which the brigade remains connected. A new aspect to the military is reconnaissance. This is a value that gives a bonus (or penalty, if low) to capturing provinces and defeating enemy armies; in prolonged combat, however, the reconnaissance value drops. Units such as cavalry and aeroplanes have high reconnaissance values and are intended to be used as scouts. The overall objective is to move your country on into a new era, in a period of great change.  Development  The decision to create Victoria II was influenced by voting on the Paradox Interactive forums and debate within the company. The CEO of Paradox Interactive, Fredrik Wester, publicly announced his belief that the game would never see a profit while other members of the company such as Johan Andersson were confident it would be profitable. To this end Wester promised that if the game did indeed make a profit he would shave his head and post the pictures onto the forum.A small note from a guy who didn't vote for this project , Paradox Plaza This belief stemmed from the first game's lackluster sales numbers. It was revealed in a German interview with Fredrik that 70,000 copies would need to be sold in order for Victoria II to be profitable. Im Gespr√§ch mit Paradox Interactive , Making Games On June 17, 2010, Jessica Chobot from IGN shaved it off for him.Jessica Chobot shaving Frederik's head , Twitpic. Expansions and mods Victoria II has received two main expansion packs, as well as numerous other smaller additions. It was released before Paradox's current DLC plan was used, so differs from games such as Europa Universalis IV and Crusader Kings II in regards to this. Many players consider the expansions to be essential to gaining full enjoyment from the game, going as far as to dismiss Victoria II without expansions as unplayable; having added not only new content and mechanics, but also significant user experience improvements like the ability to queue unit production, move/select units, and transport these over water (a common complaint addressed in early releases of Paradox titles such as CK2 and EU4 which Paradox has subsequently patched). A House Divided A House Divided was announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 Special E3 Announcement - just for you! , Paradox Plaza as an expansion pack with an aim on \\"[improving the] political and economical aspects of the game, with focus on the American Civil War era\\". It was released on February 2, 2012 for Windows and on March 30, 2012 for OS X; it is currently only available for purchase by download., Paradox Plaza It includes the following features: *A new starting point in 1861, allowing players to experience the American Civil War from the start. *The ability to manufacture reasons to go to war with other countries, all in the name of the great game of power. * For uncivilized countries, various new reform paths to ultimately become equal to the western nations. *The ability for Great Powers to invest in building infrastructure and factories in other countries to strengthen their ties to them. *A deeper political system with new national focus options and new types of reform. *A new system of popular movements that can be appeased or suppressed, but if ignored, will become the revolutionaries of tomorrow. *An improved interface, with more information easily available and improving gameplay. *China is now divided into cliques, known as substates, allowing for more interaction in the Far East. Heart of Darkness The Victoria II: Heart of Darkness expansion was released on April 16, 2013. It includes the following features: *A brand new colonization system; *A new naval combat system; *Significant changes to land combat (particularly forts, recon/siege); *A number of top-level interface upgrades including many new map modes; *Introduction of international crises and many events, allowing smaller nations to achieve their aims with the aid of Great Powers; *Introduction of newspapers which provide information about events around the world; and *Several tweaks to industrial production. Other DLC A selection of smaller DLC has been made available for purchase for Victoria II. These have little to no effect on gameplay but alter the game's appearance or music, and are significantly less expensive than their larger counterparts.

GameSpot said that there was much less micromanagement than in its predecessor. The reviewer stated: \\"Thanks to a friendlier interface and tutorials, Victoria II is a lot more playable and enjoyable than its predecessor.\\"Gamespot GameShark was less enthusiastic. The reviewer said: \\"As a strategy game, Victoria II frustrates me. It is an orgy of detail for detail's sake, yet the information I really want never seems to be at hand. The decisions I make seem mostly inconsequential, changing the game only by a slow process of accretion. Modeling has overtaken game design. Watching Victoria II is hypnotic and frequently awe-inspiring. Unfortunately, you only occasionally might want to play it.\\"GameShark The release of A House Divided drew increased praise and averaged 76% on Metacritic, and Heart of Darkness further increased positive reviews, averaging 81%. Gaming Nexus gave the final product a verdict of 8.5 (\\"very good\\") and commented that \\"after some patching and a couple of expansions, Victoria 2 is rounding into shape. It is still deep with a killer learning curve, but it is starting to feel like a fun game rather than a buggy spreadsheet.\\"  Sequel  In an Ask Me Anything thread on Reddit in October 2013, PDS manager Johan Andersson stated that they would consider making a sequel to Victoria II, but that this would likely come after Hearts of Iron IV. In December 2015, a beta patch was made for Victoria II, long after it was assumed that no further patches would be released. This prompted speculation that there could be refreshed interest in the Victoria series, although in a Reddit thread these rumours were played down by Paradox developers. During an interview for the company's Paradox Podcast in February 2018, CEO Fredrik Wester mentioned \\"I'm not a firm believer that Victoria II is the most prioritised game to make a sequel out of\\", that he won't be the one making the decision either and that it would come \\"before 2025\\".

Although quite an early work, the arabesques contain hints of Debussy's developing musical style. The suite is one of the very early impressionistic pieces of music, following the French visual art form. Debussy seems to wander through modes and keys, and achieves evocative scenes through music. His view of a musical arabesque was a line curved in accordance with nature, and with his music he mirrored the celebrations of shapes in nature made by the Art Nouveau artists of the time. Of the arabesque in baroque music, he wrote:Lesure & Smith (eds.) Debussy on Music 1977, p84. Cited in > ‚Äúthat was the age of the ‚Äòwonderful arabesque' when music was subject to the > laws of beauty inscribed in the movements of Nature herself.‚Äù The arabesques The two arabesques are given these tempo marks: # Andantino con moto # Allegretto scherzando Arabesque No. 1. Andantino con moto This arabesque is in the key of E major. The piece begins with parallelism of triads in first inversion, a composition technique very much used by Debussy and other Impressionists which traces back to the tradition of fauxbourdon. It leads into a larger section which begins with a left hand arpeggio in E major and a descending right hand E major pentatonic progression. The second quieter B section is in A major, starting with a gesture (E-D-E-C), briefly passing through E major, returning to A major and ending with a bold pronouncement of the E-D-E-C gesture, but transposed to the key of C major and played forte. In the middle of the recapitulation of the A section, the music moves to a higher register and descends, followed by a large pentatonic scale ascending and descending, and resolving back to E major. Arabesque No. 2. Allegretto scherzando The second arabesque in G major is noticeably quicker and more lively in tempo. It opens with left hand chords and right hand trills. The piece makes several transpositions and explores a lower register of the piano. Again notable is a hint of the pentatonic scale. It closes in a similar fashion to the first arabesque. The style more closely resembles some of Debussy's later works.

The road largely follows the east bank of the French Broad River until its northern terminus at US 25/US 70 near Marshall in Madison County. Route description NC 251 begins in Buncombe County on the border of Asheville and Woodfin near the University of North Carolina at Asheville campus. The starting point is along Broadway at exit 25 of the freeway currently carrying U.S. Routes 19, 23, and 70 (soon to also carry I-26). After passing Riverside Drive, NC 251 assumes this name as it begins to travel north paralleling a railroad and the French Broad River. Fully in Woodfin, the road travels past numerous commercial businesses located along the river with woods and some residences on the east side of it. Near the northern town limit, NC 251 breaks away from the riverbank to cut through a wooded area dotted with numerous county offices and buildings. After exiting Woodfin, the road remains near the river for the rest of its length. Cliffs and woods are along the east side of the road but only some small houses and small businesses line the west side of the road. After entering Madison County, NC 251 crosses the Ivy River and immediately afterwards, forms a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 25 Business (US 25 Bus.) and US 70 Bus.

The game has been called \\"the most famous football game in Ivy League history\\". Story For the first time since 1909, the football teams of Harvard and Yale were each undefeated with 6-0 records in their conference (8-0 overall) when they met for their season's final game on November 23, 1968 at Harvard Stadium. Led by their quarterback captain Brian Dowling, nationally-ranked Yale was heavily favored to win and they quickly led the game 22‚Äì0. With two minutes remaining on the clock they still led 29‚Äì13. As the last seconds ticked down, Harvard, coached by John Yovicsin, tied the game, scoring 16 points in the final 42 seconds. The Harvard Crimson declared victory with a famous headline, \\"Harvard Beats Yale 29-29,\\" providing the title for Rafferty‚Äôs documentary. Production Created essentially as a one-man production, Rafferty followed a simple production plan by inter- cutting broadcast video of the game with interviews he'd done with close to 50 of the surviving players. The broadcast video was a color kinescope of the WHDH telecast, with Don Gillis doing the play-by-play. The film was set to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 1968 game between Yale and Harvard. The documentary includes game footage with contemporary interviews with the men who played that day, as well as contextual commentary about the Vietnam War, the sexual revolution, Garry Trudeau's Yale cartoons, and various players' relationships with George W. Bush (Yale), Al Gore (Harvard), and Meryl Streep (Vassar).

Mark Feeney of Boston Globe called the film \\"terrifically entertaining\\". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times found the film to be \\"preposterously entertaining\\". Tom Keogh of Seattle Times called it \\"a delightful documentary\\". In greater depth, Bob Hoover of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote \\"Despite his annoying style of lingering a bit too long on his subjects, Rafferty, mainly a TV documentary maker, pries fascinating stories and insights from the now aging players,\\" and Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times wrote \\"A look at the legendary Nov. 23, 1968, game, \\"Harvard Beats Yale\\" is both an irresistible human story and as fine a documentary on football as \\"Hoop Dreams\\" was on basketball\\", calling the film \\"a memorable winner\\". He further notes that the passage of 40 years allowed a unique perspective as the players spoke about \\"what was not only the game of their careers but possibly the experience of their lives\\", and made note of how time led to other celebrity for some of the players, with Tommy Lee Jones becoming an Oscar-winning actor, Brian Dowling becoming the character \\"B.D.\\" in the Doonesbury comic strip (Garry Trudeau attended Yale), and player Bob Levin remembering dating a Vassar undergraduate named Meryl Streep.\\" Underscoring that the film had appeal to more than just sports fans, Bruce Eder of All Movie Guide began his review with \\"it is only fair of this writer to point out that he cares not one whit about, and has not a scintilla of interest in football.

Buckingham is a music producer and guitarist whose work has generated at least 20 gold and 12 platinum record albums and earned him four Grammy Awards. Working as a young studio guitarist in 1977 he was given his first chance to produce a recording for an artist‚Äîit was called \\"I Love the Nightlife (Disco 'Round)\\", by Alicia Bridges. The song became an enduring world-wide hit and a signature song of the disco era, giving Buckingham virtually instant stature in the recording industry. As his career took off, he produced records by Dionne Warwick, Melissa Manchester, Ricky Van Shelton, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Dolly Parton, Tammy Wynette, Shania Twain, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, Garth Brooks and Linda Ronstadt, and is credited on over 350 albums during his career. Buckingham has produced music for four feature films, including a Grammy win for the Muppets recording \\"Follow That Bird (The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\\" He was vice-president of A&R; (artists and repertory) at Columbia Records for ten years, and Senior Vice- President of Vanguard Records and Sugar Hill Records. Later in his career, he became an adjunct instructor of Music History at Vanderbilt University's Blair School of Music in Nashville. Early life Buckingham was born and raised in the Lakeside area of Henrico County, Virginia, which is a suburb of Richmond. At age 15, while attending Brookland Junior High School, he helped form a band called \\"Ron Moody and the Centaurs\\". At that time, beach music was becoming popular and Buckingham's band specialized in it. He stated, \\"We were a band of white boys who could play black music\\". Buckingham's musicianship sharpened through Hermitage High School and on to the University of Richmond, where he continued playing in this same band while majoring in sociology and psychology. During this time he taught himself to read music and studied books on music theory. In 1969 his band went to Baltimore to record at a studio owned by engineer/producer and inventor George Massenburg. Massenburg and Buckingham hit it off musically, and Buckingham spent weekends in the studio learning how to make records. He stated, \\"(it was then) I knew this is what I wanted to do\\". He moved to Muscle Shoals, Alabama and worked as a session guitarist, performing on records by Billy Joe Royal, Johnny Nash and Joe South among others. Buckingham was a natural facilitator between the technical people and the musicians and was often in the control room arranging and writing charts. He said, \\"It was just just something I did, just my nature\\". After Muscle Shoals, he moved to Atlanta, working as a studio guitarist there as well as Los Angeles, Toronto and other cities. Big break In Atlanta in 1977, while working for music publisher Bill Lowery at Doraville's Studio One, Buckingham got a chance to produce his first song. It was called \\"I Love the Nightlife (Disco 'Round)\\", by Alicia Bridges. He also played guitar on it. At first, no record company wanted to put the song out. The publisher was turned down several times before Polydor Records agreed to release it. \\"I Love The Nightlife (Disco 'Round)\\" became a worldwide hit in 1978. This song endured and became a party anthem, and it was on the playlist for clubs across North America and Europe and became one of the signature songs of the disco era. Buckingham's successful production of this song got him noticed in the music industry, namely by Clive Davis, chairman of Arista Records. Buckingham was invited to New York to meet with Davis. Buckingham stated, \\"He grilled me, kept me there for what seemed like hours, playing me things ‚Äî 'Is this a hit? What do you think of this demo?' ... it was like taking college boards.\\" Success Clive Davis then hired Buckingham to produce an album for Melissa Manchester which was successful, and was followed by two more albums for her‚Äî then three albums for Dionne Warwick. With Columbia, Buckingham also signed and produced Mary Chapin Carpenter, who at the time was working as an office clerk. He worked for Columbia for about ten years as Vice President of A&R.; In 1984, he was asked by Rick Blackburn, head of country music at CBS Records, to try a change from pop music to country music by producing Tammy Wynette. Success on this project resulted in Buckingham being hired by CBS as an A&R; man. In this new role, Buckingham discovered and produced Ricky Van Shelton who won the CMA's \\"Male Vocalist of the Year\\" in 1987, with number one songs including \\"Wild-Eyed Dream\\", \\"Life Turned Her That Way\\" and \\"Somebody Lied\\". He produced Van Shelton's song, \\"Wear My Ring Around Your Neck\\" which was featured in the 1992 film, Honeymoon in Vegas. Buckingham produced five albums for Sweethearts of the Rodeo resulting in seven top ten hits. In the 1990s, Dolly Parton was unceremoniously dropped from her label MCA/Universal. She was looking for another label. Simultaneously, Larry Welk (Lawrence Welk's son) had acquired Vanguard and Sugar Hill Records, and offered Buckingham a chance to try new things to revive the labels. In June 1999 Parton and Buckingham happened to be on the same airplane. They were old friends since Buckingham had previously produced 18 of her albums. They switched seats to be able to talk. Buckingham asked her if she would ever consider doing a bluegrass album. This resulted in the album The Grass Is Blue which won a Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album and was named Album of the Year by the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) A subsequent Buckingham-produced Parton hit was \\"Shine\\" (with Nickel Creek), from the album Little Sparrow which won a Grammy for Best Female Country Performance. Buckingham's fourth Grammy award was for Best Contemporary R&B; Gospel album, called All Out by The Winans Family in 1994. The specialized sub-category winners are not broadcast live and often don't receive a lot of publicity. Buckingham recalls receiving a package in the mail. In it, he was surprised to find a Grammy statue. He had been so busy in the studio that he was unaware he had won it. A friend told him, \\"That should tell you something\\". In 1978, Rick Nelson came to Memphis and made the only album he ever made anywhere but Los Angeles, produced by Larry Rogers. For unknown reasons, the CBS executives never released the material, and referred to it only as \\"the Memphis Sessions\\". Then in December 1985, Nelson was tragically killed in a plane crash. After Nelson's death, CBS wanted to release the album but decided to turn it over to Steve Buckingham in Nashville for re-vamping rather than its original supervisor, Larry Rogers. Buckingham's reconstruction of the album involved transferring the material from 16 track analog to 48 track digital tape, replacing the old drum parts with \\"hotter\\" drums, and replacing the guitar parts with a cleaner Fender Telecaster sound. Nevertheless, a controversy arose as to whether hard-to-please Nelson himself would have allowed the release. John Beland, Nelson's guitarist on the original work, said, \\"I'll tell you right from the outset Rick wouldn't have wanted anybody touching those tapes\\". Beland granted that Buckingham was one of Nashville's best producers and was glad that he was given the task if it had to be given to somebody else. Buckingham replied, \\"I knew it was a delicate line. I didn't want to intrude on the things that had already been done, but we couldn't leave it like it was...CBS wanted the project to be of the highest possible quality\\". Jack Hurst of The Chicago Tribune said \\"Buckingham's technique brings Nelson's voice out front as never before\\". All Music Guide lists over 350 albums to Buckingham's credit. Motion pictures Buckingham produced Jim Henson's Muppets who appeared with the Sesame Street cast in the recording \\"Follow That Bird (The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\\" for RCA that won a Grammy in 1986. He produced the end credit song, \\"Brother To Brother\\" for the film, Next Of Kin starring Patrick Swayze. The recording featured vocals by Gregg Allman and Lori Yates. He was the music producer for a CBS network television special in 1996 entitled \\"Dolly Parton: Treasures\\" which featured Parton in concert as she saluted her favorite songs and the writers and performers who popularized them. This included Kenny Rogers, Merle Haggard, Neil Young, Kris Kristofferson, Alison Krauss and others. He produced songs for the feature film Nadine starring Jeff Bridges and Kim Bassinger and also a song in the feature film The Beverly Hillbillies based on the classic television series. Annabelle's Wish is an animated Christmas film for which Buckingham produced two songs. Later life Buckingham gave the commencement address at his Virginia alma mater, the University of Richmond in 2007. He cited the many changes in the recording industry in recent years and advised the graduates, whatever their chosen profession, to stay on the cutting edge of developing technology. He became an adjunct instructor of Music History for the Blair School of Music at Vanderbilt University in Nashville and Virginia Wesleyan University in Virginia Beach. One of his most popular classes is \\"Rhythm and Blues Tore Down the Walls of Segregation\\".

He wrote more than 100 books in Marathi, primarily in the horror genre.List of books written by Dharap Many of Dharap's stories were inspired from contemporary American authors including Stephen King. Shapath was a story inspired by King's \\"IT\\", and Hastar (later made into a film Tumbbad heavily borrowed in parts from King's Gramma. Narayan Dharap was also the first Marathi author to bring HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu to Marathi readers. Dharap earned a B.Sc. (Tech) degree from Mumbai University. The main characters which can be found often in his stories or novels are: Samarth, Appa Joshi, Krishnachandra, Panta. There are assorted stories as well, in which there can be individual heroes/heroines who overcome a situation, sometimes with a little external help, sometimes without it. Most of his stories feature a great battle between good and evil, usually concluding with good triumphant. Some similarities can be found between a few Dharap's stories and Stephen King's. However, Dharap's stories seem to come from Marathi culture and Marathi readers, so the similarity is seen only in a few stories, typically in the area of plot and geography. Horror writing is still not seen with the reverence the way other types of writings are seen in Marathi literature. However Dharap is loved by most of the Marathi readers who have some interest in the horror genre. The general characteristics of Dharap's books include \\"a victory of good over evil\\", \\"origination of the concepts in the book from Marathi culture\\", \\"keeping the story away from any kind of sexual references (which is considered an important factor in any \\"popular\\" horror or suspense literature)\\", \\"despite the books being of the horror genre, keeping the contents away from any kind of gore or offense against 'good taste'\\". Main characters that can be found in Dharap's stories are: Samarth: Samarth is one of the main characters that can be found in many of the Dharap's novels. He is a powerful saint-like person, who helps people out of difficult situations involving bad supernatural powers. He himself is a possessor of great supernatural power, which he has earned with great efforts. He is generally assisted by Appa Joshi, who is a common man with a good heart and highly esteems Samarth. Krishnachandra: Like Samartha, Krishnachandra too is a possessor of great supernatural powers, which he uses to help people in trouble(again with bad supernatural powers/ possessors of those powers/people helping these bad powers). However, unlike Samartha, he enjoys worldly pleasures as well. He is sometimes assisted by a character called Omkar. Pant: Pant is another character that can be found in a couple Dharap stories. However, he doesn't appear in as many books as Samarth and Krishnachandra do. He is a great Tantrik, whose prayer room can appear anywhere he wants. There are some brutal forces hidden behind the statues of various animals in those rooms, which help him to fight against brutal evil in the story. * Samartha - 1968 * Kata 1970 * Angarika 1976 * Chaya 1971 * Samarthanchi sahase 1970 * Ubhe adave dhage 1969 * Krishna 1971 * Samarthanchi Shakti 1972 * Kajli 1970 * Bujagavane 1971 * Krishnachandra, Samarthachiya Sevaka, Chetakeen, Dast, Samarthancha Prahar, Shapath, Sathe, Fayakas References External links ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡§ø‡§™‡•Ä‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ Category:Marathi-language writers Category:1925 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Indian horror writers Category:University of Mumbai alumni ","title":"Narayan Dharap"},{"id":"24061068","text":"The Taeng River or Mae Taeng River (, , ) is a tributary of the Ping River, one of the two main contributories of the Chao Phraya River.

Its purpose was to reduce the number of new HIV/AIDS cases in the country, as it was estimated around half of new cases came from injecting drug use. The policy consisted of multiple methods to reduce the spread of HIV, among which were: Harm reduction efforts; information to the public and in particular to populations most at risk about how HIV is spread; establishing treatment facilities and easier access to substitution treatment for drug addicts; establishing so called dissuasion commissions to persuade drug addicts to go into treatment, and, most importantly, all drug treatment and control units were reorganized into one comprehensive unit. In addition, existing practise of giving drug addicts a waiver for drug possession was codified in a new law. The law (Drug Law 30/2000) maintained the status of illegality for using or possessing any drug for personal use without authorization. However, for persons addicted to said drug, their case was now deemed an administrative offence.https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/prt/law30_html/portugal_law_30_2000.pdf The authority to impose penalties or sanctions in these cases was transferred from the police and justice system to so-called dissuasion commissions if the amount possessed was no more than a ten-day supply of that substance. Status in 1999 In 1999, Portugal had the highest rate of HIV amongst injecting drug users in the European Union. There were 2,000 new cases a year, in a country of 10 million people. In 1997, 45% of HIV reported AIDS cases recorded originated among IV drug users,CNLCS, 1998 so targeting drug use was seen as an effective avenue of HIV prevention. The number of heroin users was estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000 at the end of the 1990s.EMCDDA, 2,000 This led to the adoption of The National Strategy for the Fight Against Drugs in 1999. A vast expansion of harm reduction efforts, doubling the investment of public funds in drug treatment and drug prevention services, and changing the legal framework dealing with minor drug offences were the main elements of the policy thrust. According to Dr Jo√£o Castel-Branco Goul√£o, one of the architects of the decriminalisation policy, a reason why the programme was able to get off the ground was because in Portugal, the problem could not be blamed on any ethnic or economic group in society (as in Brazil and the favelas), allowing other prejudices to be put aside. The policy was, however, initially opposed by right-wing politicians, who feared it would turn Portugal into a narco-state.Vorobyov, Niko (2019) Dopeworld. Hodder, UK. p. 347-349 Harm reduction The needle exchange programme, \\"Say NO! to a used syringe,\\" is a nationwide syringe exchange program which has been ongoing since October 1993, involving some 2,500 pharmacies throughout Portugal. It is run by the National Commission for the Fight against AIDS - set up by the Ministry of Health and the National Association of Pharmacies - a non-governmental organisation representing the majority of Portuguese pharmacies. All drug users can exchange used syringes at pharmacy counters across the country. They get a kit with clean needle syringes, a condom, rubbing alcohol and a written message motivating for AIDS prevention and addiction treatment. From 1994 to 1999, pharmacies delivered around three million syringes annually.EMCDDA, 2000. Reviewing current practice in drug-substitution treatment in the European Union Several low threshold projects were initiated after 1999, particularly in the period 2003-2005, where outreach teams have promoted safe injection practices and supplied needles and injecting equipment on the street. Many of these projects are still running. At programme start, a media campaign was launched by television, radio and the press, and posters were put up in discoth√®ques and bars in order to attract the attention of the target population to the problems associated with drug addiction, in particular HIV transmission through needle-sharing.EMCDDA Project objectives have been threefold: To reduce frequency of sharing needles and syringes, to change other IDU (Intravenous Drug User) behaviors that create negative attitudes among the population in general, and to change attitudes towards IDUs in the general population to facilitate addiction prevention and treatment.Ferreira MO, Madeira A, Teles A, Matias L, Amaro F; International Conference on AIDS. Int Conf AIDS. 1996 Jul 7-12; 11: 152 (abstract no. We.C.3545). Expanding drug treatment In 1987, the Centro das Taipas in Lisbon was created, an institution specialising in the treatment of drug addicts. This centre consisted of a consultation service, a day centre and a patient detoxification unit. This facility was the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, and was the first in the network of centres specialising in treating drug addiction which now covers the whole country. Healthcare for drug users in Portugal is organised mainly through the public network services of treatment for illicit substance dependence, under the Institute on Drugs and Drug Addiction, and the Ministry of Health. In addition to public services, certification and protocols between NGOs and other public or private treatment services ensure a wide access to quality-controlled services encompassing several treatment modalities. The public services provided are free of charge and accessible to all drug users who seek treatment. There are 73 specialised treatment facilities (public and certified private therapeutic communities), 14 detoxification units, 70 public outpatient facilities and 13 accredited day centres. Portugal is divided into 18 districts. There is full coverage of drug outpatient treatment across all but four districts (districts not covered are located in the north of the country: Viana do Castelo, Bragan√ßa, Viseu and Guarda). Substitution treatment Substitution treatment is today widely available in Portugal, through public services such as specialized treatment centers, health centers, hospitals and pharmacies as well as NGOs and non- profit organizations. The Portuguese substitution program started in 1977 in Oporto. The CEPD/North (Study Centre on Drug Prevention/North), using methadone as the substituting substance, was the only unit using opioid substitution until 1992. However, the increase in numbers of drug addicts (including an \\"explosion\\" at the beginning of the 1990s), together with the growth of AIDS and hepatitis C among this population, led to a change in attitude. After 1992, methadone-substitution programs were extended to several CATs (Centres of Assistance to drug addicts). Overall, the programmes were medium or high threshold. With the exception of occasional activities in a slum area in Lisbon, there were no true low-threshold programs (risk- and harm reduction) prior to 2001. From 2000 to 2008, the number of people in Portugal receiving substitution treatment increased from 6040 to 25 808 (24 312 in 2007), 75% of whom were in methadone maintenance treatment. The remaining patients received high dosage buprenorphine treatment. Buprenorphine had been available since 1999, and later also the buprenorphine/naloxone combination. Decree-Law 183/2001 Article 44.1 and Decree-Law 15/93 Article 15.1-3 stipulate that methadone treatment can be initiated by treatment centers whereas buprenorphine treatment can be initiated by any medical doctor, specialized medical doctors and treatment centers. From 2004, there was also the provision of buprenorphine in pharmacies. After-care and social re-integration After-care and social re-integration of drug users in Portugal is organised through three major programmes targeting different regions in Portugal (Programa Vida Emprego, Programa Quadro Reinserir and the PIDDAC incentives for re-integration). All three programmes finance different initiatives and projects supporting drug users through training opportunities, employment support, and/or housing. Monitoring drug treatment A national treatment monitoring system is being developed but has not yet been implemented in all regions. National routine statistics from outpatient centres on substitution clients are available (for clients in methadone and buprenorphine programmes). Laws and regulations In July 2001, a new law maintained the status of illegality for using or possessing any drug for personal use without authorization. The offense was changed from a criminal one, with prison a possible punishment, to an administrative one if the amount possessed was no more than a ten-day supply of that substance. This was in line with the de facto Portuguese drug policy before the reform. Drug addicts were then to be aggressively targeted with therapy or community service rather than fines or waivers.\\"Portugal legalizes drug use\\". BBC News. 7 July 2000. Retrieved 21 August 2009. Even if there are no criminal penalties, these changes did not legalize drug use in Portugal. Possession has remained prohibited by Portuguese law, and criminal penalties are still applied to drug growers, dealers and traffickers. Despite this, the law was still associated with a nearly 50% decrease in convictions and imprisonments of drug traffickers from 2001 to 2015. Regulation Individuals found in possession of small quantities of drugs are issued summons. The drugs are confiscated, and the suspect is interviewed by a ‚ÄúCommission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction‚Äù (Comiss√µes para a Dissuas√£o da Toxicodepend√™ncia ‚Äì CDT). These commissions are made up of three people: A social worker, a psychiatrist, and an attorney. The dissuasion commission have powers comparable to an arbitration committee, but restricted to cases involving drug use or possession of small amounts of drugs. There is one CDT in each of Portugal‚Äôs 18 districts. The committees have a broad range of sanctions available to them when ruling on the drug use offence. These include: * Fines, ranging from ‚Ç¨25 to ‚Ç¨150. These figures are based on the Portuguese minimum wage of about ‚Ç¨485 (Banco de Portugal, 2001) and translate into hours of work lost. * Suspension of the right to practice if the user has a licensed profession (e.g. medical doctor, taxi driver) and may endanger another person or someone's possessions. * Ban on visiting certain places (e.g. specific clubbing venues). * Ban on associating with specific other persons. * Foreign travel ban. * Requirement to report periodically to the committee. * Withdrawal of the right to carry a gun. * Confiscation of personal possessions. * Cessation of subsidies or allowances that a person receives from a public agency. If the person is addicted to drugs, they may be admitted to a drug rehabilitation facility or be given community service, if the dissuasion committee finds that this better serves the purpose of keeping the offender out of trouble. The committee cannot mandate compulsory treatment, although its orientation is to induce addicts to enter and remain in treatment. The committee has the explicit power to suspend sanctions conditional upon voluntary entry into treatment. If the offender is not addicted to drugs, or unwilling to submit to treatment or community service, he or she may be given a fine. Law enforcement Every year, Portuguese law enforcement bodies confiscate several tonnes of cocaine, with a record amount of more than 34.5 tonnes seized in 2006. A regular increase in quantities of cannabis resin seized could also be observed over recent years, though there has been a recent decline between 2008 (61 tonnes) and 2009 (23 tonnes). Observations There is little reliable information about drug use, injecting behaviour or addiction treatment in Portugal before 2001, when general population surveys commenced. Until then, there were the indicators on lifetime prevalence amongst youth, collected as part of the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD), and some other (less reliable) data available through the EMCDDA. Thorough studies on how the various efforts have been implemented were not conducted. Thus, a causal effect between strategy efforts and these developments cannot be firmly established. There are, however, statistical indicators that suggest the following correlations between the drug strategy and the following developments, from July 2001 up to 2007: * Increased uptake of treatment (roughly 60% increase as of 2012.) * Reduction in new HIV diagnoses amongst drug users by 17% and a general drop of 90% in drug-related HIV infection *In April 2009, the Cato Institute published a White Paper about the \\"decriminalization\\" of drugs in Portugal, paid for by the Marijuana Policy Project Cato Institute Annual Report 2009 Data about the heroin usage rates of 13-16-year-olds from EMCDDA were used in the report to claim that \\"decriminalization\\" has had no adverse effect on drug usage rates and that drug-related pathologies - such as sexually transmitted diseases and deaths due to drug usage - had decreased dramatically. *The number of newly diagnosed HIV cases among drug users was 13.4 cases per million in 2009 which is high above the European average of 2.85 cases per million. * Reduction in drug related deaths, although this reduction has decreased in later years. The number of drug related deaths is now almost on the same level as before the drug strategy was implemented. However, this may be accounted for by improvement in measurement practices, which includes a doubling of toxicological autopsies now being performed, meaning that more drugs related deaths are likely to be recorded. * Reported lifetime use of \\"all illicit drugs\\" increased from 7.8% to 12%, lifetime use of cannabis increased from 7.6% to 11.7%, cocaine use more than doubled, from 0.9% to 1.9%, ecstasy nearly doubled from 0.7% to 1.3%, and heroin increased from 0.7% to 1.1% It has been proposed that this effect may have been related to the candor of interviewees, who may have been inclined to answer more truthfully due to a reduction in the stigma associated with drug use. However, during the same period, the use of heroin and cannabis also increased in Spain and Italy, where drugs for personal use was decriminalised many years earlier than in Portugal The Effect of Drug Decriminalization in Portugal on Homicide and Drug Mortality Rates while the use of Cannabis and heroin decreased in the rest of Western Europe. The increase in drug use observed among adults in Portugal was not greater than that seen in nearby countries that did not change their drug laws. * Possibly unrelated, homicide rate increased from 1.13 per 100 000 in 2000 to 1.76 in 2007, then decreased to 0.96 in 2015 * Drug use among adolescents (13-15 yrs) and \\"problematic\\" users declined. * Drug-related criminal justice workloads decreased. * Decreased street value of most illicit drugs, some significantly * The number of drug related deaths has reduced from 131 in 2001 to 20 in 2008. As of 2012, Portugal's drug death toll sat at 3 per million, in comparison to the EU average of 17.3 per million. Legal status of cannabis in Portugal Consumption and possession In Portugal, recreational use of cannabis is forbidden by law. In July 2018, legislation was signed into law to allow for the medical use of cannabis in Portugal and its dispensation at pharmacies. Portugal signed all the UN conventions on narcotics and psychotropic to date. With the 2001 decriminalization bill, the consumer is now regarded as a patient and not as a criminal (having the amount usually used for ten days of personal use is not a punishable crime) but repression persists. One can be sent to a dissuasion committee and have a talk or must pay a fee. According to the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, illegal drug use among Portuguese teenagers declined after 2001, and 45 percent of the country's heroin addicts sought medical treatment. But critics of the policy, such as the Association for a Drug-Free Portugal, say overall consumption of drugs in the country has actually risen by 4.2 percent since 2001 and claim the benefits of decriminalization are being \\"over-egged.\\" Cultivation and distribution The cultivation of cannabis, even on a very small-scale home grown basis for personal use only, can legally be prosecuted. However, an unknown number of enthusiasts of small-scale home-cultivation grow the plants with a high degree of secrecy due to the legal punishment they could face if prosecuted, and due to potential social stigma as well. In neighboring Spain, small-scale cultivation of cannabis plants for personal use only, is tolerated by the authorities and there are many grow shops across the country selling their products physically and online. In 2003 another update to the \\"Portuguese drugs law\\" brought the criminalization of the possession of cannabis seeds, except certified industrial hemp seed. This law made the buying of cannabis seeds from legal and financially transparent online cannabis seed shops based in other European Union member states, such as neighboring Spain or the Netherlands, an unlawful transaction when performed by Portuguese residents. The provision of seeds and tools to produce and consume cannabis is also illegal in the country. Production and distribution of hemp products is legal but regulated. There are a small number of hemp shops in Portugal and hemp products are legal.

It supersedes the Nokia N810. Its default operating system, Maemo 5, is a Linux-based OS originally developed for the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet. It is the first Nokia device based upon the Texas Instruments OMAP3 microprocessor with the ARM Cortex-A8 core. Unlike the three Nokia Internet tablets preceding it, the Nokia N900 is the first Maemo device to include phone functionality (quad-band GSM and 3G UMTS/HSDPA). The N900 functions as a mobile Internet device, and includes e-mail, web browsing and access to online services, a 5-megapixel digital camera for still or video photography, a portable media player for music and video, calculator, games console and word processor, SMS, as well as mobile telephony using either a mobile network or VoIP via Internet (mobile or Wi- Fi).Response from Nokia support to customer enquiry Maemo provides an X-terminal interface for interacting with the core operating system. It was launched at Nokia World on 2 September 2009 and was released in November 2009 in the United States and 9 European countries. The N900 was launched alongside Maemo 5, giving the device an overall more touch-friendly interface than its predecessors and a customizable home screen which mixes application icons with shortcuts and widgets. Maemo 5 supports Adobe Flash Player 9.4, and includes many applications designed specifically for the mobile platform such as a new touch-friendly media player.  History and availability  The Nokia N900 was announced on 17 September 2008 during a keynote presentation by Dr. Ari Jaaksi of Nokia. New supported features were announced for Maemo 5 such as cellular connectivity over 3G/HSPA, TI OMAP3 processor and high definition camera support. No news on backward compatibility for older Internet Tablets and no time frame was established. The release of the pre-alpha Maemo 5 software development kit, in December 2008 targeted exclusively the OMAP3 architecture, revamped the user interface, included support for hardware graphics acceleration and other functionalities not found in Internet Tablets at the time such as cellular data connectivity and high definition camera support. The first photo and specifications of the N900, codenamed Rover while being developed, came out in May 2009. The release of FCC approval documents in August 2009 confirmed the device and provided the second codename RX-51. The Nokia N900 was officially announced on 2 September 2009 at Nokia World 2009 in Germany. Nokia says it is step 4 of 5 in the line of Maemo devices which started in 2005 with the Nokia 770. The device was initially available in selected markets starting November 2009 (4 December in the UK) with a retail price of ‚Ç¨599 in Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain, ‚Ç¨649 in France, 2499 z≈Ç in Poland, 5995 kr in Sweden and ¬£499 in the United Kingdom, all prices including VAT but excluding subsidies. The retail price at launch was US$649 in the United States excluding sales taxes and subsidies. It will be available in Canada through independent retailers for around C$800. As of March 2010 the Nokia site in Australia lists the N900 on the homepage, hinting at launch some time in the near future. Black was the only color available at launch. Initially, availability was extremely limited, leading to further delays. The statement from Nokia was that there was higher pre-order demand than expected. The Nokia N900 launched in Hong Kong on 29 May 2010, with added features to facilitate character handwriting input. Price at launch was 4998 HKD. It has already been released to Australia via Optus.  Hardware  N900 showing system info.  Processors  The Nokia N900 is powered by OMAP 3430 ARM Cortex-A8, which is a system-on-a-chip made by Texas Instruments based on a 65 nanometer CMOS process. The OMAP 3430 is composed of three microprocessors; the Cortex A8 running at 600 MHz (up to 1.15 GHz with correct overclocking) used to run the OS and applications, the PowerVR SGX530 GPU made by Imagination Technologies which supports OpenGL ES 2.0 and is capable of up to 14 MPolys/s and a TMS320C64x, the digital signal processors, running at 430 MHz used to run the image processing (camera), audio processing (telephony) and data transmission. The TMS320 C64x main purpose is to offload the Cortex A8 from having to process audio and video signal. Moreover, the OMAP 3430 on some N900 devices has been successfully over-clocked up to 1150 MHz by using a modified kernel and editing the kernel power configuration file. The system has 256 MB of dedicated high performance RAM (Mobile DDR) paired with access to 768 MB swap space managed by the OS. This provides a total of 1 GB of virtual memory.  Screen and input  The Nokia N900 has a resistive touchscreen with a resolution of 800 √ó 480 pixels (WVGA, 267 ppi). According to both Nokia and the Xorg.log, it is capable of displaying up to 65k colours (565 RGB). Nokia N900 camera capability is 2592x1944 pixels, Carl Zeiss optics, autofocus, Dual LED flash, video light, geo-tagging The LCD is transflective to permit usability over a wide range of luminosity (from daylight to dark). Haptic feedback is provided to touchscreen input by applying a small vibration or a sound; the user can choose whether to have this feature enabled. A stylus is provided to allow more precise touch input and access to smaller user interface elements. A 3-axis accelerometer allows the orientation of the screen to change between portrait and landscape mode in certain applications, or it can be used as user input in games and applications. While the dashboard or desktop is active, rotating the device from landscape to portrait mode activates the phone application (a feature that can also be disabled at user discretion). With update PR1.2, It became possible to view web pages in portrait mode. Developers may add support for portrait mode in their applications if desired. There is a proximity sensor which deactivates the display and touchscreen when the device is brought near the face during a call. The slide-out 4-row keyboard and D-pad of the Nokia N810 have been replaced on the Nokia N900 with a slide-out 3-row backlit keyboard with arrow keys (as with previous Internet Tablets, an on-screen keyboard is also available). In addition to the English QWERTY layout, the slide out keyboard will be available in variants for Italian, French, German, Russian, Czech, Nordic (Finnish, Swedish), and Spanish. The Nokia N900 has an ambient light sensor that adjusts the display brightness and activates the backlit keyboard. The OS comes with a word prediction software that can be configured to the user preferences (auto capitalization, word completion, auto spacing between words). The device has an autonomous GPS with optional A-GPS functionality and comes pre-loaded with the Ovi Maps application. Ovi Maps provides typical mapping features such as alternate views (3D landmarks, satellite, and hybrid maps), address/places of interest searching, and route planning, although it does not have turn-by-turn navigation yet.

The lens, while not in use, is protected by a sliding hatch. Opening the hatch launches the camera application. Although the 0.3-megapixel front camera is capable of video recording at up to 640 √ó 480 pixels and pre-production units could be used for video calls over IP using Google Talk, the retail version was delivered without any software enabling video calling or video chatting.Jerz, Michal http://my-symbian.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=40267&start;=555 In update PR1.2 OTA (over-the-air) Skype video calling was added, enabling the fascia camera.Nokia N900 software update release 1.2 retrieved 28 May 2010 With some software updates the phone becomes capable of play/record/stream 720p video.  Buttons  When holding the device facing the screen; on the top, from left to right, rocking buttons (which function as volume up/down or zoom in/out depending on the context), power on/off and camera button. Pressing the power button brings up a menu to change the profile, activate offline mode (a.k.a. \\"Airplane or Flight mode\\", which turns off all emitted signals), Lock Device (either \\"Secure\\" with key code, or simple lock), and an option to end the current task. As the Nokia N900 has fewer hardware buttons, it makes use of the touchscreen to display on-screen buttons, for example, to accept, reject and end a call.  Audio and output  The N900 has a microphone and stereo speakers located on each side of the device. There is a 3.5 mm four- contact TRRS connector which simultaneously provides stereo audio output and either microphone input or video output. PAL and NTSC TV out is possible using a Nokia Video Connectivity Cable (included upon purchase) or a standard TRRS -> 3x RCA cable. There is a High-Speed USB 2.0 USB Micro-B connector provided for data synchronization, mass storage mode (client) and battery charging. This micro-USB connector was prone to failure.Nokia N900 micro-USB connectors prone to failure? The Nokia N900, unlike previous versions of Nokia's Internet Tablet, hasn't enabled support for USB On-The-Go (the ability to act as a USB host) by default, this in order to meet the deadlines for production and USB certification. There is an ongoing community effort to add this support subsequently, currently the software is in beta stage. Requiring a non- standard USB cable or USB A-A adapter and software from the development repository. The built-in Bluetooth v2.1 supports wireless earpieces and headphones through the HSP profile. The Nokia N900 supports hardware capable of stereo audio output with the A2DP profile. Built-in car hands-free kits are also supported with the HFP profile. File transfer is supported (FTP) along with the OPP profile for sending/receiving objects. It is possible to remote control the device with the AVRCP profile. The DUN profile which permits access to the Internet from a laptop by dialing up on a mobile phone wirelessly (tethering), the HID profile which provides support for devices such as Bluetooth keyboards and PAN profile for networking using Bluetooth are unsupported but can be enabled. The Bluetooth set also functions as an FM Receiver, allowing one to listen to the FM radio. The N900 also has a 88.1‚Äì107.9 MHz FM transmitter which can, for example, play music through a separate radio. (Note that the FM transmitter's frequency range can be extended to 76.0‚Äì107.9 MHz by community supported modifications to the operating system ) Furthermore, the Nokia N900 has Wi-Fi b/g connectivity with support for WEP, WPA and WPA2 (AES/TKIP) security protocols. The Nokia N900 can synchronize with Microsoft Outlook through ActiveSync and various other e-mail and calendar clients through SyncML over bluetooth or the micro-USB. Contact information can also be exchanged via the vCard file format which is supported commonly by e-mail programs, including Evolution and Microsoft Outlook. The device also features an infrared port (not compatible with IrDA) that can be used to turn the Nokia N900 into a remote controller using third- party software.  Battery and SIM  The battery life of the shipped BL-5J (1320mAh) battery in N900 seems very deficient and it was not able to make it through a full working day with an internet connection and call usage. In a press release Nokia stated they are aiming at \\"one day of full usage\\" or \\"Always online : Up to 2-4 days (TCP/IP connected)\\" and \\"Active online usage: Up to 1+ day\\". Early reports from users range from 12 hours (Wi-Fi on, web browsing, video and some GPS), to about 2 days online but not used continuously. The value appears to be highly dependent on the user's choice of background software, active desktop widgets, IM and email polling, as well as mobile network signal quality (especially 3G) and in some cases, software bugs. Nokia reported talk times are around 9 hours with GSM and 5 hours with 3G. Battery life can be extended significantly by switching off GPS/A-GPS, Wi- Fi, and Bluetooth and by replacing 3G by 2G / GPRS. While previous Internet Tablets used larger batteries (1500 mAh compared with the N900's 1320 mAh), they are based on a less efficient microprocessor. Typical battery time for the Nokia N810 is around 7 hours of continuous full usage, display and Wi-Fi on. In principle, on N900 figures are expected to be much higher. Third party extended batteries up to 2400 mAh capacity are available for the N900. Also, there are community supported modifications that can be performed on 3rd party N900 compatible batteries, usually involving putting two of said batteries in parallel, which can increase the effective battery capacity of the Nokia N900 to over 3000 mAh. The SIM card is located under the battery which can be accessed by removing the back panel of the Nokia N900. The microSD(HC) card socket is also located under the back cover (but not under the battery). No tool is necessary to remove the back panel.  Storage  The Nokia N900 has 32 GB eMMC and 256 MB NAND non-removable storage. Additional storage is available via a hot swappable microSDHC card socket, which is claimed to support up to 200 GB of additional storage. However, the SDHC specification supports cards only up to 32 GB in size, and some difficulty has been reported with the use of 64+ GB SDXC cards. Sandisk claims that SDXC cards are not compatible with the N900. Hot swapping is achieved via a software-supported magnetic sensor which detects removal of the back cover, so the partition residing on a microSDHC card is unmounted when the back cover is removed. The microSDHC card can be formatted with a supported file system such as ext2, ext3, FAT16 and FAT32. The 32 GB eMMC is split into 3 partitions: * 2 GB as ext3 mounted to \`/home\` * 768 MB as swap * the remainder as VFAT mounted to /home/user/MyDocs with about 27 GB of free space. The 256 MB NAND is formatted as UBIFS and contains the bootloader, kernel image and root directory \\"/\\" with about 100 MB of free space. Programs larger than 500 kB including dependencies should be stored in \`/opt\` which is symlinked to \`/home/opt\` and therefore located on the 2 GB ext3 partition. The VFAT partition is also available for storage but needs to be used carefully as it is unmounted and exported if a USB cable is connected to the device.  Software  Maemo 5 dashboard showing running applications. Maemo 5, also known as Fremantle, is the default operating system on the Nokia N900. Maemo 5 is Nokia's adaptation of the Linux desktop environment for a pocket-sized device. The UI is fully customizable: the user is able to move widgets around, add/remove widgets, change the background and add shortcuts to applications. The N900 comes preloaded with a variety of applications such as: * Web: Mozilla-based web browser called MicroB, which includes Adobe Flash 9.4 and RSS reader.Maemo Browser features (Updates to Flash 10.1 are available) * Phone application * VoIP: Session initiation protocol, Skype with video chat, Google Talk with Video * Conversations (IM chat and SMS, MMS (only with the PR1.2 software update)) * Media: Camera, Photos, Media player * Productivity: Email, Calendar, PDF reader, Contacts * Ovi Maps (Find position on a map using the GPS, Search an address or location, Plan routes) * Utilities: Clock, Notes, Calculator, Sketch, File manager * System Tools: File manager, Application manager for downloads, Widgets * Games: Bounce, Chess, Mahjong, Blocks (Tetris), Marbles More than 1500 additional applications (an overwhelming majority of them free to download and use) have been created by 3rd party developers.Complete Maemo 5 Software Directory Custom kernels are also available via the App Manager for users who need more out of their devices. Maemo uses upstart to reduce the boot time.Ubuntu Alpha 6 boot optimizations An application called \\"Easy Debian\\" installs a Debian LXDE image on the internal memory, enabling applications such as IceWeasel (Firefox browser) and all of the OpenOffice.org suite to run within Maemo. Other applications in the Synaptic package manager that are included in the Debian installation, such as GIMP, can run within the LXDE interface. Software can also be added to Debian using Maemo's chroot utility using Synaptic or apt-get at the command line, such as Stellarium or the zim desktop wiki, and this can then be accessed either via the LXDE desktop, by icons in the program manager, or by shortcuts on the desktop.  SIM Application Toolkit  In Nokia N900, there is no SIM Application Toolkit available (also known as \\"operator menu\\"), so it is not possible to use any services that require it. As a result, there is no support for a SIM to interact directly with the outside world and initiate commands independently of the handset and the network, making N900 not vulnerable to installation of malicious SIM Java applications via text messages. Issues with various value- added services resulting from no availability of SIM Application Toolkit include the following: * Estonia MobileID (mobile National ID) is not working on N900 * Germany \\"Lycamobile Services\\" is not displayed, which can be used to update the SIM card configuration when it cannot connect to network, by switching between automatic and manual mode * Kenya MPESA & ZAP (mobile money transfer) services are not available on the N900 * Norway \\"mobile BankID\\" is not working (N900 cannot work as mobile banking token). * Philippines \\"Smart Menu\\" is not available on N900 * Romania DigiMobil Roaming is not working on N900 * Romania Vodafone Numar Dual (Dual Number) is not working on N900 * Sweden \\"Mobil BankID\\" is not working on N900 * Tanzania MPESA & ZAP (mobile money transfer) services are not available on N900  Known issues  Nokia often offers new N8 or E7 devices as warranty replacements for N900s. Although warranty terms and consumer rights legislation differ across jurisdictions, users have reported success in refusing those and pressing for an N900 in at least the EU and India as recently as August 2011. Owners who are not confident of getting an N900 as a warranty replacement often attempt to repair their own devices, or sell the Nokia-provided replacement to buy an N900 instead. The N900's proximity sensor, which is designed to lock the touch screen when the phone is against the user's ear to prevent accidental operation, locks the screen unintentionally in bright light (usually outdoors) when a call is placed or received. Nokia has acknowledged that it is a \\"hardware issue\\" and cannot be addressed. To unlock the screen in a phone call, a tactile unlock switch in the right side of the device can be used. This however will keep the touch screen active and accidental operation of the phone keys in a call may occur when device is used as a handset. This issue has been blamed on the application of screen protectors, however N900 users without screen protectors are also experiencing the problem. The N900's MicroUSB (charger) port is very fragile; some people have successfully fixed this problem either with epoxy glue, or by resoldering the USB port onto the circuit board. Some of the chips in N900's GSM module might be badly soldered to the circuit board, resulting in multiple N900 devices reported as troubled by the inability for the SIM card to be detected. This issue is fixable by putting something between the GSM-related chips and their shielding, though a proper fix would be reballing. Future It was announced in May 2010 that the Nokia N900 will be the last mobile communication device running the Maemo 5 operating system, which will be replaced by MeeGo. Nokia will continue to support the N900 with updates when necessary. While transition to the succeeding MeeGo operating system is possible, this is mainly of interest to developers rather than consumers, as it is not officially supported by Nokia. There has been some interest within the user community in working on backporting MeeGo developments to Maemo for the N900, and this places it as being an interesting device for people within the wider Open Source community more than consumers. A download of the MeeGo operating system is available, but not officially supported by Nokia.Meego downloads retrieved 28 May 2010 Nokia used to say that MeeGo was going to succeed Maemo for new devices; however, on 11 February 2011 Nokia announced it will be primarily concentrating on their alliance with Microsoft. MeeGo development will not be stopped and one MeeGo device will become available in 2011. On 3 March 2011, Jukka Eklund, Product Manager, MeeGo OS at Nokia announced in the MeeGo-dev mailing list that there will be a MeeGo 1.2 Developer Edition for N900 developed by a dedicated Nokia team led by Mika Leppinen. The target of this particular edition is to be usable as a primary phone device for a developer/hacker person but not for regular end users. The September 2011 announcement that Intel and the Linux Foundation were abandoning MeeGo in favor of Tizen prompted the developer community to begin to seriously doubt the future of MeeGo on the N900. Subsequently, developers rapidly left the project, leading to an abrupt halt of discussion on the Meego-dev mailing list. The MeeGo Developer Edition after a rename to MeeGo Community Edition evolved into Nemo, which is based on Mer and is currently (October 2012) actively developed. The Nitdroid project, which ports Android to other devices as an alternate operating system, is also available for the N900. However, little progress has been made on achieving voice calling under Nitdroid N900, and the main developer, who goes by the online handle \\"e-yes\\", has moved on to developing for other devices such as the Nokia N9. A community-based project aiming to provide a hardware upgrade for the N900, called Neo900, began in late 2013 as a collaboration between the Openmoko and Maemo communities. The hardware upgrade will quadruple the device's RAM, provide a processor nearly twice as fast as the one in original N900, and integrate additional sensors such as a gyroscope and compass. It is likely that a more modern LTE modem will also be included.

She was a leading figure among the second generation of Bayreuth singers and her voice is preserved on a few acoustic recordings that she made for Edison Records and Path√© Records during the early part of the 20th century. In 1911, she was awarded The King's Medal of Merit by Sweden's monarch. Biography Born Ellen Norgren in Stockholm, Gulbranson studied initially at the Stockholm Conservatory under Julius Gunther and then in Paris with Ellen Kenneth and the great pedagogue Mathilde Marchesi. Subsequently, she also studied with Marchesi's daughter Blanche, who strengthened Gulbranson's top notes and transformed her voice from that of a mezzo-soprano into that of a dramatic soprano. Gulbranson made her operatic debut in 1889 as Amneris in Giuseppe Verdi's Aida in Stockholm, and sang the Wagnerian roles of Br√ºnnhilde and Ortrud there in 1898. She went on to excel in portraying these heroines‚Äîas well as succeeding in the parts of Kundry in Parsifal and Isolde in Tristan und Isolde. In 1896, she made her first appearance at the Bayreuth Festival, then in its 20th year, alternating in the role of Br√ºnnhilde with the veteran diva Lilli Lehmann. Her portrayal was so well received that Lehmann dropped out of the festival. Gulbranson went on to sing annually at Bayreuth until 1914. She also appeared in London at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, in 1900 and 1907. After retiring from the stage in 1915 she worked as a singing teacher. Her most notable pupil was Eid√© Norena. She later became a Norwegian citizen. Gulbranson died in Oslo at the age of 83. She was married to lieutenant colonel Hans Peter Francis Gulbranson and sister in law to Arne Eggen. Their daughter married business executive Ulf Styren.

It was established by law on July 3, 1981 in order to honor the participants of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. It was discontinued in 1999. It is distinct from Cross of the Warsaw Uprising, which was an informal award instituted during the Uprising itself. The decoration was awarded to persons who took an active part in the Warsaw Uprising. In particular: * Soldiers of all the formations that fought in the Uprising. * Members of the Military Women's Service, of the Health Care services of the Uprising and other auxiliary insurrectionist services. * Other persons who were somehow directly involved in the uprising. The cross was awarded to Polish citizens as well as persons who, although they held non Polish citizenship at the time, also fought on the Polish side in the Uprising. The Cross could also have been awarded to foreigners if they took part in the Uprising or contributed to the fighting in some major way. The Cross could have been awarded post posthumously. Usually the awards were made on the anniversary of the uprising or on the Victory Day (May 9) (anniversary of Nazi capitulation). Until 1989 the Cross was awarded by the Polish Council of State and later by the President of Poland, on the recommendation of: * The Minister of Defense ‚Äì in regard to persons who actively participated in the Uprising, whether through armed struggle or in civilian support. * The Minister of Foreign Affairs ‚Äì in regard to persons of Polish citizenship who were living abroad. * The Veterans associations ‚Äì in regard to other eligible persons.

Father George Daniel was parish priest from 2004 from 2012 when Father Emmanuel Yousaf Manni replaced him. To improve relations between Christians and Muslims, the officials at St. Anthony's Church organized a Christian-Muslim meeting on November 19, 2005 and formed Christian-Muslim Rabita (cooperation) Society in Lahore. The parish has other important ministries, including visiting and teaching prisoners. On May 29, 1990, the Inspector General of prisons in Punjab granted permission to church organizations to hold Bible studies with Christian prisoners. Statistics from 1990 indicate that the 28 jails hosted 35,000 inmates. On June 12, 2007, more than one thousand Catholics attended the blessing of the expanded wing of St. Anthony's Church. Archbishop Lawrence Saldanha of Lahore conducted the blessing. The construction took two years and was made with contributions collected largely from locals, with additional help from a few foreign donors. The enlargement raised the church's capacity from 900 to 1,500.

People executed in this way die from injuries caused by hitting the ground at high speed. In ancient Delphi the sacrilegious were hurled from the top of the Hyampeia, the high crag of the Phaedriades to the east of the Castalian Spring.Pericles Collas (n.d.). A Concise Guide of Delphi, pp8. Athens. Cacoulides. In pre-Roman Sardinia, elderly people who were unable to support themselves were ritually killed. They were intoxicated with a neurotoxic plant known as the \\"sardonic herb\\" (which some scientists think is hemlock water dropwort) and then dropped from a high rock or beaten to death.News Scan Briefs: Killer Smile, Scientific American, August 2009 During the Roman Republic, the Tarpeian Rock, a steep cliff at the southern summit of the Capitoline Hill, was used for public executions. Murderers and traitors, if convicted by the quaestores parricidii, were flung from the cliff to their deaths.Platner (1929). A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, Tarpeius Mons, pp509-510. London. Oxford University Press. Suetonius records the rumours of cruelty by Tiberius during the later part of his reign while he was living at Capri, Tiberius would execute people by having them thrown from a cliff into the sea while he watched.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius 62.2 These people were tortured before being executed and if they survived the fall, men waiting below in boats would break their bones with oars and boathooks. In pre-colonial South Africa, several tribes including the Xhosa and the Zulu had named Execution Hills, from which miscreants were hurled to their deaths. These societies had no form of imprisonment so punishment was corporal, capital or expulsion. It is alleged that during the Namibian war of independence numerous SWAPO rebels were dropped from South African helicopters over the sea. During the Spanish Civil War, both the right-wing Nationalist and left-wing Republican sides of the conflict made use of this execution method on their prisoners. During Argentina's Dirty War of the late 1970s, those secretly abducted were often thrown from aircraft, in what were known as death flights. Iran may have used this form of execution for the crime of sodomy. According to Amnesty International in 2008, two men were convicted of raping two university students and sentenced to death.Iran: UA 17/08 - Fear of imminent execution/ flogging Amnesty International They were to be thrown off a cliff or from a great height. Other men involved in this incident were sentenced to lashes, presumably because they did not engage in penetrative sex with the victims.

The literal meaning of Hijron ka Khanqah is a \\"Sufi spiritual retreat for eunuchs\\", with the word hijron (plural of hijra) more widely referring to a specific community of transgender women throughout the Indian subcontinent. It is one of the many monuments located in the Mehrauli village within the Archeological Park. It is maintained well by the Hijras of Turkman Gate, in Shahjahanabad (present day Old Delhi) who are in possession of this 15th- century monument since the 20th century. Hijron Ka Khanqah is a pre-Mughal, Lodi period, monument dated to the 15th century known for the serene atmosphere that exists at the monument where some eunuchs of Delhi were buried during the Lodi dynasty's reign. It is also said that Hijras of Turkman Gate who own this monument now visit the place on religious days to distribute food to the poor. Khanqah is Persian word. It connotes a religious edifice where Muslims of Sufi religious order assemble to achieve spiritual peace and character building. Hijras Hijras of Delhi Hijra generally describes the self-organised spiritual and social community (from either the Hindu or Muslim religious traditions) of transgender women in North India, while in a historical sense it can also denote eunuchs in the Western sense of the word (as males who have been castrated and who serve as members of a royal or noble court). Both eunuchs and hijra are described in South Asian history and literature. The ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata literature features a eunuch (castrated servant) named as Shikhandi, while the treasurer during the reign of Allauddin Khalji in the early 14th century CE is said to have been a eunuch, and the Mughal Emperor Aurengzeb is said to have engaged a eunuch to harass his father, Shahjahan, while the latter was being held in captivity. Meanwhile, the Hijra (transgender) community is associated with the imperial court of the Mughal Empire. The Hijra are a well organized transgender community, considered by some as a \\"religious cult\\" in the sociological sense of the word. Many members of the community describe themselves as belonging to a third gender, and are recognised as such by the governments of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. They are a highly visible community in North India, especially as their presence in marriage functions and at the birth of a child in a house are considered auspicious . Such a presence is also one of their source of livelihood. During family functions, they are even invited to dance, sing, clown, do typical drumming and bless the newly weds and the newborn. Though, no specifically enumerated census data is available of their numbers, a rough estimate puts this figure at about 50,000 in Mumbai and Delhi. Structure Tombs of eunuchs at Hijron ka Khanqah After entering the premises of the monument through a narrow gate, marble steps lead to a large patio where white colored tombs are seen. There is a small terrace adjoining the tombs. The tombs are enclosed on the west in the prayer direction by a wall mosque. Of the many white painted tombs (seen in picture) of Hijras or eunuchs here, the main tomb held in reverence is stated to be of a hijra called Miyan Saheb. Access It is approached through a small gate from the narrow and winding main street of Mehrauli village. Entry to the tomb is restricted. Mehrauli village located in South Delhi is well connected by road, rail and air to all parts of the country. The nearest rail head is the New Delhi Railway Station, which is away. The Delhi International Airport is away. The monument is located in a narrow lane called 'Chatta Wali Gali' in ward no 6 of main Mehrauli road.

The facility was decommissioned in 1992 after the program was exposed by The Washington Post.  Purpose  In the late 1950s, the United States government approached The Greenbrier resort and sought its assistance in creating a secret emergency relocation center to house Congress due to the Cuban revolution and soon after the Cuban Missile Crisis. The classified, underground facility was built at the same time as the West Virginia Wing, an above-ground addition to the hotel, from 1959 to 1962. For 30 years, The Greenbrier owners maintained an agreement with the federal government that, in the event of an international crisis, the entire resort property would be converted to government use, specifically as the emergency location for the legislative branch. The underground facility contained a dormitory, kitchen, hospital, and a broadcast center for members of Congress. The broadcast center had changeable seasonal backdrops to allow it to appear as if members of Congress were broadcasting from Washington, D.C. A radio tower was installed away for these broadcasts. The largest room is \\"The Exhibit Hall\\", beneath a ceiling nearly high and supported by 18 support columns. Adjoining it are two smaller auditoriums, one seating about 470 people, big enough to host the 435-member House of Representatives, and the smaller with a seating capacity of about 130, suitable as a temporary Senate chamber. The Exhibit Hall itself could be used for joint sessions of Congress. The facility had a six-month supply of food, periodically refreshed. What was used by The Greenbrier guests for business meetings was actually a disguised work area for members of Congress, complete with four hidden blast doors. Two of the doors were large enough to allow vehicles to enter. One weighed more than and measured wide and high. Another weighed more than . The doors were thick. The two-foot thick walls of the bunker were made of reinforced concrete designed to withstand a nearby nuclear blast. The center was maintained by government workers posing as hotel audiovisual employees, and operated under a dummy company named Forsythe Associates, based in Arlington, Virginia. The company's on-site employees maintained that their purpose was to maintain the hotel's 1100 televisions. The company's first manager was John Londis, a former cryptographic expert with the Army Signal Corps. He had a top-secret security clearance and was stationed at the Pentagon. Many of these same workers are now employed by the hotel and, for a time, gave guided tours. The complex is still maintained by The Greenbrier, and the facility remains much as it was in 1992, when the secret was revealed in the national press. While almost all of the furnishings were removed following the decommissioning of the bunker, the facility now has similar period furnishings to approximate what the bunker looked like while it was still in operation. Two of the original bunks in the dormitories remain. The bunker was designed to be incorporated into the public spaces of the hotel so as to not draw attention. Much of the bunker space was visible to the public, but went undetected for years, including The Exhibition Hall in the West Virginia Wing, which differs from other public spaces in the hotel due to large concrete columns present for reinforcing. Adjacent to the entrance of The Exhibition Hall is one of the original blast doors, which can now be seen openly, the original screen that once hid its presence removed. AT&T; provided phone service for both The Greenbrier Hotel and the bunker. All calls placed from the bunker were routed through the hotel's switchboard to make it appear as if they originated from the hotel. The communications center in the bunker today contains representatives of three generations of telephone technology that were used. Although the bunker was kept stocked for 30 years, it was never actually used as an emergency location, even during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The bunker's existence was not acknowledged until The Washington Post revealed it in a 1992 story; immediately after the Post story, the government decommissioned the bunker. The facility has since been renovated and is also used as a data storage facility for the private sector. It is once again featured as an attraction in which visitors can tour the now-declassified facilities, now known as \\"The Bunker\\".  Construction  The project used a cut-and-cover style construction method for the creation of the bunker, where material, known as spoil, is removed from the surface and carried away from the site to create a space in which the bunker is constructed. In the case of the Project Greek Island Bunker, the spoil was used in the expansion of a 9-hole golf course and as fill material in a runway extension project at the local municipal airfield. This prevented detection of the project. The government used the West Virginia Wing construction of the hotel as a cover-up for the shelter. The shelter was made to house over 1,000 people, including members of Congress. A huge vault door placed in the shelter was created so that one person could shut it.

The house of the Counts of la Torre Cos√≠o y la Cortina, located on 94 Republica de Uruguay Street in the historic center of Mexico City was built in 1781 and the scene for one of Mexico City's legends. The house is considered to be a fine example of civil architecture of the 18th century, shortly after the First Count De la Cortina received his noble title in 1773. The most notable member of this family would be Justo G√≥mez de la Cortina who was an important social and political figure in New Spain at the beginning of the 19th century. History  The previous house at this location belonged to a rich Spanish merchant named Juan Manuel Gonz√°lez de Cossio, which was built over the former residence of Juan Manuel Sotomayor. Gonz√°lez de Cossio received his title from the Spanish crown in 1773. The mansion itself was built in 1781. Despite being declared a national monument in 1931, the building was partially destroyed to make way to 20 de Noviembre Avenue. Also, nothing of the interior of the building has survived as it has long been adapted for commercial use. Legend Only small remnants of the original interior remain as it has been greatly modified over the years. Legend has it that Gonz√°lez de Cossio suspected that his wife was cheating on him, despite others‚Äô insistence to the contrary. This man sought out a curandero (a kind of healer/magician) who recommended that Juan Manuel kill the first man to pass by his house at 11pm. Juan Manuel decided to take this advice and before killing his victim, he asked the time, then proclaimed ‚ÄúYou are indeed fortunate, for you know the very hour of your death.‚Äù Juan Manuel went on to kill a number of other victims, then repented of his actions. He died mysteriously while performing the penance ordered by his priest. Fa√ßade The fa√ßade has a symmetrical design with three floors. *Main portal: The main portal has a trilobite arch of carved stone. The door still contains the original metal studs, which were a sign of wealth in the 18th century. * Covering: it is covered in tezontle (a reddish porous stone) and the window and door frame are done in chiluca, a grayish-white rock; as such it is considered a prototype of the palatial constructions to very soon follow. * Entrance: the entrance is flanked by columns and the lintel decorated with small stone heads. * Second floor: has a wide balcony with ironwork railings which rests on the main portal. ane four central doorways *Frieze: At the end of the building, there is a frieze decorated with linked chains which frame small fleur-de-lis. *Figures: Above this geometric figures top the cresting with pinnacles. The building still has it original gargoyles in the shape of cannons, which were put there as a reminder that the owner was a captain-general in the military. The square corner tower is patterned after conquistador-age buildings. *Turret: Topping all of this is a tile-covered turret on a tower with decorative bastions reminiscent of the 16th century, and cannon-shaped gargoyles.

Genetic data have confirmed the uniqueness of S. robustus. S. robustus and the subspecies of S. floridanus are distinguished primarily by size, dental, and cranial differences.

He went undrafted in the 2009 NFL Draft after playing for five years for the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Badgers. Pressley's maximum back squat weight is 770 pounds (349 kg), and he has been videotaped squatting 605 pounds nine times in a row with no assistive equipment. Early years Pressley, a 5'11\\", 260-pound fullback, was born and raised in Woodbury, New Jersey, just outside Philadelphia. He was selected as All-County, All-South Jersey and All-State during his senior year in 2003‚Äì04 while playing for Woodbury High School. His high school football coach was former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Zack Valentine, who won Super Bowl XIV as a member of the famous \\"Steel Curtain\\" defense. College career From 2004 to 2009, Pressley played for the Badgers under head coaches Barry Alvarez (2004‚Äì05) and Bret Bielema (2005‚Äì09). A broken ankle just before the start of the 2005 season sidelined him for the year, so he used his redshirt eligibility and stayed for one extra season. Pressley‚Äôs collegiate statistics were not outstanding, but his hard work ethic and willingness to sacrifice his body landed him on an NFL roster after going undrafted in 2009. Professional career In 2009, Pressley was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Cincinnati Bengals. His attempt to make the Bengals' roster was chronicled on the HBO series Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Cincinnati Bengals. Pressley failed to make the final cut, but was signed to the Bengals' practice squad after he cleared waivers. On October 28, 2009, Pressley was signed off the Bengals' practice squad to the active roster of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. On November 22, Pressley made his NFL regular season debut for the Buccaneers in a 38‚Äì7 loss to the New Orleans Saints. Pressley's first career carry came two weeks later on December 6 in a game against the Carolina Panthers. After starting the 2010 season with the Buccaneers and playing in three games, he was waived on October 23. Cincinnati then re-signed him, and on December 10 was promoted to their roster after cornerback Rico Murray sustained an ankle injury. Pressley started 10 games for the Bengals in 2011. In March 2012, he signed a two-year contract extension with the team. On September 30, 2012, Pressley scored his first career touchdown when he caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from Andy Dalton in a 27‚Äì10 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Pressley was waived by the Cincinnati Bengals on December 10, 2013. He was signed by the Cleveland Browns on April 14, 2014. He was released on May 19, 2014.

In 1953, Hasty Road won six of his nine races including the Arlington Futurity and the Washington Park Futurity, and set a record for prize money won by a two-year-old. In 1954 Hasty Road defeated Determine in track record time in the Derby Trial and then finished second to the same horse in the Kentucky Derby. At Pimlico Race Course in May he recorded his most important victory when winning the Preakness Stakes by a neck from Correlation. The rest of his three-year-old campaign wasn't as good, but he returned to form to win the Widener Handicap in February 1955 before his racing career was ended by injury. Background Hasty Road was a huge bay horse with a distinctive white blaze, bred by Clifford Mooers of Walnut Springs Farm in Kentucky. He was sired by Roman, out of Traffic Court, a mare who also produced 1955 Woodward Stakes winner Traffic Judge. As a descendant of the broodmare Traverse, Traffic Court was also related to the successful racehorse and sire Bold Bidder. Traffic Court died in 1952 but was posthumously named broodmare of the year by the Kentucky Thoroughbred Breeders' Association in 1955. Before his racing career began, Hasty Road was bought at the Keeneland summer sales for $23,100 by Allie Reuben, a real estate dealer from Toledo, Ohio and his wife \\"Billy\\" Allie Reuben had decided to pay more than $23,000 for the colt but was persuaded to make one final bid by his wife. The Reubens raced the colt under their Hasty House Farm colors. Hasty Road was trained by Harry Trotsek. Racing career 1953: two-year- old season Hasty Road won two five and a half furlong sprint races at Arlington Park before his first major test in July 1953 when he ran in the Arlington Futurity. He started favorite against seventeen opponents for the race which carried prize money $157,915, making it reportedly the most valuable two-year-old race ever run to that point. Ridden by Eddie Arcaro, Hasty Road took the lead on the home turn and claimed the victory by two and a half lengths from Mr. Prosecutor and Donnajack. His winning time of 1:10.2 for six furlongs was a record for the race. After being beaten in his next race, Hasty Road ran in Chicago's other valuable two-year-old prize, the $156,085 Washington Park Futurity in September. Arcaro sent the colt into the lead after a furlong and he was never headed, winning by three and a half lengths from Athenian and thirteen others. In October, Hasty Road finished unplaced behind Porterhouse when favorite for the Belmont Futurity, being apparently unsuited by the track. He maintained his position as the year's leading two- year-old money-winner however, with a win in the Breeders' Futurity Stakes at Keeneland Race Course and was then sent to Churchill Downs for the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes, in which he was matched against the highly rated Fisherman. Racing over one mile, Hasty Road beat Goyamo by one and a half lengths, with Fisherman more than five lengths further back in a dead heat for fourth. In this race, Hasty Road was ridden by Johnny Adams, who became his regular jockey. By the end of the year, Hasty Road had earned $277,132, making him the second biggest money-winner of the season among all American horses and the most financially successful two-year-old in history. He was overwhelmingly voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt by Turf & Sports Digest magazine. The rival Daily Racing Form and Thoroughbred Racing Association awards, however, were taken by Porterhouse, and in the Experimental Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best colts, Hasty Road was rated two pounds behind Porterhouse and Turn-To. 1954: three-year-old season Hasty Road began his three-year-old season in Florida, where he finished a neck second to Duc de Fer in the seven-furlong St. Valentine Purse at Hialeah on February 14. In the much more important Flamingo Stakes over nine furlongs two weeks later, he finished fifth of the nine runners behind Turn-To. During his time in Florida, Hasty Road displayed his \\"playful\\" temperament by twice throwing his exercise rider, sustaining minor injuries which delayed his training schedule. Hasty Road returned to racing when he ran fifth in a seven-furlong allowance race at Keeneland on April 16. At Churchill Downs eleven days later, he was matched against leading Californian colt Determine in the one-mile Derby Trial Stakes. Running in blinkers for the first time, Hasty Road returned to his best form to beat Determine by a head in a track-record time of 1:35.0. The win emphasised his prospects in the Kentucky Derby, as the last two winners of the Trial, (Hill Gail and Dark Star), had taken the first leg of the Triple Crown. Four days later, Hasty Road started the 5/1 fourth favorite for the Derby, with the Californian colts Correlation and Determine being first and second choices. Johnny Adams sent Hasty Road to the front from the start and held a clear advantage into the straight. Determine, however, emerged from the pack to challenge Hasty Road, took the lead one sixteenth of the mile from the finish, and won by one and a half lengths. Adams later claimed that Hasty Road was distracted by the crowd on the infield and lost concentration in the straight. With Determine ruled out of the remaining Triple Crown races, the meeting of Hasty Road and Correlation in the Preakness Prep at Pimlico Race Course on May 18 seemed likely to decide the Preakness Stakes favorite. As at Churchill Downs, Adams attempted to lead all the way on Hasty Road, but Correlation caught him in the closing stages and won by a head. In the Preakness Stakes six days later, Hasty Road started 9/2 second favorite behind Correlation in front of a crowd of 29,604. Adams employed his usual tactics, leading from the start on Hasty Road until Willie Shoemaker moved Correlation to challenge him in the straight. The finish was closely contested and rough, with bumping between the two leaders as Hasty Road moved away from the rail and the third-placed Hasseyampa being obstructed when trying to make a forward move. At the wire, Hasty Road prevailed by a neck, but the result was only confirmed fifteen minutes later, after the racecourse stewards scrutinised replays of the finish. After the race, Adams, who had won his first Triple Crown race at the age of thirty-nine, said that he only used his whip once, at the top of the stretch, while Reuben paid tribute to the colt's courage, saying that he \\"hangs on like a bull dog\\". Hasty Road never recovered his Preakness form and his results were mixed as the season progressed. Reuben had originally planned to miss the Belmont, feeling that the track and the distance would not suit the colt, but changed his mind after the Preakness. Hasty Road was sent to New York for the Belmont, but after the colt worked on the track, Reuben had another change of heart shortly before the race and returned him to his base in Chicago. On June 26 at Arlington Park, Hasty Road won the seven-furlong Warren Wright Memorial from off the pace by a length, with Hasseyampa third. At the same track in July, he started favorite for the Arlington Classic but never recovered from a poor start and finished fifth to Errard King. In the following month's American Derby, Hasty Road again lost to Errard King, tiring in the closing stages and losing second place to the Belmont Stakes winner, High Gun. In October, Hasty Road ran third to Helioscope in the Benjamin Franklin Handicap at Garden State Park and then finished last of the ten runners behind Chevation in the Yankee Handicap at Suffolk Downs. Hasty Road returned to the scene of his Preakness win in November but finished unplaced behind Helioscope in the Pimlico Special. 1954: four-year-old season As in 1953, Hasty Road began his year in Florida. In January at Hialeah, he recorded his first win for seven months when he carried 123 pounds to victory in a six furlong handicap race. He then took the Abraham Lincoln Purse at the same course at one mile and one-eighth, before carrying 122 pounds the $132,800 Widener Handicap on February 19. Rather than urging Hasty Road into a clear lead as he had often done in the past, Adams allowed the temperamental colt to set his own pace. Hasty Road led the race at a modest pace and turned into the stretch with a slight advantage over Capeador and Ram o' War. Although he drifted out slightly from the rail, Hasty Road appeared to have no difficulty maintaining his advantage, and Adams did not need to resort to his whip to hold off Capeador and win by a neck. An objection to the winner by Hedley Woodhouse, the rider of the runner-up, was dismissed by the racecourse stewards. Hasty Road's third straight win. On March 16, Hasty Road sustained an injury in training at Hialeah which was described as either a \\"wrenched left foreleg\\", or a \\"filled ankle\\".The horse was expected to return to the track in the summer; he finished third in his comeback and was retired to stud. Stud record Hasty Road was not an outstanding success as a breeding stallion, but sired several good winners. His daughter Berkeley Springs was raced in Europe where she won the Cheveley Park Stakes and finished second in two of the five British Classic Races. Other winners included Copy Chief (Clark Handicap), Four Lane (Fall Highweight Handicap), Run For Nurse (Equipoise Mile) and Third Martini (Knickerbocker Handicap). Hasty Road was a successful broodmare sire, with several daughters producing stakes winners. *Broadway, 1961 Polly Drummond Stakes winner, dam of champion filly Queen of the Stage and sire Reviewer.

For the later professional baseball player of a similar name, see John O'Connell (catcher). John Joseph O'Connell (May 16, 1872 ‚Äì May 14, 1908) was a baseball player for Major League Baseball. His career was short, and he only played for two seasons. During his two-season, he accumulated relatively poor statistics in very little playing time. He played in only 16 games and had nine hits in 51 at bats for a batting average of .176. At the age of 19, he made his professional debut on August 22, 1891 for the Baltimore Orioles near the end of their 1891 season in the last year of the American Association. For the Orioles, he played second base, right field, and shortstop for a total of eight games. The following year, O'Connell was not a member of the Orioles when they transferred to the National League in 1892. He then disappeared for about 10 years but reappeared as a member of the Detroit Tigers for their 1902 season, where he played second base and twice at first base. He joined the team late into the season and only played eight games. The Tigers struggled in their second season in the American League and were constantly changing their roster, which was largely filled with young, inexperienced, and inexpensive rookies. The Tigers finished the season with a record 52‚Äì82‚Äì2 (.385) at 30¬Ω games out of first place‚Äî one of the team's worst seasons in history. O'Connell, like many other players from the 1902 Detroit Tigers, did not return to play the next year. He died two days short of his 36th birthday in Derry, New Hampshire on May 14, 1908.

The government of Pakistan has attempted to subdue these separatist movements. The separatist movement in Balochistan is engaged in a low-intensity insurgency against the Government of Pakistan. History Pakistan was established in 1947 from Indian land as a state for Muslims. The driving force behind the Pakistan Movement were the Muslims in the Muslim minority provinces of United Province and Bombay Presidency rather than the Muslims from the Muslim majority provinces. Its formation was based on the basis of Islamic nationalism. However, rampant corruption within the ranks of the government and bureaucracy, economic inequality between the country's two wings caused mainly by a lack of representative government and the government's indifference to the efforts of fierce ethno-nationalistic politicians like Mujeeb-ur-Rehman from East Pakistan, resulted in civil war in Pakistan and subsequent separation of East Pakistan as the new state of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. In 2009, the Pew Research Center conducted a Global Attitudes survey across Pakistan, in which it questioned respondents whether they viewed their primary identity as Pakistani or that of their ethnicity. The sample covered an area representing 90% of the adult population, and included all major ethnic groups. According to the findings, 96% of Punjabis identified themselves first as Pakistanis, as did 92% each of Pashtuns and Muhajirs; 55% of Sindhis chose a Pakistani identification, while 28% chose Sindhi and 16% selected \\"both equally\\"; whereas 58% of Baloch respondents chose Pakistani and 32% selected their ethnicity and 10% chose both equally. Collectively, 89% of the sample opted their primary identity as Pakistani. Similarly in 2010, Chatham House conducted an opinion poll in the Pakistani and Indian-administered regions of Kashmir asking respondents if they favoured independence or an accession to either countries; in Azad Kashmir, 95% of respondents voted for all of Kashmir to accede to Pakistan, 4% voted for independence, and only 1% voted for accession to India. In the northern region of Gilgit-Baltistan, longstanding local sentiments oppose any merger of the area with Kashmir, and instead demand a constitutional integration with Pakistan.  Balochistan  The Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) separatist group was founded by Jumma Khan Marri in 1964 in Damascus, and played an important role in the 1968-1980 insurgency in Pakistani Balochistan and Iranian Balochistan. Mir Hazar Ramkhani, the father of Jumma Khan Marri, took over the group in the 1980s. The Balochistan Liberation Army (also Baloch Liberation Army or Baluchistan Liberation army) (BLA) is a Baloch nationalist militant secessionist organization. However, Jumma Khan Marri ended his opposition and pledged allegiance to Pakistan on 17 February 2018. The stated goals of the organization include the establishment of an independent state of Balochistan separate from Pakistan and Iran. The name Baloch Liberation Army first became public in summer 2000, after the organization claimed credit for a series of bomb attacks in markets and railways lines. The BLA has also claimed responsibility for the systematic ethnic genocide of Punjabis, Pashtuns and Sindhis in Balochistan (about 25,000 as of July 2010) as well as blowing up of gas pipelines. Local Balochs have also been targeted by the separatist groups in the province. Brahamdagh Khan Bugti, alleged leader of Baloch liberation army (BLA), also asked separatists to conduct ethnic cleansing of Non-Baloch citizens from the province. In 2006, the BLA was declared to be a terrorist organization by the Pakistani and British governments. However, the insurgency led by the Baloch separatists in the province is on its last leg. Baloch separatists have been losing their leaders and they have been unable to fill their ranks. There is also currently ongoing infighting between the different insurgents groups. The last insurgent leader, Balach Marri, was able to keep the different insurgent groups united. However, after his death in Afghanistan, infighting broke out between various insurgent groups. The insurgents were unable to replace him. Similarly, Baloch separatist follow Marxism. However, the Marxism ideology died across the world and there is no other ideologies to succeed it. So the founding father of Baloch separatist are dead. Moreover, attacks on pro-government leaders and politicians who are willing to take part in election has also contributed to the decline in separatist appeal. The News International reported in 2012 that a Gallup survey conducted for DFID revealed that the majority of Baloch do not support independence from Pakistan. Only 37 percent of Baloch were in favour of independence. Amongst Balochistan's Pashtun population support for independence was even lower at 12 percent. However, a majority (67 percent) of Balochistan's population did favour greater provincial autonomy. Majority of Baloch also don't support separatist groups. They support political parties who use legislature to address their grievances. Experts also claim that most of the nationalist in the province had come to believe that they could fight for their political right within Pakistan. As of 2018, the Pakistani state was using Islamist militants to crush Balochi separatists. Academics and journalists in the United States have been approached by Inter-Services Intelligence spies, who threatened them not to speak about the insurgency in Balochistan, as well as human rights abuses by the Pakistani Army, or else their families would be harmed. Sindhudesh Sindhudesh (, literally \\"Sindhi Country\\") is an idea of a separate Homeland for Sindhis proposed by Sindhi nationalist parties for the creation of a Sindhi state, which would be independent from Pakistan. The movement is based in the Sindh region of Pakistan and was conceived by the Sindhi political leader G. M. Syed. A Sindhi literary movement emerged in 1967 under the leadership of Syed and Pir Ali Mohammed Rashdi, in opposition to the One Unit policy, the imposition of Urdu by the central government and to the presence of a large number of Muhajir (Indian Muslim refugees) settled in the province. However, neither the separatist party nor the nationalist party have ever been able to take centre stage in Sindh. Local Sindhis strongly support Pakistan People Party (PPP). The unparalleled and unhindered success of the PPP in Sindh shows the preference of Sindhis for a constitutional political process over a separatist agenda to resolve their grievances. Similarly public opinion is also not heavily in favour of these parties either. In other words, neither the Sindhi separatists nor the nationalists have significant popular support ‚Äî certainly not the kind that will make them capable of fuelling a full-scale insurgency. Almost all of the Sindhis have a strong Pakistani identity and prefer to remain part of Pakistan. In 2012, a Sindhudesh rally was organised by a nationalist party in Karachi, which had a notably low turnout. The nationalist party had claimed that they would gather around million people for their million march. Although, only 3,000 to 4,000 people attended the rally. In 2020, the Pakistani government banned multiple separatist outfits including the Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz - Aresar group, Sindhudesh Liberation Army, and Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan flag of Gilgit-Baltistan United Movement Location of Gilgit-Baltistan An independence movement currently exists in Gilgit-Baltistan (called \\"Balawaristan\\" by its supporters). Balawaristan National Front (Hameed Group) (BNF-H) led by Abdul Hamid Khan were trying to seek independence of Gilgit-Baltistan from Pakistan. However, Abdul Hamid Khan unconditionally surrendered to Pakistan security officials on 8 February 2019. Following his surrender, 14 more members of BNF-H were arrested for their anti-Pakistani activities. Since then the fate of BNF-H is unknown. Another organisation by the name of Balawaristan National Front led by Nawaz Khan Naji seeks to declare Gilgit-Balistan a fifth province of Pakistan. In Pakistani side of Kashmir, no political parties with separatist tendencies can participate in the elections. All parties in Pakistan's Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan must accept that Kashmir is part of Pakistan and joined Pakistan under what the Pakistani authorities consider an accession agreement. Because of this, only pro-Pakistani nationalist parties are able to win the elections, as others are barred. Furthermore, most of the bureaucracy and civil service is controlled by the central government, with the \\"Kashmir council\\", which is headed by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Pakistan made further moves to control the area by having the region divided into Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir regions. In addition, Pakistani authorities took away the region's special status and governed by the central government in Pakistan, similar to India, which Pakistani authorities condemned.https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/pakistan-friend- kashmir-190911133539203.html Sardar Arif Shahid, was a Kashmiri nationalist leader who advocated the independence of Kashmir from both India and Pakistan's rule. He was killed on May 14, 2013 outside his house in Rawalpindi. It was the first time any pro-independence Kashmiri leader was targeted in this way in Pakistan. His supporters allege that he was killed by Pakistan security forces. Within the area, \\"Custodial torture and intimidation of independence supporters and other activists\\" has occurred. In 2010, Chatham House, a London based think tank, did a survey, sponsored by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, in both Pakistani and Indian administered Kashmir. Based on a sample size of 3,774, it found that Kashmiri's on both sides wanted independence. The survey states, 44% of Kashmiri's in Pakistan administered Kashmir wanted independence.http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2010/05/29/in-kashmir-nearly-half- favour-independence/ Jinnahpur and Muhajir Sooba Location of Karachi where the mujahir movement is mostly based Jinnahpur refers to an alleged plot in Pakistan to form a breakaway autonomous state to serve as a homeland for the Karachi based Urdu-speaking Muhajir community. Mohajirs are immigrants who came to Pakistan from India in the wake of the violence that followed the independence of India in 1947. The alleged name to be given to the proposed breakaway state was \\"Jinnahpur\\", named after Mohammed Ali Jinnah. In 1992, the Pakistani military claimed it had found maps of the proposed Jinnahpur state in the offices of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (now renamed Muttahida Qaumi Movement), despite the party's strong denial of the authenticity of the maps. Despite the party's strong commitment to the Pakistani state, at that time government of Nawaz Sharif chose to use it as the basis for the military operation against the MQM, known as Operation Clean-up.The MQM of Pakistan: Between Political Party and Ethnic Movement, Mohammad Waseem, in Political parties in South Asia, ed. Mitra, Enskat & Spiess, pp185 The Muhajir Sooba (literally meaning 'Immigrant Province') is a political movement which seeks to represent the Muhajir people of Sindh. This concept floated as a political bargaining tool by the leader of Muttahida Qaumi Movement, Altaf Hussain for the creation of a Muhajir province for the Muhajir-majority areas of Sindh, which would be independent from Sindh government.

It is one of the better known climbing plants of the genus Cissus in the grape family. A very common climber in moist areas of eastern Australia, it often colonises large areas after forest damage due to storms, fire or logging. Common names include jungle grape, water vine, giant water vine, five-leaf water vine, jungle vine, native grapes and billangai . It was initially described in 1854 by American botanist Asa Gray.  Description  Cissus hypoglauca is a large woody vine. The name water-vine comes from the fact that the woody sections of the vine may be cut into sections and the sap that drips from the sections may be drunk as water. The leaves are palmate, and are usually arranged in a group of five. Leaves elliptic or ovate in shape, slightly toothed or entire. Mid green above and a glaucous shade underneath, and measure 3 to 15 cm (1‚Äì6 in) long, 1.5 to 4 cm (0.6-1.6 in) wide. The young leaves are reddish and hairy. Tendrils appear opposite the leaf stalk. Yellow flowers occur on terminal umbels, mostly in spring and summer. A purple globose fruit matures in the middle of the year. Five leaf Water Vine provides abundant food and shelter for birds and small animals. The stunning blue berries may be eaten raw and provide a delicious watery snack but do leave an acrid aftertaste that can be slightly irritating.

It is the former home of the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd. The church branched off of Christ Episcopal Church making it the second oldest Episcopal church in Raleigh. The chapel was sold to a private owner in 2006 and is currently used for weddings and other gatherings. The chapel's 2006 move was featured in the News & Observer. History In the middle of the 19th century, there was only one Episcopal church in Raleigh, North Carolina. A disagreement between certain church members over pew rentals led to a desire for the congregation to split. In 1873, the Reverend Edward R. Rich of St. Paul's Church in Clinton, North Carolina suggested that a new Episcopal Church in Raleigh be started. On December 19, 1873, The Reverend R.S. Mason, the rector of the Christ Episcopal Church parish, gave consent for a new Episcopal church to be started in Raleigh. In 1874, a piece of land was purchased on the corner of McDowell and Hillsborough Street. There, All Saints Chapel was built in 1875 to be the home of the Church of the Good Shepherd parish. Near the beginning of the 20th century the chapel moved from its original foundation to the south side of the church lot along Morgan Street to provide space for a new stone church building. In 2006 the chapel was sold to Empire Properties to provide space for a new parish life center. The chapel was transported roughly half a mile to its current location along East Street, just west of the Historic Oakwood neighborhood. The chapel is no longer associated with the Church of the Good Shepherd or the Episcopal Church and regular services are no longer conducted.http://www.newsobserver.com/news/wake/raleigh/story/440095.html The chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

Safely Kept began her career in 1988 and won 24 of her 31 starts over the next three years. Most of her runs were against colts and geldings as at the time there were few sprint races restricted to females.http://www.pedigreequery.com/safely+kept. She finished \\"in-the-money\\" in 30 of 31 starts. Safely Kept was euthanized the morning of April 22, 2014 for due to the infirmities of old age. She was 28 years old.  Two and Three year-old seasons  As a two-year-old, she won four of five races including two stakes races in the Playpen Stakes and the Smart Angle Stakes. At age three, she separated herself from every other sprinter in North America by recording eight wins in nine races. That year (1989), she entered the Breeders' Cup Sprint as the second choice in the morning line and finished second to Ogden Phipps' Dancing Spree. Among her eight stakes wins in 1989 were the grade one Test Stakes at Saratoga Race Course and two wins in grade two races, the Genuine Risk Handicap and the Prioress Stakes. Those performances as well as her 9-8-1-0 record that year earned her the Eclipse Award for the American Champion Sprint Horse.  Four-year-old season  At age four, she won all seven of her starts, which all came in stakes races. The final race of her four-year-old season was a victory over a star-studded international field of 14 sprinters in the grade one Breeders' Cup Sprint. That win over super stars Dayjur from England and Black Tie Affair from Ireland as well as reversing the previous year's form as she defeated Dancing Spree by nine and a half lengths.  Five-year-old season  At age, five Safely Kept won five of seven races and finished third in the other two. She ran in the same stakes races at the same tracks that she had in the two previous years. She three-peated in the grade two Genuine Risk Handicap, three-peated in the Maryland Million Distaff Handicap, three-peated in the grade three Garden Stakes Handicap (no longer run), and repeated in the grade three Meadowlands Handicap. Safely Kept also won the Chicago Handicap at Arlington Park and contested in the grade one Frank J. De Francis Memorial Dash Stakes, where she finished third to Housebuster.  Career Earnings  Safely Kept's career bankroll of $2,194,206 ranks her as the greatest earner among any filly or mare bred in the state of Maryland. She is one of only five multi-millionaire Thoroughbred foaled in the state after Cigar, Awad, Concern, and Broad Brush. At the time of her retirement, Safely Kept had earned more than any other female horse in the world bred outside the state of Kentucky except for Lady's Secret and still ranks fourth on that list.2009 The Original Racing Almanac, Leading Earners Where Bred, pages 574-583.  Honors  Laurel Park Racecourse renamed a Graded stakes race in her honor. Safely Kept won the 1989 running of the Columbia Stakes, and in 1990 the race was renamed and given graded stakes status for the first time. The stakes upgrade has been credited to the level of competition that has run in the race, but in large part the upgrade is due to the fact that Safely Kept went on to win the Breeders' Cup Sprint. The Safely Kept Stakes is run annually on the same card as the Frank J. De Francis Memorial Dash Stakes.2007 Maryland Jockey Club Media Guide, page 37 on March 3, 2007.

Best known for her contributions to the Radical Orthodoxy movement, she has been Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge since 2018 and a fellow and tutor of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. She was previously Professor of Metaphysics and Poetics. Early life and education Pickstock was born in 1970 in New York City, United States, but grew up in England. Though not raised in the Church of England, she credits her grandparents with introducing her both to Anglican liturgySee Pickstock's 2001 interview with Stratford Caldecott, \\"Radical Orthodoxy,\\" at Catholic Culture. Accessed 7 October 2020. and to the ethical-political concerns of the Anglican tradition.See Pickstock's interview with Jeffrey Tucker, \\"More than Immanent: An Interview with Catherine Pickstock.\\" Sascred Music. 134.4 (Winter 2007): 65. She was educated at Channing School, an all-girls independent school in Highgate, London, England. Having won a choral scholarship, she studied English literature at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1991. Interested in the relationship between poetics and metaphysics, she then moved into philosophical theology and undertook postgraduate studies in this field at the Faculty of Divinity, University of Cambridge. She completed her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1996 with a thesis titled \\"The Sacred Polis: Language, Death and Liturgy\\". Her doctoral supervisor was John Milbank. Academic career From 1995 to 1998, Pickstock was a Research Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. From 1998 to 2000, she held a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Faculty of Divinity, University of Cambridge. In 2000, she was appointed a University Lecturer in Philosophy of Religion in the Faculty of Divinity. In 2006, she was promoted to Reader in Philosophy and Theology. From 2016 to 2017, she was also a Mellon Teaching Fellow at the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities. In 2015, she was made Professor of Metaphysics and Poetics. In March 2018, it was announced that Pickstock would be the next Norris‚ÄìHulse Professor of Divinity. She took up the Chair on 1 October 2018. Works and Major Themes Pickstock has from the start of her career been associated with the Radical Orthodoxy movement, on account of her collaboration with John Milbank, her then doctoral supervisor.On the relationship with Milbank, see the Caldecott interview. Her own academic work is both like and unlike that of her mentor: they are both identifiable as ‚Äúpost-modern critical Augustinian‚Äù theologians,See John Milbank, \\"Postmodern Critical Augustinianism: A Short Summa in Response to Forty-Two Unasked Questions.\\" Modern Theology. 7.3 (April 1991): 225-237. heavily influenced by both twentieth-century French theory and the Christian Platonic tradition. At the same time, where Milbank's work (especially Theology and Social Theory) tends to focus on the historical critique and re-narration of other authors‚Äô projects, Pickstock's writing tends to be more question-oriented, more affirmative, and less narrative. Her work also tends to begin more frequently with direct reflection upon the writings of Plato, an engagement she has continued to pursue throughout her career.At the beginning of Aspects of Truth, Pickstock declares that \\"my thesis is unabashedly Platonic,\\" and the same could be argued of her other works (xi). See for example Ch. 1 of After Writing, her several scholarly articles on Plato, and her popular essay on \\"Truth and Courage\\" from August, 2020. The dominant theme in Pickstock's writing thus far has been the way in which humans participate in the divine creation through language. Within this paradigm, at least four interlinked subthemes have found expression in her various writings: liturgy, music, repetition, and truth. First, the meaning and significance of liturgy, which was the subject of Pickstock's dissertation and first book, After Writing: On the Liturgical Consummation of Philosophy (1998). There, and in a number of related essays, she argues that language is fundamentally ‚Äúdoxological‚Äù: ‚Äúthat is to say, language exists primarily, and in the end only has meaning as, the praise of the divine‚Äù (xiii). Thus, liturgical speech is language par excellence, and the modern fall away from spoken, liturgical order into written metaphysical systems is the key to philosophy's failure over the last few centuries. The path of return, as Pickstock conceives it, runs through the postmodern (largely French) critique of modernity, then beyond to a non- foundational theology of liturgical encounter--an encounter with being through language. A second, closely related theme of Pickstock's work has been the place of music in Western thought. Building on the foundation of Augustine's treatise De Musica, several of Pickstock's essays have argued that music is ‚Äúthe science that most leads toward theology,\\"Catherine Pickstock, \\"The Musical Imperative.\\" Angelaki. 3.2 (1998): 7. provided it be properly conceived as a contemplative mode of measuring reality. While certain modern approaches to music, as narrated by Pickstock, have tended to distort its metaphysical character in various ways, certain twentieth-century and contemporary composers such as Olivier Messiaen and James MacMillan have opened up possibilities of radical return.See Catherine Pickstock, \\"God and Meaning in Music: Messiaen, Deleuze, and the Musico-Theological Critique of Modernism and Postmodernism.\\" Sacred Music. 134.4 (2007): 40‚Äì62. Third, Pickstock has focused in much of her writing on the metaphysical significance of the phenomenon of repetition. While the notion is already present in After Writing,E.g. in the description she gives of its centrality to the Eucharist (247) she focuses on it squarely in her 2013 book, Repetition and Identity, which opens with the claim that we define our own identities precisely in the act of identifying those of others. Somehow, identification of self and other are bound up together: ‚ÄúThe external acts of recognition, and our internal access to a specific identity, seem to depend upon one another‚Äù (1). The book presents a phenomenological account of how this dual identification happens in human experience, and happens precisely through repetition. For the form of the other--of anything a person encounters or takes in--will necessarily strike the perceiver differently every time, so that each act of recognition circles back to the other's identity, but in a new way. Every recognition is thus both the same as and different from all previous perceptions. This habit of repetition in difference defines us: ‚Äúthe idea of forms and forces flowing into us from without, and there self-transmuting and pleating back upon themselves‚Äù--this ‚Äúform[s] our subjectivity,‚Äù our sense of ourselves (17). At the same time, the identity of the other--of each identified thing--comes more and more fully into being through the repetitions of human language, which are always adding new details, new angles. The fourth major theme in Pickstock's thought has been the metaphysics of truth. In her co-authored 2001 book, Truth in Aquinas, as well as her 2020 monograph, Aspects of Truth: A New Religious Metaphysics, Pickstock develops an approach to truth that is both philosophical and theological at once, ultimately because she thinks the two discourses cannot in fact be separated. At the heart of the latter book is the claim that ‚Äúthe epistemological approach to truth‚Äù--the dominant modern way that ever more carefully unpacks the conditions for truth's possibility-- cannot in fact ‚Äúyield truth‚Äù (x). This is because, for Pickstock, truth is always already metaphysical, referring to a way of being in relation to what is, and this primary relation of knower and known can never be reached by epistemological pathways. Now, given the postmodern deconstruction of modern epistemology, she believes the time is right for a radical return to ‚Äúpre- modern metaphysical approaches to truth. . . . For such approaches,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äútruth coincides with being as a ‚Äòtranscendental‚Äô, and yet it is surplus to being, insofar as being itself is taken to be manifestatory and expressive‚Äù (x). In other words, the human knower, in relation to being as such, always has something of his or her own to add, a new aspect, a fresh take, a singular angle of reception. Truth is thus ever growing, ever adding to the deposit of being by means of differentiated repetition. Pickstock's project, finally, circles around the way that human experience, especially as mediated through language, music, art, works to extend the creation beyond what it now is, participating in the never-finished work of God.

AGS Maps, Digests, and Guidebooks are published at irregular intervals.  Governance  The society is managed by a 15-member Executive Committee consisting of Officers and Advisory Councilors who serve calendar- year terms. The Officers include President, Vice President-Field Trips, Vice President-Programs, Vice President-Marketing, Secretary, Vice-Secretary, Treasurer, and Vice-Treasurer; their duties are specified in the Bylaws of the society. The Advisory Council consists of six members who serve staggered three-year terms; their duties are to promote interest in AGS activities and supervise special projects undertaken by the society. The seventh member of the Advisory Council is the immediate Past-President who serves as Chair of the Advisory Committee. The Executive Committee serves without remuneration. There are three other committees nominated by the Executive Committee to perform specific duties. These include the Investment Committee, the J. Harold Courtright Scholarship Committee, and the Nominating Committee. **The Investment Committee is the financial advisor to the Executive Committee and operates under guidance specified in the AGS \\"Mission, Financial Management and Investment Policy.\\" **The J. Harold Courtright Committee solicits applications from qualified graduate students who are researching field geology projects in the Northern and Southern Cordillera with emphasis on the study of ore deposits; this committee awards a scholarship annually in honor of former AGS member and ASARCO exploration geologist J. Harold Courtright (1908-1986). **The Nominating Committee is chaired by the immediate Past- President who, along with 2-4 other voting members of AGS, prepares the proposed slate of incoming Officers and Councilors to be approved by the Executive Committee and presented to the membership in the election held in September. The J. Harold Courtright and Nominating Committees are disbanded after their duties are performed.  AGS Maps, Digests, and Guidebooks  Arizona Geological Society has prepared two Arizona geologic highway maps, one of which is still in print. The 1998 highway map was prepared in collaboration with the Arizona Geological Survey. AGS Digests are a serial geologic publication produced on an irregular basis usually as a compilation of papers presented at a scientific symposium. The first Digest was produced in 1952; the most recent was Digest 22 published in 2008. The Digests have International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 0066-7412 Over the decades, AGS field trips have visited every part of Arizona's varied landscape and geology. The trips are intended for professional geologists, and led by geologists with the U.S. Geological Survey, Arizona Geological Survey and other governmental agencies, the three major Arizona universities, mine geology departments at the producing mines, and by graduate students presenting their research topics and thesis or dissertation progress. For the Spring or Fall field trips, a formal guidebook is prepared.  AGS Symposia  Historically AGS symposia have focused on the connections between the geology of ore deposits and structural geology with associated pre- and post-meeting field trips and a compendium of papers prepared after the meetings. They have traditionally been co-sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey branch in Tucson, the University of Arizona, and/or other professional geological societies and organizations.

() is a Singaporean omnibus comedy horror film directed by Jack Neo and Boris Boo. This film is Jack Neo's first attempt with horror flicks. Plot The film is made up of three omnibus horror tales laced with Singaporean humour. In sequence, they are \\"Roadside Got Ghost\\", \\"Forest Got Ghost\\" and \\"House Got Ghost\\". Episodes Roadside Got Ghost Directed By: Jack Neo Swindlers Cai, Fu and Shou are returning to Cai's house after a successful scam. Cai becomes hungry and tells his accomplices to buy him some food while he returned home. As it is late at night and they are too lazy to walk to the shops, Fu and Shou decide to steal some oranges from the roadside, placed there as offerings during the Hungry Ghost Festival. Cai eats the oranges and complains that they are tasteless. Later, the three men devise a new scheme - they would make phone calls from the phone book and each person they called would receive a random 4D lottery number, with enough calls to cover every possible combination from 0000 to 9999. Those who win the lottery are required to pay 20% commission to Cai or fall victim to harassments from loansharks. This initially works and the three set up a company, which was largely successful. One day, Cai receives a phone call. The caller gives Cai a lottery number, deploying the same hotline trick. Believing him to be a competitor, Cai naturally disregards the call, but goes ahead and tries his luck with the given number anyway. To his surprise, he wins first and second prize for the same number. On his way home with his two sidekicks, a pale- faced man suddenly confronts Cai for his commission. After teasing the man and refusing to pay, Cai receives the warning that he will be run over by a car. Cai laughs it off and runs into the middle of the road to prove it is all a hoax scare. He actually does get crushed by a car overturning from an overhead highway. As Cai dies, the driver of the car is revealed to be a spirit who tells Cai never to steal her oranges again. In the ending scene, hundreds of oranges start to roll onto a dying Cai in the middle of the road. Forest Got Ghost Directed By: Jack Neo Nan and Lei are attending their army NS reservist training and had to trek through a jungle to reach a checkpoint using a map. Along the way, they become lost and decide to take a short cut through a supposedly haunted jungle, where they find the tombstone of a young woman in the middle of nowhere. After night falls, the two soldiers notice a woman in a red dress watching them from a distance, which frightened them. There is a huge thunderstorm the next morning. Nan and Lei meet a plump girl named Yin Yin with a white umbrella selling drinks and sought refuge at her house. There, they encounter the woman in the red dress again, and run for their lives. Yin Yin catches up with them after a while and explains that it was her, and not a ghost, that they saw back in the house. She persuades them to return to her house, making them feel more comfortable by performing magic. After a demonstration, Nan and Lei allow themselves to be strapped to chairs and noosed so they can learn one of Yin Yin's magic tricks. However, it was a trap. The two men are left hanging on a tree outside the house, as the two girls, Yin Yin and the other female ghost, are ready to depart now that they have found two people to take their place. As an epilogue, the story skips to the following year where another batch of soldiers arrives for reservist training. Once again, two of them get lost and take a shortcut. The story ends with them wandering through the forest and stopping in front of Nan and Lei. House Got Ghost Directed By: Boris Boo This was a short sequel to Money No Enough 2. It is the Seventh Lunar Month and three brothers - Bao Qiang, Bao Huang and Bao Hui - all pay respects to their deceased mother. They complain bitterly to their mother that they are doing poorly financially, and that their mother is not assisting them supernaturally. Soon afterwards, however, strange things begin to happen at their homes. The brothers all claim to see or hear their mother on numerous occasions. After hearing that parents dying in the night will bring bad luck to their children, Bao Qiang and Bao Huang overrule Bao Hui and urge him to bring their mother's remains to a temple. Bao Hui attempts to bring their mother's urn and tablet to a temple, but is shocked to find it reappearing in his car later. He immediately calls his brothers to accompany him, but they think he is overreacting. During a car journey from Malaysia, the ghostly apparition of their mother suddenly appears on the road before them, causing Bao Huang to swerve and nearly crash off a cliff. Fortunately, the brothers manage to crawl out unscathed. As they wonder over their mother's sudden appearance, they witness a massive landslide along the road ahead. By causing them to swerve, their mother actually saved their lives.

He spent most of career in the service of the Kingdom of Castile, but at times served the neighbouring Kingdom of Le√≥n as well. He was a courtier, almost permanently present at court late in the reign of Alfonso VIII (1158‚Äì1214), whom he twice served as alf√©rez, the highest military post in the kingdom,From 8 July 1187 to 28 July 1188 and again from 22 October 1201 to 23 October 1205. also fighting, with his brothers √Ålvaro and Gonzalo in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. Family Fernando was the son of Nu√±o P√©rez de Lara and Teresa Fern√°ndez de Traba, who after Nu√±o's death in 1177 married King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n, taking her children from her first marriage to live at the court. Sometime before 1202 he married Mayor.Luis de Salazar y Castro and other genealogists identified her as Mayor Garc√≠a, daughter of Garc√≠a Garc√©s de Aza. This Mayor, as attested in several charters, was the wife of Count Gonzalo de Mara√±√≥n (see op. cit. by Mart√≠nez D√≠ez, p. 194). Fernando's wife, Mayor, was most likely related to the Manzanedo family. Fernando and Mayor had four children: Fernando (d. before June 1232); √Ålvaro (d. 1240), who married Infanta Mar√≠a Alfonso, illegitimate daughter of Alfonso IX of Le√≥n and Teresa Gil de Soverosa, and by an unknown mistress fathered Teresa √Ålvarez, wife of Diego L√≥pez de Salcedo; Sancha, wife of Ferdinand, a younger son of Afonso II of Portugal; and, Teresa, who married Count Pon√ß IV of Emp√∫ries. Fiefs and lands The breadth of Fernando's power and influence is an apparent in a lists of territories he is known to have governed.Barton (1997), 239‚Äì40, contains such a list. Between 1173 and 1190 Fernando held the tenencias of Aguilar de Campoo (1173‚Äì90), Herrera (1173‚Äì88), Amaya (1175‚Äì90), Carri√≥n (1175‚Äì90), and Avia (1176‚Äì88).The dates in parentheses refer to the date on which his possession of the tenencia is first mentioned and the last. Later he held those of Ubierna (1181‚Äì90), Tamariz (1181‚Äì95), Ordej√≥n (1182‚Äì86), and Salda√±a (1183‚Äì90). Among the tenencias that he appear to have held only for brief periods were Asturias de Santillana (1173), Li√©bana (1178), Monz√≥n (1179), Cuenca de Campos (1181), Villaescusa (1183), Moratinos (1184), Toro√±o (1192‚Äì94), Asturias de Tineo (1193), Astudillo (1196), and Medina del Campo (1210). The large region of Asturias de Oviedo, once the heartland of the kingdom, was held by Fernando on three separate occasions (1191, 1192‚Äì93, 1200), and that of Bureba, a Castilian district fronting Navarre, twice (1187‚Äì90, 1202), his rule there being interrupted by Diego L√≥pez II de Haro. There is evidence that Fernando sought to consolidate his lands in the region around Burgos, the capital of Castile. His daughters sold important estates in and around Burgos to the Diocese of Burgos during the 1240s, and his wife made a donation to the Cathedral of Burgos. Later, his son √Ålvaro donated the church of Boadilla del Camino in the Burgos region to the Diocese of Palencia.Simon R. Doubleday (2001), The Lara Family: Crown and Nobility in Medieval Spain (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press), 46‚Äì47. For a map of Fernando's patrimony, see p. 48. On 22 January 1189 Fernando was the recipient of royal largesse for his faithful service, receiving estates at Huerta and Carabanchel from Alfonso VIII. His career after this date was marked less by faithfulness than by opportunism, and he frequently shifted allegiance between the Castilian court and the Leonese. Between 15 January 1191 and 17 July 1194 he is traceable at the court of Alfonso IX of Le√≥n, and then again from 24 June 1199 to 6 January 1200. On 8 December 1199 Alfonso IX granted his new wife, Berenguela of Castile, as part of her arras a number of castles to be held by Fernando as her vassal. While the total number of royal castles thus given away was thirty, those to be kept by Fernando were located in the Asturias: Aguilar, Goz√≥n, Ventosa, Buanga, Oviedo, Santa Cruz de Tineo, and Tudela.Barton (1997), 171. Those in the Tierra de Campos, for instance‚ÄîCastro Gonzalo, Castroverde, and Villalug√°n‚Äîwere all held by Mu√±o Rodr√≠guez. Fernando's future stays at the Leonese court were more brief, in 1208, 1217, and 1219. Relationship with the Church Fernando favoured the Benedictine house of San Salvador de O√±a with a donation in 1183 and the Praemonstratensian monastery at Aguilar de Camp√≥o in 1205. His other relations with the Church were more economic in nature, and often disputes. In 1208 he came to an agreement with the monastery of Sobrado in a property dispute. In 1215 he made an exchange of properties with the diocese of Palencia. In July 1216 he sold an estate at Berlanga de Duero to the convent of Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Las Huelgas in Burgos for 1,000 maraved√≠s, and at the same time was involved in a legal dispute with the prior of San Juan de Burgos in the same city. Fernando also made donations to the military orders. The Order of Calatrava, a native Castilian order, received one in 1182 and in 1193 the Hospitallers also.

This fish is also commonly called widowfish and red snapper. Description The body of the widow rockfish is elongate and compressed. The head is relatively short, and the upper profile is slightly curved. The mouth is relatively small, the lower jaw projects slightly. The color is brassy brown over most of the body with the belly generally lighter in color, often with a reddish cast. The fin membranes, particularly in the anal and pectoral fins, are black. Specimens smaller than are lighter in color and are tinged with vague streaks of orange. Widow rockfish reach lengths up to 24 inches and may live as long as 60 years, but fish older than 20 are uncommon. Habitat and Range The widow rockfish occurs from Todos Santos Bay, Baja California, to Kodiak Island, in the Gulf of Alaska. Adult widow rockfishes are most abundant from British Columbia to northern California. Natural history Adult widow rockfish feed extensively on small free floating crab-like animals. Occasionally salps, small squids and anchovies are eaten. A few mature when long and 3 years old. Fifty percent are mature when long or 4 years old. Widow rockfish may live to be 16 years old. As with other rockfish fertilization is internal and the young are born live. The number of developing eggs increases from 55,000 in fish long, to about 900,000 in a fish long. Genetics A potential PCR-RFLP genetic sex marker developed for gopher rockfish does not successfully distinguish male and female widow rockfish. Fishing information Widow rockfish are generally caught by sport anglers fishing on or just above the bottom in deep water up to , although young fish may be taken at or near the surface. On occasion, widow rockfish form huge schools in midwater where they feed on small plants. At such times, they are vulnerable to recreational anglers as well as commercial trawling gear and are often taken in great quantities.

His full designation was only occasionally mentioned on the show. History Although a machine endowed with superhuman strength and futuristic weaponry, he often displayed human characteristics, such as laughter, sadness, and mockery, as well as singing and playing the guitar. With his major role often being to protect the youngest member of the crew, the Robot's catchphrases were \\"It does not compute\\" and \\"Danger, Will Robinson!\\", accompanied by flailing his arms. The Robot was performed by Bob May in a prop costume built by Bob Stewart. The voice was primarily dubbed by Dick Tufeld, who was also the series' narrator, and Jorge Arvizu for the Spanish dubbing. The Robot was designed by Robert Kinoshita, who also designed Forbidden Planet's Robby the Robot. Both robots appear together in Lost in Space episode #20, \\"War of the Robots,\\" and in episode #60, \\"Condemned of Space.\\" The Robot did not appear in the unaired pilot episode, but was added to the series once it had been greenlit. Initially, the bellows-covered legs were articulated, and were moved separately by the actor inside. However, the metal edges inside the suit cut actor Bob May's legs, so changes were made. The legs were bolted together, and the robot was pulled along by a wire instead of walking as it had done before. A new lower section was constructed with the legs cut off at the knee. This was filmed either in close-up or behind something to obscure the actor's feet protruding out the bottom; this version of the suit was informally referred to by the cast and crew as \\"the Bermuda shorts.\\" Features and abilities Robot consisted, from top down, of # A glass bubble sensor unit with moving antennae; # A fluted, translucent ring collar (actually an arrangement of shaped ribs, through which performer Bob May could see); # A cylindrical, rotating trunk section with extending bellows arms that terminated in red mechanical claws. The trunk section had controls, indicators, a small sliding translucent door through which data tapes, similar to punched tape, could be accessed (\\"The Hungry Sea\\"), a removable power pack and a signature chest light that illuminated in synchrony with the Robot's speech (May had a key inside the suit that he would tap in time with his speech to illuminate the light, resulting in some scenes where one of the claws can be seen moving in time with the light); # Bellows legs that were understood to move with some agility but which, due to real-world practical limitations, were rarely seen on camera to move separately; and # Trapezoidal continuous track units at the bottom of each leg. These normally paired as a single locomotive device, but they also could function as individual feet. The leg and tractor sections apparently could be readily detached, allowing the Robot to be positioned in the rear of the Chariot ATV, although the actual disconnect operation was depicted only once. According to the series # The Robot possessed powerful computers that allowed him to make complex calculations and to deduce many facts; # He had a variety of sensors that detected numerous phenomena and dangers; # He was programmed with extensive knowledge on many subjects, including how to operate the Jupiter 2 spaceship; # His construction allowed him to function in extreme environments and in the vacuum of space; # He was extremely strong, giving him utility both in performing difficult labor and in fighting when necessary. Moreover, his claws could fire laser beams and, most frequently, a powerful \\"electro-force\\" that was similar to arcing electricity. In one first season episode, Dr. Smith was seen to remove the robot's programming tapes, which resemble a small reel of magnetic tape, from a hatch below the robot's chest panel. After Lost in Space Two versions of the robot were used during Lost in Space filming ‚Äì a \\"hero robot\\" costume worn by Bob May, and a static, \\"stunt robot\\" prop that was used for distant or hazardous shots. Both versions fell into disrepair after the series, but these have since been discovered and restored. The \\"hero\\" is privately owned by TV and film producer Kevin Burns, who commissioned a replica in the early 1990s for touring and conventions. The \\"stunt robot\\" is in storage at the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington. Like Robby the Robot, the B-9 Robot prop costume was re-used on at least one other show. On the Saturday morning children's show Mystery Island, it was modified to make the primary character \\"P.O.P.S.\\" There it had different domes, different color scheme, and an added rectangular skirt of gold-colored tubes, covering the rubber bellows legs and base. Full-size replicas of the robot are available commercially. Other versions have been built by hobbyists around the world, who have built at least 15 detailed full-size replicas of the Robot. In the 1998 film, the Robot is originally a sleeker design equipped with weapons, but its original form is destroyed during a fight on an alien ship. Will is able to download most of its consciousness before the robot's original body is destroyed, filling in the gaps with extracts of his own neural patterns, and eventually manages to build a new body for it that bears a resemblance to its appearance in the original series. In the 2018 Netflix series, the Robot is an alien AI which bears only a few resemblances with earlier versions, such as his famous line and loyalty to Will.

To the west of the Southern Alps lies the Alpine Fault, a major fault boundary, that passes through the South Island from Fiordland in the south, to the Marlborough Region in the north, where it divides into multiple faults. The Pacific Plate lies to the east of the Alpine Fault and the Australian Plate lies to the west. The Pacific Plate is sliding SSW at about 35mm/yr, relative to the Australian Plate, and rising up 10mm/yr, generating the Southern Alps. The Alpine Fault did not develop until early Miocene times (23 Ma). Ten million years ago the Southern Alps were low hills, and they only became mountainous as recently as 5 million years ago. To the east of the Southern Alps are the Canterbury Plains, formed by the sediment eroded from the Southern Alps. On the coast, just southeast of Christchurch, is Banks Peninsula, composed of two large mainly basaltic Miocene volcanoes. Basement rocks All basement rocks beneath the Canterbury Region belong to the Torlesse Composite (Rakaia and Pahau) Terrane. They are largely composed of greywacke (hardened sandstone and mudstone) that accumulated in a deep marine environment and were accreted to the Gondwana continent before the Tasman Sea opened up in late Cretaceous times (80 Ma). They outcrop in the Southern Alps and the foothills. The Rakaia Terrane rocks, of Permian to late Triassic age (300‚Äì200 Ma), occur south of Rangiora. The Pahau Terrane rocks, of late Jurassic to early Cretaceous age (160‚Äì100 Ma), occur to the north, and are probably derived from the Rakaia Terrane. At the boundary between these two terranes is the Esk Head Belt, an 11 km wide melange of broken and deformed rocks. The basement rocks just to the east of the Alpine Fault and to the south of Timaru have been metamorphosed into schist. Southern Alps The Southern Alps began as sedimentary deposits between 230 and 170 million years ago. The predominantly greywacke formations were uplifted into mountain ranges between 140 and 120 million years ago. From about 26 million years ago, a second continuing period of uplift formed the present-day Southern Alps, driven by the collision of the Pacific tectonic plate with the Australian Plate. The plate boundary is represented by the Alpine Fault which runs slightly west of the main divide of the Southern Alps. Mount Somers Volcanics Volcanic activity occurred around the Mount Somers / Te Kiekie area, and nearby foothills, in late Cretaceous times (100‚Äì66 Ma). Remnants still exist in the foothills from the Malvern Hills and the Rangitata River. Limestone Sandstone, mudstone and some limestone were deposited throughout many areas from late Cretaceous to Pliocene times. Oligocene (34‚Äì24 Ma) limestone outcrops occur in South Canterbury around the Opihi River area, and in North Canterbury around Omihi, and further north near Waiau. Outcrops also occur south of Castle Hill. Banks Peninsula The Lyttelton and Akaroa Harbours correspond to two large overlapping volcanoes, that built Banks Peninsula in late Miocene times (11‚Äì6 Ma). Pliocene Volcanics Basalt eruptions occurred near Timaru and Geraldine, around 2.5 Ma. Glacial Lakes and Moraines Lakes such as Lake Pukaki and Lake Tekapo in the MacKenzie Country represent the beds of previous glaciers. Quaternary Deposits Much of the Canterbury Plains are covered by alluvial deposits from the many large rivers coming out of the Southern Alps. Earthquakes Generally, there are few earthquakes in the Canterbury Region. However, the Alpine Fault last ruptured in 1717 CE, and a major earthquake on the Alpine Fault can be expected to occur every 200 to 300 years. Liquefaction of the ground can occur up to 150 km from the epicentre for a large earthquake. Notable earthquakes include: * The 1888 North Canterbury earthquake * The 2010 Canterbury earthquake, 7.1 magnitude, causing widespread damage * The 2011 Canterbury earthquake, 6.3 magnitude, causing widespread damage and deaths Geological sites of interest *Drive around Banks Peninsula. Look for Castle Rock, above Heathcote Valley, The Remarkable Dikes near Kaituna Pass, etc. *Drive from Christchurch to Arthurs Pass, and over the Southern Alps, to Greymouth. Look for the change from greywacke to schist, as you near the Alpine Fault. *Drive up to Mount Cook, and visit the Hooker and Tasman Glaciers. *Drive from Christchurch to Hanmer Springs, for a hot swim, and see the limestone at Weka Pass on the way.

The school targets a population of students, newly arrived immigrants, who have historically been under-served nationally, in California, and in Oakland. History OIHS is a member of The Internationals Network for Public Schools, a non-profit organization that grew out of the work of a group of international high schools in New York City. It now supports 12 schools in New York and California. The first international high school, located on the campus of LaGuardia Community College, opened in 1985; two more followed in the 1990s. Since 2001, the network has opened and supported nine additional high schools with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The network of schools annually serves 4,000 students immigrating from 90 countries. The network's mission is to provide quality education to recently arrived immigrants by developing and interconnecting small high schools based on the Internationals approach. Site The school campus is the former Verdese Carter Middle School, built in the 1970s. The site formerly served as Woodrow Wilson Junior High School from 1926. Mission The mission of OIHS is to provide newly arrived immigrants a quality alternative education focused on English language acquisition in preparation for college. Students 100% of the student body is made up of English language learners, nearly all of whom immigrated to the US in the last four years. Collectively, students speak over 30 languages other than English. Students have come from over three dozen countries: Afghanistan, Brazil, Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, China, Congo, C√¥te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Cuba, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, El Salvador, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iraq, Japan, Liberia, Macau, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Yemen. 52% of students are Latino, 6% African, 36% Asian, and 6% Arab or White. Approximately 25% of students hold refugee immigration status, having escaped ethnic conflicts in Liberia, Nepal, Burma, and Central Asia. More than 90% of the student body qualifies for free or reduced-price lunch. Approximately 97.2% of students are socioeconomically disadvantaged. To promote a sense of community and support, class sizes are kept small, holding only 25 students or fewer. The total enrollment for the school in the 2017-2018 academic year was 360 students, maintaining a maximum of 100 students per grade level. In their freshman and sophomore years, students at OIHS are kept within a tight circle of the same four teachers who strengthen their basic English skills. As upperclassmen, students are acquainted with new teachers and are given the opportunity to participate in internships at local businesses, government bureaus, and community service programs. Curriculum Experts conclude that we must infuse our textbooks with information from the minority perspective, instead of incorporating a few instances of it into a white history book, placing an emphasis on culturally relevant teaching. Teachers at Oakland International High School incorporate many aspects of the students' culture into the everyday curriculum. Additionally, the school organizes \\"Community Walks\\" in which students become the teachers and educate the staff on their cultural backgrounds and customs. These Community Walks include the sharing of cultural dishes and visits to local ethnic enclaves such as grocery stores and churches. Bilingual education was barred from the classroom in 1998 by California Proposition 227, but these restrictions were repealed by California Proposition 58 when it passed in 2016. In support of this, Professor Ofelia Garc√≠a of the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, argued that dynamic (meaning-making) bilingualism which integrates culture and language together in the classroom can yield more desirable results in both the short and long term than complete immersion in an English-only classroom. In the ongoing debate on bilingual education, OIHS chooses to implement an immersion approach, despite scholarly evidence that supports transitional and bilingual education models. Although OIHS is advertised as an English immersion school, language support from teachers, volunteers, and even other students is encouraged. Furthermore, teachers are trained on the refugee experience and its various narratives in order to best educate their students and help with the resettlement of these populations. Refugees may or may not have had formal education prior to arriving in the American classroom.  Internationals approach  OIHS teachers are trained in the Internationals Approach to teach students to improve their speaking, writing, and reading skills in English. This approach is built on the belief that English-language acquisition is best fostered in an academic environment in which students participate in 1) heterogeneous groups, using 2) a project-based curriculum, and where 3) English development is integrated into all content areas. Working in small groups, students learn academic content, art, music and technology through exciting, rigorous, hands-on projects as they learn their new language.Kessler, J. (2009). Oakland Unified School District case study: OIHS. Stanford, CA: School Redesign Network at Stanford University.  Modern context  25,000 new refugee students enter the U.S. public education system each year. OIHS was founded in 2007, preceding the year 2008 when the United States received 70% of the world‚Äôs refugees equating to 60,190 people. These figures reflect the fact that about half of the world's refugee population are minors. Through the Refugee Act, refugees upon arrival in the U.S. receive eight months of medical and cash assistance; however services for youth refugees are limited, even in schools which have been proven to be the most stable and effective institution of support for refugee families.

It is native to the waters of the Pacific Ocean off western North America from Baja California to Alaska. The body of the vermilion rockfish is moderately deep and compressed. The upper profile of the head is somewhat curved; the mouth is large, with the lower jaw slightly projecting. The color is bright red on the body and fins; many with black and gray mottling on back and sides. On fish shorter than the mottling is much more apparent and the fins are often edged with black. The yelloweye and canary rockfishes are similar in appearance to the vermilion, but the bottom of their lower jaws is scaleless and feels smooth to the touch. The vermilion rockfish has scales on the bottom of the lower jaw which make it rough to the touch. It may also be confused with the brown rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus) in deep water. Range The vermilion rockfish occurs in the Eastern Pacific from Baja California, to Alaska. It is generally caught over rocky bottoms at depths of , although it has been taken from depths as great as . Reproduction The vermilion rockfish appears to mature and spawn for the first time at age 3-4\\\\. A vermilion rockfish that was long was estimated to contain 282,000 eggs. By this measure a female might hold as many as 500,000 eggs. The principal reproductive period is from December through March. As with all other rockfish, fertilization is internal and the young are mobile. The free swimming young feed primarily upon shrimp- like organisms, while the larger, bottom-living adults feed almost exclusively upon fishes (smaller kinds of rockfish), squid and octopus. Fishing Because a good rockfish \\"hole\\" often will yield a dozen or more kinds on any given day, it has been said that rockfish fishing is colorful, interesting, productive, and mysterious. Vermilion rockfish usually are found in the bag of \\"red\\" rockfish taken from one of these holes. The same rig, bait, and technique used for bocaccio works for vermilion rockfish. Rebaiting can be reduced by using a tough, difficult-to-steal bait, such as a piece of squid or salted mackerel.

The people that lived in this province, also called the Ulaid, are claimed as being descended from the Clanna Rudraige and in medieval texts are often referred to by that name. Etymology The Clanna Rudraige may mean \\"descendants of Rudraige\\" (a personal name) or \\"descendants of the Rudraige\\", a population name like Dartraighe or Osraige. An alternate spelling found in medieval texts is Clan na Rudraige, which would lean towards the latter. It is suggested that rud is related to ruad meaning \\"red\\", which would give Rudraige the meaning \\"red people\\". Red also features prominently in the Ulster Cycle of legends: there is the tale of Togail Bruidne D√° Derga, with D√° Derga meaning \\"red god\\"; the term Cr√≥eb Ruad translates as Red Branch, a royal house near the Ulaid capital Emain Macha;Whitley Stokes (ed. & trans.), \\"Tidings of Conchobar mac Nessa\\", √âriu 4, 1910, pp. 18-38 and the Red Branch Knights, which was a military order wholly in the service of ancient Ulaid.

Rowman & Littlefield, 1992. p.73 Origins The origins and background of the Clanna Rudraige comes from medieval texts, most of which combined myth, pseudo-history and possible real events into an elaborate and largely fabricated legendary history. According to one of these works, the Annals of the Four Masters, the Clanna Rudraige are descended from Rudraige mac Sithrigi, a prince of the province of Ulaid who became High King of Ireland sometime between the 1st and 3rd centuries BC. During the reign of Eochu Feidlech as High-King, the provinces of Ireland are said to have been turned into kingdoms, with the ruler of each tribe who possessed a province becoming a king, as such the first king of Ulster was Fergus mac L√©ti, grandson of Rudraige mac Sithrigi. Fergus' cousin Conchobar mac Nessa was king of Ulaid during the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. According to these medieval texts, in the fourth century the Three Collas invaded Ulaid. The Three Collas and their armies fought seven battles in a week against the Ulaid at Achaidh Leithdeircc, killing Fergus Foga, king of Ulster, in the seventh battle. The Collas burnt Emain Macha, the capital of Ulaid, after which it was abandoned, and seized substantial territories in mid-Ulster. This is thought to be the origin of the medieval over-kingdom of Airg√≠alla.

This fish is also commonly called yellowtail rockfish or yellowtail seaperch. Description The body of the yellowtail rockfish is elongate and compressed. The head is rather long and the upper profile is steep and slightly curved. The lower jaw projects, but not beyond the upper profile of the head. The color is grayish brown above which shades to white below. The sides are finely spotted with yellow. The tail is yellow, while the other fins are dusky yellow. When the fish is fresh, reddish brown speckling is visible on some of the scales. As with many of the rockfish, identification can be somewhat difficult. Some of the distinguishing characteristics of the yellow tail rockfish include a convex (surface curves outward) space between the eyes, the absence of spines on top of the head, a projecting lower jaw, an anal fin with eight (rarely seven) soft rays and the lining of the belly is white. Range The yellowtail rockfish occurs from San Diego, California, to Kodiak Island, Alaska; it is caught commercially off the coast of British Columbia, as well as being caught by recreational anglers off of central and northern California. It is regularly found over deep reefs from the surface to depths of 1,800 feet Natural history Adult yellowtail rockfish feed on small hake, anchovies, lanternfish, and other small fishes, as well as on small squid, and other shrimp-like organisms. These are all good baits to use for the yellowtail rockfish. A few yellowtail rockfish mature when 11 inches long or 3 years old. Fifty percent are mature when 13 inches long or 5 years old. They may live to be 24 years old. As with other rockfishes, fertilization is internal and live young are born. The number of developing eggs increases from 50,000 in a fish 12 inches long to about 633,000 in a fish 19 to 21 inches long. Genetics A potential PCR-RFLP genetic sex marker developed for gopher rockfish does not successfully distinguish male and female yellowtail rockfish. Fishing information When fishing for yellowtail rockfish in deeper waters, the typical rockfish rig and bait is appropriate. Since this species occurs quite often at or near the surface, standard surface fishing techniques and baits such as anchovies or squid fished on a small hook are effective. Small silvery lures or small lead and rubber jigs also work well Status Separate stock assessments for yellowtail rockfish in the waters off British Columbia, and the West Coast of the United States north of Cape Mendocino have estimated the stock as healthy (above the management limits) with overfishing not occurring. Yellowtail rockfish in the Gulf of Alaska were included in an \\"Other Rockfish\\" stock complex which was also estimated as not experiencing overfishing. The stock of yellowtail rockfish south of Cape Mendocino are estimated to be genetically distinct from those further north, but insufficient information was available to estimate the status of the stock in this area.

Many authors use the term noncommutative ring to refer to rings which are not necessarily commutative, and hence include commutative rings in their definition. Noncommutative algebra is the study of results applying to rings that are not required to be commutative. Many important results in the field of noncommutative algebra area apply to commutative rings as special cases. Although some authors do not assume that rings have a multiplicative identity, in this article we make that assumption unless stated otherwise.

History  Beginning with division rings arising from geometry, the study of noncommutative rings has grown into a major area of modern algebra. The theory and exposition of noncommutative rings was expanded and refined in the 19th and 20th centuries by numerous authors. An incomplete list of such contributors includes E. Artin, Richard Brauer, P. M. Cohn, W. R. Hamilton, I. N. Herstein, N. Jacobson, K. Morita, E. Noether, √ò. Ore and others.  Differences between commutative and noncommutative algebra  Because noncommutative rings are a much larger class of rings than the commutative rings, their structure and behavior is less well understood. A great deal of work has been done successfully generalizing some results from commutative rings to noncommutative rings. A major difference between rings which are and are not commutative is the necessity to separately consider right ideals and left ideals. It is common for noncommutative ring theorists to enforce a condition on one of these types of ideals while not requiring it to hold for the opposite side. For commutative rings, the left‚Äìright distinction does not exist.  Important classes  Division rings A division ring, also called a skew field, is a ring in which division is possible. Specifically, it is a nonzero ringIn this article, rings have a 1. in which every nonzero element a has a multiplicative inverse, i.e., an element x with . Stated differently, a ring is a division ring if and only if the group of units equals the set of all nonzero elements. Division rings differ from fields only in that their multiplication is not required to be commutative. However, by Wedderburn's little theorem all finite division rings are commutative and therefore finite fields. Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ‚Äúcommutative fields‚Äù. Semisimple rings A module over a (not necessarily commutative) ring with unity is said to be semisimple (or completely reducible) if it is the direct sum of simple (irreducible) submodules. A ring is said to be (left)-semisimple if it is semisimple as a left module over itself. Surprisingly, a left-semisimple ring is also right-semisimple and vice versa. The left/right distinction is therefore unnecessary. Semiprimitive rings A semiprimitive ring or Jacobson semisimple ring or J-semisimple ring is a ring whose Jacobson radical is zero. This is a type of ring more general than a semisimple ring, but where simple modules still provide enough information about the ring. Rings such as the ring of integers are semiprimitive, and an artinian semiprimitive ring is just a semisimple ring. Semiprimitive rings can be understood as subdirect products of primitive rings, which are described by the Jacobson density theorem. Simple rings A simple ring is a non-zero ring that has no two- sided ideal besides the zero ideal and itself. A simple ring can always be considered as a simple algebra. Rings which are simple as rings but not as modules do exist: the full matrix ring over a field does not have any nontrivial ideals (since any ideal of M(n,R) is of the form M(n,I) with I an ideal of R), but has nontrivial left ideals (namely, the sets of matrices which have some fixed zero columns). According to the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem, every simple ring that is left or right Artinian is a matrix ring over a division ring. In particular, the only simple rings that are a finite- dimensional vector space over the real numbers are rings of matrices over either the real numbers, the complex numbers, or the quaternions. Any quotient of a ring by a maximal ideal is a simple ring. In particular, a field is a simple ring. A ring R is simple if and only its opposite ring Ro is simple. An example of a simple ring that is not a matrix ring over a division ring is the Weyl algebra. Important theorems Wedderburn's little theorem  Wedderburn's little theorem states that every finite domain is a field. In other words, for finite rings, there is no distinction between domains, skew- fields and fields. The Artin‚ÄìZorn theorem generalizes the theorem to alternative rings: every finite simple alternative ring is a field. Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem The Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem is a classification theorem for semisimple rings and semisimple algebras. The theorem states that an (Artinian)Semisimple rings are necessarily Artinian rings. Some authors use \\"semisimple\\" to mean the ring has a trivial Jacobson radical. For Artinian rings, the two notions are equivalent, so \\"Artinian\\" is included here to eliminate that ambiguity. semisimple ring R is isomorphic to a product of finitely many ni-by-ni matrix rings over division rings Di, for some integers ni, both of which are uniquely determined up to permutation of the index i. In particular, any simple left or right Artinian ring is isomorphic to an n-by-n matrix ring over a division ring D, where both n and D are uniquely determined. As a direct corollary, the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem implies that every simple ring that is finite-dimensional over a division ring (a simple algebra) is a matrix ring. This is Joseph Wedderburn's original result. Emil Artin later generalized it to the case of Artinian rings. Jacobson density theorem The Jacobson density theorem is a theorem concerning simple modules over a ring .Isaacs, p. 184 The theorem can be applied to show that any primitive ring can be viewed as a \\"dense\\" subring of the ring of linear transformations of a vector space.Such rings of linear transformations are also known as full linear rings.Isaacs, Corollary 13.16, p. 187 This theorem first appeared in the literature in 1945, in the famous paper \\"Structure Theory of Simple Rings Without Finiteness Assumptions\\" by Nathan Jacobson. This can be viewed as a kind of generalization of the Artin- Wedderburn theorem's conclusion about the structure of simple Artinian rings. More formally, the theorem can be stated as follows: :The Jacobson Density Theorem. Let be a simple right -module, , and a finite and -linearly independent set. If is a -linear transformation on then there exists such that for all in .Isaacs, Theorem 13.14, p. 185 Nakayama's lemma Let J(R) be the Jacobson radical of R. If U is a right module over a ring, R, and I is a right ideal in R, then define U¬∑I to be the set of all (finite) sums of elements of the form u¬∑i, where ¬∑ is simply the action of R on U. Necessarily, U¬∑I is a submodule of U. If V is a maximal submodule of U, then U/V is simple. So U¬∑J(R) is necessarily a subset of V, by the definition of J(R) and the fact that U/V is simple. Thus, if U contains at least one (proper) maximal submodule, U¬∑J(R) is a proper submodule of U. However, this need not hold for arbitrary modules U over R, for U need not contain any maximal submodules. Naturally, if U is a Noetherian module, this holds. If R is Noetherian, and U is finitely generated, then U is a Noetherian module over R, and the conclusion is satisfied. Somewhat remarkable is that the weaker assumption, namely that U is finitely generated as an R-module (and no finiteness assumption on R), is sufficient to guarantee the conclusion. This is essentially the statement of Nakayama's lemma. Precisely, one has the following. :Nakayama's lemma: Let U be a finitely generated right module over a ring R. If U is a non-zero module, then U¬∑J(R) is a proper submodule of U. A version of the lemma holds for right modules over non-commutative unitary rings R. The resulting theorem is sometimes known as the Jacobson‚ÄìAzumaya theorem. Noncommutative localization Localization is a systematic method of adding multiplicative inverses to a ring, and is usually applied to commutative rings. Given a ring R and a subset S, one wants to construct some ring R* and ring homomorphism from R to R*, such that the image of S consists of units (invertible elements) in R*. Further one wants R* to be the 'best possible' or 'most general' way to do this - in the usual fashion this should be expressed by a universal property. The localization of R by S is usually denoted by S ‚àí1R; however other notations are used in some important special cases. If S is the set of the non zero elements of an integral domain, then the localization is the field of fractions and thus usually denoted Frac(R). Localizing non-commutative rings is more difficult; the localization does not exist for every set S of prospective units. One condition which ensures that the localization exists is the Ore condition. One case for non-commutative rings where localization has a clear interest is for rings of differential operators. It has the interpretation, for example, of adjoining a formal inverse D‚àí1 for a differentiation operator D. This is done in many contexts in methods for differential equations. There is now a large mathematical theory about it, named microlocalization, connecting with numerous other branches. The micro- tag is to do with connections with Fourier theory, in particular. Morita equivalence Morita equivalence is a relationship defined between rings that preserves many ring-theoretic properties. It is named after Japanese mathematician Kiiti Morita who defined equivalence and a similar notion of duality in 1958. Two rings R and S (associative, with 1) are said to be (Morita) equivalent if there is an equivalence of the category of (left) modules over R, R-Mod, and the category of (left) modules over S, S-Mod. It can be shown that the left module categories R-Mod and S-Mod are equivalent if and only if the right module categories Mod-R and Mod-S are equivalent. Further it can be shown that any functor from R-Mod to S-Mod that yields an equivalence is automatically additive. Brauer group The Brauer group of a field K is an abelian group whose elements are Morita equivalence classes of central simple algebras of finite rank over K and addition is induced by the tensor product of algebras. It arose out of attempts to classify division algebras over a field and is named after the algebraist Richard Brauer. The group may also be defined in terms of Galois cohomology. More generally, the Brauer group of a scheme is defined in terms of Azumaya algebras. Ore conditions The Ore condition is a condition introduced by √òystein Ore, in connection with the question of extending beyond commutative rings the construction of a field of fractions, or more generally localization of a ring. The right Ore condition for a multiplicative subset S of a ring R is that for and , the intersection . A domain that satisfies the right Ore condition is called a right Ore domain. The left case is defined similarly. Goldie's theorem In mathematics, Goldie's theorem is a basic structural result in ring theory, proved by Alfred Goldie during the 1950s. What is now termed a right Goldie ring is a ring R that has finite uniform dimension (also called \\"finite rank\\") as a right module over itself, and satisfies the ascending chain condition on right annihilators of subsets of R. Goldie's theorem states that the semiprime right Goldie rings are precisely those that have a semisimple Artinian right classical ring of quotients. The structure of this ring of quotients is then completely determined by the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem. In particular, Goldie's theorem applies to semiprime right Noetherian rings, since by definition right Noetherian rings have the ascending chain condition on all right ideals. This is sufficient to guarantee that a right- Noetherian ring is right Goldie. The converse does not hold: every right Ore domain is a right Goldie domain, and hence so is every commutative integral domain. A consequence of Goldie's theorem, again due to Goldie, is that every semiprime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of prime principal right ideal rings. Every prime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a matrix ring over a right Ore domain.

It is commonly called the Chilipepper rockfish and Chilipepper seaperch. Description The body of sebastes goodei is slender and rather elongate. The head is elongate, pointed and with no spines; the lower jaw is projecting. The adult fish is generally pinkish-red becoming whitish below with pink fins. Juveniles are light olive on back. The middle of the chillipepper's side, the lateral line, stands out clearly, as a lighter, bright red zone. In comparison to the bocaccio, it has a smaller mouth with an upper jaw that extends only to about the center of the eye, not past it. Chilipeppers may live to be 35 years old. The record length is 22 inches (56 cm), and weight is 5.25 pounds. Range This species occurs from Magdalena Bay, Baja California, to Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Sebastes goodei are not taken as frequently as other rockfishes because they are rarely caught in depths less than 360 feet along the coast of California. They generally occur over rocky bottoms at depths between 160‚Äì820 feet (50‚Äì250 m) and have been taken as deep as 1,080 feet. Natural history Adult sebastes goodei feed on small crustaceans, small squids, or on such fishes as anchovies, young hake, small sardines, and lanternfishes. Approximately 50 percent of the males mature when 8.75 inches long and 2 years old; while 50 percent of the females are mature when they are 12 inches long and 4 years old. Chili peppers may live to be at least 16 years old. As with other rockfishes, fertilization is internal and live young are born. The number of developing eggs increases from 29,000 in a 12-inch female to about 538,000 in a 22-inch fish. Rockfish have internal fertilization, eggs incubate and embryos hatch in the ovaries, with subsequent extrusion of larvae. Fishing information The usual rig for sebastes goodei is made up of three to six hooks above a sinker that is heavy enough to take the line to the bottom on a fairly straight course. Sebastes goodei are often fished in midwater as well on the bottom. Because of the depths, it may take a considerable amount of time to lower and raise this fishing rig; therefore, the bait should be tough enough to remain on the hook while being chewed upon. Pieces of squid, dried salted anchovies or strip bait, or cut bait as it is commonly known, consists of small strips of flesh with the skin still on from freshly caught rockfish, mackerel or other fishes are ideal.

Since locally compact abelian groups have a well-understood theory, Pontryagin duality, which includes the basic structures of Fourier series and Fourier transforms, the major business of non-commutative harmonic analysis is usually taken to be the extension of the theory to all groups G that are locally compact. The case of compact groups is understood, qualitatively and after the Peter‚ÄìWeyl theorem from the 1920s, as being generally analogous to that of finite groups and their character theory. The main task is therefore the case of G that is locally compact, not compact and not commutative. The interesting examples include many Lie groups, and also algebraic groups over p-adic fields. These examples are of interest and frequently applied in mathematical physics, and contemporary number theory, particularly automorphic representations. What to expect is known as the result of basic work of John von Neumann. He showed that if the von Neumann group algebra of G is of type I, then L2(G) as a unitary representation of G is a direct integral of irreducible representations. It is parametrized therefore by the unitary dual, the set of isomorphism classes of such representations, which is given the hull-kernel topology. The analogue of the Plancherel theorem is abstractly given by identifying a measure on the unitary dual, the Plancherel measure, with respect to which the direct integral is taken. (For Pontryagin duality the Plancherel measure is some Haar measure on the dual group to G, the only issue therefore being its normalization.) For general locally compact groups, or even countable discrete groups, the von Neumann group algebra need not be of type I and the regular representation of G cannot be written in terms of irreducible representations, even though it is unitary and completely reducible. An example where this happens is the infinite symmetric group, where the von Neumann group algebra is the hyperfinite type II1 factor. The further theory divides up the Plancherel measure into a discrete and a continuous part. For semisimple groups, and classes of solvable Lie groups, a very detailed theory is available.

He is best known for his flagship restaurant, Bouley. Early in his career, Bouley worked in restaurants in Cape Cod, Santa Fe, New Mexico, and, eventually, France and Switzerland. While in Europe, after studies at the Sorbonne, he had the opportunity to work with chefs Roger Verg√©, Paul Bocuse, Jo√´l Robuchon, Gaston Len√¥tre, and Fr√©dy Girardet. Bouley returned to work in New York City in leading restaurants of the time, such as Le Cirque, Le P√©rigord, and La C√¥te Basque, as well as spending time as sous chef in a restaurant opened by Roger Verg√© in San Francisco. In 1985, he became chef of Montrachet restaurant. In 1987 he opened his own restaurant, \\"Bouley,\\" in TriBeCa overlooking Duane Park. The restaurant earned a four-star review in The New York Times and won James Beard Foundation awards for the Best Restaurant and Best Chef, among other Beard Awards. In 2015, Bouley was awarded the \\"Best Restaurant Award in the United States\\" from TripAdvisor's Traveler's Choice Awards, ranking #15 in the world. Bouley also received 29 out a 30 rating in Zagat. In 1991, Zagat's asked its 7,000 diners, \\"Where you would you eat the last meal of your life?\\" Respondents \\"overwhelmingly\\" chose Bouley. In 1997, Bouley restaurant moved location and opened up as the Bouley Bakery. In September 1999, Bouley opened Danube, a Viennese-inspired restaurant, located on Hudson Street, and authored his first book East of Paris: The New Cuisines of Austria and the Danube. Following the September 11 attacks, Bouley Bakery served as a base to feed rescue and relief workers at Ground Zero. Known as The Green Tarp, over one million meals for Ground Zero relief workers were prepared in conjunction with the Red Cross. Bouley Bakery re-opened in 2002. In the summer of 2006, Bouley married collaborator Nicole Bartelme, pioneer of the TriBeCa Film Festival, artist and photographer.Crampton, Thomas, (August 25, 2006), |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/26/nyregion/26BOULEY.html date=June 4, 2015}} Restaurants Bouley Bakery earned two Michelin Stars before it changed locations in 2008 and was renamed Bouley Restaurant. His other restaurant, Danube, also initially received two Michelin stars. The Danube location was transformed into a new entity called Brushstroke Restaurant. Brushstroke Restaurant, located at 30 Hudson Street and opened in April 2011, was a combined effort between Bouley and the Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka, to share Japanese food culture and products while integrating American ingredients. Bouley Test Kitchen is a private event and testing learning center for visiting guest chefs and for developing recipes for the Bouley enterprises. The facilities were used by the American Team for the Bocuse d'Or Competition 2011. It was relocated from TriBeCa, lower Manhattan, to the Flat Iron District in October 2017. Bouley Botanical, on another corner in TriBeCa, located at 281 Church Street, is an event space dedicated to cultivating nutrient-rich plants, served in the flagship Bouley Restaurant. It also serves as an educational forum to develop creative healthy eating lifestyles through its lecture series: The Chef & The Doctor. Bouley at Home, a fine dining restaurant, is Bouley's first venture in Manhattan crossing Canal Street. Located at 31 West 21st Street in the Flat Iron District, Bouley at Home is a collaboration with Bulthaup Kitchen Design group based in Germany, with divisions across the United States and Europe.

His speech attracted considerable media attention and drew responses from a number of Members of Parliament from Singapore's governing People's Action Party (PAP), including Minister Mentor, Lee Kuan Yew. Lee stated that he wanted to \\"bring the House back to earth\\" on the issue of racial equality in Singapore, and rebut Viswa's \\"false and flawed\\" arguments.

It was built around 1860. In 2002 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It has remained a private residence since its original construction. Building The house sits on a long, narrow () lot on the east side of the street, a short distance north of the Kingston Stockade District and three houses south of Tremper Avenue. The neighborhood is exclusively residential, except for the nearby Sharp Burial Ground. A non- contributing pool and outbuilding are located behind the house. It is a two- and-a-half-story building on a brick foundation. The clapboard siding rises to a steeply pitched mansard roof with two cross-gables. It is shingled in patterned slate. The rooflines are marked by heavily molded cornices, paired brackets and decorative friezes. The gables are topped with finials. On the southwest corner of the west (front) facade is a one-and-a-half-story projecting bay. At the first story this features a bay window. A porch stretches across the rest of the facade at that story. Its roof is supported by three chamfered and paneled posts with brackets. The main entrance has leaded sidelights and an arched top light. A similar bay, two and a half stories high, projects from the south side. It too has a bay window at ground level. A single-story rear wing projects from the east, adjacent to an enclosed porch now part of an expanded kitchen. The north profile has no projections or additions. Inside, the house has a double-pile central hall plan. The first story retains much of its original finishing, such as carved newels and balusters on the stairs, molded door and window surrounds and decorated plaster cornices and ceilings. The second story also has its original plan and finishings; the attic has been renovated, opening up the space once used as servants' quarters. It still has some of the original finishing. History The house is believed to have been built around 1860, probably following patterns in books by Andrew Jackson Downing, who had strongly promoted the Picturesque mode as an ideal for American residential construction during his lifetime. Few significant owners are known. In 1909 the city directory gives the owner as Charles Banker, a local osteopathic physician. In 1921 it was the property of Vincent Gorman and his wife, Margaret.https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/in-kingston-a-house-of-legends- video/article_83851845-7eff-5f80-8fe9-6ad44232ce83.html Gorman was a founding partner of the city's Rose Gorman Rose department store. In 1965 the house was purchased by George and Bianca Vogel. Their family, which included 4 children, lived in the house for about 20 years.

The band's current line-up consists of Nicholas Shacklette ( Guitar/Vocals), Bradley Wood (Bass), and Jeff Carter (Drums/Vocals). The band signed to Bombworks Records, an indie metal label based out of Seattle, Washington, in 2007. History After touring and recording with now widely recognized hardcore/metalcore band, The Chariot, drummer Jeff Carter mutually agreed to part ways due to a conflict in stylistic preferences in music. Having been fond of death/progressive metal growing up, it was his concern to start something up in the veins of such bands he admired. He soon got in touch with friend and vocalist David Hopper, in winter of 2005 who was also looking to begin work with such a band. After putting out a call to find others in the greater Atlanta area wanting to play progressive/melodic metal, guitarists Jay Sexton and Damien Chason were introduced into Deus Invictus. By mid-2005, Deus Invictus began playing shows all around the southeast with such bands as Mychildren Mybride, With Blood Comes Cleansing, With Faith or Flames, and Drag the Waters to name a few. It was not long that the momentum which had built up was nearly shattered by a series of critical lineup changes, which coincidentally, changed both the scope and professionalism of the band. It was then that guitarist Damien Chason parted ways with the band on good terms. Bassist Matthew Lee was also replaced with Illinois native, Jeff Watt. Soon to follow Jeff Watt into the band was guitarist Nich Shacklette, a Louisville, Kentucky native. With these changes, Deus Invictus strived more on writing new material while still playing many shows in order to maintain their strong support in Georgia, as well as the Southeast. Following several months of writing and playing these shows, Deus Invictus would be parting ways with Jeff Watt, who in turn, was replaced by Randy Searcy. Following the entrance of Randy into the group, founding member David Hopper stepped down from being the vocalist for the band, and members coped by becoming proficient at handling vocal responsibilities whilst playing their instruments in a live setting. As the band was now a four-piece, the musical prevalence shifted from old school death metal to playing with a tech death/grind edge. Shows were performed alongside such bands as All Shall Perish, The Faceless, Arsis, and many other well-known acts. Due to the member changes and shift in musical direction, the band would then only play shows in and around the Atlanta region. Sensing the need for a dedicated vocalist so as to relieve the instrumentalists of the band to focus solely on musicality, the band brought a well-auditioned Joseph Calleiro in as a permanent vocalist in early 2007. For several months, this lineup played shows and even recorded and published a track for Bombworks Records' \\"Cornerstone 2007 Sampler\\", which included acts A Hill to Die Upon, Dagon, and Common Yet Forbidden. After this, bassist Searcy played a few last shows with Deus Invictus, but also ran into conflicts that couldn't be resolved unless ways were parted with the band. Deus Invictus began working with Bombworks Records on joining their artist roster by late 2008. An unreleased demo for the future track ‚ÄúRain of God‚Äù was released on the Cornerstone Sampler in preparation to the band joining the label at Cornerstone at their own mini-festival, \\"Day of Metal\\". After playing Cornerstone Festival on a few different stages and with great crowd response, the band signed on with Bombworks and began finalizing material for their first full-length release. Joseph then parted ways with Deus Invictus, and the group continued to write material for their debut album. At that time, Deus Invictus were prepared to enter the studio as a three-piece until receiving a phone call from bassist Brad Wood, whom would serve to complete the band's bassist role from 2008, onward. Jeff Carter and Nich Shacklette decided it would be best to take a full year off to properly write the album, and by January 2009, Deus Invictus were confirmed to record with locally renowned engineer Charles Clifton of Redroom 104 studios, best known for producing and recording local, yet well known acts such as The Glass Ocean. Clifton would bring a fresh view of the band's former production/style, and would attempt to capture a sound both raw, yet laser-sharp; focusing the barrage of sonic diversity that Deus Invictus sought to bring forth on their first major effort. It is notable that members of the band were also juggling full-time work, which played into the fact that \\"Staged in Awaiting\\" encountered many obstacles for the bandmates to jump through as far as time constraints were concerned. After initial completion of engineering, it was then decided by the band to send the unfinished recording down for mixing/mastering by well-known death metal frontman Erik Rutan's (Hate Eternal/Morbid Angel) Mana Recording Studios, located in St. Petersburg, FL. The album was officially finished/released in September 2010 worldwide to many positive reviews, being made available on many popular online merchant websites including Nuclear Blast America, Relapse Records Online, CDBaby, iTunes, and the like. Many people made comment on Deus Invictus' somewhat \\"newer\\" and more \\"cohesive\\" sound together, and as a band abroad in the progressive death metal genre. Most notable on the many international music reviews of \\"Staged in Awaiting\\" was the fact that critics were at first, both shocked and confused by its musical arrangements stylistically. It was cited by many that the genre- crossing performance on the album were both jarring, yet strangely cohesive; both blindingly chaotic, yet retaining a nearly symphonic edge of cacophony amongst instruments and vocals. With 4 vocalists performing their renditions across all tracks, and mainly at a moment's notice, this new invention of progressive-metal-bent-death seemed to be classified all its own. Deus Invictus played two shows following the release of Staged in Awaiting internationally. It was after said shows that a founding member, Jay Sexton, decided to part ways with the band. After more than a year further into writing the next album, with personal lives beckoning attention into what would normally be reserved for playing shows and touring, the band, as it were, decided to take a hiatus. Carter began putting together a record for his solo project, entitled Darkening, which would realize Jeff‚Äôs full creative potential as a composer, producer and engineer. On this album, indefinitely titled Augur, Jeff sought Mike \\"Prophet\\" Brookes, known from the Florida-based band Monotheist to track two songs on guitar.

Based in New Zealand, their products and systems are sold in around 120 countries worldwide. FPH is primarily an exporting company, with just 1 percent of revenue coming from New Zealand sales. History Fisher & Paykel began in 1934 as an importer of refrigerators, washing machines and radios. In 1938, F&P; signed an agreement with Kelvinator and in the mid-1950s moved to manufacturing products using the company's own technology. The involvement in healthcare started in the late 1960s when F&P; sought involvement in a business that could benefit from their growing manufacturing and electronic expertise. A prototype respiratory humidifier, developed in New Zealand for use with patients being ventilated in hospital intensive care situations, was taken to the production stage by F&P.; Continuing product innovation to improve patient care and development of a world-wide distribution network are two core strengths. The company was separated and was also listed on the stock exchange on 14 November 2001. As part of a re-organisation, Fisher & Paykel Industries Limited was renamed Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited and a new company, Fisher & Paykel Appliances Holdings Limited, was established to own F&P;'s appliances and finance business. In connection with the reorganisation, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited listed on the Australian and New Zealand Stock Exchanges and Nasdaq. In February 2003 the Nasdaq listing was terminated. Business areas The company maintains focus on two major product groups. Respiratory and Acute Care Respiratory humidifiers, single-use and reusable chambers and breathing circuits and accessories. These are designed to humidify and deliver the gases that a patient receives during mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, oxygen therapy, and laparoscopic surgery. Their neonatal care products include infant warmers to help maintain normal body temperature, infant resuscitators and CPAP systems designed to improve infant respiratory function. Obstructive sleep apnea Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy products which are used in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea to prevent temporary airway closure during sleep. Their products, including integrated flow generator-humidifiers, are designed to deliver humidified airflow to patients during CPAP therapy. Manufacturing They manufacture, assemble and test their complete range of products, including many components, at their facilities in New Zealand with a total area of approximately 560,000 ft2 (51,000 m2). An additional manufacturing facility was established in Tijuana, Mexico in 2010. The Tijuana facility is responsible for approximately 30% of the company's total production volume, and approximately 50% of all products sold in the US . A second Tijuana manufacturing facility is currently under construction and is expected to come on line in late 2019/2020.

Early years  Webb was born in 1839 in Calcutta, the son of Allan Webb M.D, surgeon in the Bengal Army, later Professor of Anatomy at the Calcutta Medical College, and was baptised on 17 November 1839 in India. He was educated at Rugby School and subsequently at Corpus Christi College, Oxford University, becoming a fellow and tutor at University College (1863-1868). From 1864 to 1867 he was vice principal at Cuddesdon Theological College. He married Elizabeth. the sister of George Hugh Bourne, the hymn-writer, who served as his chaplain (1879 ‚Äì 1898).They had three children: Cyprian, Charles (The Rev, Charles Johnstone Bourne Webb 1874-1963) and a daughter who died young who is commemorated in the window to Webb in the North choir transept of Salisbury Cathedral. Webb's first posting was as rector of Avon Dassett.  Bishop of Bloemfontein  On St. Andrew's Day (30 November) 1870 Webb responded to an appeal from Bishop Robert Gray of Cape Town to accept the Bishopric of Bloemfontein in the interior of South Africa. He was consecrated at Inverness Cathedral in Scotland and sailed for the Cape on 25 April 1871, arriving in Cape Town on 28 July. One of Webb's first tasks was to oversee the planting of the Anglican Church on the Diamond Fields in the west of the Diocese of Bloemfontein. From this foundation would eventually spring (in 1911) the Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman. Other major works included the establishment of the Community of St Michael and All Angels, a nursing order based in Bloemfontein and Kimberley, where Sister Henrietta Stockdale pioneered aspects of nursing and provided for the first state registration of nurses in the world. Under Webb the Brotherhood of St Augustine of Hippo grew in strength at Modderpoort in the eastern Free State.  Bishop of Grahamstown  In 1883, on the advice of the Archbishop of Canterbury (Edward Benson) and of the Metropolitan Archbishop of Cape Town (William West Jones), Webb accepted his unanimous election as the Bishop of Grahamstown. There the cathedral congregation had been split by controversy between St George's and a pro-cathedral of St Michael. Webb's arrival is referred to as the \\"era of pacification\\" and by the end of 1885 he had succeeded in reuniting the divided factions. The building of the St. Michael and St. George Cathedral commenced in the 1890s, the chancel being consecrated in 1893. Webb resigned from Grahamstown in 1898, going first as provost at Inverness Cathedral.  Dean of Salisbury  In June 1901, Webb became dean of Salisbury, where he died in 1907. A set of three stained glass windows in Salisbury Cathedral were dedicated to his memory.  Role in creation of sisterhoods  Webb was one of the first Anglican bishops to support and nurture corporate women's work in the church through the formation of sisterhoods: The Community of St Michael and All Angels in Bloemfontein and Kimberley (a foremost member being Sister Henrietta); and the Community of the Resurrection of our Lord and St Peter's Home in Grahamstown (under the leadership of Mother Cecile)  Styles and titles  *Mr Alan Webb ( - 1863) *The Revd Alan Webb (1863 - 1870) *The Rt Revd Alan Webb (1870 - 1871) *The Rt Revd Dr Alan Webb (1871 - )  Notes and references   *  External links  * Bibliographical directory from Project Canterbury * Category:1839 births Category:1907 deaths Category:Bishops of Bloemfontein Category:Bishops of Grahamstown Category:Deans of Salisbury Category:Alumni of Ripon College Cuddesdon Category:Staff of Ripon College Cuddesdon ","title":"Allan Webb"},{"id":"24062892","title":"Gymnastics at the 1992 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Men's artistic individual all-around"},{"id":"24062899","text":"John William Joyce (26 June 1877 ‚Äì June 1956) was an English footballer who played as a goalkeeper for various clubs between 1898 and 1920. Throughout his career, he was known to supporters as \\"Tiny\\" in allusion to his size, being tall and weighing over . Football career Joyce was born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire and started his football career with his home-town club, Burton Pioneers, before spells with two clubs in neighbouring Derbyshire, Woodville and Overseal Town. Whilst playing for Overseal Town, he was spotted by scouts from Southern League champions Southampton, for whom he was signed for a fee of ¬£80. Joyce, together with his Overseal teammate, Sid Cavendish, joined the \\"Saints\\" in May 1898 and made his debut against Warmley in December 1898, but Warmley shortly afterwards withdrew from the league and their record was expunged. As a result, Joyce's \\"official\\" debut was delayed until 21 October 1899, in a 5‚Äì1 victory over Queens Park Rangers. At Southampton, Joyce was an understudy to England international Jack Robinson and Robinson's form meant that Joyce's first-team opportunities were rare. Nonetheless, he was a useful goalkeeper to have in reserve and was able to use his bulk to punt the ball upfield further than any other contemporary goalkeeper. After seven Southern League appearances, in May 1900 Joyce moved to fellow Southern League club Millwall Athletic in search of regular first team football. After a season with Millwall, Joyce returned to his home-town to join the newly formed Burton United in the Football League Second Division in August 1901. After failing to break into the first-team at Burton, Joyce was transferred to Blackburn Rovers of the Football League First Division in May 1902. At Blackburn, he vied for the No.1 shirt with Willie McIver but after making 14 appearances he returned to London in the spring of 1903. After a brief spell with Tottenham Hotspur, he returned to Millwall in the summer where he was to remain for the next six years, before re-joining Spurs in 1909. In December 1905, he was briefly displaced as first-choice 'keeper by Jack Robinson, under whom he had played at Southampton. At White Hart Lane, Joyce was initially first-choice 'keeper, before losing his place to Tommy Lunn but by 1912, he had ousted Lunn and taken over as the regular \\"custodian\\". On 10 April 1914, Joyce scored from a penalty against Bolton Wanderers and followed this with another against Bayern Munich in a friendly a month later. Joyce played a total of 113 first-team matches for the Spurs, with his career ending following the outbreak of World War I. During the war, Joyce returned to Millwall and after the war, following a brief spell with Gillingham, became assistant trainer and was briefly caretaker manager when Bob Hunter became ill in the 1930s.

Middle East Command was a command of the Royal Air Force (RAF) that was active during the Second World War. It had been preceded by RAF Middle East, which was established in 1918 by the redesignation of HQ Royal Flying Corps Middle East that had been activated in 1917Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation - Overseas Commands - Middle East & Mediterranean although a small Royal Flying Corps presence had been operational in the region since 1914. RAF Middle East Command was formed on 29 December 1941 following the redesignation of RAF Middle East. During the early part of the Second World War, the Command was one of the three British commands in the Middle East, the others being the British Army's Middle East Command and the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet. On 15 February 1943, RAF Middle East Command became a major sub-command of the Mediterranean Air Command (MAC), the Allied formation that also included non-RAF units.  RAF History in the Middle East  The RAF presence in the Middle East from the time of the First World War was similar to that of the Middle East Command of the British Army, with operational responsibility for Egypt, the Sudan and Kenya, and administrative responsibility for Palestine and Transjordan. Separate RAF Commands held operational responsibility for Iraq and Aden while RAF Mediterranean held responsibility for Malta. However, interwar planning held that in times of war, Middle East Command would assume control over all of these commands. A small Royal Flying Corps presence was deployed to the Middle East in late 1914. By 1 July 1916 this force had grown sufficiently to be raised to a brigade as Middle East Brigade.http://www.rafweb.org/GrpO3.htm#MEB By December 1917 Middle East Brigade had grown to become HQ RFC Middle East which was renamed to RAF Middle East in April 1918. It renamed again to RAF Middle East Area in March 1920, then back to RAF Middle East in April 1922, and finally became RAF Middle East Command on 29 December 1941. From mid-February until MAC was disbanded on 10 December 1943, the Command consisted of the following sub-commandsRichards, D. and H. Saunders, The Royal Air Force 1939-1945 (Volume 2, HMSO, 1953). with their initial commanders indicated: * No. 201 (Naval Co-Operation) Group under Air Vice Marshal Thomas Langford- Sainsbury; * Air Headquarters (AHQ) Air Defences Eastern Mediterranean under Air Vice Marshal Richard Saul; * 9th Air Force under Major General Lewis H. Brereton; * Headquarters (HQ) British Forces Aden under Air Vice Marshal Frank MacNamara VC (RAAF); * Air Headquarters (AHQ) East Africa under Air Vice Marshal Harold Kerby; * Air Headquarters (AHQ) Levant under Air Commodore Bernard McEntegart; and * Air Headquarters (AHQ) Iraq and Persia under Air Vice Marshal Hugh Champion de Crespigny However, during this period of the Second World War, Middle East Command was distinct from the other major sub- commands of MAC: * Northwest African Air Forces under Lieutenant General Carl Spaatz; * AHQ Malta under Air Vice Marshal Sir Keith Park; and * RAF Gibraltar under Air Vice Marshal Sturley Simpson. Accordingly, Middle East Command was primarily responsible for operations in the Eastern part of the Middle East during the war. It was during the critical campaigns in Egypt and Libya during 1942 that Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, as Air Commander-in-Chief of RAF Middle East, successfully coordinated his strategic, coastal, and tactical air forces consisting primarily of No. 205 (Heavy Bomber) Group, No. 201 (Naval Co-operation) Group, and especially Air Vice Marshal Arthur Coningham's Air Headquarters (AHQ) Western Desert, respectively. The success of the Tedder-Coningham air interdiction during the desert war was the model upon which the Northwest African Air Forces were created at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943. Earlier, Tedder had been Churchill's default choice as Air Officer Commanding in Chief of RAF Middle East when his first choice, Air Vice-Marshal Owen Boyd was captured. But soon after Tedder assumed command in June 1941, he made the following statement that not only characterized his mission in the Middle East, but the organization of the Mediterranean Air Command in early 1943 and nearly all future air forces: > \\"In my opinion, sea, land and air operations in the Middle East Theatre are > now so closely inter-related that effective coordination will only be > possible if the campaign is considered and controlled as a combined > operation in the full sense of that term.\\"Dick, Ron and Dan Patterson, > Aviation Century, World War II, Boston Mills Press, 2004, p. 71. The concept itself was certainly not a new one, but putting it into practice under the military dogma and commander egos of the day was easier said than done.

The film was released in the United States as The Czar Wants to Sleep. Sergei Prokofiev composed the score; a five-movement suite based on the score quickly became part of the international concert repertoire. Plot Set in Saint Petersburg in 1800, the film satirizes the pedantic absurdities of the rule of Emperor Paul I. His obsession with rigid drill, instant obedience and martinet discipline extends not only to his soldiers but also to his courtiers and even the servants who scrub the palace corridors. A slip of the pen by an army clerk when drawing up a list of officers for promotion, leads to the creation of a Lieutenant Kij√©. Once the document is signed by the Emperor, Kij√© takes on an existence of his own. The Emperor's aide cries out when engaged in amorous play with Princess Gagarina's companion, awakening the sleeping Paul. The non-existent Lieutenant Kij√© is blamed, flogged in front of the assembled Imperial Guard and sent under escort to a fortress in Siberia. His lack of substantive form is explained by his being \\"a confidential prisoner with no shape\\". Reprieved by the Emperor at the request of Princess Gagarina, Kij√© returns to Saint Petersburg and is rapidly promoted to colonel and then general. In absentia, he marries the lady in waiting. At last, when the Emperor insists on a meeting with his \\"most faithful servant\\", General Kij√© is reported as having died. The Czar orders a state funeral, not knowing the coffin is empty. In an ironic twist ending, the Emperor is made to believe that his favorite officer was an embezzler after a note reading \\"General Kij√© spent the money on meals\\" (deliberately left by the Emperor's aide) is found in the empty state treasury chest. The furious Paul then remembers that it was Kij√© who originally disturbed his sleep. The \\"deceased\\" is demoted to the rank of private and the Emperor's aide is promoted to the rank of general, embracing Princess Gagarina's companion after the funeral for her disgraced husband is canceled.

She was a White House correspondent for 15 years, for the Gannett Company, USA Today (1979‚Äì1985), and The Washington Post (1989‚Äì1997). She covered four presidents including Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and 10 White House chiefs of staff. Life and career Ann Mary Devroy was born October 9, 1948, in Green Bay, Wisconsin. While she was a journalism student at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìEau Claire, she interned at the Milwaukee Journal and worked as a reporter for the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram. After she received her bachelor's degree in 1970 Devroy began working for the Courier News, a New Jersey newspaper owned by the Gannett Company. In 1977 she moved to Gannett's Washington bureau. She covered Congress for two years before becoming White House correspondent for Gannett and its new national newspaper, USA Today. In 1985 Devroy joined The Washington Post as political editor on the national news desk‚Äîa job that would allow her to spend more time with her young daughter. As deputy national editor, Devroy directed coverage of the 1988 Presidential campaign.McCaslin, John, The Washington Times, October 24, 1997 In 1989 she returned to the White House beat. Andrew Rosenthal of The New York Times, who was Devroy's main competition, described her as \\"the scariest and most generous reporter I've ever known. She would kick your butt 24 hours a day.\\" She was also a prolific reporter. Over 2,300 stories carrying Ann Devroy's byline appeared in The Post from 1989 through 1995.Kaiser, Robert G., remarks at Ann Devroy's memorial service November 1, 1997; reprinted in the pamphlet Ann Devroy of The Washington Post: Colleagues Remember a Woman and Her Work, page 41 Devroy was not part of the Washington TV punditocracy.

Devroy made a rare television appearance as Tim Russert's guest on his CNBC show March 28, 1994.March 28, 1994, episode information, Tim Russert, CNBC As a cost-saving measure, The Post once floated the idea of ending expensive press charter flights to out-of-town presidential events, proposing instead that its reporters fly commercial. Devroy fired off a response concluding that the short-sighted move to economize \\"diminishes our commitment to White House coverage ... and erodes a lesson I have spent a career beating into every White House I cover: Don't screw with The Post. When no one else pays attention, we do.\\" \\"Ann Devroy was the toughest and fairest White House reporter I knew,\\" said George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to President Clinton in his first term. \\"She knew when she had a story, and she knew when to kill one. She revered the office of the presidency and the role that reporters play in keeping it honest.\\" In May 1994 Devroy received a journalism award from the Gerald R. Ford Foundation, for distinguished reporting on the presidency. She received the foundation's seventh annual prize for her articles on President Clinton's foreign policy and his effort to sell his domestic program, Vice President Al Gore's record and an evaluation of former president George H. W. Bush. Devroy died at her home in Washington October 23, 1997, age 49, of uterine cancer.

Discovery Astronomer R. Brent Tully of the University of Hawaii‚Äôs Institute of Astronomy identified the Complex in 1987. Extent The Pisces‚ÄìCetus Supercluster Complex is estimated to be about 1.0 billion light-years (Gly) long and 150 million light years (Mly) wide. It is one of the largest structures known in the observable universe, but is exceeded by the Sloan Great Wall (1.3 Gly), Clowes‚ÄìCampusano LQG (2.0 Gly), U1.11 LQG (2.5 Gly), Huge-LQG (4.0 Gly), and Hercules‚ÄìCorona Borealis Great Wall (10 Gly), respectively. The complex comprises about 60 clusters and is estimated to have a total mass of 10 . According to the discoverer, the complex is composed of 5 parts: # The Pisces-Cetus Supercluster # The Perseus-Pegasus chain, including the Perseus-Pisces Supercluster # The Pegasus-Pisces chain # The Sculptor region, including the Sculptor Supercluster and Hercules Supercluster # The Laniakea Supercluster, which contains our Virgo Supercluster (Local Supercluster) as well as the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster. With its mass of 10 , our Virgo Supercluster accounts only for 0.1 percent of the total mass of the complex. The complex was named after the Pisces-Cetus Superclusters, which are its richest superclusters.

Location and extent The Arthashastra of Chanakya (around 350‚Äì283 BC) refers to it along with Vanga, Pundra and Kamarupa. This geographical idea continues with some of the ancient texts. Gauda and Vanga are sometimes used side by side. Shashanka, the first important king of ancient Bengal who is believed to have ruled between 590 AD to 625 AD, had his capital at Karnasubarna, south-west of Baharampur, headquarters of Murshidabad district. The Chinese monk, Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) travelled from the country of Karnasubarna to a region in Orissa ruled by Shashanka. There is mention of Pundravardhana being part of Gauda in certain ancient records.Bandopadhyay, Rakhaldas, Bangalar Itihas, , first published 1928, revised edition 1971, vol I, p 101, Nababharat Publishers, 72 Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata. Early 19th century lithograph of the Muslim ruins of Dakhil Darwaza at Gaur, West Bengal. Evidence seems to be discrepant regarding links of Gauda with the Rarh region. While Krishna Mishra (eleventh or twelfth century AD), in his Prabodha- chandrodaya, mentions that Gauda rashtra includes Rarh (or Rarhpuri) and Bhurishreshthika, identified with Bhurshut, in Hooghly and Howrah districts, but the Managoli inscription of the Yadava king Jaitugi I distinguishes Lala (Rarh) from Gaula (Gauda). According to Jain writers of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Gauda included Lakshmanavati in present-day Malda district. The Pala emperors were referred to as Vangapati (Lord of Vanga) and Gaudesvara (Lord of Gauda). Sena kings also called themselves Gaudesvara. From then Gauda and Vanga seem to be interchangeable names for the whole of Bengal. In the early Muslim period the name Gauda came to be applied to Lakhanavati in Malda district. In the narrower sense Gauda is the territory between the river Padma and Bardhamana region. But in course of time it embraced much wider area. In the Satpanchasaddeshavibhaga, the seventh patala of Book III, Shaktisangama Tantra Gauda is said to have extended from the vanga country up to Bhuvanesha (ie Bhubaneshwar in Orissa). Gour, ruined city Gaur/Gour (), as it is spelled mostly in modern times, refers to Lakhnauti the ruined city located on the India-Bangladesh border. Most of the former citadel is located in present-day the Malda district of West Bengal, India, while a smaller part is located in Nawabganj District of Bangladesh. This city was on the east bank of the Ganges river, 40 kilometers (25 mi) downstream from Rajmahal. Howeverver, the current course of the Ganges is far away from the ruins.

In Wolfsburg the old B 248, upgraded to four lanes in the 1960s, has been renamed today as the A 39 motorway (autobahn).  History   Origin  The southern section of the present-day Bundesstra√üe 248 between Northeim and Brunswick was referred to by the Duchy of Brunswick as Frankfurter Stra√üe and upgraded between 1786 and 1794 into a surfaced road (chaussee). In Northeim this road merged into the B 3, which was also upgraded to a chaussee at the same time. The centre section between Brunswick and Wolfsburg was upgraded into a chaussee between 1805 and 1816 and called the Berliner Stra√üe. The northern section between Wolfsburg and Salzwedel appeared between 1853 and 1855 as a district chaussee, which was built with funding from the participating districts.  Former route and description  The section between Brunswick and Seesen was elevated to the status of a Reichsstra√üe in 1932 and designated as Reichsstra√üe 64. Reichsstra√üe 248 between Northeim and Salzwedel was established in 1937. This federal highway was cut in two places by the division of Germany and could not be driven from end to end again until 1989, when the border crossings between Brome and Mellin (on 18 November) and between Salzwedel and L√ºbbow were re-established.  Importance for long-distance traffic  The B 248 is very important for long-distance traffic between Northeim and Seesen. When there is a traffic jam on the A 7 motorway which runs alongside it, traffic is diverted onto Bundesstra√üe 248. This causes an increase in traffic through the neighbouring villages and towns.

It can be found in Scutellaria barbata and S. lateriflora. The determination of the structure of scutellarin took Guido Goldschmiedt many years: after the first publication on that topic in 1901, only in 1910 he managed to obtain enough starting material for more detailed studies. Scutellarin is the focus of some very promising research and development for experimental medical therapies. This research will hopefully contribute to the development of new treatments for disease. Scutellarin has been shown to induce apoptosis of ovarian and breast tumor cells in vitro. Scutellarin also shows protective effects for nerve cells that are affected by estrogen. Scutellarin has been shown as a potential treatment for diabetic retinopathy, which could prevent diabetic blindness. In laboratory studies, scutellarin inhibits hypoxia-induced and moderately high glucose-induced proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs); thus, it could be a potential therapy for diabetic retinopathy. However, how scutellarin inhibits VEGF is unknown. Scutellarin has anti-HIV-1 effects as well. In laboratory studies, a drug-resistant type HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection was inhibited with significant potency. The scutellarin compound was found to inhibit several strains of HIV-1 replication with different potencies, by preventing HIV-1 particle attachment and cell fusion, as well as inhibiting HIV-1 retransmission.

The formation of the Production Code Administration (PCA) hastened the production of sentimental comedies; others include Maybe It's Love (1935), Three Married Men (1936), and Wife, Doctor, and Nurse (1937).Kylo-Patrick R.

When Eric finally shows up after sleeping off the bachelor party, Shelia intends to get a quick divorce and marry him after the media attention dies down. Although Henry has been in love with her for years, he gets fed up and spends his time on their honeymoon with his old girlfriend, wealthy Helen Van Orden (Claudia Dell), and a bevy of beauties.
