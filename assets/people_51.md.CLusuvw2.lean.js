He is notable as being credited as the first man to develop 21\\" circumference arms. He was a traditionalist using full body workouts with a mini push/pull, where you a pushing exercises following by a pulling exercise. This also applied to legs don't do a quadricep exercise followed by another quadricep exercise. Leroy said you are not giving the muscle rest when you train it back to back. He and along with his friends such as Marvin Eder in their youth pioneered many of the principles bodybuilders today use. An example of these principles were the 21 curls where you do 7 curls to perpendicular, 7 curls perpidicular to chest and 7 full curls. Another example of Leroy's principle was the priority principle, where the muscle you train first will grow biggest because you put the most energy in the beginning of the workout. It was also to be paired with the saturation principle where the first exercise you do the most amount of sets to saturate it with blood. Lastly, Leroy and his friends also pioneered the tri and quadra sets in a Bicep,Tricep,Bicep....etc. style. His other training principles can be found on his channel. Colbert famously was wary of the worth of using steroids and never used the substance in an era where steroids had just started coming into bodybuilding. His views on steroids were formed in his later years as he was unaware of their effects in his youth and admits he would have used them had he not had his accident, stopping his competitive career. He started training age 10. In 2003 he was inducted into The IFBB Hall of Fame. He was the first black man on the cover of Muscle Power magazine. Colbert won only a few titles (Mr. New York City and Mr America East) but was famous for being on many covers of Weider magazines with his huge upper body development. His competitive career ended after a horrific motorbike accident nearly severing his foot. Motorbikes were his long life passion and this didn't stop him riding. After the accident he used his experience working in Weider's shipping warehouse to open a supplement store where he made a wealthy amount for himself. He was married three times. Colbert used a website and YouTube videos on Yorkieloverfitness in later life to export his extensive knowledge and over 60 years of experience to others and to protect people from the lies of the fitness and supplement industry.

Biography =Origins and early career= FƒÉlcoianu family coat of arms Born in Bucharest, he belonged to a boyar family originating in Romana»õi County. His father Ioni»õƒÉ was a serdar, while his mother was Rali»õa Lipoveanu. He had a twin brother, Ioan, who became a mathematician.Repez, pp. 421-22 »òtefan was born second, making him the last of eight children. After completing secondary school in his native city, he entered its military officers' school in 1854 and graduated two years later.Repez, p. 422 His abilities during four years of training attracted notice, and, with the backing of domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, he was sent to the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. An assistant to Achille Baraguey d'Hilliers, he remained with the French General Staff until 1864, when he returned home with the rank of captain. Meanwhile, from 1862 to 1864, he attended the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris.Repez, pp. 422-23 In 1865, he married the 16-year-old Alexandrina B√¢scoveanu. Two of their four children died young; a daughter became lady-in-waiting to Queen Elisabeth, while a son was killed in action during World War I. Alexandrina died in 1870, aged 28; her widower hired Antoine-Augustin Pr√©ault to carve the gravestone at Bellu Cemetery. Within the Romanian Land Forces, FƒÉlcoianu attained the following ranks: second lieutenant (1856), lieutenant (1860), captain (1862), major (1865), lieutenant-colonel (1868), colonel (1877), brigadier general (1883) and divisional general (1892). His first commanding role came from 1856 to 1859, when he led a platoon within a line infantry regiment.Repez, p. 423 After returning from France in 1864, he was named cabinet chief to War Minister Savel Manu. He taught at the military officers' school from 1864 to 1868. From 1866 to 1868, he was assistant to the chief of artillery emplacements and general staff chief of an infantry division. Sent to the reserves in early 1869, he was called back to active duty in a line regiment later that year. In 1872, he was again placed in reserve. =Civil servant and military leader= From 1870 to 1877, he was secretary general in the Ministry of Public Works, and headed the telegraph and post service from 1876 to 1877. In April 1877, during the preparations for the Romanian War of Independence, FƒÉlcoianu was recalled to active duty, serving as director of the central war administration until October. From that point until the following July, he was Chief of the Romanian General Staff. He held this position twice more: from 1883 to 1884, and from 1886 to 1894, when he resigned from the army. He served as War Minister under Ion C. BrƒÉtianu from June 1884 to January 1886.Repez, p. 424 In October 1878, he was named Romania's representative to the commission charged by the Treaty of Berlin with dividing Dobruja between Romania and the Principality of Bulgaria. In 1880, he became the first director of CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne state railway carrier. He was involved in the company leadership until 1883, and again headed its administration from 1895 to 1899. During his time at the helm, FƒÉlcoianu helped draft legislation on a unified structure for the rails and supervised the 1881 opening of the BuzƒÉu-MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti line. This was the first in the country built by domestic engineers, technicians and workers.Repez, p. 428 In 1883, he was Senator for Tecuci.Repez, pp. 424-25 As such, he repeatedly spoke of the need to increase the country‚Äôs defense capabilities, refuting the idea that the fortifications then under construction were useless. While FƒÉlcoianu was in the army leadership, numerous reforms took place: four army corps were established at Bucharest, Craiova, Gala»õi, and Ia»ôi between 1882 and 1884; work began on the fortifications of Bucharest and along the fortified Foc»ôani-NƒÉmoloasa-Gala»õi line; and several high-level administrative posts were created, as well as the inspectors-general. The general staff was reorganized along the modern, Prussian model, also taking into account lessons learned in the independence war. In 1894, it became a special division within the War Ministry, directly subordinate to the minister.Repez, p. 426 The Higher War School opened in 1889, and FƒÉlcoianu was its first commander.Repez, pp. 426-27 Under his orders, every summer between 1891 and 1894, officers from the school traveled to different sections of the border with Austria-Hungary in order to study their military potential.Repez, p. 427 =Publications and recognition= He authored several books on military theory and history: ExplicƒÉri generale (1880), RƒÉspuns (1889), Conferin»õƒÉ asupra disciplinei, subordina»õiunii »ôi √Ændatoririlor ierarhice (1890), Despre scrisori »ôi raporturi (1892) and Istoria RƒÉzboiului din 1877‚Äì1878 ruso-rom√¢no-turc (1895). In 1891, he was among those who relaunched Rom√¢nia MilitarƒÉ magazine, and in subsequent years helped ensure its continued printing. He was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1876, the first military figure so honored. Over the years, he led various of its working committees, served as its vice president from 1886 to 1888 and from 1898 to 1899, and was several times vice president of the scientific section between 1882 and 1905.Repez, pp. 428-29 FƒÉlcoianu was awarded a number of orders and medals, including the Order of Osmanieh, third class (1878); the Benemerenti medal, first class; officer, Order of the Star of Romania (1878); grand officer, Order of the Crown; the gold Military Virtue Medal (1888); commander, Order of the Star of Romania (1888); grand cross, Order of the Crown (1891).Repez, p. 429 He died in Bucharest and was buried at Bellu Cemetery.Repez, p. 430 Notes References * Filofteia Repez, \\"»òtefan FƒÉlcoianu ‚Äì militar de seamƒÉ al Armatei Rom√¢ne »ôi membru activ al Academiei Rom√¢ne\\", in Studii »ôi comunicƒÉri, vol, VI/2013, pp. 421‚Äì30 1835 births 1905 deaths Military personnel from Bucharest Nobility from Bucharest √âcole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr alumni √âcole Polytechnique alumni Romanian Land Forces generals Romanian Ministers of Defence Romanian military personnel of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) Chiefs of the General Staff of Romania Romanian civil servants CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne people Members of the Senate of Romania Titular members of the Romanian Academy Commanders of the Order of the Star of Romania Grand Crosses of the Order of the Crown (Romania) Recipients of the Benemerenti medal Burials at Bellu Recipients of the Military Virtue Medal ","title":"»òtefan FƒÉlcoianu"},{"id":"51321199","text":"The consists of historical and existing pottery kilns in Japan and the Japanese pottery and porcelain ware they primarily produced.

It was part of a long route established in 1859 that ran from St. Cloud, Minnesota, to the Red River Valley on the border of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Manitoba. The road fragment was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 for having state-level significance in the theme of transportation. It was nominated for being a remnant of one of Minnesota's most important stagecoach roads, and a reminder of the stagecoach companies' founding role in establishing the state's overland travel routes. Description The Kandota Section begins at a westward bend of Todd County Highway 92 and runs northwest for , where all traces of it are lost in an agricultural field. The first descend a slight incline through a wooded area and have small ditches on either side of the track. The rest of the distance is level and shows no evidence of ditches. History The Saint Cloud and Red River Valley Stage Road was prompted by an 1857 international agreement that the Hudson's Bay Company of Canada could supply its Red River outposts from Saint Paul, Minnesota. The Northwestern Express and Transportation Company acquired the contract to carry the supplies and‚Äîfollowing a merger and name change to the Minnesota Stage Company‚Äîmail between St. Cloud and Fort Abercrombie. One of the stagecoach company's partners, Russell Blakely, led the road-blazing crew. They began in June 1859, felling trees and building bridges, and the first stagecoach was able to traverse the route on July 4. The road was the first to carry regular stagecoach traffic from the settlements of Central Minnesota to the Red River Valley, and functioned in concert with the establishment of steamboat service on the Red River of the North. The road also spurred the development of west-central Minnesota, as towns were founded along its route. The Saint Cloud and Red River Valley Stage Road did so well that in 1863 the stage company had to advertise for more drivers and teams. By 1871, though, the first rail line was completed to the Red River Valley and road traffic diminished. Portions of the stage route were incorporated into the road network and modernized, but the Kandota fragment was abandoned in 1939.

Article 1 paragraph 1 of the ordonnance no 45-174 du 2 f√©vrier 1945, modifi√©e, relative √† l'enfance d√©linquante In 2013, French correctional tribunals rendered 576,859 judgments on 'action publique, pronounced 501,171 verdicts and homologu√© 67,983 compositions p√©nales. Les chiffres-cl√©s de la Justice 2014 Lesser offenses called contraventions are judged by the tribunal de police Article L121-10 of the Code de l'organisation judiciaire or the juridiction de proximit√©.Article 521 of the Code de proc√©dure p√©nale Article L231-6 of the Code de l'organisation judiciaire More serious wrongdoing such as felonies (crimes) are judged by the cour d'assises.Article 181 paragraph 1 Article 231 of the Code de proc√©dure p√©nale In terms of judicial organisation, the correctional tribunal is one of the chamberschambre, an administrative division of the magistrates at that site, or seat of a tribunal or cour of the tribunal de grande instance. At the largest of these tribunals, several chambers may hear penal matters. Such tribunals number the chambers to distinguish them, and they are referred to as the nth correctional chamber or the nth chamber of the correctional tribunal.  Jurisdiction of the correctional tribunal  The jurisdiction of a court such as the correctional tribunal is determined either by: * the matters it judges (ratione materi√¶), * the persons it may judge (ratione personn√¶) * the territorial scope of its purview (ratione loci). Jurisdiction is the first question to be determined by the tribunal correctionnel when a matter commes before it, so that it knows whether to proceed. If it cannot, it must relever son incomp√©tence file a finding of nul jurisdiction (exception d'incomp√©tence). = Criteria of jurisdiction =  Ratione materi√¶  In France, the correctional tribunal is the penal jurisdiction of first instance, competent to judge misdemeanors (delits).Article L211-1 of the Code de l'organisation judiciaire In premier ressort,In criminal matters, a double degree of jurisdiction is the rule. In other words one may have a matter re-tried on appeal, after a first trial un premier proc√®s. it judges matters that concern the commission of a criminal offence (infraction p√©nale) considered a d√©lit, similar in severity to a misdemeanor.article L221-9 of the Code de l'organisation judiciaire In French law a misdemeanor is an offense punished by a prison sentence (peine d'emprisonnement) or by a fine of at least 3750 euros. The law sets ten years as the maximum length of a prison sentence for a correctional infraction.The penalty provided by law is tha set for the offense in question, independently of all other rules that may result in harsher sentences for persons found guilty, such as the laws on recidivism. article 131-4 of the Code p√©nal  Ratione personn√¶  The correctional tribunal is not competent to judge: * offenses committed by minors (depending on their age and situation one of the juvenile courts would be competent or the correctional tribunals for juveniles); * a misdemeanor committed by the president of the Republic or a member of the government in the exercise of their functions (which would, respectivement, by tried by either the Haute Cour or the Cour de justice de la R√©publique, competent in such a case). Beyond these, the correctional tribunal is competent to judge any other person who has reached the age of majority and has committed an offense. Its competence extends to co-authors and accomplices, assuming they too have also reached the age of majority.1045C49AB1D6B84673470A811909.tpdila11v_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006576389&cidTexte;=LEGITEXT000006071154&dateTexte;=20150226 article 383] of the Code de proc√©dure p√©nale So for example two thieves who acted in concert,article 311-4 1¬∞ of the Code p√©nal are co-authors of the theft, and any sponsor or silent partner is an accomplice by instigation.article 121-7 of the Code p√©nal The three would judged together by the same correctional tribunal assuming they were all adults. If one were a minor, his situation can only be determined by a juvenile court. Any proceedings that concern him will be severed from the correctional tribunal case and take place only within the framework of the juvenile courts. So in some cases a matter might be examined by two different tribunals.  Ratione loci  Territorial comp√©tence is defined with respect to: * the location of the offense; * the location of the defendant's residence; * the place of arrest; * the place of detention (even if detained for some other reason); * the domicile or residence of the victim in cases of family abandonment. At least one of these five locations must be located within the territorial limits of the tribunal de grande instance for the correctional tribunal to be competent to judge the relevant infraction. Since its latest reform, (r√©forme), the French judicial map includes 177 correctional tribunals whose assigned territory is that of the tribunal de grande instance of premi√®re instance. = Exception of incompetence = If the correctional tribunal finds that at least one of the competence criteria is absent, it must declare its incompetence: this means that it must refuse to judge the matter. The exception of incompetence is an absolute of the public order, which means that even if all parties had agreed to \\"chose\\" the tribunal correctional despite the rules of competence the tribual has an obligation to declare itself incompetent. If during a trial the correctional tribunal finds that the facts it is judging as a misdemeanor (d√©lit) in fact amount to a crime, it must d√©clare itself incomp√©tentarticle 469 du code de proc√©dure p√©nale and the matter referred to a juge d'instruction, whose referral is mandatory in matters of crime.article 79 du code de proc√©dure p√©nale Exceptions do exist to the exception of incompetence rule: a normally incompetent tribunal correctional can be brought to need to judge a matter that arise in another jurisdiction. When a matter is judged outside of the territorial jurisdiction it is called d√©paysement. Finally, law has come to recognize a practice of correctional tribunals, by fixing conditions where an act that can be characterized as a crime, rape for example can be judged by the correctional tribunal as a lesser offense, such as sexual aggression rather than rape: this is called correctionnalisation.  D√©paysement  In some cases, notably good administration of justice, the matter must be judged in another territorial jurisdiction than the one prescribed ratione loci rules. For reasons of public safety, where there is a risk of serious disturbance of the peace if the trial were held in the competent jurisdiction, the criminal chamber of the court of cassation can refer the matter to a different correctional tribunal. This request can only be made by the procureur g√©n√©ral of the Cour de cassation, after he is informed of the difficulty. In the interest of good administration of justice the criminal chamber of the court of cassation can also order the referral of a case to another tribunal than the one that is competent ratione loci, either at the request of the public prosecutor of the Cour de cassation, or of the prosector-general of the Court of Appeal in the jurisdiction where the jurisdiction in question has its seat, either on his own initiative or at the request of the parties. For example, if: * A magistrate, * a lawyer, * a public or ministerial official, * a member of the gendarmerie nationale, * an employee of the national police, customs or penal administration * or any other person who holds a position of public authority or who is charged with a mission of public service public, * a person who is habitually, by his functions or his mission, in relation with the magistrates or officials of the tribunal correctionnel which has jurisdiction the procureur of the Court of Appeal that has jurisdiction over the particular correctional tribunal may, d'office, at the request of the procureur of the tribunal correctionnel and at the application of interested parties, transfer the proceeding to the tribunal de grande instance closest to the jurisdiction of the court of appeal, which will then have jurisdiction in the case, par d√©rogation aux dispositions de comp√©tence territoriale. Cases exist of material impossibility to hold the trial before the competent correctional tribunal. A referral may be ordered by the criminal chamber if the court that would normally have jurisdiction cannot be legally assembled or if the course of justice finds itself otherwise interrupted. A request for referral may be presented, either by the procureur g√©n√©ral before the Court of cassation, or by the established minist√®re public before the jurisdiction in question. More often, especially in smaller jurisdictions, if the normally competent jurisdiction cannot be composed because the incompatibilities exist that the law has provided for, the first president of the cour d'appel can order the matter sent back to a neighboring jurisdiction situated in the scope of that court and designated by a special ordinance passed every year by the first president of the court of appeal indicating for each of its jurisdictions the jurisdiction to which procedures may be sent for this reason.  Correctionnalisation  A lack of means in the cours d'assises in France allows some defendants to be judged by the correctional tribunal after committing a crime. This is termed correctionnalisation. While illegal, the arrangement often suits both parties; the prosecutor or examining magistrate increases the likelihood of a shorter and simpler trial, while the defendant sees his crime downgraded to a simple misdemeanor-like d√©lit.  Composition of a tribunal correctionnel  A French correctional tribunal is composed of:article 398 du code de proc√©dure p√©nale * three professional judges: a president of the tribunal et deux assessors (Article 398 of the Code de proc√©dure p√©nale, (Code of Penal Procedure)). * The minist√®re public or parquet, represented by the procureur or his representative. Similar to a prosecutor in common law jurisdictions in that he speaks for the community, although the role differs in other ways from jurisdictions where the juge d'instruction does not exist * the clerk of the '''' For the tribunal to sit with one judge only, √† juge unique, the possible penalty must be less than five years imprisonment and the matter must concern d√©lits specified by the Code de proc√©dure p√©nale as traffic offenses (driving while intoxicated for example), or violence resulting in more than eight days of inability to work (incapacit√© Totale de travail (I.T.T.)) with only one aggravating circumstance. These cases are provided by Article 398-1 of the Code de proc√©dure p√©nale. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same article outline some exceptions having to do with provisional detention and procedure for immediate appearance. In cases of the wrong judge (? -t) article 398-2 provides for a return to the collegial formation because the jurisdictional rules are d'ordre public. Usually, it is the pr√©sident de la formation coll√©giale who rules √† juge unique. Sometimes there may be more than three judges if the arguments are expected to be lengthy. One or more additional judges may then attend, because the rule holds that one can only be judged by judges who have heard the arguments. This may pose a problem if one of the judges becomes ill, for example. Only three judges will deliberate the matter, however, regardless of the number who heard it.  Procedure before the correctional tribunal  The arguments are normally held in public, in open court. If publicity would endanger the order and serenity of the arguments, the dignity of the person or the interests of a third party, the plaintiff or the procureur may at their option request a closed session. This decision will be publicly rendered. (verify:decision to close? ) The president of the tribunal may prohibit the presence of minors, or of certain minors. He can expel any person who disturbs the arguments, including the defendant. The procedure before a correctional tribunal unfolds in the following order: * The president notes the identity of the defendant and outlines the action the tribunal will judge * If motions of nul jurisdiction have been filed , before the facts of the case are put in evidence, the tribunal theoretically should delve into the incident in depth and deliberate simultaneously on the procedural questions and on the acts with which the defendant is reproached, except if the points raised before a defense is made might play on the outcome of the proceedings. A judgement will be rendered. * Interrogation of the defendant * Argument of the plaintiff * The minist√®re public asks for a sentence * Argument of the defendant's lawyer (if the defendant has chosen to hire a lawyer) * The last word goes to the defendant. After the arguments the prosecutor presents the government's demand for a sentence (r√©quisitoire oral). He summarizes the elements of culpability and may advocate a penalty for the defendant. His proposal does not obligate the tribunal; it is an opinion in consultation, given the same weight as the argument of the defense attorney.  Miscellaneous  = Vocabulary = * Individual who appears before the tribunal correctionnel as a defendant is called un pr√©venu. * Victims of a crime are parties civiles when they seek indemnification. = See also = * ‚Äîappeal court jurisdiction for some French overseas territories * International Criminal Court * International Court of Justice * Judiciary of France * Law codes in civil law and common law jurisdictions * Civil law * Common law * in modern law Cour d'assises exists only in the French judiciary and other civil law jurisdictions, i.e. ** Corte d'Assise Italian Cour d'assises ** Belgian Cour d'assises * it may also refer to obsolete courts in a number of common law jurisdictions, for example: **Assizes **Assizes (Ireland) * or royal writs, for example: **Assize of Clarendon **Assize of Northampton * Court of Appeal (France)‚ÄîCourt of Appeal in France.

After his departure from Deliverance, Farkas joined the band Vengeance Rising, then known as Vengeance. In 1988, the band released their debut album titled Human Sacrifice. The band's name, Vengeance, got the band into legal trouble, so they changed it to Vengeance Rising. In 1990, Vengeance released Once Dead. After the release, Farkas, Guitarist Doug Theime, Bassist Roger Dale Martin and Drummer Glen Mancaruso left the band and formed the band Die Happy. Ever since departing from the band, Farkas, along with Thieme, Mancaruso, and Dale Martin, have all expressed interest in reuniting for a Vengeance concert. Retrieved on August 31, 2016. Which they tried to do in later years but would have been sued for continuing. Die Happy formed in 1990 with the former Vengeance members and Robyn Basauri (ex- Joshua). In 1993 Martin left and was replaced by Greg Chaisson. In 1994, the band disbanded. During the time Farkas was in Die Happy, he also performed in Sircle of Silence. In 2002, Farkas along with Mancaruso and Deliverance/Recon guitarist George Ochoa started a modern rock band called S.A.L.T. which was very short lived. In 2004, Farkas reunited with his former Vengeance members, minus Roger Martinez, along with Scott Waters of Ultimatum. The band was to play two shows, but Martinez threatened to sue over the concerts, as he owned the rights to the name. The band then continued the band under the moniker, Once Dead, named after the Vengeance album of the same name. In 2005, the band released a DVD of their live set, called Return With a Vengeance. Scott Waters (ex-Once Dead, Ultimatum) stated that on this first release, Farkas was not heard very well at all. After the release of Return With a Vengeance, Mancaruso left the band. Jim Chaffin of The Crucified fame took over drums as well as Glenn Rogers, Farkas' fellow Deliverance alumni, coming on as third guitarist. The next year, 2006, both Waters and Martin left the band and was replaced by Devin Schaefer (Fasedown) and Angelo Espino (Hirax). The band then started the recording of their full-length. During this process, the band signed to Open Grave Records. Farkas had issues with the label and refused to work with them and therefore quit. By the time Farkas quit, Thieme was the last remaining original member. In April 2008, the band announced that Farkas had rejoined the band. In 2010, Farkas was asked by Klank to be on his new album along with Jim Chaffin (The Crucified) and Mike Phillips (Deliverance). In 2015, Farkas recorded lead guitar on a track for the band Worldview. In 2016, Farkas performed as a special guest for the long-awaited return of Bloodgood. On August 6, 2017, it was announced that Vengeance Rising would reunite for SoCal Metal Fest with the original lineup, Farkas included, with Jim Settle of Hand of Fire on vocals. Later that week, it was announced that Farkas was a part of a new thrash metal supergroup known as Disciples of God, or D.O.G. alongside Holy Soldier and Neon Cross members.

Research Kposowa is known for his research on suicide. For example, his research has shown that divorced men are significantly more likely to commit suicide than their female counterparts, and that Wednesday is the most common day for people to commit suicide. Another study he published found that people who lived in conservative-leaning states and in states with higher gun ownership rates were more likely to commit suicide. The same study, published in 2013, found that people who lived in a state where a higher percent of the population attended church were less likely to commit suicide.

During the three-day turmoil, several people, including police officers, were injured and dozens of protesters arrested. A nightly curfew was set up for teenagers in the area. Smith was running on foot and armed with a stolen handgun when he was shot. Smith and the officer who fired the fatal shots, Dominique Heaggan-Brown, were both African-American. Video from the officer's bodycam showed that Smith had turned with the gun in his hand toward the officer just before the officer shot him. Heaggan-Brown was criminally charged with Smith's death and acquitted at trial. This was the first homicide charge against a Milwaukee police officer in over a decade. A civil lawsuit is currently pending. Background In 2014, community protests followed the fatal shooting of Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill black man, in Milwaukee. The officer who shot and killed Hamilton was fired from the police force for not following protocol, but he was not criminally charged. In December 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it would work with the Milwaukee Police Department on reforms. Milwaukee police previously attracted controversy for two incidents involving the deaths of black suspects while in police custody--one in 2010 and the other in 2011--as well as a scandal involving illegal strip searches and body cavity searches of 74 black people, for which a $5 million settlement was approved by the Milwaukee Common Council. Residents have criticized policing methods in predominantly black neighborhoods, which they say often involve a lack of respect towards suspects and use of force. On June 29, 2016, police in riot gear had to respond to unrest in Sherman Park, near 39th and Burleigh, a block away from the August incident. Rioters smashed windows and threw rocks at police. A BP gas station had been a frequent flash-point for unrest during June and July 2016, with several incidents taking place there, including a murder. Later, it would be looted and set on fire during the August 13 riot. The shooting of Sylville Smith occurred during a violent weekend in Milwaukee, with nine other shootings, five of them homicides, occurring within the preceding nine hours from August 12 to August 13. Two of the crime scenes were located a few blocks away from the police shooting. =Influence of inequality= Several reports and Milwaukee residents have connected the riots to a history of segregation and discrimination in Milwaukee. Black residents, who make up about 40 percent of the city's population, have higher rates of unemployment, violent crime, incarceration, lack of education, and lower incomes than white residents. The poverty difference between black and white citizens is about one-and-a-half times the national average, and according to the Economic Policy Institute, Milwaukee has the nation's highest black unemployment rate. One resident, Sharlen Moore, said: > It's a series of things that has happened over a period of time. And right > now you shake a soda bottle and you open the top and it explodes, and this > is what it is. Initial police shooting At about 3:30p.m. on August 13, 2016, two 23-year- old men were pulled over by two officers for suspicious activity while driving through the neighborhood. Both men fled on foot. One, who was armed with a semi-automatic handgun carrying 23 rounds, was later shot twice, in the right arm and chest, by one of the officers, and died at the scene. The man's handgun, along with 500 additional rounds of ammunition, had been reported stolen during a March burglary in nearby Waukesha. The second man was later apprehended and put into police custody. The deceased man, later identified as Sylville Smith, was shot about 20 seconds after the traffic stop was conducted. =People involved= Sylville Smith Sylville K. Smith (April 11, 1993 - August 13, 2016) had two sisters, and a two-year-old son. According to his grandfather, Smith had cognitive and mental health issues, needing to take special education classes in elementary and middle school. He also started carrying a gun on his person after being shot at or robbed several times in separate incidents. According to the police department, Smith had a \\"lengthy arrest record\\" dating back to at least 2011. He had been arrested or ticketed eight times for robbery, carrying a concealed weapon, theft, heroin possession, and other crimes. On February 3, 2015, he had been charged with felony first-degree \\"reckless endangering safety\\", in relation to a shooting at a party on August 24, 2014. This charge was followed by felony witness intimidation, when Smith attempted, through his girlfriend, to get the victim to sign a letter recanting his account. Both charges were dismissed after the victim willingly recanted his story. Smith's family said he had, at some point, filed a lawsuit against the Milwaukee Police Department, but no evidence of such a suit--settled or pending--was found in state or federal court. Dominique Heaggan-Brown Dominique Heaggan-Brown (born c. 1992) joined the police force in 2010 as an aide and then graduated from its academy three years later. He was wearing a body camera at the time of the shooting, as were two other officers at the scene. Heaggan-Brown is African American, and his name was initially withheld by police officials as \\"there are concerns for his safety\\". He was identified by the public on August 16 after at least 3,000 people shared a Facebook image of him, with some adding threatening comments; the post was deleted by Milwaukee police shortly after. On August 14, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward A. Flynn said Heaggan-Brown's \\"body camera showed Smith had turned toward the officer with a gun in his hand\\". Heaggan- Brown was placed on administrative duty following the shooting, as is standard protocol in the city police department. Heaggan-Brown was described by residents as an \\"aggressive\\" officer who was not well-liked in the community. According to one of Smith's sisters, Sherelle, Heaggan-Brown had known her brother in high school. An unnamed law enforcement source confirmed that both men had attended Casimir Pulaski High School together. Sherelle Smith also said that Heaggan-Brown was jealous of Smith's popularity and would often harass him because of it. On October 31, Heaggan-Brown was fired from the force for unrelated misconduct. Riots =August 13= According to Tom Barrett, the first riot was \\"driven\\" by the protesters' social media messages encouraging to congregate in the area. Between 8:00 and 9:00p.m., hours after the shooting, a group of around 100 black protesters gathered near the scene at North Sherman and Auer to hold a protest, and confronted a line of 20‚Äì30 officers. Some of the protesters used social media to encourage others to participate in the demonstration. At some point, the protest turned violent. The Revolutionary Communist Party confirmed that some of its members were among the protesters and that they traveled to Milwaukee to \\"support a revolution\\" but did not intend to incite violence. Several cars, including police squad cars, were set alight and a BP gas station was looted and set on fire as well. When additional officers dressed in riot gear arrived, gunshots were heard. Firefighters were initially unable to put out the gas station fire due to reports of shots being fired, but eventually extinguished the flames. The Milwaukee Fire Department reported that bricks were thrown at one of their trucks. One officer was treated at a hospital for injuries sustained after being hit by a brick. The protesters also attacked reporters and a photographer documenting the incident. One reporter was shoved to the ground and physically assaulted. This O'Reilly Auto Parts shop was one of the buildings set on fire. An O'Reilly Auto Parts shop, a beauty supply store, and the local branch of BMO Harris Bank were also set on fire in the area. A MetroPCS store was among the businesses that were looted. A supermarket and a liquor store were destroyed during the rioting, as well. In total, four police officers were treated for injuries during the riot and seventeen people were arrested. =August 14= In the early hours of August 14, Mayor Barrett and other local officials urged residents at a press conference to help restore order. Barrett also urged residents to bring home any of their children who may be among the protesters. During the day, volunteers assisted police in cleaning up debris left by the riot. In the afternoon, about 100 people, mostly black, held a peaceful demonstration in front of the O'Reilly Auto Parts shop that had been burned during the riot. The crowd moved to the local police station and held their arms up in the air as a form of protest. More unrest occurred on the night of August 14. About two dozen officers in riot gear responded to the scene. Protesters threw objects at officers and a person was shot in the neck near the site of the disturbance. Police had to use an armored vehicle to retrieve the victim from the crowd. The victim was then taken to the hospital for treatment. A police officer was also injured and treated when a rock smashed into a patrol car windshield. =August 15= Protests continued on the early hours of August 15. Demonstrators were reported to have thrown objects and fired shots shortly after midnight. Chief Edward Flynn said that the department's ShotSpotter system recorded a total of 30 instances of gunfire on the night of August 14. By the morning of August 15, fourteen more people were arrested and four police officers were wounded, including the one hit by the rock smashing a windshield. A 10:00p.m. curfew was announced for teenagers. Three police cars and a BearCat vehicle were damaged, another vehicle and a dumpster were set on fire, and a store had its windows broken. The night of August 15 was relatively peaceful, with no property damage being reported. A few heated confrontations did occur, but were calmed down after six people were arrested. Police shooting investigation An investigation into the police shooting was initiated by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. Smith's autopsy was released on August 15, confirming authorities' account of the shooting that he was shot twice: once in the right arm and once in the chest. City officials refused to release the police body camera video showing Smith's shooting pending the approval of the state Department of Justice. However, Barrett urged state officials to release the video as soon as possible, hoping it would placate protesters. On August 23, Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said that releasing the video soon \\"would compromise the integrity of the investigation\\" and that it will not be unless charges are filed. After the first shot was fired, the video reportedly shows Smith throwing his gun away and falling, in a half-backwards roll, to the ground on his back, unarmed, with his legs and arms moving towards his head. He was alive when the second shot fatally struck him in the chest rupturing his heart and a lung. 1.69 seconds elapsed between the shots. Heaggan-Brown testified that Smith was reaching for his waist when the second shot was fired. However, the video allegedly shows that Smith was never searched for a second firearm by the officers. Prosecution =Criminal prosecution of Heaggan-Brown= On December 15, 2016, ex-officer Dominique Heaggan-Brown was charged with first-degree reckless homicide stemming from Smith's death \\"under circumstances showing utter disregard for human life\\", as defined by Wisconsin state law. During his first court appearance, on December 16, Heaggan-Brown wore protective clothing to prevent self-harm. His bail was set at $100,000. On December 23, Heaggan-Brown pleaded not guilty to the charge. On April 10, 2017, the court ruled that the trial must be held in Milwaukee County, and that the jurors will be chosen from that county. The judge thereby denied the defense's motion for a venue change and refuted the argument that pre-trial publicity, alleged anti-police sentiment, and prior police-involved shootings might prevent the defendant from getting a fair trial. Jury selection started on June 12 and concluded the next day. As the selection began, the court mandated that the jury be sequestered and that the jurors, both potential and actual, remain anonymous except to the prosecutors and defense. According to the district attorney, jury sequestration had not taken place in Milwaukee County for at least 23 years. The jurors in Heaggan- Brown's case were asked to stay in a hotel for the duration of the trial. Opening statements took place on June 13. During the trial, prosecutors argued that the second shot fired by Heaggan-Brown was unjustifiable since Smith was already on the ground gun-free, wounded and therefore unable to escape or resist, so the officer's fear for his life was unfounded. The defense countered that, in firing the second shot, Heaggan-Brown followed a police protocol to assume that if a person has one weapon, he might have another. On June 20, closing arguments were delivered and jury deliberations began. On June 21, 2017, Heaggan-Brown was acquitted. =Civil litigation= The civil lawsuit filed on June 21, 2017, by Sylville Smith's family sought compensatory damages and attorney fees from Dominique Heaggan-Brown and the city of Milwaukee, as well as punitive damages from Heaggan-Brown. The 8-count federal lawsuit was brought in the United States Eastern District of Wisconsin. Estimated damage According to a Milwaukee Fire Department official, the riots caused around $5.8 million worth of damage to the neighborhood businesses. This \\"rough estimate\\" includes commercial real estate damage, as well as lost merchandise. At least seven businesses were affected. The ATF offered a $10,000 reward for information on the perpetrators of the arson fires set during the riots. Reactions =Political= Following the August 13 riot, Governor Scott Walker, under the threat of another riot in Milwaukee, declared a state of emergency in Milwaukee and put the National Guard on standby. President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation. =Police= Chief Edward Flynn praised faith and community leaders for their efforts in curbing the violence on August 14, and assigned blame of the riots to members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, saying they organized additional protesters, which turned the initial protests violent. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke wrote a controversial op-ed for The Hill, in which he blamed the riots on President Obama and liberals. =Smith's family= One of Smith's sisters, Kimberly Neal, urged protesters to stand down, saying violence was not the answer. Conversely, another sister, Sherelle Smith, encouraged protesters to focus the riots on suburban neighborhoods and burn them down. Sherelle Smith's encouragement of violence in the suburbs was controversially edited out of initial online and televised reports by CNN, which were later updated to include her full statement. Smith's father, Patrick Smith, acknowledged having been a \\"bad role model\\" to his son, and urged other parents to become better role models for their children.

The name was changed in 2016-2017 and is now correctly referred to as Harlows Creek. Jim Crow Creek took its name from a nearby point. The origin of the name is unclear, but most likely was a reference to Jim Saules, a free black man who worked and lived in the area in the 1800's. An early 20th century work suggested the point was named for crows that nested there. However, this reference also suggests a tree growing on the point could be seen far out at sea, an idea which should not be taken seriously due to distance as well as geographic features, so the reference itself might have little value.

The PHLASH route is particularly notable for connecting Philadelphia's main tourist attractions, from Penn's Landing on the Delaware River Waterfront, to National Park Service sites like Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell in Independence National Historical Park, to cultural institutions along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway like the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and attractions like the Philadelphia Zoo and Please Touch Museum in Fairmount Park.

Service history trolley replicas until 2014.|alt= The PHLASH was first introduced in 1994 by Ed Rendell, who was Mayor of Philadelphia at the time. The service was operated by the city's Center City District starting in the late 1990s. In order to keep fares at a price point attractive to visitors, the PHLASH service has always been subsidized. By 2011, the state grant that had been providing a subsidy for PHLASH operations was almost exhausted. With Gov. Rendell was leaving the governor's office, additional funding didn't appear to be forthcoming, and the service was in danger of shutting down. In 2012, the IVCC took over management of the PHLASH under CEO, James J. Cuorato, who believed the PHLASH provided an important service for Philadelphia tourism. Cuorato was able to successfully secure funding by convincing the state legislature to include an allotment for PHLASH in its Transportation Package bill, by partnering with Philadelphia's public transportation provider, SEPTA. In 2014, PHLASH upgraded its fleet from trolleys to its current modern buses, and contracted vehicle operations to Krapf Transit. The PHLASH fleet is composed of seven 30-foot and 35-foot MiDi buses, manufactured by New Flyer under licence from Alexander Dennis. In 2016, PHLASH had a record-breaking season, with 316,000 riders.

She first appeared in the series nineteen episode \\"Out With a Bang\\", broadcast on 18 September 2004. Bouzova was originally signed to appear in the show for four months. The character proved popular with viewers and her contract was renewed. Ellen is characterised as a charming and intelligent woman who has a manipulative side. She can be nasty and scheming, traits which initially worried Bouzova who presumed the public would dislike her. Ellen is originally from Ukraine and arrives in Holby City to work as a nurse. She was introduced as the step-sister of Nina Farr (Rebekah Gibbs). The character's most notable storyline is the portrayal of cancer resulting from a molar pregnancy. The story was based on a real-life case and Bouzova researched the condition thoroughly. She also cut her waist- length hair short to accommodate her character's chemotherapy treatment. Other stories include marrying Abs Denham (James Redmond) for a visa and believing she is pregnant by Harry Harper (Simon MacCorkindale). In 2006, Bouzova decided to leave the show to pursue other projects. The actress was not allowed to discuss her exit storyline until after Ellen's departure had aired. Casualty producer Jane Dauncey wanted to surprise viewers. In the episode titled \\"Silent Night\\", broadcast 24 December 2006, Ellen is hit by a motor bike and killed. The character was popular and liked by viewers but polarised television critics' opinions. A Western Mail reporter branded Ellen a \\"man- eating blonde nurse\\". Jim Shelley from the Daily Mirror viewed the character as \\"intensely irritating\\" and \\"slightly psychotic\\". Casting Actress Georgina Bouzova was looking for casual work when producers offered her the role of Ellen. She said that it was \\"amazing\\" and that she \\"jumped\\" at the chance to take on the role. The actress was contracted with the show for four months but this was later extended because the character became popular with viewers. Producers only ever envisioned Ellen as a \\"stand-in character\\" but she became a successful character on-screen. On her first day filming Bouzova thought a woman with a bloodied face had been injured on set. When she tried to help her, she discovered that the woman was actually playing an injured character on the show. Development =Characterisation and introduction= Ellen is characterised as \\"stubborn and selfish\\" but has natural charm which makes other characters like her. Bouzova told a BBC Online reporter that \\"she's a bit of a flirt and she likes to flirt with woman too and win everyone over.\\" Ellen is a charming individual, she makes people believe she is a friendly person and a \\"good laugh\\" to be around. Ellen trained as a nurse in Ukraine. Bouzova branded her character a \\"quite an intelligent woman\\" who grew up with aspirations of becoming a doctor. Her career goals changed when she realised that the training was too difficult and she could be a nurse instead. The actress added that Ellen thinks she can put her time to better use in finding a rich man to marry. Ellen's personality can be intimidating. Bouzova said that \\"If I ever met a real-life person like Ellen I'd be very scared!\\" The character was two-faced hiding a more manipulative side. The actress said that her initial reaction from fans was positive and she was worried how that response could change. Bouzova explained that \\"her true colours begin to emerge\\" the audience would dislike her. The actress has suggested the character is promiscuous because she had \\"flings with half the ward\\". Bouzova originally feared that viewers would spit at her in the street because Ellen is such a \\"scheming, nasty character\\". She added the nurse is \\"conniving\\" and she could never imagine trying to get away with the things Ellen does. Ellen is the sister of Nina Farr (Rebekah Gibbs) and arrives to work in the hospital as a nurse. Bouzova told a reporter from the Western Mail that Ellen arrives in the Holby City to stay with her sister after something happened in her home country the Ukraine. Ellen grew up in Ukraine with Nina's mother who married her father. She had travelled to the United Kingdom eleven months prior to arriving at Holby. Ellen and Nina have a poor relationship and on her first day Ellen behaves \\"outrageously flirtatious\\" and immediately comes between Nina's developing relationship with Abs Denham (James Redmond). The actress added \\"she's staying with Nina because she's family and when you're in trouble you go to family first - even though they're not the best of friends.\\" Bouzova added that Ellen sees Nina as an enemy. When she arrives on the wards she instantly charms Jim Brodie (Maxwell Caulfield) and becomes friends with Claire Guildford (Leanne Wilson). =Sham marriage= In one storyline Ellen asks Abs to marry her so she can stay in the UK after her visa runs out. Discussing the development, the actress told Lucy Lawrence from the Daily Mirror that \\"Ellen is such a bitch - actually I'm a bit scared of what the public reaction to me will be.\\" Ellen manages to convince Abs to marry her by falsely claiming that her father abusing her. Bouzova told a reporter from Inside Soap that her character thought Abs \\"was a bit of a hunk\\" when they first met. As Ellen gets to know Abs she realises how gullible he is and decides to scam him. Bouzova explained that \\"she realised he's a walkover, so she takes him for a ride. The fact that he's her stepsister, Nina Farr's boyfriend is even better.\\" She added that Ellen always wants what Nina has and decides to steal Abs. She later reveals that she has debts and loan sharks are after her. Abs is faced with the task of helping her gather the money together. Ellen's lies begin to unravel and Abs discovers that she has lied about her father's abuse. He realises that she only wanted a visa and has been scamming him. Ellen tries to convince Abs that she wants to make their marriage genuine because she loves him. Abs believes she is still lying and throws her out of their home. In episodes airing in February 2005, Abs decides he wants to divorce Ellen. He even threatens to report Ellen to immigration despite the fact it could see him handed a prison sentence. A reporter from Inside Soap revealed that Nina uses the opportunity to tell Abs she still loves him, but this does not change his mind. The looming threat of deportation makes Ellen stressed at work. When she treats a patient she makes an error which leads to her being disciplined. In another storyline Ellen causes trouble on the wards when she spreads rumours. She claims that Nathan Spencer (Ben Price) is going to be sacked. However it is soon revealed the information Ellen discovered was that the city administration have decided there is no need for two ED wards and Holby's risks closure. =Cancer= The show developed a cancer storyline for Ellen, a rare cancer form that develops after a molar pregnancy, which occurs after an egg is fertilised outside the uterus and the foetus grows into a tumour. The story was based on the real- life experiences of the Casualty producer Jane Hudson's friend Gena. Bouzova met with Gena to discuss her experiences and gain a better understanding of the condition. The actress took Gena's experiences in mind when filming her character's cancer scenes. In addition the actress visited the Bristol Cancer Help Centre for further research. She spoke with cancer counsellors and spiritual healers. Bouzova also wanted to empathise with Ellen and decided to read books about the condition and watch cancer related movies. The actress told Hoyle that the tears Ellen shed on-screen during the story were real. On- screen the storyline plays out when Ellen thinks she is pregnant with Harry Harper's (Simon MacCorkindale) baby. Harry had ended their relationship when scheming nurse Bruno Jenkins (Mark Bonnar) started a false rumour that he and Ellen were having an affair. Ellen tells Harry that she is pregnant but he refuses to believe her and she slaps him in the face. Ellen manages to convince Harry and he comes to terms with the idea of having a child with her. Ellen experiences bleeding and goes for a scan to check on her pregnancy. Bouzova told Claire Brand from Inside Soap that \\"the bleeding gives her a bit of a shock [...] Ellen is nervous about the scan but also excited to be seeing her baby.\\" The scan reveals the molar pregnancy. She added that \\"Ellen looks at the screen herself and notices straight away there is nothing there.\\" Harry arrives to support Ellen, who Bouzova said was \\"devastated\\" as they come to terms with it. Bouzova told Jon Wise of The People that she put her \\"heart and soul into filming these episodes.\\" Ellen was looking forward to motherhood and \\"felt complete after years of feeling vulnerable\\". She was ready and feeling optimistic about life as a single parent. Ellen later discovers that she may have cancer. Ellen visits the oncology ward alone, but her colleagues do not realise she is ill and dismiss her absence as skiving. Nina asks Ellen about her baby and she is forced to tell her step-sister the truth. Nina supports Ellen and accompanies her to collect her scan results. Ellen is then told she has cancer. Abs later discovers the truth. She asks him to keep her illness a secret and he agrees. Later in the story Ellen collapses while shopping and is taken to the ward she works on. Hoyle stated \\"her colleagues realise what's going on and see her bald head for the first time.\\" The actress believes the story actually had a positive effect on the character. She explained that \\"Ellen was so excited when she thought she was pregnant. But her cancer ordeal has changed her for the better.\\" She begins to undergo chemotherapy treatments and eventually begins to lose her hair. Bouzova knew that the storyline would require her to cut her hair short. When the time came the actress had her waist length hair cut in into a short bob. Producers did not require the actress to shave her head and had her wearing a wig for scenes that she was portrayed as going bald. Bouzova added that her father could not face watching the storyline. =Departure= In October 2006, Bouzova announced that she had decided to leave Casualty' to pursue other acting projects. The actress also wanted her character to leave the show \\"on a high\\" rather than let Ellen become a \\"stale\\" character and leave quietly. Bouzova had to remain secretive about her exit, but told Hendry that Ellen would go \\"out with a bang\\". She described it as \\"very exciting and very shocking\\" and that it would make an \\"impact\\" on the show itself. Hendry reported that it was unlikely the character would not be killed off, revealing a number of predicaments the character becomes involved with in her final episodes. Bouzova branded the experience playing Ellen \\"a really great journey\\" and said that her character had transformed dramatically over her tenure. She told Steve Hendry from the Sunday Mail that Ellen started out as a \\"baddie\\" but through her storylines with Harry and her subsequent cancer, the audience really cared about her and the character had gained a \\"big fan base\\". Casualty producer Jane Dauncey said that she wanted the exit to remain a secret to surprise viewers. She added that Ellen's final scenes \\"will take people's breath away\\". When the episode aired, Ellen was killed after she was hit by a motor bike. Reception A Western Mail reporter branded Ellen a \\"man-eating blonde nurse\\". They added \\"while Ellen initially turns the male doctors' heads, especially unlucky-in- love American medic Jim Brodie, her ruthless, manipulative side shines through all to soon.\\" Hoyle of the Daily Mirror branded the character a \\"scheming nurse\\" and \\"trouble-maker\\". They stated that Casualty viewers were \\"dabbing their eyes with sudden sympathy\\" over the cancer storyline. Their colleague Beth Neil also branded her a \\"scheming nurse\\". Lawrence from the publication described her as the \\"manipulative Ukrainian nurse Ellen\\". While Damien Fletcher said that the actress \\"injected an extra dose of glamour into Casualty.\\" The Sunday Mail's Hendry called her a \\"mercenary Ukrainian nurse\\". Jon Wise from The People said that Harry \\"rocked Casualty viewers by romping with stunning nurse Ellen Zitek and getting her pregnant.\\" The Daily Mirror, Birmingham Mail and Daily Record included Ellen's cancer storyline in their \\"pick of the day\\" features. Television critic Jim Shelley disliked the character. He called her the \\"intensely irritating, slightly psychotic Ukrainian stepsister Ellen.\\" He did not think that she was a well acted character. He scathed \\"with Ellen facing deportation (mostly for her [Bouzova's] appalling acting)\\". He later branded her \\"the most irritating person on television.\\" He also opined that she was a \\"strange\\" character with a \\"incomprehensible, irritating accent\\" much like the EastEnders character Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson). The following year Shelley said he was unsure how much more Ellen being on-screen viewers could cope up with. He also named her the \\"big wuss of the week\\" in his television column. The story involving Ellen and Abs was not well received by the Daily Mirror's Polly Hudson. She ranted \\"Casualty The Abs/Ellen/Nina triangle is ludicrous - and now dull, too.\\" Tom Adair of The Scotsman branded Ellen a \\"winsome\\" character and opined that Abs marrying her for a visa \\"limp\\" story telling. Adair thought the character was a liar. He stated \\"maybe the baby is a figment of Ellen's \\"rich fantasy life\\". A rich fantasy life is something boring, anaesthetised old Casualty could be doing with.\\" References External links *Character profile at BBC Online * Ellen Zitek on IMDb Casualty (TV series) characters Television characters introduced in 2004 Fictional nurses Female characters in television ","title":"Ellen Zitek"},{"id":"51321872","text":"Jos√© Enrique Manica Grajales (born March 27, 1993 in Veracruz City, Veracruz) is a Mexican professional footballer who plays as a defender for Ascenso MX club Potros UAEM.

The Capuchin order returned and reconsecrated the church in 1903. During restorations in the 1971, a large fresco was found in the apse, depicting the Annunciation. The work is attributed to two friars, Franceschino and Manfredino Baxilio, and dated to 1484. Of the fresco, only the Virgin remains.

To encourage development and testing, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued fast track status. Volixibat is an IBAT inhibitor, meaning that it blocks the function of the IBAT protein (ileal bile acid transporter), which is also called SLC10A2 (solute carrier family 10 member 2) or ASBT (apical sodium‚Äìbile acid transporter). IBAT is most highly expressed in the ileum, where it is found on the brush border membrane of enterocytes.

Early life Cole was born in 1906 in London, the eldest son of Ernest Cole and Adelaide Arundel. In 1923, after a falling out with his father and following World War 1, he sailed on board Ormuz to Australia. Outback life In 1994 Tom Cole was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his contribution to history. His publication, Hell, West and Crooked sold over 100,000 copies. Tom Cole has been described as the original Australian crocodile dundee, a buffalo shooter, a crocodile hunter and a horseman of the Australian outback. Tom Cole had started out in Queensland in the Blackall Ranges as a rouseabout or stockman, moving from here to Lake Nash in the Northern Territory and then onto droving cattle down the Birdsville delivering cattle to other states in Australia. He met and worked for many of the big cattle properties. Tom Cole became acquainted and worked for Jim and Paddy Ambrose from Banka Banka station (Chapter 8 of Hell, West and Crooked). Tom did not have any horse breaking experience until he met Jim and Paddy and had only helped out a few times but was anxious to get the experience. Tom was put to the task of breaking in horses for Jim and Paddy Ambrose. Tom broke in horses and was given the pick of 1 for every 4 that he broke in. Tom would also later race horses named Curio and Black Watch at the race at Barrow Creek. Tom Cole and the Ambrose's travelled more than 200 miles for the annual race. Arriving at the race Tom thought it was unspirited that a race be convened without booze. A would - be publican had bought a two tonne truck full of liquor and expecting to make a 300% profit, Paddy and Jim purchased the entire outfit, lock-stock-barrel and bottle. The Banka - Banka encampment then became host for the rest of the meeting and were deemed by the rest of the race meeting as \\"terribly good fellows\\". Tom Cole rode in three races and managed a 2nd and a 3rd and whilst not winning a race, Jim Ambrose told him \\"it's the booze and the company that counts\\". Tom worked at many jobs in these first few years a cook at Brunette Downs to a position on one of Sidney Kidman's properties. By 1928 he was appointed Head Stockman at Wave Hill Station one of the Vestey's properties. Cole moved around the stations in the early 1930s as a horse breaker with Vestey's. By 1932 Cole tried buffalo hunting with Harry Hardy and sold horses to other shooters. He continued buffalo hunting, acquiring a lease at Kapalga, near the Wildman River and then in 1937 buying properties near Pine Creek, Goodparla and Esmeralda which his partner stocked with cattle. Gold deposits were later mined at Esmeralda. In 1932, Cole was at Kapalga where he received word from Jack Hales on the Maroubra about two pearling luggers Raf and Myrtle Olpa which had called into Caledon Bay on the Arnhem Coast and the entire crew had been speared. He heard more about the massacre from other lugger crews that called in to load his hides.

The game was not tied or based around the film, but rather an original story, inspired by the \\"Secret Invasion\\" storyline in the comics.  Gameplay  Gameplay was to be co-op, between four players offline and online, with teamwork being an essential mechanic. Each of the playable characters would have a unique play style, such as Iron Man being able to fly while the Hulk had the strongest melee attacks. Assist attacks allowed players to stun enemies, leaving them open to be finished off by other players, such as Thor summoning lightning with Captain America finishing off the opponent using his shield. Players could also earn experience points from performing a series of melee attack combos on stunned enemies, which would go on to unlock additional abilities. \\"Hero boosts\\" used by the player could increase stats of other players depending on the character, such as Iron Man creating energy shields around his allies for a limited time. The Skrull army were to have unique abilities based on a variety of superheroes such as the Fantastic Four, X-Men and the Avengers themselves, with bosses such as Ultron, Veranke and a giant Skrull. Other characters such as Black Widow and Hawkeye were also considered to be unlockable characters along with the Fantastic Four and Ant-Man, who were also included as NPCs.  Development and cancellation  In 2010, THQ acquired the rights from Marvel with development handled by THQ Studio Australia with outsourced development handled by Blue Tongue Entertainment to create a video game based on several characters from the Avengers. The game chosen to be in first-person came from the developers wanting to try something different from previous games based on Marvel's properties, wanting the player to see through the eyes of characters such as Captain America, Hulk, Thor and Iron Man. The story was to be an original one borrowing elements from the \\"Secret Invasion\\" story in the comics with Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote the arc, brought in to script the game's story. PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were the main consoles of development with Blue Tongue Entertainment handling the PC port. Plans for a Wii U was also considered around the system's launch and console features such as the Kinect for a mode called \\"Avengers Training Academy\\" which would have the player take control of a rookie superhero to fight along The Avengers using motion controls, but both were later cut during pre-production. During mid 2011, the game was struggling to keep up with development with THQ's financial problems with Homefront and the uDraw peripheral costing the company $100 million and the value of the Australian dollar to rise, causing THQ to pay their employees in Australia more than their domestic divisions which led to the decision to shut down both THQ Studio Australia and Blue Tongue Entertainment. In the last few weeks of the developers being shut down, they reached out to Marvel Entertainment in hopes to continue funding and developing the title, which Marvel refused to with the game officially being cancelled. After the game's cancellation, THQ sold off their properties, with Ubisoft acquiring the license to make their own tie-in game to the film, borrowing some of the game's concepts and story to create Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth for Xbox 360 and Wii U, released on October 20, 2012.

She was active in politics both civic and tribal and was elected as county treasurer of Johnston County, Oklahoma. Ward was the first woman to represent the Chickasaw Nation as a delegate to Washington, D.C.. Early life Estelle Chisholm was born on June 18, 1875 in Chism, in the Chickasaw Nation of Indian Territory to Julia Ann (n√©e McLish) and William Chisholm. The town was founded and named after her father. Her grandfather was Jesse Chisholm a mixed blood Cherokee-Scottish trader, after whom the Chisholm Trail was named. Her mother's parents were Ginny \\"Gincy\\" (n√©e Colbert) and George Frazier McLish, who were of Chickasaw and Scottish descent. By her father's first wife, Hester Butler Cochran, she had a half-sister, Caroline, as well as seven full siblings: Eliza, Angeline, Mary V., Alice, Cora Ann, Julia Ann and William Jr. Chisholm attended the Bloomfield Academy and after graduating, taught in the school for a couple of years. She then attended Kidd College in Sherman, Texas from 1894 to 1895, before moving to Bowling Green, Kentucky to attend Potter College. Career Upon completing her education, Chisholm began teaching at Burris Chapel School, a neighborhood school which was part of the Chickasaw education system and located near Tishomingo. On December 23, 1896 in the Chickasaw Nation she married William Thomas Ward, who would serve as the long-time auditor of the Chicaksaw tribe and later as a deputy United States clerk. They lived on their farm and raised their children in Garrett Township, near Tishomingo through the 1920s and then kept a home in Oklahoma City. She was a member of the National Bureau of Women Speakers and contributed articles to newspapers both inside and outside of Oklahoma. Ward published and edited a magazine in Oklahoma City called the Super Civilized Indian. Ward was involved in politics and was elected as Johnston County Treasurer, as well as running several campaigns for Republican candidates. In 1928, she attended a convention of Choctaw and Chickasaw tribe members from throughout Oklahoma in Ardmore. The purpose of the convention was to discuss both financial issues and the burdens being placed upon the tribes because of implementation of the Indian Citizenship Act and the Burke Act. The tribes were concerned about the inability to secure funds that were due them from the government for their coal and asphalt lands. They selected committee representatives, all men save Czarina Conlan for the Choctaw tribe and Ward for the Chickasaw, to draft a solution. The committee met to prepare the recommendations and decided to send Conlan and Ward to Washington, D.C.. It was the first time women had been sent to Washington as tribal representatives for either tribe. The women's task was to argue in favor of passage of a bill proposed by U.S. House Representative Wilburn Cartwright for sale of the coal and asphalt holdings, as well as continuing the restrictions of selling Indian lands. Ward died on December 9, 1946 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and was buried at City Cemetery in Tishomingo, Oklahoma.

It was founded by the ITV News journalist and surfing historian Pete (Peter) Robinson as non-profit organisation 'The Surfing Museum'in 2003, originally as an online UK surf heritage resource (thesurfingmuseum.co.uk). The first public 'Exhibition of British Surfing History' was opened on 6 April 2004 in Brighton's heritage fishing quarter, along with help from local surfers, family and friends. The project was funded by the founder, along with an initial donation from the family of the late Viscount Ted Deerhurst and ongoing sponsorship from the surfing company Oxbow - it displayed Robinson's personal collection of British surfing memorabilia. Through the Touring Exhibitions Group (TEG) two main displays the 'Exhibition of British Surfing History' and 'An Art History of British Surfing' toured locations in Great Britain between 2004 and 2011 (including London, Newquay, Aberdeen, Thurso, Marton, Brighton, Havant and Tynemouth). These early exhibitions included the loan of an historic wooden surfboard, belonging to Hawaiian royalty, high chief Abner Paki, that dated back to the time of Captain James Cook \\\\- the first time it had been exhibited outside its native Hawaii. The board was loaned by the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, and was displayed at the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum in Marton near Middlesbrough in north-east England. This exhibition also featured a visit by the Hawaiian cultural ambassador Tom Pohaku Stone, who carried out a public shaping of a traditional 'olo' surfboard which he donated to the Cook museum. The surfing museum still maintains a mobile display which travels to surfing spots around the country. An oral history project, The First Wave, which collected the memories of early British surfers received funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Registered Charity status was awarded in 2010, with the updated name of the Museum of British Surfing. Its permanent site in Braunton, near the North Devon coast, opened on 6 April 2012 in the former goods shed of the old Braunton Railway Station on the Ilfracombe Branch Line. Several grants have been awarded to help open the museum, notably from Leader 4, the North Devon Coast Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, North Devon Council Section 106 - and from other local councils and charitable trusts to develop 'The Yard' (the building leased from Braunton Parish Council which contains the museum), and the surrounding site including the management of a local skatepark. It was awarded the Collections Trust award for 'collections on a budget' as a result of the museums commitment to working towards carbon neutral status. The founder Pete Robinson, donated \\"as a gift to surfing in Britain\\" his collection of surfboards and surfing memorabilia to start the museum. He left the project in 2015. The museum has been run since 2015 on a voluntary basis by a board of trustees, Kevin Cook, Charlie Spurr, Ian Watson and Christian Dormer. It was awarded Arts Council England accreditation in February 2019. The collection includes more than 200 different designs and shapes of British surfboards, many elaborately decorated. Some of the earliest board, known as coffin lids, were made by South West undertakers and were used in the 1920s and 1930s. There are also videos and photographs including the story of Devonian Agatha Christie with a surfboard in Waikiki. There is also a photograph of King Edward VIII when he was Prince of Wales, also surfing at Waikiki, illustrating the aristocratic nature of the sport in the first half of the 20th century.

History Pickwell was known as pediccheswella in the Domesday Book. The manor was owned by John Harris who was the member of parliament for Barnstaple in the mid 19th century. During the Victorian era Pickwell was owned by the Hole family who paid for much of the restoration of St George's church in Georgeham. The church contains a \\"Pickwell chapel\\" which dates from 1762 and is separated from the body of the church by an ornate screen. =Manor house= The manor house still contains some of the structure which built in the late medieval period, however it was largely rebuilt between 1902 and 1905 for Sir Montague Style of the Style baronets. It is a Grade II listed building. The main range of the house, which is in a Jacobean style, is L shaped and consists of two storeys. The central gable has an oculus. To the rear of the range is a 15th- century doorway with a moulded surround. In the grounds is a folly built to resemble a chapel.

She is considered to be the first New Zealand pianist to gain international recognition. Early life Moore was born in Dunedin, the youngest of five children of Herbert and Charlotte Moore. The family was a musical one - her father was a church organist and a piano teacher, and her older brother Frederick later became a professor of piano at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Another brother, Irvin, became a church organist in Gisborne, in the North Island of New Zealand. Following lessons at home, Moore began entering piano competitions at the age of 7, in 1903. She competed in Dunedin and Christchurch competitions, gaining many first-placings. She also won first prize of a grand piano at a Christchurch competition when aged 16, in 1912. Career From 1917 Moore performed as a soloist and as an accompanist at recitals around the South Island. She moved to England in 1920, where she initially studied piano under her brother Frederick, followed by four years as a pupil of Leonard Borwick. In the 1920s, Moore became friends with the artist Winifred Nicholson, and was the subject in one of Nicholson's paintings, Woman Playing a Piano. Moore enjoyed a successful performing career in England and Europe, receiving particular acclaim for her renditions of the work of Debussy and Chopin. Indeed, in 1931 Debussy's widow attended a concert by Moore and wrote her a congratulatory note for her \\"exquisite\\" performance. Moore returned to New Zealand for visits and to give recitals in 1924 and 1928. In 1928, she stopped en route in Melbourne to perform at the Melbourne University Conservatorium of Music. Her Christchurch concert in the same year was described by critics as \\"phenomenal\\". On occasion, when her brother Frederick was overseas examining for the Associated Board of the Royal Academy, Moore took his place at the Royal Academy. In the late 1930s, Moore was frequently invited to perform for BBC broadcasts. In 1937, she performed as part of the BBC's New Zealand Day radio broadcast. Moore retired to a small French village, Monfort-l‚ÄôAmaury near Paris, where she provided private tutoring in piano, poetry and philosophy. Amongst her students were mezzo-soprano Sophie Koch and pianist Pierre-Alain Volondat.  Personal life  Moore met the Romanian artist Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi in 1931, when their mutual friend, art critic H.S. Ede, invited Br√¢ncu»ôi to one of Moore's concerts. The couple began a relationship, and in 1934 she gave birth to their son, John Moore. Br√¢ncu»ôi never acknowledged his son as his own.

The Shanmen (), also known as the Gate of Three Liberations, is the most important gate of a Chinese Chan Buddhist temple. The origin of the name The origins of the name are debated. One theory is that \\"Shanmen\\" takes its literal meaning of \\"Mountain Gate\\", because temples were traditionally built in forested mountain areas where Chan monks could seclude away from secular life. Another suggests that during various episodes of suppression of Buddhism in Chinese history, monks moved their monasteries deep into the mountains, and later built gates at the foot of the mountain to guide pilgrims to the temples. A further theory is that \\"Shanmen\\" is a corruption of \\"Sanmen\\", or \\"Three Gates\\", referring to the \\"three gateways\\" to liberations.() in the Dharma - the \\"Kongmen\\" (; emptiness liberation), \\"wuxiangmen\\" (; no-aspects liberation) and \\"wuyuanmen\\" (; desireless liberation). The latter view correlates with the traditional structure of Chan temples which included three gateways, said to symbolise the three gateways. Architectural Style The Hall of Mount Gate at Jietai Temple, in Beijing. The arched windows represent the traditional side gateways. Historic Shanmens in China are either a gateway of the paifang style, or a more substantial building, typically with three archways. Where a substantial building is used, the two side gateways might be simplified to arched or circular windows, leaving only the middle gate for access. The gate building may be called the \\"Hall of Three Liberations\\" or \\"Hall of the Mountain Gate\\" (). Traditionally, if the Shanmen takes the form of a gate building, statues of two guardians of Buddhist law are erected in that hall as guardians of the entrance (identified as \\"Heng and Ha\\" (the \\"A-un\\" Nio in Japanese). This is the arrangement at Jietai Temple in Beijing. In some Chan temples, the Shanmen building is combined with the Hall of the Four Heavenly Kings, so that the Four Heavenly Kings serve as guardians of the gateway to the monastery. In other Chan sect temples, the Shanmen building is combined with the Maitreya Hall, with a statue of the Maitreya Buddha erected in the centre of the hall. This is the arrangement seen at Shaolin Temple and Longhua Temple. Yet other Chan temples combine both the Maitreya Hall and the Hall of the Four Heavenly King with the Shanmen, so that the entrance building also features the statue of the Maitreya Buddha at the centre as well as the Four Heavenly Kings on the sides. This is the arrangement at Lingyin Temple.

The movement was formed in July 2016, and the march it staged in August 2016 has been characterized as the largest demonstration in Peruvian history Background =Statistics= According to Peru's National Statistics Institute 2014 survey, 32.3% of Peruvian women had at some point experienced physical violence from a spouse or partner, and 11.9% had experienced such in the previous 12 months. The country's national human rights ombudsman's office has estimated that every month 10 women are killed by their partners. A 2015 study by the same office revealed that from January 2009 to October 2015, 795 femicides were committed, but the courts had issued only 84 sentences between 2012 and 2015. In 81% of the cases of attempted femicide no measures were taken by authorities to protect the survivor, and 24% of women who turned to the justice system for help were later murdered by the very men from whom they had sought protection. In 2017, between January and September there were 94 femicides, 5,707 sexual assaults and 21,000 assaults. Of the 5,707 sexual assaults, 71.33% of victims were children. Movement The protest was called as a show of indignation following the freeing from jail of convicted batterer Adriano Pozo Arias. In July 2015 Pozo had been captured on video attacking his girlfriend, lawyer Cindy Arlette Contreras Bautista, in a hotel in the city of Ayacucho, and dragging her by the hair. The attack left her with damage to one of her legs, necessitating the use of a cane.

Echeverr√≠a entered the order despite the opposition of her parents and was a close friend of Saua Angel ‚Äì a friend from Catholic Action who became a priest. Guggiari Echeverr√≠a's cause for sainthood commenced under Pope John Paul II in 1997 after she received the title Servant of God, and the confirmation of her heroic virtue led to Pope Benedict XVI conferring the title of Venerable on 27 March 2010. Pope Francis confirmed her beatification and it was celebrated on 23 June 2018. Life Mar√≠a Guggiari Echeverr√≠a was born in 1925 in the Guair√° Department as the first of seven children to Ram√≥n Guggiari (b. 10 November 1895) and Mar√≠a Arminda Echeverr√≠a (b. 21 May 1904). Her father often called her \\"Chiquitunga\\". Her siblings included her brother Federico Augusto Ram√≥n Guggiari Echeverr√≠a and sisters Mar√≠a Teresa Arminda and Ma√±ica Gonz√°lez Raveti; there were four others. She was baptized on 28 February 1929 and made her First Communion on 8 December 1937. In 1941 she became a member of the Catholic Action movement ‚Äì despite her parents' opposition to it ‚Äì and she dedicated herself to the movement and the care of the poor and those who suffered while also serving as a catechist for children. She met her spiritual director Father Julio Cesar Duarte Ortella in February 1941. It was during her time with the movement that she met and fell in love with the medical student Saua Angel and she began to wonder if God wanted her to wed like the parents of Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, who made vows to remain chaste in the married life. Echeverr√≠a waited for the Lord's will to manifest itself, and Angel later told her in May 1951 that he felt called to the priesthood. She decided to offer whatever assistance he needed and helped Angel hide it from his father, a Muslim. She bid farewell to Angel who departed for Madrid for further studies and to continue to discern his vocation. She made a vow to remain chaste in October 1942. In 1947 ‚Äì due to civil unrest ‚Äì her father and brother Federico were sent to Posadas in Argentina for a brief period of time. In February 1950 she and her parents relocated to the capital of the nation. Angel departed for Europe in April 1952 and then made the decision to become a priest in November 1952, in a move that also prompted her to discern her call to the religious life (she had visited a convent of the Carmelites on 20 August 1952), though in 1953 she received staunch opposition to this from her parents. In January 1954 she began a period of spiritual exercises. Despite this opposition she entered the Discalced Carmelite Order on 2 February 1955 and received the habit on 14 August 1955. She took her initial vows on 15 August 1956 along with her new religious name. She wrote around 48 letters to the now-Father Angel in her time as a religious. On 7 January 1959 she became ill with infectious hepatitis and was forced to move into a sanatorium to recover; she spat blood for the first time on 28 March 1959 ‚Äì Holy Saturday. On 28 April 1959 in Asunci√≥n she was with her siblings and parents on cushions and sat up and spoke her final words at 4:10 am: \\"Jesus I love You! What a sweet encounter! Virgin Mary!\\" She had asked the prioress to read a poem of Teresa of √Åvila before she died. Her remains were relocated on 28 April 1993. Beatification The beatification process was set to commence after she became titled as a Servant of God under Pope John Paul II on 17 July 1997 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted the official \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the cause, while the diocesan process spanned from 13 December 1997 until 28 April 2000. The C.C.S. validated this process on 22 February 2002 and allowed for the postulation to compile and submit the Positio dossier to officials in Rome in 2004 for further assessment. Theologians met to approve the cause on 20 March 2009 while the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. met and approved the cause in a similar fashion on 8 February 2010. On 27 March 2010 she was titled as Venerable after Pope Benedict XVI confirmed her life of heroic virtue. The process for investigating a miracle spanned from 23 March 2005 until 27 April 2007 and received C.C.S. validation on 14 November 2008. Her miracle involved the healing of a newborn, √Ångel Ram√≥n, who showed no vital signs at birth but recuperated after 20 minutes, following the prayers by the obstetrician for the intercession of Mar√≠a Guggiari Echeverr√≠a.Chiquitunga, a un paso de ser primera paraguaya beatificada por el Vaticano ultimahora.com, June 2. 2017, retrieved February 12, 2019. Medical experts in Rome approved the miracle presented to them in their meeting on 1 June 2017. Theologians approved the case on 30 November 2017 as did the C.C.S. members on 6 March 2018. Pope Francis approved this miracle just hours later and confirmed her beatification; she was beatified at the Estadio General Pablo Rojas on 23 June 2018 with Cardinal Angelo Amato presiding on the pope's behalf.

Bilateral relations between the Republic of Singapore and the Kingdom of Thailand formally date to 1965, when Thailand established diplomatic relations soon after the independence of Singapore. Both countries are the founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  History  The elephant statue given by Rama V to Singapore Singapore and Siam started trade relations before the founding of Singapore by Stamford Raffles. At that time, some Chinese Siamese merchants went to Singapore for trading activities. In 1871, King Rama V of Siam visited Singapore and this was the first time of the Monarchy of Thailand visiting a foreign country. During his visit, he gave an elephant statue to Singapore which stands outside the Old Parliament House today. In 1965, Thailand established diplomatic relations with Singapore, which had just gained its independence from Malaysia. In 1967, both countries, with Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, formed the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations. In 1978, when the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War broke out, Singapore supported the actions of Thailand towards Cambodia. In 1997, the two countries established the relations of \\"Enhanced Partnership\\". In 2005, S.R. Nathan, the President of Singapore, visited Thailand, making the first visit of the President of Singapore to Thailand. In August 2015, Tanasak Patimapragorn, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Thailand, visited Singapore and met Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore. The leaders reaffirmed the longstanding and excellent relations between Singapore and Thailand. During Tanasak's visit, he also met K. Shanmugam, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Singapore for the commemorative activities of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between the two countries, and the enhancement of the interpersonal relations between the two countries.  Trade relations  According to the data from The Observatory of Economic Complexity, the exported values from Singapore to Thailand were between 2 billion and 4 billion US Dollars between 1995 and 2002. Then the value increased and rose to 7 billion US dollars in 2008. Though the value was dropped to 5 billion US dollars the next year, it then rose again and made a peak of 8 billion US dollars in 2013. Singapore mainly exported machines to Thailand. Since 2002, the scale of chemical products in exported products had increased. Between 1995 and 2003, The exported values from Thailand to Singapore were between 4 billion and 6 billion US dollars. The values started rising in 2003 and the values increased to the range between 9 billion and 10 billion US dollars. Thailand mainly exported machines to Singapore while the proportion of refined petroleum in the exported products started to increase in 2003. When Prayuth Chan-ocha, the Prime Minister of Thailand, visited Singapore in June 2015, Singapore and Thailand signed two agreements about the avoidance of double taxation and cruise travelling. Moreover, in order to provide a platform for trading, investments, commercial activities and personnel training, the Singapore Manufacturing Federation and the Federation of Thai Industries signed a memorandum of understanding.  Cultural relations  Since 1997, Singapore and Thailand established Thailand-Singapore Civil Service Exchange Program for regular interactions of personnel and experiences. The program covers 13 aspects. Among these aspects, there are more educational interactions between the two countries. Both countries also have technical cooperation under the Singapore Cooperation Programme. Under the Thailand-Singapore Civil Service Exchange Program, both countries give technical assistance to countries like Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar and Timor-Leste. In 2015, the Media Development Authority of Singapore and the Software Industry Promotion Agency of Thailand enhanced cooperation in broadcast, audiovisual, animation, game and digital media aspects by signing a memorandum of understanding. In the same year, the Silpakorn University of Thailand and the Singapore Wind Symphony staged a joint musical performance during an activity organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand.

(n√©e Grigorevskaya, March 21, 1879 ‚Äì September 22, 1950) was a Russian anatomist, cell biologist and embryologist. In 1908 she was the first woman in Russia to be appointed as a professor and she became a pioneer in stem cell research. She emigrated to the United States in 1915 where she was a leading exponent of the idea that all types of blood cell develop from a single type of cell. She has sometimes been called \\"the mother of stem cells\\". She later returned to Europe to continue with her research. Early life Vera Danchakoff ‚Äì beginning of twentieth century Danchakoff was born in St Petersburg where her parents wanted her to study music or drawing. Determined otherwise, she left home to take a degree in natural sciences before moving to Lausanne University for a medical degree, producing her thesis in 1906. Returning to Russia she took a Russian medical degree at Kharkov University and then became the first woman to be awarded a doctorate in medical sciences at the St Petersburg Academy of Medicine ‚Äì Russia's first medical college for women. She married and her daughter, born in 1902 in Zurich, was Vera Evgenevna who went on to study at Columbia University and to marry Mikhail Lavrentyev, the mathematician. quoting an article in Vedomosti, 14 April 1995 In 1915 Danchakoff emigrated to the United States where she was politically active, writing as the New York correspondent of the Moscow newspaper Utro Rossi (Russian Morning) and by helping the American Relief Administration with publicising the difficulties of Soviet scientists in working in Russia during the Great War, the Bolshevik Revolution and afterwards. During the Russian famine of 1921‚Äì22 Danchakoff appealed for food parcels to be sent to Russia by publicizing the correspondence she had been receiving from scientific colleagues in Russia. Although internationally eminent, they had been denounced as \\"parasites and idlers\\" and were dying of starvation. At the time there was a strong Russian √©migr√© community in New York and, with her husband, Danchakoff hosted lavish gatherings of friends. She was a talented pianist and she took part in the musical evenings of Juan and Olga Codina, who were professional singers. She used to look after their daughter Lina when her parents were away on their extended tours ‚Äì Lina later was to marry Serge Prokofiev. Scientific career In 1908 Danchakoff became an assistant professor in histology and embryology at Moscow University ‚Äì the first woman to become a professor in Russia. In 1915 she emigrated to the United States where she first worked at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. Then at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, led by Thomas Hunt Morgan, she was \\"instructor in anatomy\\" at a time when women were first being allowed admittance as students. In a 1916 lecture she said In his 2001 keynote address to the Acute Leukemia Forum Marshall Lichtman described her presentation as an \\"extraordinary lecture\\" and considered that \\"The rest of the century has been spent filling in the details of [her] experimental insights!\\". It has been claimed that a paper of Danchakoff's is the first publication to use the term \\"stem cell\\", for example \\"These stem cells develop on the one hand into the small lymphocytes, and on the other hand into granulocytoblasts, and further into granulocytes\\". referring to It has now been confirmed that hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all other blood cells. For these reasons Danchakoff has sometimes been called the \\"mother of stem cells\\". However, in terms of the actual terminology, in 1909 Alexander A. Maximow wrote in German of \\"Stammzelle\\" for the same concept in his paper \\"The lymphocyte as a stem cell, common to different blood elements in embryonic development and during the post-fetal life of mammals\\" (English translation). allantoid membrane of a chick embryo. Right: the spleen of the same chick embryo after 17 days. Note the specific induction of growth of the spleen. In 1916 Danchakoff and James Bumgardner Murphy independently reported on a surprising discovery concerning the chick embryo ‚Äì one that turned out to be of great importance. When the embryo was injected with adult lymphocytes the spleen greatly enlarged. With other types of cell this did not occur. Murphy's and Danchakoff's explanations for the effect were wrong but much later these observations led to an understanding of lymphocyte migration and graft-versus-host disease. By 1919 Danchakoff was a full professor of anatomy in Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1934 she left Columbia and until 1937 worked in the Department of Histology and Embryology at the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. In 1938 she conducted important experiments which involved exposing female guinea pig foetuses to testosterone. She showed for the first time that this can give rise to an increase of masculine sexual behavior in adulthood. Danchakoff published many books as well as scientific papers, possibly her last publications being Le sexe; r√¥le de l'h√©r√©dit√© et des hormones dans sa r√©alisation in 1949 and Effects of cancer provoking chemical substances on gravid guinea pigs and their fruits in 1950.

Early life Telanga Kharia was born on 9 February 1806, at Murgu village, Gumla district of modern-day Jharkhand state. He belonged to Kharia tribe. His father's name was Thunya Kharia, who was a storekeeper at Chotanagpur Nagvansi king of Ratu. His mother's name was Peti Kharia. He married Ratni Kharia. Since childhood Telanga Kharia was very brave, honest and talkative by nature. He was involved in agriculture and animal-rearing. He developed keen interest on social and political issues as he often had chance to witness debates on these topics in the court of King of Ratu, where he used to go with his father. As an adult, he was well known for his revolutionary thoughts, reasoning skills and dedication to social service. Movement against the British Raj By the end of 1850, the British rule was established in Chotanagpur region. From ages, tribals have their own traditional autonomous self-governance rule of \\"Parha System\\" and they were almost free from any kind of outside interference. But this autonomous self- governance rule was disturbed and destroyed by the regulations imposed by the British Raj. Now, tribals had to pay revenue (malgujari) on their own land which they had been preparing and cultivating for centuries. When they failed to pay the land revenue, they were alienated from their own land in the hands of zamindars and Britishers. They were forced to live like a farm labourers. The middlemen like money lenders(sahukars) and zamindars didn't miss any single chance to loot common people. Apart from this, there existed a major problem of rural indebtedness. Poor people had to lose their land when they were unable to repay loans taken from village moneylenders. Many times, these debts were inherited from the past and increased with the passage of time. The plight of a common man was very miserable. Telanga Kharia couldn't tolerate these injustice and atrocities and started the fight against the British rule and their middlemen. He started to organise people and create awareness among them. He created Jury Panchayat in many villages, which worked as self- governance rule parallel to the British rule. There were 13 Jury Panchayats formed by Telanga Kharia, which were spread across Sisai, Gumla, Basia, Simdega, Kumhari, Kolebira, Chainpur, Mahabuang and Bano area. He created \\"Akhara\\", where he used to give arms training to his followers. Their main weapons were sword and bow-arrow. He raised an army of around 900 to 1500 trained men. They used Guerrilla style of fighting. Telanga Kharia and his followers attacked Britishers, their middlemen and every other establishments of the British Raj. They also looted British banks and treasuries. During the period of 1850-1860, the rebellion led by Telanga Kharia against the British Raj in Chotanagpur region was at its peak. British government became very desperate to get rid of Telanga Kharia and wanted to suppress this uprising by any means. After knowing the intentions of the British government, Telanga Kharia became very alert. He began to control his operations mostly from hideouts inside the forest and unknown locations. Once, when Telanga Kharia was busy conducting a meeting at one village Jury Panchayat, the information about his presence at the meeting was passed by an agent of Zamindar to the Britishers. Soon, the meeting place was surrounded by the British army and then they arrested Telanga Kharia. He was first sent to Lohardaga Jail, and then to Calcutta Jail, where he got imprisonment of 18 years. Release from the jail, revival of movement and death When Telanga Kharia was released after completing his imprisonment in Calcutta jail, he again met his followers at Sisai Akhara. He started to revive the movement and made plans to strengthen the organisation. The information about his rebellion activities soon reached the ears of the Britishers and they started making plans to kill him. On 23 April 1880, when Telanga Kharia was offering daily prayer at Sisai Akhara before starting the training session, as soon as he bowed down for prayer, one of the British agents named Bodhan Singh, ambushed nearby that Akhara, open fired at him. After being hit by bullet, he collapsed. Then, his followers immediately carried his body and moved towards the forest, so that Britishers couldn't find his body. After crossing the Koel river, they buried the body of Telanga Kharia at Soso Neem Toli village of Gumla district. Now this burial place is known as 'Telanga Topa Tand', which means 'burial ground of Telanga'. This place is considered sacred by the people of Chotanagpur, specially by the Kharia community. Every year on this day, his martyrdom is commemorated by the people. Also, one week long 'Sahid Telanga Mela' is organised on this occasion at Dhedhouli village of Gumla district. Telanga Kharia is still an inspiration to the millions in the region of Chotanagpur for his bravery, sacrifice and martyrdom.

At unspecified time though prior to the summer of 1877 he returned to Spain, settling back in Toledo. As a discharged officer he was not entitled to military pension; he decided to make a living banking on his teaching and wartime experience as an infantry commander. The Toledo Colegio Milit√°r de Infanter√≠a, set up by Ministry of Defense in 1850 as the key military education establishment, following a brief period in Madrid returned to Toledo in 1876, renamed as Academia. Located in iconic Alc√°zar premises and admitting hundreds of officer hopefuls every year it became not only a city landmark, but also exercised enormous influence on local life, with massive impact in terms of lodging, transportation, services and production, all geared to address the academy needs.Enrique S√°nchez Lub√≠an, Toledo y las academias preparatorias, [in:] ABC 17.09.13, available here The Infantry Academy gave rise also to private schools, supposed to prepare candidates to pass the Academia entry exams; during last decades of the 19th century there were 5-8 such establishments operating.ran i.e. by Antonio Lozano Ascarza, Agustin Montagut, Arturo Guiu, Pedro Baz√°n or Rodrigo Pe√±alosa, most of them in senior officer ranks and some acting professors of the Academy at the same time, S√°nchez Lub√≠an 2013 It was one of such schools that Sanz Escart√≠n opened himself. Named Academia Preparatoria, Colegio de Preparaci√≥n, Colegio General Militar or simply Academia-Colegio, the school was first located at Puerta Llana, then moving to two adjacent buildings at Bajada del Pozo Amargo.compare adverts from the 1870s - La Corespondencia de Espa√±a 24.09.78, available here, from the 1880s - El Imparcial 09.11.81, available here, from the 1890s ‚Äì El Imparcial 14.09.91, available here, or from the 1900 - La Corespondencia de Espa√±a 04.01.05, available here Its exact opening year is unclear; some of its later notes claimed it had operated since 1875,El Comercio 03.10.79, available here though first press adverts targeting new candidates can be traced back to 1877.La Corespondencia de Espa√±a 19.06.77, available here Invariably featuring Sanz as the director, the school kept recruiting at least until the early 20th century. It is not clear whether lack of press adverts in mid-1890s is indicative of the school temporarily closing or quite to the contrary, acquiring a prestigious status which did not require commercial marketing. Though press adverts did not exploit the Carlist wartime record of its director, parents of similar political leaning used to favor Sanz's college over similar schools; that was the case of Ignacio Hidalgo de Cisneros, the future commander of Republican Air Force, who as a boy was sent from his native Vitoria to Toledo.in this particular case Sanz as an educator recorded a failure. The young Ignacio demonstrated little knack for learning and his entering the Sanz‚Äôs college was intended as an emergency measure; the plan did not work out and the boy fell out from also from this school, finally completing his education elsewhere, Ignacio Hidalgo de Cisneros, Dobry wiatr alisio, Warszawa 1961, p. 36 new Toledo cadets taking oath Sanz's educational establishment seems to have worked well; in 1905 it claimed that 267 of its alumni had passed the Infantry Academy entry exams so far,La Corespondencia de Espa√±a 04.01.05, available here some of them admitted as \\"numero uno\\" in their respective classes.Ferrer 1979, p. 93 Also independent contemporary commentators noted that in terms of military education Sanz was \\"greatly successful\\".La Revista Moderna 1898, p. 573, available here At least periodically the college employed some teaching staff,Juan Eymar, Franco Alvarez Arenas and others. El Porvenir 22.11.05, available here though it is not clear whether Sanz remained an owner-manager or whether he taught himself; the latter is not unlikely, as some sources refer to him as \\"gran matem√°tico\\".La Revista Moderna 1898, p. 573, available here With some 30 years of teaching record, in the early 20th century the college gained a firm status and its owner emerged as one of established city figures. In the 1910s Sanz entered the Toledan Asociaci√≥n de Misiones Pedag√≥gicas and became a member of its Junta Directiva.La Campana Gorda 04.04.12, available here It is not clear in what circumstances and when exactly the college closed. Its last commercial note identified comes from 1911.El Porvenir 31.08.11, available here Deputy Cerralbo Following military defeat of 1876 Carlism underwent the period of crisis and did not assume an organized political shape until the late 1880s. Sanz remained on the sidelines of the movement's meager public initiatives; neither in contemporary press nor in scholarly historical works he is noted among provincial, regional or national party leaders.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 80; in the late 1880s marqu√©s de Cerralbo took the lead in Castilla la Nueva, while Valde-Espina remained the Northern leader, Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 146 However, he remained engaged in the party, subscribing to Traditionalist press and taking part in mobilization projects formatted as cultural initiatives, e.g. in the mid-1880s donating money to the monument of Tom√°s Zumalacarregui.El Siglo Futuro 24.03.83, available here; he also took part in initiatives which seem not quite typical for a Carlist, e.g. engaged in anti-slavery movement, La Uni√≥n Cat√≥lica 06.04.89, available here During the 1888 crisis, when Ram√≥n Nocedal challenged the claimant and eventually led the secession of the so- called Integrists, Sanz remained loyal to his king. When the new party leader marqu√©s de Cerralbo changed the strategy from abstention to active participation in national political life, Sanz emerged among candidates to take part in electoral race. During the 1891 campaign the Carlists for the first time decided to field official party lists. Sanz Escart√≠n, though resident of Toledo, was agreed to stand in his native Navarre, in the district of Pamplona. Some newspapers confused him with his uncle, Ces√°reo Sanz L√≥pez,La Uni√≥n Cat√≥lica 22.01.91, available here. Also some present-day scholars confuse Sanz Escart√≠n with his uncle, see e.g. Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, pp. 207, 238 which did not prevent electoral success: Sanz emerged as the front-runner,see the Sanz 1891 mandate at official Cortes service, available here defeating Conservative, Liberal, Republican and Integrist counter-candidates;Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Zaratiegui Labiano, Efectos de la aplicaci√≥n del sufragio universal en Navarra.

He was the only one of 4 Carlists running in Navarre who succeededthose defeated were Montoya in Estella, Irigaray in Tafalla and Castillo in Tudela, Zaratiegui Labiano 1996, p. 199 and one of 7 Carlists elected nationwide.

The Silvela government reacted with preventive detentions and expulsions, resulting in the Carlist organizational network seriously debilitated. Finally Don Carlos decided to abstain, Remirez de Ganuza L√≥pez 1988, p. 382 Sanz remained fully loyal and complied.Remirez de Ganuza L√≥pez 1988, p. 382 Palacio de las Cortes Though Sanz spent 5 terms and 9 years in the Congress of Deputies, he is hardly known for any personal activity. Not a single time he has been referred to by the press in his MP capacity, be it delivering an address, fathering a legal motion or simply questioning the government. It seems that his engagement boiled down to signing up to initiatives animated by Carlist parliamentary champions, mostly Juan V√°zquez de Mella; their scope ranged from education to economy to military issues.see e.g. La Dinast√≠a 23.12.93, available here, Revista de Espa√±a 1894, p. 100, available here, La Iberia 29.03.95, available here, El Correo Militar 08.07.96, available here, El Liberal 08.09.96, available here The single time he was mentioned single-handedly was when the disciplinary commission considered legal action against Sanz; the motion, eventually abandoned, resulted from his article published in El Correo Espa√±ol and deemed anti-constitutional.La Uni√≥n Cat√≥lica 03.05.92, available here It is not clear whether his performance in the chamber contributed to termination of Sanz's career of a deputy; in 1903 he again stood in Pamplona and somewhat unexpectedly failed to get his ticket renewed.El Siglo Futuro 02.05.06, available here Rise to Field Marshal Carlist dogs conspiring Having obtained the Cortes mandate Sanz, despite his previous moderate engagement in internal party life, emerged as one of the most recognizable Carlist figures. This translated to his somewhat more energetic activities, be it in terms of co-ordinating nationwide projects with nominal party leadershipe.g. in 1891 he corresponded with de Cerralbo on another attempt to honor Zumalacarregui, a pyramide, Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 166 or taking part in public rallies, be it in PamplonaEl Siglo Futuro 01.1091, available here or in Madrid;Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 323 he also took advantage of his deputy status protesting to civil authorities about alleged mistreatment of Carlist activists.1891 protesting to the civil governor of Pamplona over measures v Carlists, Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 207; in the work quoted he is confused with Ces√°reo Sanz L√≥pez Throughout most of the 1890s, however, he did not assume any major position within the party structures; the regional organization in Castilla la Nueva, where Sanz lived, was led by marqu√©s de Cerralbo, while the one in Navarre, where he originated from, following the death of marqu√©s de Valde-Espina was led by Salvad√≥r El√≠o Ezpeleta.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 258 It was only in the late 1890s when Sanz grew to head of the Madrid circulo,in 1897, Remirez de Ganuza L√≥pez 1988, p. 362, Eduardo Gonz√°lez Calleja, La raz√≥n de la fuerza: orden p√∫blico, subversi√≥n y violencia pol√≠tica en la Espa√±a de la Restauraci√≥n (1875‚Äì1917), Madrid 1998, , pp. 194-5 in 1897 assuming also the Navarrese jefatura.La Epoca 22.03.97, available here; in 1903 he became jefe of the riojan Carlists, El Pa√≠s 04.02.03, available here In the very late 1890s Sanz emerged among the party heavyweights. In 1897 he was invited to the claimant's residence in Venice to take part in editing the Carlist doctrinal manifesto, though little is known about his actual contribution to the so- called Acta de Loredan.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 326, Gonz√°lez Calleja 1998, p. 183 The following year he was already fully engaged in a Carlist plot, aimed at launching another insurgency. In 1899 he was nominated to a 7-member junta, supposed to co-ordinate action plan of the rising,Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 363, Gonz√°lez Calleja 1998, pp. 198-9 and grew to its supreme military authority; this was formally recognized by Carlos VII nominating Sanz to mariscal del campo.Ferrer 1979, p. 93, Sanz y Escart√≠n, Romualdo Ces√°reo entry, [in:] Gran Enciclopedia Navarra, vol. X, Pamplona 1990, , p. 264. Sanz did not use the title in public milieu; if Sanz's Carlist rank was invoked by the press, he was usually referred to as \\"so-called general\\" or \\"so-called marshal\\", though there were exceptions, also in non-Carlist press, see e.g. references to \\"general Sanz\\" in El Sol, 16.06.19, available here Full picture of the attempt remains obscure; it seems that the Carlist command put off the insurgency, which in Catalonia got out of hand and materialized as few isolated revolts, known as La Octubrada.the 1899 events have not earned an in- depth monograph so far. The most detailed works available are somewhat sketchy articles, see Eduardo Gonz√°lez Calleja, Jordi Canal, No era la ocasi√≥n propicia.....

Violencia pol√≠tica en la Espa√±a finiseculan, [in:] Ayer 13 (1994), pp. 57-84 During the key period Sanz was in Bayonne, not clear whether part of Carlist smokescreen or actual strategy to disengage from would-be unrest.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 362 Also the aftermath period is far from clear. Some authors claim that Sanz was spared the claimant's anger and in 1900 was still considered Minister of War in a would-be rebellious Carlist government.Gonz√°lez Calleja 1998, p. 205 On the other hand, contemporary press reported his alleged differences with Carlos VII, pointed to his supposed opposition to military action and speculated this was the reason for no official reprisal measures having been administered versus Sanz.La Vanguadia 06.11.00, available here La Octubrada, 1899 La Octubrada caused major shakeup in the Carlist political command, with marqu√©s de Cerralbo replaced by Mat√≠as Barrio y Mier as the king's Jefe Delegado. Sanz is not named as a protagonist of the turmoil which rocked top layers of the party, apart that he resigned from the Navarrese jefatura.La Vanguardia 06.11.00 It seems he did not fall from grace, as in 1902 he was considered member of an auxiliary junta, to be set up as assistance to the ailing Barrio.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 413 However, having lost the parliamentary mandate in 1903 he lost also prestigious position within the executive, especially that his friend de Cerralbo was also sidetracked and the party was controlled by a new team. Senator Carlist standard In 1904 Sanz attempted to re-enter the Cortes; instead of Congreso de Diputados he targeted the Senate, fielding his candidature in Navarre. Instead of popular vote, members of the upper chamber were selected by a pre-defined group of electors, named compromisarios; accordingly, the electoral campaign was all about behind-the- stage dealings. Details of the bid are not clear, except that Sanz was endorsed as a Carlist candidate;Heraldo Alaves 17.11.04, available here at that time he was already sort of an iconic Navarrese figure, acknowledged even in not necessarily hostile press couplets.see rhymes of Raimundo Garc√≠a, known as Garcilaso, El Eco de Navarra 15.09.06, available here The negotiations must have proven unsuccessful, as he withdrew shortly before the process was concluded.La Dinast√≠a 14.04.04, available here In the mid-1900 he generally disengaged himself from great politicshe was noted rather for religious activities, see e.g. El Siglo Futuro 05.12.06, available here. In another rather non-typical Carlist gesture, paired with his anti-slavery activity one more evidence that Sanz Escart√≠n was by no means a typical military, he joined the campaign to save the life of Pedro Coromines, see El Pa√≠s 24.09.07, available here. At the turn of the decades Sanz did not hold any regional Carlist jefatura; Navarre was led by Francisco Mart√≠nez and Castilla La Nueva by Tom√°s Dom√≠nguez Romera, Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 443 and focused on the Toledan milieu. Apart from rising to executive of the local Asociaci√≥n de Misiones Pedag√≥gicas,La Campana Gorda 04.04.12, available here in 1906 he entered Junta Municipal de ToledoEl D√≠a del Toledo 10.03.06, available here and in 1908 became adjunto del Juzgado Municipal.El D√≠a del Toledo 12.12.08, available here Having engaged in setting up the municipal C√°mara de Comercio, in the early 1910s he emerged as its first president.he resigned in 1914, Esther Mart√≠n, 100 a√±os y un futuro incierto, [in:] La Tribuna de Toledo 13.08.12, available here, see also Gu√≠a Oficial de Espa√±a 1913, p. 775, available here In 1914 Sanz resumed his Senate bid, again from Navarre. There is no information on the background of the campaign, though apparently this time the backstage haggling proved successful: he was elected among 3 candidates who enjoyed massive advantage over the remaining contenders.see Sanz 1914 mandate at the official Senate service, available here The victory again proved to be the first one in a string of successive triumphs: Sanz got his mandate prolonged in 1916,see Sanz 1916 mandate at the official Senate service, available here 1918see Sanz 1918 mandate at the official Senate service, available here and 1919.see Sanz 1919 mandate at the official Senate service, available here His 4 terms came to an end in 1920; it is not clear whether he lost or decided to terminate the parliamentarian career. Unlike in case of his deputy record, Sanz's stand in the upper chamber was not passive. Though in terms of legal initiatives he is noted only for fathering a draft law related to officer retirement rules, the project he eventually withdrew,see Proposici√≥n de Ley de D. Cesareo Sanz y Escart√≠n sobre pase de Coroneles a la escala de reserva (1918-1919) at the official Senate service, available here [Actividad parlamentaria bookmark] Sanz engaged in a number of army-related discussions ‚Äì he contributed to debates on internal organization, military academies, remuneration and awards, war in Morocco, retirement or military justice. He formed part of commissions related to the army and the navy, though also used to join those focusing on legal, budgetary and economic issues.see Sanz recorded at record of the Senate sessions at the official Senate service, available here [Diario de Sesiones bookmark] Though his term in the Senate fell on the years of the Great War, neither in the official Senate record nor in the press he was recorded discussing Spanish position towards the warring parties. Palacio del Senado Sanz's term in the Senate was not marked by particular controversies; it was only once that he came under fire as alleged \\"generalisimo de Requet√©s\\", a freshly created Carlist youth organization, whose members were suspected of running a sabotage campaign.requet√©s were suspected of throwing stones at bypassing trains, ABC 14.11.16, available here He denied any involvement and indeed, at the time the Requet√© organization was led by another Carlist military, Joaqu√≠n Llorens.Eduardo G. Calleja, Julio Ar√≥stegui, La tradici√≥n recuperada: el Requet√© Carlista y la insurrecci√≥n, [in:] Historia Contemporanea 11 (1994), pp. 30-31, Julio Ar√≥stegui, Combatientes Requet√©s en la Guerra Civil espa√±ola, 1936-1939, Madrid 2013, , pp. 56-61 Due to his advanced age and longtime parliamentary record Sanz acquired prestigious status: in 1916 Navarrese MPs and senators from all parties elected him their dean.La Epoca 23.05.16, available here Mellista Jaime III, 1918 During the 1910s Carlism was paralyzed by conflict between the claimant Don Jaime and the key theorist, Juan V√°zquez de Mella. Sanz, due to his Senate seat a member of Junta Superior Central Tradicionalista, was not a protagonist of the strife,Mellism has earned one monograph so far, Juan Ram√≥n de Andr√©s Mart√≠n, El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambici√≥n pol√≠tica, Madrid 2000, . When discussing the conflict maturing within Carlism, the authot does not mention Sanz a single time prior to 1918 though his links with Cerralbo placed him rather among the Mellistas. In 1916, when the Navarrese jefe Francisco Mart√≠nez found it impossible to square the circle of conflicting loyalties and resigned, Cerralbo appointed Sanz as his replacement;Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, pp. 487-8 at that time Don Jaime was isolated in his house arrest in Austria and the party was almost entirely taken over by de Mella supporters. In the mid-1910s Sanz was already considered \\"claro promellista\\".Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 134 Since the early 1918 marqu√©s de Cerralbo tried to step down as Carlist political leader. In April 1918 he managed to get his resignation as president of Junta Superior accepted; its members elected Sanz his temporary replacement.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 495 At the age of 74 he formally became the Carlist political leader, though missing final confirmation from his non-contactable kingFern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 501 he appeared either as \\"vicepresidente de Junta Suprema\\" or \\"presidente en funciones\\",Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 497 holding what was named \\"presidencia interina\\" or \\"presidencia accidental\\".Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 136 The second half of 1918 was a period of general bewilderment among the Carlists, with de Mella effectively acting as their political leader in Spain. Sanz was not noted for any specific initiative except a note he co-editedwith Pradera and Beunza, ABC 03.05.74, available here, also Jos√© F. Lorca Navarrete, Pluralismo, regionalismo, municipalismo, Sevilla 1978, p. 130 and promoted, finally issued by the Navarrese Diputaci√≥n: it re-claimed traditional provincial rights, scrapped in 1839, and was intended as a measure countering Basque nationalist demands, presented to president Wilson.Romualdo Ces√°reo Sanz Escartin entry, [in:] Au√±amendi Eusko Entziklopedia, available here Juan Vazquez de Mella In the first days of January 1919 Don Jaime arrived in Paris; he immediately demanded that Sanz, de Mella and de Cerralbo report to him in person.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 502 Sanz was anticipating the worst and possibly preparing a would-be secession, he took steps intended to transfer ownership of the party mouthpiece, El Correo Espa√±ol, to a commercial company controlled by the Mellistas.Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 141-2 The Spanish Carlists were eventually denied French visas and did not show up in Paris,Oyarz√∫n 2008, p. 494; according to another scholar, it was Sanz himself who refused to go to Paris, Jos√© Javier L√≥pez Ant√≥n, Trayectoria ideol√≥gica del carlismo bajo don Jaime III, 1909-1931, [in:] Aportes 15 (1990), p. 39 but as late as in February 1919 the clash did not seem inevitable: Don Jaime confirmed Sanz as temporary president of Junta Superior.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 502 Aware of a belligerent manifesto, prepared by the claimant, Sanz asked that its publication be suspended; he was surprised to find it printed in Correo.Oyarz√∫n 2008, p. 494, Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 144 Details of the final breakup are not clear; there is no known document in which Don Jaime dismissed Sanz from the presidency or expulsed him from the party.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 508. According to one source Don Jaime dissolved the entire Junta Central, which formally terminated Sanz‚Äôs role as its president, El Norte 16.05.20, available here However, in late February 1919 he already appointed Pascual Com√≠n Moya as the new, temporary party leader.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, pp. 508-9 In April the 75-year-old Sanz was already recorded as active in Junta Central of a new, separate Mellista organization.Andr√©s Mart√≠n 2000, p. 165,Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 514, Oyarz√∫n 2008, p. 498, Sanz y Escart√≠n, Romualdo Ces√°reo entry, [in:] Gran Enciclopedia Navarra, vol.

The Hall of Four Heavenly Kings or Four Heavenly Kings Hall (), referred to as Hall of Heavenly Kings, is the first important hall inside shanmen (mount gate) in Chinese Pure Land Buddhist temples and Chan Buddhist temples and is named due to the Four Heavenly Kings statues enshrined in the hall. Maitreya Buddha is enshrined in the Hall of Heavenly King and at the back of his statue is a statue of Skanda Bodhisattva facing the northern Mahavira Hall. In Buddhism, the Maitreya Buddha, also the future Buddha is Sakyamuni's successor. In the history of Chinese Buddhism, Maitreya Buddha has the handsome image in which he wears coronet on his head and yingluo () on his body and his hands pose in mudras. According to ' (; Sung kao-seng chuan), in the Later Liang Dynasty (907-923), there was a fat and big-stomached monk named \\"Qici\\" () in Fenghua of Mingzhou (now Zhejiang). Carrying a sack on his shoulder, he always begged in the markets and streets, laughing. So local people called him \\"The Sack Monk\\" (). When he reached his Parinirvana, he left a Buddhist Gatha \\"Maitreya, the true Maitreya, has thousands of hundreds of millions of manifestations, often instructing people of their time, even when they themselves do not recognize him.\\" () So he was seen as the manifestation of Maitreya Buddha. Since then, in Chinese Buddhist temples, Maitreya statues were shaped into a big fat monk's image with a big head and ears, laughing with his upper body exposed and cross-legged. The Skanda Bodhisattva behind him is the Dharmapalass of Buddhist temples.

Burke and Jonathan Gibson; London, Ashgate, 2004; pp. 157-80. best known for her activities during the English Civil War. Origins She was born at Mereworth Castle in Kent, the fifth daughter of Francis Fane, 1st Earl of Westmorland by his wife Mary Mildmay, a daughter of Sir Anthony Mildmay of Apethorpe Hall in Northamptonshire, where Rachel grew up. Rachel's brother, Mildmay Fane, 2nd Earl of Westmorland, a poet and dramatist, was close to King Charles I, who became a godfather to Fane's son in 1635. Another of Rachel's brothers was Colonel George Fane, who also supported the Royalist cause. Youth In her youth Lady Rachel Fane wrote masques for performance at family entertainments.Marion O'Connor, 'Rachel Fane's May Masque at Apethorpe, 1627', English Literary Renaissance, vol. 36, No. 1 (Winter 2006), pp. 90-113 One of these was her \\"May Masque\\" of 1627. Marriages =First marriage= On 13 December 1638, at the age of 25, in the church of St Bartholomew the Great in the City of London, she married the 50 year-old Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath (1587-1654) of Tawstock Court in Devon. By 1642 during the Civil War he was active in the Royalist cause, and wrote to his wife from York and London about the progress of the War. In December 1642 the House of Lords ordered Thomas Browne to return the horses he had commandeered from the countess on behalf of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, the Parliamentary commander. She bore him no children, although in 1663 she became the guardian of her nephew, Sir Henry Fane (d.1706), the only child of her brother George Fane. Following Bourchier's death in 1654, Rachel commissioned a striking monument in his memory, which survives in the south aisle chapel of St Peter's Church, Tawstock. Opinions vary as to its artistic merit, with Hoskins (1954)Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954), p. 489 calling it \\"massive and ugly\\", while J. H. Marland deemed it \\"almost unequalled in singularity and absurdity\\". It is constructed in black and white marble, with four dogs supporting a sarcophogus on their shoulders with a black obelisk at each corner. =Second marriage= Six months after the earl's death, she married Lionel Cranfield, 3rd Earl of Middlesex (1625-1674) , who was 12 years her junior, a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King Charles II. The marriage was not a happy one and the couple lived apart from 1661 onwards. After Cranfield's death in 1674, Rachel did not remarry. Monuments The life-size white marble statue of Rachel Fane, sculpted by Balthasar Burman (son of Thomas Burman),Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.790 which survives in St Peter's Church, Tawstock, is a copy of the statue of Mary Cavendish (1556‚Äì1632) the wife of Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, sculpted in 1671 by Thomas Burman at the cost of her nephew William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle (1592-1676), which stands in a niche on the Shrewsbury Tower of the Second Court (which she partly financed) of St John's College, Cambridge.'St. John's College', in An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in the City of Cambridge (London, 1959), pp. 187-202 See images:File:St John's College Second Court, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg:File:St John's College, Cambridge, second court 04.JPG Sir Anthony van Dyck painted two portraits of Rachel, one prior to her first marriage, which survives, and another in 1641, for which she paid him ¬£20, of which only an engraving survives, by Pierre Lombart.

In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, John Apokaukos was Metropolitan of Naupaktos. In 1277 the sebastohypertatos John Apokaukos was a senior official. The family may have declined though at the end of the 13th century, since Nikephoros Gregoras maintains that the megas doux Alexios Apokaukos, one of the main figures of the Byzantine civil war of 1341‚Äì47, came from a humble family. Alexios promoted his relatives to high office: his eldest son John became megas primikerios and governor of Thessalonica, his second son Manuel was governor of Adrianople, and his three daughters received highly-placed husbands. With the end of the civil war in 1345, however, the family declined abruptly in importance. A George Apokaukos was \\"archon\\" at Constantinople in 1403, while at about the same time the painter Alexios Apokaukos, a friend of Joseph Bryennios, settled in Crete.

She was born on March 25, 1887 in Nanjanagudu of the erstwhile state of Mysore under British India. Her father, Venkatakrishna Iyengar, was a lawyer and her mother was Alamelamma. Like the Srivaishnavas of their time, her mother tongue was Tamil. She had a special predilection towards Kannada language which was the language of the city in which she lived. She knew Kannada, Tamil, and Telugu languages. Early life At the custom of her time when child marriage was common, Tirumalamba was married at the age of ten. At the age of fourteen, she felt bereavement for her husband. Retrieved 2016-8-4 Venkatakrishna Iyengar was a bibliophile who had a large heart, ensured that his daughter received the best of works that he read to his daughter. And so, books were their companions. Apart from Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavatha, they read plays named Nanjanagudu Srikanta Shastri, Bellave Somanathayya, M. Venkatadri Shastri and others widely. Without paying heed to her tragic personal life, reinforcing her inner self with reading books, Tirumalamba walked ahead in life and relentlessly worked towards solving problems of the world. Teacher In her spare time, Tirumalamba started teaching children from the cross borders of her house which over a period of time became a school in itself. Not only the children, but women from her neighborhood started learning from Tirumalamba after finishing their household chores as early as possible. Thus, her home came to be known as ‚ÄúMathru Mandira‚Äù. For her favorite students, Tirumalamba started a newspaper called ‚ÄúSanmargadarshini‚Äù. During the course of her studies, Tirumalmba had the habit of jotting down notes of her likings as a habit. Using the thoughts that came to her from her notes, Tirumalamba extended the range of ideas to drama, fiction, stories, and songs. Her ‚ÄúMathru Mandira‚Äù always provided an endearing audience for her writings. In this direction, Tirumalmba started writing more and more to deliver the much awaited audience. Writer Once a monthly magazine from Mysore called ‚ÄúMadhuravani‚Äù organized a story competition to which Tirumalamba sent in one of her stories. The editor of ‚ÄúMadhuravani‚Äù, Mr K. Hanuman came looking for the writer of such a wonderful story to Tirumalamba's house. There, he saw a treasure of several such beautiful pieces of writing. He found several stories, novels, plays, essays and a variety of articles in that house. He got influenced by a writing named ‚ÄúVidhava Kartavya‚Äù and published the same in ‚Äú Madhuravani‚Äù. In times of untouchable society where child marriage was rampant, and widowed women were secluded, Tirumalamba received criticisms from a lot of her counterparts. Undeterred in her precedent, Tirumalamba continued to do what she felt was right with confidence. To all of this, Tirumalamba had the blessings and best wishes of her father. In the near future, Tirumalamba started writing ‚ÄúSathi Hitaishini‚Äù, a publication house. Publisher From the publication house of ‚ÄúSathi Hitaishini‚Äù, Tirumalamba's first novel ‚ÄúSushile‚Äù was published on 1913. The book was so popular within a short time that it saw four editions, and sold more than 7000 copies. The ‚ÄúSathi Hitaishini‚Äù publication house did not only publish Tirumalamba's novels alone but superior books such as ‚ÄúSanmarga Granthavali‚Äù, ‚ÄúSanmarga Grantha Malika‚Äù, ‚ÄúNandini Granthamala‚Äù, (by Panyam Sundarashastri, Saraguru Venkata Varadacharya respectively), book that spoke about aims, and features called ‚ÄúScience of Decoration‚Äù (by Dr. S. N. Narasimhayya), books called ‚ÄúSuksmayurveda Chikitsa Prayoga‚Äù, ‚ÄúSarala Unipathi Chikisakata‚Äù (by Dr. Srinivas Murthy) were published. Tirumalamba possessed such a great attitude. During 1913-16 Tirumalamba's eleven books including ‚ÄúNabha‚Äù, ‚ÄúVidyullatha‚Äù, ‚ÄúHarina‚Äù were published. Not excluding stories, novels, short novels, detective novels, essays, poems, plays, the total number of books that Tirumalamba wrote was approximately 28. 1939 saw Tirumalamba write her last novel titled ‚ÄúManiMala‚Äù. Newspaper Editor Next, Tirumalamba started a monthly magazine called ‚ÄúKarnataka Nandini‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am a common woman with very less cognition who did not know the scent of knowledge. I do not have the sophistication of the urban civilization nor do I have a clue about the knowledge that the urban people seemed to possess, however, I do want to help the sorority as much as possible which is the idea that I cannot let go‚Äù were the words uttered by Tirumalamba who gave this special gift of monthly magazine to the woman kind. One of the writers who sent a poem to be published in ‚ÄúKarnataka Nandini‚Äù who died in the whirlpool was Udupi TulasiBai. Kademgodlu Shankara Bhattaru regularly sent some of his works to ‚ÄúKarnataka Nandini‚Äù. Within the magazine, there was a column called ‚ÄúKannada Rannagannadi‚Äù which was reserved for people who fought for Kannada. Tirumalamba invited educated women to contribute to ‚ÄúKarnataka Nandini‚Äù. Since there were very few writers whom you could count on your fingers, Tirumalamba herself assumed different pen names to fill the columns of the magazine. Owing to which, Tirumalamba could not sustain the magazine and had to shut down the magazine. Death and legacy In the meantime, her father's death shocked Tirumalamba immensely. Thus she turned more and more introverted and set her attention philosophical writing. Unable to write more, Tirumalamba's mind returned to silence. At the age of ninety five years on 31 August 1982, Tirumalamba died. Awards, Honours, Reception Literary works that came out of the publication house ‚ÄúSati hitaisini‚Äù such as ‚ÄúMatrunandini‚Äù, ‚ÄúChandravadana‚Äù, ‚ÄúRamanand‚Äù received prize from the Madras School Book and Literature Society. Karnataka's Vidyavardhaka Sangha honored the works ‚ÄúRamananda‚Äù and ‚ÄúPurnakala‚Äù. Mysore, Madras, Bombay governments rewarded several works of Tirumalamba. In the year 1980, the Rajya Sahitya Academy honored Tirumalamba. Since 1917, for almost two decades, Tirumalamba's works became text books in schools of Madras, Mysore, and Bombay states. Tirumalamba Award To immortalize Tirumalamba, C. N. Mangala founded the ‚ÄúShaswathi‚Äù institution that confers ‚Äú Tirumalamba Award‚Äù to one of the good woman writers.

Lamoine is located northeast of Waterville on Road 8 NW. Today it consists of a few dryland wheat farms with about 8 or so residents. History Before Lamoine received its name, the town of Arup, Washington, was platted and filed on Nov. 20, 1905, by the immigrant farmer Nels P. Nelson (1861‚Äì1935). On January 3, 1906 the formation of the Town Site Arup was approved by the Board of County Commissioners of Douglas County, Wash. Arup was named after Aarup (spelled with two As), a town near Skydebjerg, Denmark, where he was born. Nelson was anticipating the railroad's running through the newly formed Arup, but in 1909 the Great Northern Railway bypassed it and went through Withrow instead. That sealed the town‚Äôs fate, and like many upstart towns during the early 1900s, Arup was never around long enough to build a future. Sometime between 1906 and 1909, the name of Arup disappears from records, and the name Lamoine starts being used. Why the name Arup was not kept is unclear. The story of Lamoine's receiving its name was written and posted in the Withrow Banner by the paper‚Äôs publisher, W. H. Murray: Lamoine once featured a school, a church, a post office, a dance hall, a hardware store, a blacksmith shop, feed store, and even a baseball team. The post office of Lamoine was established in 1906 and remained in operation until 1910. Some of the original family names that homestead this area during the late 1800s were Lanphere, Jensen, Cunningham, Preugschat, Nelson, Schmidt, Fletcher, and Moore.

Her works deal with the interplay of Christianity with indigenous beliefs and the difficulties of her own life. Before her mother died from tuberculosis she was adopted by a white couple where she faced prejudice among whites. Her experience with alcoholism and as a victim of prejudice and child abuse is expressed in the theme of struggle and healing in her work. She started her working career as a legal secretary and began writing around age 50 when she was a contributor to the Native American Renaissance. She eventually owned her own stenography business, which she lost while battling cancer. Her final years were spent in a poor, inner-city neighborhood in San Francisco, where she co-founded the Tenderloin Women Writers Workshop. She lived in San Francisco until her death in 1994.  Early life  Mary TallMountain was born on June 19, 1918 in Nulato, Alaska, to a mother of Russian and Native American heritage, and a father of Irish-Scottish descent, who was an American soldier. She was born to the Athabascan tribe, which is believed to be one of the original tribes that came over to Alaska via land bridge from Asia. Mary also had a brother two years younger than her. Tallmountain's mother had Tuberculosis when she had both her children, and decided to give them both up for adoption, knowing she would inevitably die from TB; so that her children would hopefully have a future free from TB. Because of a decision by the village council, Tallmountain's younger brother stayed, and she was given to the government doctors white family, the Randles. She and her adoptive family moved to Oregon. This transition was very traumatic for Tallmountain as she was taken from her native land, people, language, and culture. Her adoptive father was abusive, and molested her. She was not allowed to speak her native tongue, and was bullied by the white school children she attended school with. When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s, she and her adoptive family became poor immigrant workers and moved to Portland, Oregon. And shortly after Tallmountain graduated high school, he died of heart failure. When Tallmountan was 19 she married Dal Roberts, who died after only three years of marriage. Later, her adoptive mother, in 1945, suffering from Parkinson's and Diabetes, committed suicide. Tallmountain then left Portland, Oregon, and went to Reno, Nevada to pursue a career of a legal secretary.  Career  After TallMountain moved to Reno, Nevada and trained and worked as a legal secretary she began to drink to deal with her struggles in the past. After taking into account the damage all the alcohol was doing to her body she quit drinking and started her own stenography business. She was then diagnosed with cancer in 1968, while she overcame this, she lost her business. After losing her business she moved to the \\"Tenderloin\\", then a lower income neighborhood of San Francisco. She began to keep a journal, as her adoptive mother had her do when she was a child. After she started receiving a disability pension she was able to teach, write, do readings, and follow her true passion: writing. She published works such as \\"Nine Poems,\\" and \\"Good Grease.\\" Much of her work follows the themes of spirituality of Native and Christian though, and our connectedness to nature. TallMountain writes \\"Coyotes' Desert Lament,\\" where the narrator becomes a coyote, exploring Native thought how all creatures and people are connected. \\"Suddenly I am coyote too, Nose a wet black tremble. Hound and I bunch together Among warm grey bodies Calling our brother home.\\" She was diagnosed with cancer a second time in 1978, then when she went into remission she located her biological father. He was also battling cancer, living in Phoenix, Arizona, and spent the last few years of his life with her.  Late Life  TallMountain was located by an Alaskan poet and given a grant to travel and teach to local schools, communities, and prisons. Then in 1987 she co-founded the Tenderloin Women Writers Workshop, to support local women in expressing themselves through literature. She suffered a stroke in 1992, which left her with aphasia, the inability to express or understand language. She then stopped doing any readings or teaching, but continued to write until her death on September 2, 1994. Her work titled \\"Listen To The Night\\" was published in 1995 by Freedom Voices. After her death a memorial organization dedicated to preserving her literary works and advancing the causes she championed was created by the Tenderloin Reflection and Education Center (TREC) a non-profit organization with which she had a long association.

The Umayyads, under the governor of Khurasan, Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri, managed to surprise and defeat the T√ºrgesh khagan, Suluk, and his ally, the Arab renegade al-Harith ibn Surayj. The Arab armies of the Umayyad Caliphate had conquered most of Transoxiana in the early years of the 8th century, as part of the Muslim conquests. From , Umayyad rule was increasingly challenged by attacks from the Turkic T√ºrgesh nomads from the north, and revolts of the native princes of Transoxiana. After a major defeat in the Battle of the Defile in 731, the Umayyads lost control over most of Transoxiana, while in 734‚Äì736 al-Harith ibn Surayj led a major rebellion against the Caliphate's governors in Khurasan itself. The appointment of the veteran Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri brought about the defeat of Ibn Surayj, but in 737 Asad's attempt to restore Umayyad control over Khuttal ended in a debacle when the T√ºrgesh attacked his army. Although Asad managed to save most of his force, he suffered heavy losses, and lost his most of his army's baggage train and its escort in the Battle of the Baggage on 30 September. Asad withdrew to Balkh, leaving the field to the T√ºrgesh. While the Arab army demobilized and returned to their homes for winter, the T√ºrgesh ruler Suluk, now advised by Ibn Surayj, launched an invasion of Lower Tokharistan. This left Asad with far fewer men to confront the T√ºrgesh invasion, but when the T√ºrgesh ruler dispersed his army to raid and gather forage, Asad seized the opportunity to confront him. With 7,000 men he surprised Suluk, who had only about 4,000 troops with him, and defeated him near Kharistan. The T√ºrgesh ruler and Ibn Surayj managed to flee, but his camp fell into Arab hands, and most of the roaming bands of the T√ºrgesh army were destroyed. This unexpected victory shored up the threatened Umayyad position in Khurasan, while diminishing the prestige of Suluk, who fell victim to inter-T√ºrgesh rivalries in early 738. Asad's successor Nasr ibn Sayyar was able to use the collapse of T√ºrgesh power, and by had restored the Arab position in Transoxiana almost to what it had been before the T√ºrgesh intervention. Background The region of Transoxiana (Arabic: Ma wara' al- nahr) had been conquered by the Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate under Qutayba ibn Muslim in 705‚Äì715, following the Muslim conquest of Persia and of Khurasan in the mid-7th century. The loyalty of Transoxiana's native Iranian and Turkic populations to the Umayyads remained questionable, however, and in 719 the various Transoxianian princes sent a petition to the Chinese court and their T√ºrgesh vassals for military aid against the Caliphate's governors. In response, from the T√ºrgesh launched a series of attacks against the Umayyads in Transoxiana, coupled with uprisings among the native Sogdians. The Umayyad governors initially managed to suppress the unrest, but control over the Ferghana Valley was lost and in 724 the Arabs suffered a major disaster (the \\"Day of Thirst\\") while trying to recapture it. The Umayyad government made some half-hearted attempts to placate the local population and win the support of local elites, but in 728 a large-scale uprising broke out. With T√ºrgesh aid, the Umayyad garrisons were evicted, and the Caliphate lost most of Transoxiana except for the region around Samarkand. The Umayyads suffered another major defeat in the Battle of the Defile in 731, after which Samarkand too was lost. The Sogdians under Ghurak regained their independence, while Muslim military activity north of the Oxus River was severely curtailed, with the Umayyads focusing their efforts at keeping control of the principalities of Tokharistan in the upper Oxus valley. In addition, the Umayyad authorities were preoccupied by the rebellion of al-Harith ibn Surayj in Khurasan itself. The revolt broke out in early 734, spread quickly across the province and gathered the support of a large portion of the indigenous Iranian population. At one point, the rebel army even threatened the provincial capital, Marw. The arrival of the experienced Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri, who had served as governor of Khurasan in 724‚Äì727 and now brought with him 20,000 veteran and loyal Syrian troops, managed to reverse the tide and suppress Ibn Surayj's revolt, although the rebel leader himself managed to escape. In 737, Asad launched a campaign into the principality of Khuttal, whose rulers had supported the T√ºrgesh and Ibn Surayj's rebellion. Asad was initially successful, but the Khuttalans called on the T√ºrgesh for aid. The T√ºrgesh khagan Suluk led some 50,000 of his men south in response. Asad received very little notice of this, and at the approach of the T√ºrgesh the Umayyad army panicked and fled headlong to the Oxus. Amidst much confusion, and with the T√ºrgesh on their heels, the Umayyad troops managed to cross the river. They were followed, however, by the T√ºrgesh, who attacked the Umayyads in their camp. On the next day, 30 September, the T√ºrgesh found and captured the Umayyad baggage train and annihilated the Umayyads' allied contingent from al- Saghaniyan, which Asad had sent off ahead, in the so-called \\"Battle of the Baggage\\". Battle The campaign had been a disaster for Asad and his now mainly Syrian army; Umayyad control north of the Oxus had collapsed entirely, and while the governor had been able to escape complete destruction, he had suffered considerable casualties. Asad led his troops back to Balkh, but the T√ºrgesh remained in Tokharistan, where they were joined by Ibn Surayj. As the Arabs customarily did not campaign during winter, Asad demobilized his men. On Ibn Surayj's urging, on the other hand, the T√ºrgesh khagan decided to launch a winter attack into Lower Tokharistan, hoping to raise the local population in revolt against the Umayyads. In this he was joined not only by Ibn Surayj and his followers, but by most of the native princes of Sogdiana and Tokharistan. Asad was apprised of this on the evening of 7 December, when messages arrived at Balkh that the T√ºrgesh and their allies, some 30,000 strong, were at the nearby fortress of Jazzah. Asad ordered signal fires to be lit and mobilized his Syrian troops, although he had to pay each man twenty dirhams to persuade them to fight. Asad initially refused to call upon the help of the local Khurasani Arabs, indicating the level of mistrust existing by now between the latter and the representatives of the Umayyad regime; in the end, however, he relented, and gathered a force of 7,000 men. In the meantime, Suluk attacked Khulm, but after being repelled marched on to Peroz Nakhsher/Peroz Bakhshin. Bypassing Balkh, the T√ºrgesh seized the capital of Juzjan, and then dispersed and sent out mounted raiding parties in all directions, with some reaching as far as Marw al-Rudh, some south and east of Balkh. This was possibly done in search of forage, since such a large army could not otherwise be sustained during the winter. Against the expectations of Ibn Surayj, however, the ruler of Juzjan elected to side with Asad, who, informed of these events by the governor of Khulm, set out to engage the T√ºrgesh. The account in al-Tabari of the ensuing battle is confused and, according to the Orientalist H. A. R. Gibb, \\"shows the marks of rehandling\\", but it appears that Asad managed to surprise the T√ºrgesh ruler and Ibn Surayj near Kharistan. According to al- Tabari, Asad learned of the dispersal of the T√ºrgesh army when his advance guard, 300 cavalry under Mansur ibn Salim al-Bajali, encountered a T√ºrgesh reconnaissance party of equal size, defeated it, and took a few T√ºrgesh prisoner. Asad then marched on, encamping first in the village of al-Sidrah, then at Kharistan, until he finally reached a site some two farsakhs‚Äîroughly ‚Äîfrom the capital of Juzjan. According to the report of Amr ibn Musa, relayed by al-Tabari, Asad gave command of his battle line to al-Qasim ibn Bukhayt al- Muraghi. The latter placed the Azdi and Tamimi tribal contingents, as well as the ruler of Juzjan and his personal retinue (shakiriyya) and the contingents of the Syrian districts of Filastin (under Mus'ab ibn Amr al-Khuza'i) and Qinnasrin (under Maghra ibn Ahmar al-Numayri) on the right, while the left was held by the Rabi'ah tribe (under Yahya ibn Hudayn) and the contingent of the districts of Homs (under Ja'far ibn Hanzalah al-Bahrani) and Jordan (under Sulayman ibn Amr al-Muqri). Mansur al-Bajali commanded the vanguard as before, reinforced by the troops of the district of Damascus (under Hamlah ibn Nu'aym al-Kalbi) and the personal retinue of Asad. The khagan, who had only 4,000 of his men with him, placed Ibn Surayj and his followers on the right, while the rest of his force consisted of his T√ºrgesh and of contingents from the princes of Transoxiana‚Äîal-Tabari implies they were there in person, but this is unlikely‚Äîincluding the rulers of Sughd, Shash (Tashkent), Usrushana, Khuttal, and the Jabghu of Tokharistan. In the ensuing clash, the T√ºrgesh right under Ibn Surayj was victorious, reportedly reaching Asad's tent. However, after the Arabs attacked from the rear‚Äîreportedly on the suggestion of the ruler of Juzjan‚Äîthe T√ºrgesh and their allies broke and fled. In their flight, the T√ºrgesh abandoned their encampment with their women, including the wife of the khaghan; she was stabbed by a eunuch servant to prevent her from being taken captive. The Umayyads also recovered the enormous spoils taken by the T√ºrgesh, including 155,000 sheep, \\"every kind of silver vessel\\", and many Muslim captives. Suluk barely managed to escape, as his horse got stuck in the mud. Fortunately for him, the Muslims did not recognize him, and he was rescued by Ibn Surayj. Asad divided the spoils among his men, sending the captive T√ºrgesh women to the local Iranian landed nobility, the dehgans. He remained at the site of his victory for five days, before returning to Balkh, nine days after his departure. From there he set out for Jazzah, where the khagan had fled. Suluk fled before the Umayyad pursuit, but the Arabs were soon hampered by heavy rain and snow, allowing the khagan and Ibn Surayj to escape to Upper Tokharistan, whence they moved on to Usrushana. The T√ºrgesh raiding parties left behind in Khurasan were captured or destroyed one by one by Asad and his officers, and only a few Sogdians managed to escape back across the Oxus. Aftermath Asad's resolution in confronting the khagan, and the wise strategic choice of making Balkh his residence, paid off, and allowed him to salvage a situation that, in the wake of several defeats at the hands of the T√ºrgesh, had appeared seemingly hopeless‚Äîindeed, the Umayyad caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (), is said to have been incredulous at the first news of Asad's victory. The victory at Kharistan consolidated the Arab position in Khurasan, and particularly in Tokharistan, where the remaining loyal native rulers would certainly have gone over to the T√ºrgesh if the latter had won or remained unopposed. Conversely the defeat diminished the prestige of Suluk, and may possibly have played a role in his assassination early in 738, although rivalries between the T√ºrgesh, fanned by the Chinese court, were more directly responsible for this. The T√ºrgesh khaganate then collapsed into infighting, and stopped being a serious threat to Umayyad interests in the area. As a result, the Battle of Kharistan is considered a turning point for Muslim fortunes in Central Asia. Under Asad's successor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, the Umayyad armies recovered most of Transoxiana by , and with the Battle of Talas in 751 and the turmoil of the An Shi Rebellion, which terminated Chinese influence in Central Asia, Muslim dominance in the region was secured. Nevertheless, the losses suffered by the Syrians under Asad's command in the 737 campaign in Khuttal were of particularly grave importance in the long term, as the Syrian army was the main pillar of the Umayyad regime. Its numerical decline in Khurasan meant that the Khurasan-born Arabs could no longer be completely controlled by force; this opened the way not only for the appointment of a native Khurasani Arab governor in the person of Nasr ibn Sayyar, but also, eventually, for the outbreak of the Abbasid Revolution that toppled the Umayyad regime.

In the early 1960s American-style tenpin bowling alleys became popular in the UK. In 1962 a bowling alley and restaurant was built west of the Empire Pool. The Stadium Bowl boasted 24 bowling lanes. The name Starlight for the restaurant was probably inspired by the Starlight Dance held in the neighbouring Empire Pool on 17 October 1959, which was one of the first popular music events held at Wembley. Tenpin bowling competitions were held at the Stadium Bowl, some reported on Path√© newsreels. One of these was the London International Matchplay tournament, which ran at Wembley from 1962 to 1972, before moving to the Airport Bowl in 1973.

It is sometimes called Dvi Pada Sirsasana, but that name describes the balancing form of the pose. In hatha yoga, the pose, Pasini Mudra, was a mudra, a seal to prevent the escape of prana, not an asana. Etymology and origins as a mudra Vishnu asleep on Ananta. Deogarh Temple, Dasavatara The name of this pose comes from ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‚Äã yoga meaning \\"uniting\\", ‡§®‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞ nidra meaning \\"sleep\\", and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÅsana meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The asana's name derives from the yogic sleep mentioned in the Hindu epic Mahabharata: Yoganidrasana is described in the 17th century Ha·π≠ha RatnƒÅvalƒ´ 3.70. The pose is illustrated in an 18th century painting of the 8 yoga chakras in Mysore. The pose is illustrated as \\"Pasini Mudra\\" (not an asana) in Theos Bernard's 1943 book Hatha Yoga: The Report of A Personal Experience. Pasini Mudra is described in the Gheranda Samhita 3.84: \\"Throw the two legs on the neck towards the back, holding them strongly together like a noose (Pa≈õa). This is called Pa≈õini Mudra; it awakens the Shakti (Kundalini).\\" The pose appears as an asana in the 20th century in works such as the 1966 Light on Yoga. Description In Yoganidrasana, the back is on the ground, the feet are crossed behind the head, and the arms are wrapped around the legs and body, the hands clasped behind the lower back. The effect is of a strong forward bend; B. K. S. Iyengar rates its difficulty as 18 out of 60. The practice is said to warm the body rapidly. In Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, the pose is in the intermediate series. In Sivananda Yoga, as described by Vishnudevananda Saraswati, the pose is named \\"Dwipada Sirasan\\" (sic) and \\"head-knee pose\\"; other authors treat Dvi Pada Sirsasana and Janusirsasana as quite different poses. In literature The pose appears in Barbara Henning's 2005 novel You, Me and the Insects, where the protagonist travels to India to study with a meditation and hatha yoga master.

She was the subject of Cohen's 1967 track \\"So Long, Marianne\\", in which he sang that she \\"held on to me like I was a crucifix as we went kneeling through the dark\\".  Early life  Ihlen was born on 18 May 1935 in Larkollen, Norway, and was raised in Oslo. She was the creative one of her family and wanted to become an actress. Her parents were opposed to that career choice; she lost courage and did not pursue that path but ran away.  Relationships with Axel Jensen and Leonard Cohen  She fell in love with Norwegian writer Axel Jensen when they were both teenagers. They married, against her parents' wishes. The pair left for the Greek island of Hydra in 1958, where Jensen, already a poet and novelist, was going to write. There, they had a son, Axel Jr., and, she said, she became Jensen's \\"Greek muse\\"; she sat at his feet while he wrote and she carried the groceries up from the harbour to their home. Their home was simple with an outside toilet and electricity for only one hour in the evening and one hour in the morning. Otherwise, they used paraffin lamps. Jensen abandoned Marianne, and their son, to live with another woman. According to Marianne, she met Cohen, for the first time, shortly after she returned from a trip to Norway, only to learn her husband had abandoned her. After they met in early 1960, Cohen and Ihlen began living together on Hydra; later that year, Cohen drove her to Oslo where she finalized her divorce from Jensen. For the next few years, Ihlen became Cohen's muse, inspiring him to write several songs on his first two albums, Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967) and Songs from a Room (1969). The back sleeve of Songs from a Room features a famous photograph of her at Cohen's typewriter, draped in a white towel in their simple home in Greece. The song \\"Moving On\\" from Cohen's posthumous 2019 album Thanks for the Dance is also a tribute to Marianne. Lindsay Zoladz, \\"A Last Dance for Leonard Cohen\\", New York Times, 19 November 2019 From a window in that home, Ihlen once saw a bird perched on a newly installed telephone wire and remarked to Cohen that they looked like musical notes; she suggested he write a song about it. Bird on the Wire was the result, one of his most successful songs, with the opening lines: Like a bird on the wire, Like a drunk in a midnight choir, I have tried, in my way, to be free.  Later life  Ihlen married Jan Stang in 1979, worked in the oil industry, and lived in Oslo. She developed an interest in Tibetan Buddhism and spent time painting.  Illness and death  She was diagnosed with leukemia in late July 2016. Her close friend Jan Christian Mollestad contacted Cohen to tell him Ihlen was dying. Leonard Cohen penned a poignant final letter to her, which is often misquoted by the media and others. However, the widely circulated version of the letter was based on an inaccurate verbal recollection by Mollestad which was then transcribed in a radio interview. The actual letter (actually an email) obtained through the Leonard Cohen estate reads: She died aged 81 on 28 July 2016, in Oslo. Cohen died later that year on 7 November 2016.  Legacy  , an award-winning Norwegian journalist, won the 2006 Prix Europa for her 2005 radio documentary about Ihlen. In 2008, Hesthamar published her biography of Ihlen, So Long, Marianne. Ei Kj√¶rleikshistorie; ECW Press published the English translation So Long, Marianne: A Love Story in 2014. In 2014, in a review of Lana Del Rey's third album, Ultraviolence, Alexandra Molotkow compared Del Rey's persona of surrender to Ihlen's account of her search for independence. Molotkow described Del Rey as an artist, fully in control of her career, who, paradoxically, had chosen a performing persona as a weak and helpless female, who sought to surrender to powerful men. According to Molotkow, who had just read Hesthamar's recently translated biography of Ihlen, even though Ihlen had the reality of the fantasy Del Rey shows in her videos, of the woman socially and economically reliant on a man, Ihlen has described how she became fully independent. According to Molotkow, Hesthamar's book is \\"the story of a remarkable woman who was a muse ‚Äì who has, until now, appeared in history as a man‚Äôs idea ‚Äì and how she found herself. Often, the book reads as a caution against giving up your power.\\" Her life and relationship with Cohen was depicted in the 2019 documentary film Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love.

The pottery allowed for the identification of the Yayoi period and its primary features such as agriculture and social structure.  History  Distinguishing characteristics of the Yayoi period include the appearance of new pottery styles that distinguishes it from the earlier J≈çmon pottery. A point of difference is evident in the way Yayoi pottery is technically superior but artistically less advanced due to the way J≈çmon pottery featured greater freedom of design and more variety of shape. The Yayoi pottery is believed to be traded with a former island native to Japan, but wasn't successful due to war in spiritual beliefs. It was followed by the Haji pottery of the Kofun period. There are accounts that cited a relationship between Yayoi pottery and the pseudo- Korean-style Late Mumun pottery.

Fairbank was responsible for some of the earliest translations of hymns into Marathi. He also worked on a number of initiatives to improve agriculture. His children and several relatives continued to work as missionaries in India. Trochalopteron fairbanki, a bird, Fairbankia and Achatina fairbanki, molluscs are named after him. Biography Samuel was born in Stamford, Connecticut, the eldest son of John Barnard Fairbank, principal of a school. The family later moved to Massachusetts where they manufactured straw hats. Fairbank studied at Illinois earning an A.B. in 1842 and an A.M. in 1845 followed by studies at the Andover Theological Seminary. He was ordained D.D. in 1845. Shortly after marrying Abbey Allen (died 1852), the couple moved to India to join the American Marathi Mission in western India. His work was mainly at Ahmednagar (1846 to 1850 and again from 1871 to 1879), Bombay (1850 to 1857), Wadala (1857 to 1871) and from 1889 at Kodaikanai in South India. Fairbank had a camp on the ridge at Prospect Point in Kodaikanal. He visited the United States on three furloughs. Trochalopteron fairbanki from the Palnis Fairbank spent much of his time on evangelism through working with the local people. He taught agriculture and attempted to introduce more efficient practices and implements. He was also into music, translating hymns and transcribing them to make it suitable for local use, composing songs and teaching communities. In his spare time, he also took an interest in natural history, making collections of molluscs, birds and plants. He also made studies of some molluscs in life. He wrote notes in the Gazetteer on natural history and his publications on the topic included a \\"Key to the Natural Orders of Plants in the Bombay Presidency\\", \\"Popular list of birds of the Bombay Presidency with Notes\\", \\"A list of the Birds of the Palani Hills, with Notes\\", \\"List of the Reptiles of the Bombay Presidency, with Notes\\" and \\"list of the Deccan fishes, with notes\\". He collaborated with other naturalists including William Thomas Blanford who named a genus of a mollusc Fairbankia after him although it is now a synonym of Iravadia. Achatina fairbanki was named after him by William Henry Benson. Blanford also named Trochalopteron fairbanki after a specimen collected by Fairbank from Kodaikanal. He also corresponded on birds with Allan Octavian Hume. A set of fern specimens collected by Fairbank reside in the Pringle Herbarium (VT), at the University of Vermont. The fern species Lastrea fairbankii was named after him by R.H. Beddome in 1867. Map of the Palani hills where Fairbank collected plants and animal specimens With Abbey he had three children, two of whom died young; a daughter, Emily Maria married Rev. Thomas Snell Smith of Sri Lanka while Mary Crocker and John Melvin died young. After the death of Abbey in 1852, Fairbank married Mary Ballantine in 1856 (she died in 1878). They had daughters Anna (married Robert M. Woods), Katie (married Robert Allen Hume), Elizabeth (married William Walter Hastings), Rose (born 1874, married Dr Lester H. Beals), Mary Darling (a missionary who married T. A. Evans) and Grace (married H.M. Burr); sons Henry (born 1862) and Edward (born 1867) who became missionaries. Henry was also interested in ornithology and wrote Birds of Mahabaleshwar (1921); two sons Melvin and James died young. Edward along with his wife Marie Lively established the James Friendship Memorial Hospital at Vadala in 1938. It is also known as the Fairbank James Friendship Memorial Hospital. Rose and her husband Dr Lester Beals established the Willis F. Pierce Memorial Hospital in Wai, Satara District. Samuel Fairbank died, possibly of heat stroke, while on a train to Kodaikanal on May 31, 1898. He was buried at Ahmednagar.

Andy Neiderreiter, Joe Sarno, and Paddy Roche served as his managers during his career. Early career Sullivan was born on May 21, 1897 in Brooklyn, New York and resided there most of his life. He fought almost exclusively in the Brooklyn area from 1911-1914, though some of his earliest fights are not well documented by BoxRec. One source placed his earliest bouts around 1907-8. Taking some time to gain prominence, he won a ten round newspaper decision against well rated Jewish New York boxer Frankie Callahan at the Broadway arena in Brooklyn on January 22, 1916. Callahan would fight five world champions in his short life, including being credited with a win against future world lightweight champion Benny Leonard the following year.Callahan fought five world champions in Silver, Mike, Stars in the Ring, (2016), Rowman and Littlefield, Guilford, Connecticut, pg. 37 Sullivan fought Vincent \\"Pepper\\" Martin for the first time on April 1, 1916, at the Broadway Sports Club in Brooklyn, winning in a fourth round knockout. He would fight Martin again on August 7, 1923 in Queens, New York, winning in an eighth round disqualification. Ramping up to the World Jr. Lightweight Championship He fought the highly rated Sammy Sieger on January 22, 1923, at the Broadway Arena in Brooklyn, New York, losing in a twelve round points decision. That Spring he would meet Charles \\"Dutch\\" Brandt twice, once on March 8, and once on May 5 of 1923, winning in a twelve round points decision and then achieving a twelve round draw. Both Sieger and Brandt were well known, well rated boxers of his era. On December 17, 1923 he defeated Babe Herman at Madison Square Garden in an eighth round decision. Herman was unable to continue the fight after receiving a broken rib in the eighth, and had to be carried from the ring. Taking the World Jr. Lightweight Title from Johnny Dundee Johnny Dundee Sullivan took the World Jr. Lightweight Title against reigning champion Johnny Dundee on June 20, 1924, at the Henderson Bowl in Brooklyn, New York, in a ten round points decision. At 27, he achieved his most important victory in his hometown, and at an age when many boxers are at their peak of skill and physical conditioning. On August 18, 1924, he defended his title against Vincent \\"Pepper\\" Martin in a fifteen round points decision at the Queens Athletic Club in Queens, New York.

The Evening News wrote that \\"Sullivan finished his man with sickening quickness...He (Ballerino) crumpled horribly...\\"\\"Sullivan Stops Mike Ballarino\\", Evening News, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, pg. 20, 16 October 1924 Their return match, only a month later would demonstrate that Ballerino was still capable of showing his best skills.

Had he not completed the full ten rounds, he could have lost the fight and the title. In a World Jr. Lightweight rematch on April Fools day in 1925, he lost a Unanimous Decision to his frequent rival Mike Ballerino at the Armory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in a bout that went the full ten rounds.

History A small rural sanctuary was present at the site. However, the present structure mainly results from the obsession of a former military chaplain, don Adamo Accosa, who wished to literally create a temple from the ruins left after World War II and other conflicts, as a way to promote convivencia (more akin to common living in English), or confraternity, among humanity. Starting in 1951-1952, he began to request fragments and remnants of the prior war to embellish as spolia for the church. In this goal, he was aided and encouraged by the Apostolic Nunzio Monsignor Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII), who provided him with stones from an altar from a church near Coutances, fragmented during the battle of Normandy in 1944. Other such fragments have been collected from throughout Europe and other sites in the world. The baptismal font is built from the remnants of a cannon turret in the naval ship Andrea Doria. A crucifix is made from rifles and pistols. The pulpit is made from portions of a British landing craft. However, much of the grounds awkwardly garners the appearance of military museum with displays of uniforms, weapons, and military machinery, rather than a sanctuary dedicated to the abhorrence of war.

Biography He was born into a musical family in Budapest, his father Bernard Ney and his cousin, David Ney, were members of the Opera in Budapest. Tibor Ney entered the Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied violin with Joseph Bloch and N√°ndor Zsolt, later his master was Jeno Hubay in his masterclass, where he had finished his violin studies receiving his diploma in 1926. From 1926, he was a member of the orchestra of the Hungarian State Opera in Budapest, but he tried to continue his career abroad, playing in the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler. Coming back to Hungary in 1932, he became the concertmaster of the Hungarian Radio Symphony Orchestra of which principal conductor was Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi (the orchestra was known as the Hungarian Symphony Orchestra outside Hungary, adopted the name Hungarian Radio Symphony Orchestra just later). In May 1944, Dohn√°nyi disbanded his ensemble, in 1945, Tibor Ney became once again the concertmaster of the reorganized Hungarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, a post he held until 1966.

Ney was appointed the professor of the violin at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music (1960‚Äì1974). After retiring from the concert stage, he edited several works of Paganini, G. Tartini and Pietro Nardini published by Editio Musica, Budapest, and Schott Music. Gy√∂gy Lehel, Hungarian conductor commemorates about him with these words: \\"he was a musician from a family, which had been enriched the music culture of our country since David Ney.

Biography John IX was born on 29 August 1524 in Thalheim, Saxony in the Ore Mountains of Saxony. He came from the Haugwitz family, who held several high clerical offices. He was the last bishop of the Bishopric of Meissen, which became a Protestant diocese in the wake of the Protestant Reformation. On his appointment, relatives of his predecessor began a feud over the inheritance of the episcopal estate. The so-called Pig War or Saukrieg lasted 3 years before it was resolved by Elector Augustus. He signed the Formula of Concord in 1577 and the Book of Concord in 1580.Irene Dingel (ed.) (2014). Die Bekenntnisschriften der Evangelisch-Lutherischen Kirche Fully revised edition. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen, , pp. 15 and 762. In 1581, the bishop resigned from his office and converted to the Protestant faith. In 1559, he appointed Johann Leisentrit as the Administrator of the remaining Roman Catholic areas. In 1582 he married his considerably younger niece, Agnes. After John's death, she married the Electoral Saxon Advisor (Rat) and Amtmann of Stolpen, Hans Georg von Wehse, and had four daughters from that marriage. Agnes was the heiress of the episcopal estate. John IX died in M√ºgeln on 26 March 1595; his gravestone is in the town church of Neu- M√ºgeln.

It features Varun Tej and Sai Pallavi in the lead roles which marks the latter's debut in Telugu cinema. Principal photography commenced in August 2016. The film won four Filmfare Awards from 9 nominations. Sai Pallavi‚Äôs performance was ranked by Film Companion in 100 Greatest Performances of the Decade. Plot Varun is a non-resident Indian who lives in Texas, United States of America with his elder brother Raju and adopted, younger brother Bujji. He is a medical student aiming to become a neurosurgeon. Varun comes to India along with his younger brother for Raju's marriage to Renuka, whose family hails from Banswada in Telangana. There he meets Bhanumathi, Renuka's younger sister. Bhanu is a beautiful and naughty girl who doesn't want to feel secondary to anyone. Gradually Varun and Bhanu develop a liking for each other but don't express it. Bhanu loves her father very dearly and doesn't believe in leaving him after her marriage. One day, she overhears Varun talking to his cousin Shailu about the opportunities in USA compared to India which he deems unfit for settling. Worse, his reference to a marriage between Shailu and her boyfriend is misconstrued by Bhanu as being between Varun and Shailu and so she feels cheated and misled by Varun. Heartbroken, Bhanu decides to forget Varun and kill her feelings for him and starts to ignore him. After his brother's marriage, Varun returns to USA but can't stop thinking about Bhanu all the time. He decides to confess his love to her. But Bhanumathi gives him a rude answer which enrages Varun creating a rift between them that widens further due to subsequent rude behaviors from both of them. Bhanu finally agrees to marry a man of her father's choice but realizes she isn't comfortable with him even before marriage. Meanwhile, Renuka becomes pregnant and is advised bed rest by the doctors. Bhanu is sent to USA by her father to help Renuka cope up with the pregnancy. Varun starts being inconsiderate towards Bhanu during her stay with them. This disturbs Bhanu and an argument ensues between them after which she decides to leave for India in a week. Before leaving, Bhanu decides to visit her friend in USA and Varun is asked to drop Bhanu at her friend's place. On the way when Varun drops her at a bus stop so she can take a bus, both have their final fight. Realizing he has hurt her, Varun makes amends and confesses to Bhanu how deeply he loves her and cannot imagine his life with anyone else and that his bad behavior towards her was but a dirty mask to try and get rid of, albeit unsuccessfully, his feelings for her, but since he seeks her happiness, will respect and value her going forward. They then decide to stay as friends and he offers to show her America. It is during this cross-country USA roadtrip that Bhanu realizes how deep Varun's love for her is and she also rediscovers her own deep feelings for him. Before leaving for India, at the airport, Bhanu runs to Varun and hugs him with tearful eyes. Varun understands that Bhanu still loves him and a few days later goes to India to ask for her hand in marriage. Bhanu's father who comes to know of their feelings for each other, advises her to follow her heart and marry Varun instead of the man he chose to which she agrees. Though happy that she is marrying Varun, she is apprehensive about leaving her father and her village. After the wedding ceremony, Bhanu starts packing her luggage to leave for the USA. Renuka then tells her the truth that Varun actually gave up his life in the US and his medical seat and has decided to settle and practice as a Doctor in their village. Overjoyed, Bhanu runs to Varun and asks him how he could make such a big sacrifice to which he answers that where ever she is, it is his world because he loves her a lot. Varun decides to establish a hospital in the village and they live happily ever after.

Critical reception *Times Of India gave it three stars and wrote, \\"The plot line is too flimsy and simplistic; the climax is also a la Anand. The cinematography is flawless and the frames have a rich visual appeal. The music is in line with Shekhar Kammula‚Äôs earlier films and although there‚Äôs nothing special about the songs, they‚Äôre not harsh on the ear either. The movie is absolutely bereft of any vulgarity. But after you leave the theatre, the only memory you‚Äôd carry back is that of Bhanu and her Telangana dialect. If that was what Kammula intended, then he has surely succeeded.\\" *The Hindu wrote, \\"The meeting and subsequent romance between Bhanu and Varun (Varun Tej, younger brother of the groom and a doctor) happens in a love-hate- love manner. They‚Äôre both enamoured, yet don‚Äôt go weak in the knees blinded by love. The setting adds to the charm. The Bhanswada house looks lived in, not like a make-believe set. The Telangana dialect is spot on and a lot of humour is woven in matter-of-factly. Jeevan‚Äôs background score adds mirth to the already lively proceedings.\\" *Sify gave it 3.25 stars as well and wrote, \\"Fidaa is lovely. The love story, even though regular, is told in most endearing manner and with passionate approach. The story of Bhanumathi is likeable to the core and Sai Pallavi steals the show. Sekhar Kammula brings another good romantic story not worrying about commercial aspects. It may work with all kind of audiences (given the thick Telangana accent and slow pace) but it is a good movie. Go watch it.\\" *Idlebrain Jeevi gave it 3.25 stars and wrote, \\"First half of the film is very good as Sekhar Kammula sets up the plot and make us travel with the characters in Banswada. Second half has less of story and most of the scenes appear repetitive. Yet, Sekhar makes sure that a few of scenes between hero and heroine are entertaining. Plus points of the film are writing, characterization of heroine and strong emotions. On the flipside, there are a few issues in the latter part of second half. After Pelli Choopulu, here comes another film that makes Telangana dialect and culture a trend! On a while, Fidaa has strong emotions with nicely sprinkled humor. You may watch it!\\" *Firstpost was another to give it 3.25 stars, and wrote \\"Having said that, this is not a complaint, but a result of the angst that one goes through after watching a film which should have had a more befitting closing. The climax feels rushed and the story itself needed better closure. We get what we want in the end, but it feels like a chunk of beautiful moments which have held the story together.\\" *The News Minute wrote, \\"In the places where we expect a sob fest, we get a gentle touch of relevance and realism. The leads do cry buckets and buckets, yet they don‚Äôt grow into a dramatic nuisance. Varun, upset that his ‚Äòproposal‚Äô was turned down by Bhanu, drops her off at a bus station and tells her to use public transport to go to her friend‚Äôs house. She looks at him begrudgingly and doesn‚Äôt utter a word. He does come back for her. She does get into the car, after a five-second argument. When the rocky equation they share and the love-and-hate emotions they throw at each other come out in such good measure, it‚Äôs a story one would definitely feel for.\\" *Indian Express wrote \\"As a director, it was a great move to cast Sai Pallavi. However, the one thing that irks the audience a little is the absence of a strong supporting cast. Yes, there is great camaraderie between Varun and his brother, there is affection between him and his new sister-in-law, but in an important scene, a conversation between Varun and his sister-in-law falls flat.\\" Awards =Filmfare Awards South= ;65th Filmfare Awards South Won * Filmfare Award for Best Actress - Telugu - Sai Pallavi * Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer ‚Äì Telugu - Hemachandra for Oosupodhu * Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer ‚Äì Telugu - Madhu Priya for Vachinde * Filmfare Award for Best Dance Choreographer - South - Sekhar VJ Nominated * Filmfare Award for Best Film - Telugu * Filmfare Award for Best Director - Telugu - Sekhar Kammula * Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress - Telugu - Saranya Pradeep * Filmfare Award for Best Music Director - Telugu - Shakti Kanth * Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist - Telugu - Chaitanya Pingali = South Indian International Movie Awards =  7th South Indian International Movie Awards  = Won = * SIIMA Award for Best Film (Telugu) - Dil Raju * SIIMA Award for Best Actress (Telugu) - Sai Pallavi * SIIMA Award for Best Lyricist (Telugu) - Suddala Ashok Teja for Vachinde * SIIMA Award for Best Female Playback Singer (Telugu) - Madhu Priya for Vachinde = Nominated = * SIIMA Award for Best Male Playback Singer (Telugu) - Hemachandra for Oosupodhu * SIIMA Award for Best Music Director (Telugu)- Shakti Kanth = Zee Cine Awards Telugu =  ZCAT 2017  = Won = * ZCAT Best Director - Sekhar Kammula = Nominated = * ZCAT Entertainer Of The Year (Male) - Varun Tej * ZCAT Entertainer Of The Year (Female) - Sai Pallavi * ZCAT Favourite Music Director - Shakti Kanth * ZCAT Favourite Song - Vachinde * ZCAT Favorite Director - Sekhar Kammula * ZCAT Favourite Film - Dil Raju References External links * 2017 films Films directed by Sekhar Kammula Indian films 2017 romantic comedy-drama films Telugu-language films 2010s Telugu-language films Films set in Texas Films shot in Texas Films shot in Telangana Indian romantic comedy-drama films 2010s Malayalam-language films ","title":"Fidaa"},{"id":"51324880","text":"Pig War may refer to the following conflicts: * Pig War (1555‚Äì58), or Saukrieg, a feud between the Bishop of Meissen and the family of his predecessor * Pig War (1859), a border confrontation between the United States and the British Colony of Vancouver Island * Pig War (1906‚Äì08), a trade war between Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Serbia * The Pig War (poem), a Latin poem ","title":"Pig War"},{"id":"51324902","text":"Spink Arms Hotel, also known as the Lionel Artis Center, is a historic hotel building located at Indianapolis, Indiana.

Through his efforts engines designed and built by the Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick were shipped to Peru and carried high over the Andes to the silver mines, where they were used to pump water and hoist ore. Uville went well beyond the mandate agreed with his partners in his arrangements to obtain the equipment. He died before seeing the enterprise collapse in 1820 during the Peruvian War of Independence. Early life Francisco Uville was born in Switzerland. He was about 36 years old in 1817, so would have been born around 1781. Uville was a watchmaker by trade. As a young man Uville visited the rich silver mines of the Pasco Region about from Lima, Peru. The Yanacancha socav√≥n, an adit or tunnel long, had been completed in 1811 to drain the mines into the San Judas lake. However, on average it was only about , below ground level. Any mine deeper than the socav√≥n would have to be drained by hand pumps and buckets. When Uville visited them, the silver mines had reached the socav√≥n level and were now almost abandoned. It struck Uville that the mines could be worked much deeper by using steam engines to pump out the water. Uville visited England in 1811 and spent a few months in London. He met the Boulton and Watt engineers, who told him it would not be possible to build low-pressure steam engines that would work efficiently in the thin air of the mountains round Cerro de Pasco, around above sea level. It would also be impossible to make an engine that could be disassembled into pieces small enough to be carried by mule along the narrow track to the mines, which reached above sea level. However, while in London Uville chanced on a working model of Richard Trevithick's high-pressure steam engine, which he saw in the window of the engine maker William Rowley. He was struck by the simplicity of its design and how well it was built, and bought the model for 20 guineas. He took it back to Peru and successfully tested it at Cerro de Pasco. Water boiled at this altitude at about compared to at sea level, but still produced ample steam and drove the engine as well as it had in London. Cerro de Pasco enterprise Mule track from Lima to Cerro de Pasco (1874) =Formation= On 17 July 1812 Uville joined the leading Lima merchants Pedro Abadia and Jose Aresmendi to form a company to drain the mines around Cerro de Pasco. Abadia received two shares for $20,000, while Arismindi and Uville received one share each for $10,000. It was estimated that $30,000 would cover the cost of two engines in England, and Uville was authorised to buy another if he could obtain it on credit. Uville was to arrange to have the machines made in England and erecting in Peru, and in return would get 10% of the net profits. The remainder would be divided in four parts among the shareholders. If the enterprise succeeded Uville would be credited with $2,000 for the model and with travelling expenses. Jos√© Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, Viceroy of Lima, gave his support to the plan. On 22 August 1812 the company made a contract with the owners of the Cerro de Pasco mines. The contract, signed by all but three of the mine owners, was for at least two full-size engines to be installed at Santa Rosa. The company would provide the capital to buy and transport the steam engines and to install them over a pit dug down to below the Yanacancha socav√≥n. Water filtering in from the surrounding pits would be pumped up to the socav√≥n, allowing silver to be extracted from the lower levels. The company would get 15% of the ore from the Yanacancha and Yauricocha mines, 20% of ore from the other mines, and 50% of the ore from the drainage pit. =Second journey to England= Uville travelled to Jamaica, then continued to Falmouth, Cornwall, which he reached in the summer of 1813. He became ill on the journey. He found that Trevithick's first cousin was a fellow passenger, and a meeting between Trevithick and Uville was arranged as soon as they reached England. Uville spent several months at Trevithick's house in Camborne while he learned about the use of machinery in mining and visited most of the Cornish mines. Trevithick, who had made improvements to his high-pressure engines, entered a contract with Uville to deliver nine steam engines. On 8 January 1814 Uville made Trevithick a one-fifth partner in the company and guaranteed Trevithick a good percentage of the profits. The partnership was given in exchange for ¬£3,000 that was needed to pay overdue bills, and was to be ratified later by the partners in Lima. Ulville said he had bills on various people in England, but could not draw on them since the payers were absent from the country. Uville had acted far beyond his authority. His agreement with Abadia and Aresmendi prohibited bringing in new partners. He was only authorised to buy two engines, plus a third on credit. He had spent more twice the authorised amount. =Delivery of engines= Trevithick High Pressure Steam Engine The engines were built for about ¬£10,000 and shipped for Lima on a south sea whaler that left on 1 September 1814. There were four 33 hp pumping engines, four 10 hp winding engines, and a smaller engine to be used by the mint in Lima. There also four spare boilers, pitwork for the engines and other equipment. Uville sailed with the engines accompanied by the Cornish engineers Thomas Trevarthen of Crowan, Henry Vivian, of Camborne and William Bull of Chacewater. Transporting the equipment from the coast to Cerro de Pasco took much longer than expected, in part because the Indian communities along the way would not provide the necessary manpower. However, William Bull put the first steam engine into operation at the Santa Rosa mine near Cerro de Pasco on 27 July 1816. The test was satisfactory. A pit deep was emptied in 21 minutes, and then began filling with water from the surrounding mines. The official report to the Viceroy, published in the Lima Gazette in August 1816 said, A winding engine was installed beside the pump engine at Santa Rosa, and saved much labour in hauling up the ore from the drainage pit as the water was lowered. A vein of coal had been found to supply fuel. Six months after the Santa Rosa pump had been started a second pump was working at the Yanacancha mine, and rapidly drained the mine. =Difficulties and death= Richard Trevithick Richard Trevithick sailed for Lima on 20 October 1816 on a south sea whaler, with a Mr. Page of London and James Saunders of Camborne, an engine maker. He bought with him a furnace to be used in purifying the silver by sulphur. He reached Lima on 6 February 1817. The Lima Gazette of 12 February 1817 reported Don Ricardo Trevithick's arrival, saying, \\"This professor can, with the assistance of the workmen who accompany him, construct as many engines as are necessary in Peru, without any need of sending to England for any part of these vast machines. The excellent character of Don. R. Trevithick, and his ardent desire for promoting the interests of Peru, recommend him in the highest degree to public estimation, and make us hope that his arrival in this kingdom will form the epoch of its prosperity, with the enjoyment of the riches enclosed in it ...\\" The machinery in Cerro de Pasco had developed various problems that the Cornish craftsmen could not fix until Trevithick arrived. Trevithick managed the repairs, and supervised installation of a second pumping engine at the start of 1818. Uville and Trevithick began to argue about control of the company which was struggling badly from lack of capital and lack of fuel for the machines. Uville claimed that it was only through his efforts that steam engines had been brought to Peru, demanded complete control of the mining operation, and made every effort to undermine Trevithick's position. Trevithick left the mines in disgust, but turned back when he heard of Uville's death. Uville's death in August 1818 was \\"in consequence of the cold penetrating air of the Cordilleras on coming out of the mines in a strong perspiration.\\" Later events With Uville dead, Trevithick was placed in full control of the mines. The fuel problem was solved when rich coal seams were found near to the pumping site, and by the end of 1819 there were three pumping engines in operation and the future of the company seemed secure. However, the Peruvian War of Independence disrupted operations. On 27 October 1820 Cerro de Pasco was occupied by a patriot army under General Juan Antonio √Ålvarez de Arenales. At the start of December royalist forces recaptured Cerro de Pasco, but on 9 December Arenales defeated the royalists. This was the start of four years of fighting in the region. The mines were taken and retaken, skilled workers fled or were conscripted, and silver production came to a halt. Operations resumed at the mines in 1825, but only one pumping engine was working. In 1828 a boiler burst and the last engine was abandoned.

It was opened in 2013, replacing the former headquarters at Brent Town Hall located a mile north on Forty Lane. History The building was commissioned to replace the aging Brent Town Hall. The site selected for the new building had previously been occupied by the former Palace of Industry which had been built for the British Empire Exhibition in 1924. The construction work started on site in November 2010. The new building, which was designed by Hopkins Architects and built by Skanska at a cost of ¬£75 million, was officially opened to the public on 6 October 2013. Key aspects of the internal design for the nine-storey glass structure included a large atrium and a feature looking like a circular drum. The atrium, which at high, was also intended to double as an events venue, featured a wide staircase which was fitted with seating in the central section so allowing it to function as a grandstand. The circular drum, which was clad in timber, was partitioned inside to create a council chamber, community hall and library. The design also allowed the building to act as a community hub, with two caf√©s, entertainment spaces, meeting rooms and a wedding garden. When it opened, the civic centre was described by a journalist at the Guardian as \\"like ...the parliament of a small nation state\\". The scheme allowed some 2,000 council staff carrying out civic and administrative functions, who had previously been based at various locations around the borough, to be co- located in one place. The intention was to provide most of the Council's services in the new building, which is roughly in the centre of the borough, other than its archives department which was to remain at The Library at Willesden Green. Brent Civic Centre was awarded a BREEAM 'Outstanding' rating. The design reduced carbon emissions by a third thanks to solar shading, natural ventilation and a combined cooling, heating and power using waste fish oil. In May 2015 the building had to be evacuated when an unexploded Luftwaffe bomb dating from the Second World War was uncovered by construction workers operating in Empire Way.

Taxonomy Xylaria longipes was first described by the German botanist and mycologist Theodor Rudolph Joseph Nitschke in the first volume of his Pyrenomycetes Germanici, published in 1867. He gave it the name by which it is currently known. Xylaria is from the Latin xulon, meaning \\"wood\\", and aria, meaning \\"pertaining to\\", while longipes is from longus, meaning \\"long\\", and pes, meaning \\"foot\\". The specific name is in reference to the long stem, which is one of the distinguishing features in contrast to Xylaria polymorpha (dead man's fingers). In 1958, the English mycologist and plant pathologist R. W. G. Dennis coined the binomial Xylosphaera longipes, resurrecting the Belgian botanist and politician Barth√©lemy Charles Joseph Dumortier's 1822 genus Xylosphaera. However, the mycological databases MycoBank and Index Fungorum reject Dennis's name, preferring Nitscke's. The variety Xylaria longipes var. tropica was described from Mexico in 1989 by Felipe San Mart√≠n Gonz√°lez and Jack D. Rogers; this is listed on Index Fungorum as synonymous with the nominate variety, but is listed as taxonomically independent on MycoBank. The species is commonly known as \\"dead moll's fingers\\". Description The species has a roughly club- shaped fruit body measuring from in height, and reaching a thickness of up to . The top is rounded, while the stem can be fairly long (though is sometimes almost entirely lacking). The colour of the body's surface varies with age; younger specimens fairly gray or fairly brown, but they darken with age, becoming black. As the fruit body ages, the surface cracks and develops scales. X. longipes differs from the similar Xylaria polymorpha (dead man's fingers) by being somewhat more slender, by having a more distinct stalk, and by its smaller spores. While X. longipes has spores measuring 12 to 16 by 5 to 7 micrometres (Œºm), the spores of X. polymorpha measure 20 to 32 by 5 to 9 Œºm. The spindle-shaped spores of X. longipes have a smooth surface but for germ slits. Distribution and habitat This fungus is known from Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a saprotroph, growing directly from dead wood from hardwoods, including both fallen branches and stumps. It causes soft rot in its host. In Europe, it favours the wood of sycamores, while collections in North America have favoured the wood of maples and beeches. The species can grow singly or in groups, and is more likely to grow singly than X polymorpha. Uses Xylaria longipes is inedible, but a 2008 study concluded that the species could improve wood for the purposes of making violins. A number of chemicals have been derived from the fungus, including the antifungal xylaramide, the antioxidant tyrosol, and a derivative of the antifungal compound sordarin, a chemical first isolated from Sordaria araneosa.

Many believe that he was wrongfully convicted and executed for the 1977 murder of a young white woman in Monroe County of that state. The only evidence against Baldwin in the murder was his own confession. He retracted it, saying that it was coerced by beatings and torture by the local police in Wilcox County, Alabama, where he was arrested. A 1985 letter by his co-defendant Edward Dean Horsley surfaced in 1996, after Horsley was executed for first-degree murder. He wrote that he had acted alone in the rape and murder of Naomi Rolon, and that Baldwin had not known of her death. Death penalty opponents regard this case in which racial bias contributed to the wrongful conviction and execution of a man who did not commit Rolon's murder. The appeals process was marked by conflicts of interest. Governor Don Siegelman was petitioned for clemency on behalf of Baldwin before execution. Siegelman refused, saying that although he was \\"deeply troubled by some of the matters raised,\\" he wrote \\"this matter does not rise to a level that warrants clemency.\\" Background Brian Keith Baldwin was born in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1958 and had gotten into trouble with the law as a teenager. In March 1977 he was serving time in a juvenile facility in western North Carolina for stealing a car.Associated Press, \\"Brian Keith Baldwin\\", 16 June 1999, at Murderpedia; accessed 1 June 2017 On March 12, at age 18, he escaped with Edward Dean Horsley, Jr (known as Ed Dean), age 19, who had been convicted of armed robbery, a felony during which a police officer was shot.Edward HORSLEY v. Alabama (1995), No. 92-6813; US Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit; at Murderpedia, accessed 1 June 2017 Events In March 1977, Naomi Rolon, a young white girl aged 16, was driving in Hudson, North Carolina across town to visit her father in a hospital. She apparently picked up Baldwin and Horsley, who were hitchhiking. They robbed and stabbed her, raped her, and put her in the truck. They drove 40 hours with her in the trunk, traveling across state lines to Monroe County, Alabama. Horsley went off in the car with Rolon, returning alone. She was killed on March 14, 1977. The police found Rolon's body and car beside a rural road in Monroe County. The pair of men stole a truck in nearby Wilcox County, Alabama the next day, March 15, and they were arrested after a high-speed case by county police. They both gave statements at the Wilcox County jail. Baldwin later said that he was beaten and tortured there, finally giving a confession to end the punishment. They were not advised of their rights, including right to counsel. They were taken to Monroe County, where they were each indicted for aggravated robbery and murder. This combination made it a capital crime; each man was eligible for the mandatory death penalty if convicted. A sentencing hearing would be held by the judge to determine if there were mitigating circumstances to reduce the penalty. Horsley confessed to the murder; he was executed for first-degree murder in 1996. Baldwin later said that after he was arrested as a suspect, the local police beat him and subjected him to shocks from an electric cattle-prod, forcing him to confess to the murder of Rolon. He later retracted the confession (which had incorrect material facts both about how Rolon died and the nature of the murder weapon). Three witnesses testified to seeing bruises on Baldwin's back and body after the interrogation. Nathaniel Mazdie, the only black deputy sheriff in Monroe County at the time, later testified that he had seen Baldwin being beaten to coerce his confession and that a cattle prod was present at the jail. He also said that he had falsely signed an affidavit saying that Baldwin had been advised of his rights, including the right to counsel. But in 1999, from a nursing home, he told Gov. Don Siegelman in an interview that he had not seen the beating. The judge refused funds for Baldwin's defense. The court-appointed lawyer spent very little time with Baldwin and called no defense witnesses, although Baldwin had some who could attest to his beating by police. Baldwin's fingerprints were found in the car. He was not indicted for the rape. The robbery of the car and violence against the victim were aggravating factors used to justify the capital charge of first-degree murder against him. There was no physical evidence tying Baldwin to the murder: he had no blood on his clothes (in contrast to Horsley), and there were no Baldwin fingerprints on the murder weapon. (Note: Forensic analysis determined that the murder was committed by a left-handed person, but Baldwin was right-handed. The defense did not obtain the latter evidence until 1999; the prosecution had not made it available at the time of his trial and the jury never heard it.) The trial and conviction were completed in 1 1/2 days, August 8 and 9, 1977.\\"Brian Baldwin went to his death in the Alabama electric chair...\\", Center on Wrongful Convictions, at Murderpedia Baldwin was convicted by an all-white jury, although the population of the area of the jury pool was 46% black. (Exclusion of African Americans from a jury in such cases, where they form a significant part of the local population, was ruled as unconstitutional in Batson v. Kentucky by the United States Supreme Court). Baldwin's parents were not informed of his whereabouts until after he was convicted of capital murder. Appeals There were multiple appeals on the conviction and trial proceedings, based primarily on the following issues: *Failure to advise suspect of rights, including right to counsel *Coerced confession under torture *Ineffective defense counsel *Racially biased jury selection The first appeal, as to whether Alabama had jurisdiction to try the case, because the kidnapping and robbery occurred in North Carolina, was heard by Judge Robert E. Lee Key, although he had presided over Baldwin's conviction. It is normally accepted in law that the same judge cannot preside over a hearing to appeal his own case. It was settled that Alabama had jurisdiction because the murder was committed there. Horsley before his execution had testified in writing in 1985 that he alone had committed the murder of Rolon and that Baldwin had not known of her death. This was not given to Baldwin's counsel until after Horsley's execution in 1996. Baldwin's case was taken to the Supreme Court, with 33 senior judges and prosecutors signing a letter supporting Baldwin. The Supreme Court declined to reverse the conviction on murder and the death sentence. The Pope, former president Jimmy Carter, the Archbishop of Mobile, Alabama; 26 members of the Congressional Black Caucus of the United States Congress, and Coretta King, widow of Martin Luther King, petitioned to prevent Baldwin's execution, but they were unsuccessful. During an investigation in 1999, in an attempt to recover case evidence for DNA analysis (not available at the time of the trial), it was found that all evidence in the case was lost or destroyed after Baldwin's execution.

Description and history The town of Randolph is located in the White River valley of central Vermont, roughly midway between Montpelier (the state capital) and White River Junction, a commercial and industrial center on the Connecticut River. Its original center was centered on the banks of the White River in the western part of the town, about north of present commercial business district. The Central Vermont Railway introduced service to the town in 1848, and its depot became the new focus for commercial and industrial activity. Most of the area's buildings date after 1875, with the current railroad station dating to 1877. Industrial buildings include the Randolph Coal and Ice Company building, and a large grain mill. Depot Square is lined with brick commercial buildings built in the 1870s and 1880s, that are fine examples of Second Empire and Late Victorian architecture. with The historic district is organized around the three sets of railroad tracks that run roughly east‚Äìwest, roads that parallel them on either side (forming Depot Square), and stretches of Main Street (Vermont Route 12) and Pleasant Street that extend north from railroad crossing to their point of junction.

It was formally proposed to the British Indian government by Major General John Ardagh, chief of military intelligence in London, in 1897, based on the surveys conducted by William Johnson in 1865. The Ardagh‚ÄìJohnson Line is one of three boundary lines considered by the British Indian government, the other two being the Macartney‚ÄìMacDonald Line and a line along the Karakoram range. The British preference among the three choices varied over time based on the perception of their strategic interests in India. The Ardagh‚ÄìJohnson Line represented the \\"forward school\\" that wanted to advance the boundary as forward as possible as a defence against the growing Russian empire. Following the Chinese reluctance to acquiesce to the more conservative Macartney‚ÄìMacDonald Line, the British eventually reverted to the forward line in the Aksai Chin area, which was then inherited by the independent Republic of India.  Initial survey  Johnson's proposed boundary line marked in dark green W. H. Johnson of the Survey of India was commissioned to survey the Aksai Chin region. Johnson noted that Khotan's border was at Brinjga, in the Kunlun mountains, and the entire the Karakash Valley was within the territory of Kashmir. The boundary of Kashmir that he drew, stretching from Sanju Pass to the eastern edge of Chang Chenmo Valley along the Kunlun mountains, is referred to as the \\"Johnson Line\\".  Chinese reception  In 1893, Hung Ta-chen, a senior Chinese official at St. Petersburg, provided a map which coincided with the Ardagh‚ÄìJohnson line in broad details. It showed the boundary of Xinjiang up to Raskam. In the east, it was similar to the Ardagh‚ÄìJohnson line, placing Aksai Chin in Kashmir territory.: \\"Clarke added that a Chinese map drawn by Hung Ta-chen, Minister in St. Petersburg, confirmed the Johnson alignment showing West Aksai Chin as within British (Kashmir) territory.\\"  Proposal  In 1897 a British military officer, Sir John Ardagh, proposed a boundary line along the crest of the Kun Lun Mountains north of the Yarkand River. At the time Britain was concerned at the danger of Russian expansion as China weakened, and Ardagh argued that his line was more defensible. The Ardagh line was effectively a modification of the Johnson line, and became known as the \\"Ardagh‚ÄìJohnson Line\\".  Aftermath  In 1911 the Xinhai Revolution resulted in power shifts in China, and by the end of World War I, the British officially used the Ardagh‚ÄìJohnson Line. From 1917 to 1933, the \\"Postal Atlas of China\\", published by the Government of China in Peking had shown the boundary in Aksai Chin as per the Ardagh‚ÄìJohnson line, which runs along the Kunlun mountains. The \\"Peking University Atlas\\", published in 1925, also put the Aksai Chin in India. The border of independent India Upon independence in 1947, the government of India fixed its official boundary in the west, which included the Aksai Chin, in a manner that resembled the Ardagh‚ÄìJohnson Line. India's basis for defining the border was ‚Äúchiefly by long usage and custom.‚Äù. Unlike the Johnson line, India did not claim the northern areas near Shahidulla and Khotan.

The bridges connected Madison Street, on the river's west bank, and Hawthorne Avenue, on the east bank, on approximately the same alignment as the existing Hawthorne Bridge. The original and later bridges are sometimes referred to as Madison Street Bridge No. 1 and Madison Street Bridge No. 2, respectively.Wood Wortman (2006), pp. 6, 13, 62. The second bridge, built in 1900, has alternatively been referred to as the \\"rebuilt\\"Bottenberg (2007), pp. 29‚Äì30. Madison Street Bridge (of 1891), rather than as a new bridge, because it was rebuilt on the same piers. Both were swing bridges, whereas their successor, the Hawthorne Bridge, is a vertical-lift-type. First bridge Construction of the first bridge, a wooden swing-span bridge, began in February 1890.Introduction in Bottenberg (2007), p. 7. It was built by the Pacific Bridge Company and owned by the Madison Street Bridge Company. It opened as a toll bridge on January 11, 1891. At that time, the bridge's east end was in the city of East Portland, Oregon. Subsequently, in July of the same year, East Portland merged with its larger neighbor, becoming part of the city of Portland. Later in 1891, the Oregon state legislature organized eight Portland residents into a committee that purchased the bridge on November 18, 1891, for $145,000 () and eliminated the tolls. The following year, the committee won approval from the United States Secretary of War for a contract to build the Burnside Bridge nearby. The bridge's two-lane roadway was wide, and there were sidewalks on both sides, while the structure's overall width was . The Madison Street Bridge disaster occurred on November 1, 1893, when a westbound streetcar drove off the open draw of the bridge, and seven people died. This event remains the worst streetcar accident to occur in Portland, as well as the worst bridge disaster in the city's history.Labbe (1980), pp. 101‚Äì102.Thompson (2006), p. 39.Wood Wortman (2006), p. 6. In July 1899, the aging bridge was declared unsafe and in urgent need of rebuilding. Work to replace the structure, on the same piers, began in December 1899, with dismantling of the trusses. Second bridge In 1900, the first bridge was replaced by another wooden swing-span bridge, sometimes referred to as Madison Street Bridge No. 2. It has also been described as a rebuilding of the original bridge, because the work consisted of new truss spans mounted on the same piers. The rebuilt bridge opened to traffic in April 1900, but retaining the original swing-span section from 1891. Because of the estimated high cost, replacement of the swing span had been postponed, with predictions that it might hold on for another year or two. However, in July 1900 it was declared unsafe by the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners, and plans to replace it with a new swing-type draw span were accelerated. The new swing span was constructed in fall 1900, and it was made stronger than its predecessor by an additional tower built over the middle pier, connected to the outer ends of the span by iron or steel rods. On June 21, 1902, a fire that destroyed six blocks of east-side waterfront property also heavily damaged the bridge's eastern approach viaduct, closing the bridge to all traffic for several weeks. It reopened to pedestrians on July 18, to horse-drawn vehicles on August 5, and subsequently to streetcars. By 1907, planning was under way for the bridge to be replaced by a new structure that would be positioned at a higher elevation over the water and be constructed of steel instead of wood. In June 1907, voters approved a measure to issue $450,000 in municipal bonds to fund construction of a new bridge.MacColl (1976), p. 345. On January 20, 1909, the bridge was closed indefinitely to all traffic, after high river levels had caused debris to accumulate around its piers, placing strain on the structure. The indefinite suspension became a permanent one. Plans for a new, stronger bridge, eventually to be named the Hawthorne Bridge, were firm by this time. The Portland Railway, Light and Power Company, whose streetcars had used the bridge, and many residents of the east side, argued that the old bridge should be reopened while the new one was being built, but it remained closed. Construction contracts for the new Hawthorne Bridge were signed in June 1909. Dismantling of the Madison Street Bridge's structure and demolition of its piers took place in August and September 1909, followed by construction of the replacement bridge, on the same alignment. The Hawthorne Bridge opened on December 19, 1910.Wood Wortman (2006), p. 61.

Bred, owned and trained by Seamus McGrath he won one minor race from four starts in 1972. In 1973 he finished second three times in spring before winning the Irish Derby at odds of 33/1. He then finished fourth in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes before his racing career was ended by injury. Background Weavers' Hall was a \\"big, strong\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by the McGrath Trust Company, a breeding organisation run by his owner and trainer Seamus McGrath. His sire Busted was the British Horse of the Year in 1967 and sired many other good middle-distance performers including Bustino and Mtoto. Weavers' Hall was the second foal of his dam Marians who finished fourth in the Irish Oaks. She was a daughter of Damians, an influential and long-lived British broodmare whose other descendants have included Oasis Dream, Beat Hollow, More So, Zenda, Candy Glen (Premio Parioli), Wemyss Bight (Irish Oaks) and Ballydam (sire of Bally Ache) Racing career =1972: two- year-old season= Weavers' Hall began his track career racing over six furlongs, finishing unplaced on his debut and running third in his next two races. He was then moved up in distance and won a maiden race over seven furlongs. =1973: three-year-old season= Weavers' Hall began his second season by finishing second to Starboard Buoy over seven furlongs. He was then moved up in class and distance for the Nijinsky Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse in which he was matched against older horses. He finished fifth behind Ballymore who recorded an upset victory over the 1972 Epsom Derby winner Roberto. In the Lumville Stakes over one mile at the Curragh Racecourse in May he finished third behind the dead heaters Status Seeker and Boone's Cabin but was promoted to second when Boone's Cabin was disqualified. In the Players-Wills Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown he finished second, beaten two lengths by the Vincent O'Brien-trained Hail The Pirates. On 30 June, Weavers' Hall, ridden by George McGrath (no relation to the Owner/Trainer), contested the Irish Derby over one and a half miles at the Curragh and started a 33/1 outsider in a fifteen-runner field. Hail The Pirates started the 11/4 favourite whilst the other runners included Freefoot, Ksar and Ragapan (respectively third, fourth and fifth in the Epsom Derby) as well as Buoy, Natsun (Dee Stakes) and Laurentian Hills (Churchill Stakes). Park Lawn (also trained by McGrath) took the lead from the start and set an exceptionally strong pace from Buoy, Weavers' Hall and Laurentian Hills. Approaching the final turn Hail The Pirates began to make ground as Laurentian Hills and Park Lawn faded. Buoy took the lead in the straight but Weavers' Hall quickly gained the advantage and stayed on very strongly to win by two and a half lengths from Ragapan, with Buoy taking third ahead of Hail The Pirates and Ksar. After the race George McGrath siad \\"we did not think he would do so well on fast ground, but once we hit the front I knew it would take a good horse to beat us\\". On his only subsequent start Weavers' Hall was sent to Ascot Racecourse for Britains most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles. He was among the leaders from the start and stayed on well in the straight to finish fourth of the twelve runners behind Dahlia, Rheingold and Our Mirage. In the autumn of 1973, Weavers' Hall was scheduled to run in the Prix Royal- Oak at Longchamp Racecourse in September. When being transported in a horse- box to the Curragh for a training session he sustained a severed artery and was retired from racing. Assessment In the 1972 Irish Free Handicap, a ranking of the leading Irish two-year-olds, Weavers' Hall was assigned a weight of 110 pounds, thirty pounds behind the top-rated Thatch. In 1973 the independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 122, fourteen pounds behind Thatch, who was their top-rated three-year-old colt. Stud record Weavers' Hall began his stud career at the Brownstown Stud, County Kildare at a fee of 2,000 guineas. The best of his offspring was probably El Badr who won the Prix du Cadran in 1979.

Spiritualism involved in the extremity of science is found anywhere in the book as the sun found reflected anywhere in the ocean or a clear body of water.\\" (Tiruvallam Bhaskaran Nair, Malayalam poet and Malayalam translator of the Kural text) P *\\"[Tirukkural] will be read with pleasure, as affording proof of the existence of the loftiest sentiments, the purest moral rules, and equal power of conception and expression. Nothing certainly, in the whole compass of human language, can equal the force and terseness of the sententious distichs in which the author conveys the lessons of wisdom he utters.\\" (Rev. Peter Percival, Christian missionary and the reviser of the Tamil version of the Bible) *\\"Perfection of human nature is the be-all and end-all of Kural. Before I resume my seat let me make one humble bow to the Prince of Moralists.\\" (J. M. Nallaswami Pillai, Tamil scholar, 1864‚Äì1920) Alexander Piatigorsky *\\"Thiruvalluvar, the author of Kural, addresses neither the King, subject, nor priest, but man. He does not address man either as the law-giver or prophet but as well-wisher, teacher and friend. He neither prophesied nor spoke in hints and riddles; his words contained no shade of doubts, he had full conviction of the truth of what he said, both as an artist and thinker.\\" \\"Thiruvalluvar is rightly considered as Chef d'oeuvre of both Indian and world literature. This is due not only to the great artistic merits of the work but also to the lofty humane ideas permeating it which are equally precious to the people all over the world, of all periods and countries.\\" (Alexander Piatigorsky, Russian philosopher, 1929‚Äì2009) George Uglow Pope *\\"The Kural owes much of its popularity to its exquisite poetic form. The brevity rendered necessary by the form gives an oracular effect to the utterances of the great Tamil 'Master of Sentences'. They are the choicest of moral epigrams. Their resemblance to gnomic poetry of Greece is remarkable as to their subjects, their sentiments and the state of society when they are uttered. Something of the same kind is found in Greek epigrams, in Martial and the Latin elegiac verse. There is a beauty in the periodic character of the Tamil construction in many of these verses that read minds, the reader of the happiest efforts of properties.\\" \\"He was undoubtedly one of the great geniuses of the world. Complete in itself, the sole work of its author (the Kural) has come down the stream of ages, absolutely uninjured, hardly a single various readings of any importance being found. In value it (Kural) outweighs the whole of the remaining Tamil Literature and is one of the selected numbers of great works which have entered into the very soul of a whole people and which can never die.\\" (George Uglow Pope, Christian missionary to India, 1820‚Äì1908) R *\\"It is the gospel of love and a code of soul-luminous life. The whole of human aspiration is epitomized in this immortal book, a book for all ages.\\" \\"Among the precious classics of the world literature the Kural takes a place in the front rank.\\" \\"Thiruvalluvar was one of those rare and great men whose catholic spirit rose above all denominations and whose vision was not clouded by dogma or prejudice of any kind. His teachings elude classification on any denominational basis.\\" (Rajaji, Governor-General of India, 1878‚Äì1972) *\\"Tirukkural contains all things and there is nothing which it does not contain.\\" (E. J. Robinson, Protestant missionary to British India) S *\\"Great thinkers belong to the world. Thiruvalluvar belongs not only to Tamilnadu but also to the whole of India, nay, to the whole world. He wrote for the benefit of the whole mankind.\\" \\"After reading Kural, we will realise that Indian culture all over the country is one. The art of this great country is full of the same blood.\\" (Sane Guruji, Marathi author, teacher, and nationalist, 1899‚Äì1950) Albert Schweitzer *\\"There hardly exists in the literature of the world a collection of maxims in which we find so much of lofty wisdom.\\" \\"World and life negation are found in the thought of Jesus insofar as he did not assume that the Kingdom of God would be realized in this natural world. He expected that this natural world would very speedily come to an end and be superseded by a supernatural world in which all that is imperfect and evil would be overcome by the 'power of God'. On the contrary, Valluvar believed that in this very natural world, the liberated man can find his heaven and said that perfect bliss could be attained by an individual in this natural world itself and it is unnecessary to wait indefinitely for the transformation of the world in order to transform oneself. Thus, he took life and world affirmation to a loftier plane than Christ did.\\" \\"The idea of active love did arise in the popular ethics of India in fairly ancient times. We know from many stories we meet in her literature and especially through the ethical maxims found in the Kural, a work which probably belongs to the second century A.D.\\" \\"In the ethics of the Kural, as in those of the Laws of Manu, the idea of reward has a place. The way of virtue is recommended because it leads to a better reincarnation or to liberation from re-birth.\\" \\"Whilst Bhagavad Gita in a forced and chilly manner gives as a motive for remaining in active life that it is in accordance with the order of universe, the Kural justifies it ‚Äì what an advance ‚Äì by the idea of ethical activity. Work and profit place a man in a position to do good. According to the Kural, duty is not contained as in the Bhagavad Gita to what the caste calling involves but consists in general in 'all that is good'.\\" \\"Maxims about joy in activity, such as one would not expect from the Indian lips, bear witness to the strength of the world and life affirmation present in the Kural.\\" \\"Like the Buddha and the Bhagavad Gita, the Kural desires inner freedom from the world and a mind free from hatred. Like them it stands for the commandment not to kill and not to damage. It has appropriated all the valuable ethical results of the thought of world and life negation. But in addition to this ethic of inwardness, there appears in the Kural the living ethic of love.\\" \\"With sure stroke, the Kural draws the ideal of simple ethical humanity. On the most varied questions concerning the conduct of man to the world its utterances are characterized by nobility and good sense.\\" (Albert Schweitzer, French-German theologian, organist, philosopher, and physician, 1875‚Äì1965) *\\"Thirukkural is essentially a book on ethical philosophy. It portrays a way of life and it lays down a code of conduct. The author's beliefs are simply stated; he believes in God. The first ten verses are in praise of God. But he does not call God by name so that he can be identified with one religion or another. He refers to him as the Wise One, the Incomparable One, and as the Sage of the sea of virtue. He is completely non- denominational. He also seems to believe in rebirth. Often, he refers to 'seven births' or 'countless births'.\\" (Swami Shivanandha, Indian spiritual leader) *\\"It is the duty of individuals and groups to study this guide book of ethics and honour the author and his work.\\" (Sardar Ujjal Singh, Former governor of Punjab and Tamil Nadu, 1895‚Äì1983) T Rabindranath Tagore Leo Tolstoy *\\"The ideas of great Saint Thiruvalluvar will apply not only to India but the whole world.\\" (Rabindranath Tagore, Indian poet, 1861‚Äì1941) *\\"The sacred Kural, in all its aspects appears to be a Hindu Kural.\\" \\"What are wanted for the Indian as for the Englishman, the Frenchman, the German, and the Russian, are not Constitutions and Revolutions, nor all sorts of Conferences and Congresses, nor the many ingenious devices for submarine navigation and aerial navigation, nor powerful explosives, nor all sorts of conveniences to add to the enjoyment of the rich, ruling classes; nor gramophones and cinematographs, not those childish and for the most part corrupt stupidities termed art ‚Äì but one thing only is needful: the knowledge of the simple and clear truth which finds place in every soul that is not stupefied by religious and scientific superstitions ‚Äì the truth that for our life one law is valid ‚Äì the law of love, which brings the highest happiness to every individual as well as to all mankind.\\" (Leo Tolstoy, Russian writer, 1828‚Äì1910) Note:Leo Tolstoy was inspired by the concept of non-violence found in the Tirukkural when he read a German version of the book, who in turn instilled the concept in Mahatma Gandhi through his A Letter to a Hindu when young Gandhi sought his advice. *\\"‡ÆÜ‡Æ≤‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Øá‡Æ≤‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Æø; ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ≤‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æá‡Æ∞‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æö‡Øä‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Æø.\\" (Banyan and neem maintain oral health; Four [the quatrains of Naladiyar] and Two [the couplets of Tirukkural] maintain moral health.)

Thiruvalluvar, one of the greatest authors in Indian history, wrote Thirukkural more than 2000 years ago. The Thirukkural is one of the most revered ancient works in the Tamil language. It is considered a 'common creed', providing a guide for human morals and betterment in life. The Thirukkural has been translated into several languages.\\" (Vairamuthu, Indian poet and lyricist, 1953‚Äì) W *\\"Thirukkural is a synthesis of the best moral teachings of the world.\\" (Rev.

Man in the totality of his relationship is the subject of the Kural. After a 'cosmic' introduction, which praises God, rain, supermen and virtue, the author of the book turns towards man, whose personality is gradually unfolded in 'ever expanding concentric cycles' within the family with his wife and children, within the community with his friends, and within his country in his relationship towards the ruler and the state. Man is shown not in a static state but in the development, and the force that is behind this dynamism is sympathy, even love, manifesting itself through kind thoughts, sweet words, and right actions.\\" \\"The Kural, one of the great books of the World, one of those singular emanations of human heart and spirit which preaches positive love, forgiveness and peace.\\" \\"As regards the Kural it stands on its merits. The purity of its Tamil, the richness of its diction, the lofty tone of its morality, the theistic and unsectarian nature of its theology, the endless variety of topics discussed in its one hundred and thirty-three chapters and the profound esteem in which it is held by all classes of Tamil-speaking Hindus are too well-known to need praise or comment.\\" \\"One should never contemplate the couplets in isolation. We must again and again stress that they have true validity and meaning only in their patterned relation to other couplets, and to the whole. And when read and contemplated in this way, Thiruvalluvar's ethics is never that of a Chanakya or a Macchiavelli.\\" \\"Let it be said in conclusion that it is almost impossible to truly appreciate the maxims of the Kural through a translation. Thirukkural must be read and re-read in Tamil. This fact, too, reveals something about the nature and degree of its 'poetic excellence'.\\" \\"It is more important that he was also a very integral part of the non- Sanskrit and pre-Sanskrit Tamil tradition. This fact is seen not only from his conception of 'pleasure' which is so typically a reflexion of the akam genre, but also from the all-pervading pragmatic, this-worldly, empirical and, to a great extent, humanistic and universalistic character of his particular conception of dharma and justice.\\" \\"Above all I believe that the outstanding works of Tamil literature of the past, and the very interesting writings of the present times, should be translated, published and spread wide, they intrinsically belongs to the literary heritage of the world and man's culture will be enriched by their general knowledge.\\" \\"Thiruvalluvar's Kamattuppal is utterly different from any of the Sanskrit Kamasastras. While Vatsyayana's work (and all later Sanskrit erotology) is Sastra, that is, objective and scientific analysis of sex, the third part of the Kural is a poetic picture of eros, of ideal love, of its dramatic situations. As a work of literary art, [it] reveals a single structural plan, and looks like a work of a single master ... In the erotic couplets of the third part (Kamattuppal), the teacher, the preacher in Valluvar has stepped aside and the poet speaks almost the language of the superb love poetry of the classical Age.\\" (Kamil Zvelebil, Czech scholar in Indian literature and linguistics, 1927‚Äì2009) See also * Tirukkural translations * List of Tirukkural translations by language Citations References          * Further reading *M.

The historic church was built by the city's first Lutheran congregation, which organized in 1837, and was its third house of worship. The former church, whose present-day name is The Sanctuary on Penn, is operated as a for-profit event venue. The red-brick structure is notable because it combined two styles of architecture, Late Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival, which were popular styles for religious buildings in the late nineteenth century. The L-shaped church was built in two sections. The original chapel, which dates from 1874‚Äì75, is Late Gothic Revival-style building. The Romanesque Revival-style main sanctuary was completed in 1887 on a limestone foundation laid in 1875. The sanctuary features round-arched windows, a rose window, and brick buttresses with limestone caps. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History Pastor Abraham Reck organized the city's first Lutheran congregation in 1837 and served as its pastor until 1841. Eventually, the congregation became known as the Mount Pisgah Evangelical Lutheran, First English Lutheran, and First Lutheran Church. The congregation built three churches in downtown Indianapolis at different times and in three different locations. The cornerstone for the congregation's first church at Meridian and Ohio Streets was laid in April 1838. The congregation's second church, which cost $3,000, stood at Alabama and New York Streets. Both of these churches have been demolished; however, the congregation's third building at 701 North Pennsylvania Street still stands. See also: For its third church, the Lutheran congregation acquired a lot at the corner of Pennsylvania and Walnut Streets in 1874 for $2,500. The building was constructed in two sections. The chapel dates from 1874‚Äì75; the sanctuary was completed in 1887 on a foundation laid in 1874‚Äì75. Peter Cookingham was the architect of the chapel. The main sanctuary's architect is not known for certain. Cookingham may have drawn the plans for the sanctuary, but he had left Indianapolis by the time it was completed in 1887.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 1172, 1180. Note: This includes and accompanying photographs. In March 1970 the congregation voted to sell its North Pennsylvania Street property and relocate east of the downtown area; however, at a meeting held in September 1973, the congregation reversed the decision and remained at the church for several more years. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Its present-day owners operate the facility, called The Sanctuary on Penn, as a for-profit venue for weddings and other special events. See also: Description The building, which was constructed in two sections, is notable for its combination of two popular styles of architecture for religious buildings in the late nineteenth century. The first section of the L-shaped, red-brick building was a small, Late Gothic Revival-style chapel dating from 1874‚Äì75. Construction on the second section, a Romanesque Revival-style main sanctuary, began in 1885 and was completed in 1886 on a limestone foundation that was laid in 1874‚Äì75. The two structures are attached at the southeast corner of the sanctuary. The main sanctuary on North Pennsylvania Street faces west; the attached chapel on Walnut Street faces south.The Art and Architecture of Nine Urban Churches and The History of Nine Urban Churches. See also: Few alterations to the building have been made since its completion in 1886. A pipe organ was installed in 1898 on a raised platform behind the altar. In 1915 the church's plain windows were replaced with stained glass. The renovation also included excavation under the sanctuary and a concrete floor to provide space for classrooms and restrooms on the lower level. In addition, an entrance to the basement was added to the building's south elevation. =Exterior= The Gothic Revival-style chapel was constructed of red brick with a limestone foundation. Brick buttresses were constructed on its corners. The chapel features a steep, gable roof of slate and tall, narrow windows with two-story arches. The south fa√ßade facing Walnut Street has tall, stained- glass windows flanking a larger one. The chapel's entrance features double doors inset with stained-glass windows. (The chapel's original entrance had double doors with a transom above the entrance that contained the words, Luther Chapel.) The Romanesque Revival-style main sanctuary was constructed of red brick with a limestone foundation. It features round-arched windows, a stained-glass rose window, and brick buttresses with limestone caps. The main building's slate roof was framed with wood timbers. The front fa√ßade's arched and segmented stained-glass window is installed beneath a stained-glass rose window that dominates the center section. The front fa√ßade's two double-door entrances with stained-glass transoms flank the center section. The southwest entrance has a gable-roof porch supported by wooden brackets. The church had a single cross the peak of the gable roof. The sanctuary's north and south elevations include four stained-glass windows with rounded arches set in recessed panels. The brick buttresses with limestone caps separate the arched panels. In addition, the upper-most level on the north and south elevations, near the front fa√ßade, each include three, round-arched openings with wooden louvers. These may have been intended to house church bells that were never installed. =Interior= The sanctuary's simple interior includes a large stained-glass window on the west wall that depicts Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd. A Moeller Company pipe organ originally covered the apse; it was moved to the front of the sanctuary, behind the altar, in 1898 and relocated to the rear of the sanctuary during a later renovation to the church. During renovations made in 1915, the church's plain glass was replaced with stained glass and its electrical fixtures were replaced with gas fixtures. In addition, the second floor above the original chapel was remodeled to create classrooms and the ground beneath the sanctuary was excavated and concrete floor added to create space for classrooms and restrooms. A later renovation included the addition of a false ceiling in the sanctuary. In the 1970s the basement was repainted and the chapel was redecorated. Church mission and present-day use When the church was active as a Lutheran congregation, it helped establish five other congregations in the city: Zion United Church of Christ (1841), Pleasant View Lutheran Church (1844), Gethsemane Lutheran Church (1921), Bethlehem Lutheran Church (1923), and First Latvian Church (1947). The Lutheran congregation also contributed to the development of the Lutheran church in Indiana. In 1920 the Lutheran convention that organized the Indiana Synod was held at the church and the first administrative offices of the Indiana-Kentucky Synod were housed there. The First Lutheran Church also provided outreach services and community development efforts. After World War II it sponsored Estonian immigrants to Indianapolis and at one time offered Estonian language religious services.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 552. The Indianapolis Near East Side Community Organization (NESCO) organized at the church building in 1970. The present-day facility, called The Sanctuary on Penn, is a for-profit, private event venue.

On August 27, 2011, the Vietnamese government arrested Nhat and charged him with ‚Äúcarrying out activities aimed at overthrowing the people‚Äôs administration‚Äù under Article 79 of Vietnam's Criminal Code due to his writings in favor of free speech and a pluralist political system in Vietnam. Nhat was found guilty and sentenced to four years in prison with an additional three years of probation. He was eventually released on August 28, 2015 after completing his prison sentence where he has faced constant harassment by the police.  Background  Tran Minh Nhat is a journalist and blogger for the Vietnam Redemptorist News, an independent Catholic news outlet that reports on religious, social, and human rights issues in Vietnam. As a member of the Redemptorist Ky Dong church in Ho Chi Minh City, Nhat was known for contributing political writings in support of democracy and human rights to the church's website.  2011 Arrest  In 2011, Tran Minh Nhat assisted in organizing and participating in protests against China‚Äôs policies in regards to the South China Sea and their bauxite mining operations in Vietnam‚Äôs Central Highlands. Including this, Nhat wrote for the Redemptorist News blogging for freedom of speech and supporting a multi-party, pluralist political system. On August 27, 2011, Nhat was arrested at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Foreign Languages and Information Technology and charged under Clause 2 of Article 79 of Vietnam‚Äôs Criminal Code for ‚Äúactivities aiming to overthrow the people‚Äôs government,‚Äù a strategy often used by the Vietnamese government to charge and convict pro-democracy activists. On January 9, 2013, a trial was held by the People's Court of Nghe An Province where Nhat and 13 other activists were found guilty of ‚Äúcarrying out activities with intent to overthrow the people‚Äôs administration‚Äù due to his political activities and involvement with the banned opposition group Viet Tan. He was sentenced to four years in prison and three years of probation. = International response = After the verdict, Human Rights Watch released a press statement calling for Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to immediately ‚Äúwithdraw all the charges against those who are held pending trial and for those who have been sentenced to be unconditionally exonerated.‚Äù On December 13, 2011, Congresswoman Susan Davis of California's 53rd District and a member of the Congressional Caucus on Vietnam spoke to the United States Congress on behalf of the 14 arrested Catholic Vietnamese youth activists. The Congresswoman called on her colleagues to ‚Äústand side-by-side with these brave individuals and raise their voice in demanding that the Government of Vietnam release all prisoners of conscience and uphold their commitment to human rights for all.‚Äù Following the trial, Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, stated that ‚Äúthis was the largest group to be brought to trial together in recent times.‚Äù Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, condemned the arrests and stated that ‚ÄúThe conviction of yet more peaceful activists is another example of a government that is increasingly afraid of the opinions of its own people. Instead of imprisoning critics, the Vietnamese government should be honoring them for their efforts to address the myriad problems facing the country that the government itself has also identified.\\" = Detention = During his time at the Nghi Kim prison, Nhat was treated poorly and forced to live in harsh prison conditions in severe summer weather while being denied basic medicines and reading material. Inside the prison, Nhat went on a prolonged hunger strike to protest these unfair conditions and treatment he and his fellow prisoners faced. Nhat was also pressured to sign a confession in order to receive a shorter sentence but openly refused, stating that he was ‚Äúnot guilty and nobody can force me to sign a confession.‚Äù On January 8, 2013, he appealed to reduce his jail sentence but was denied by the courts, though he did not have to face probation anymore after completing his jail sentence.  Release  Tran Minh Nhat was released on August 28, 2015 after serving his four-year prison sentence. Since his release, Nhat and his family have been constantly harassed by authorities. On November 8, 2015, Nhat and his companion Chu Manh Son were arrested by the police in Dinh Van in the Central Highlands province while traveling south to Ho Chi Minh City for medical treatment. He was accused of being in communication with a Redemptorist priest and using money to carry out insubordinate activities against the state. After being taken to the local police station, both men were severely beaten and assaulted. On both December 24, 2015 and January 2, 2016, unknown individuals broke into Nhat's property to damage his family's home. Much of the vegetation such as the pepper vines, coffee plants, and avocado trees were either chemically poisoned or chopped down and irrigation pipes were destroyed. These unknown individuals are suspected to have been hired by the Vietnamese police as another form of harassment to discourage Nhat from continuing his human rights work. From February 10 to February 22, 2016, Nhat was again attacked by the police both inside and outside his home in the Lam Ha district of Lam Dong. His family's coffee plants were again set on fire, masked men threw stones at their homestead, and a police officer came to his front door and demanded Nhat to come out outside where he then abruptly attacked him with a rock causing severe head trauma. = International response = Desperate for relief, Nhat went to Radio Free Asia asking for help in making public his current situation. As he told Radio Free Asia reporter Gia Minh, ‚ÄúMy current situation is alarming because they sprayed pesticides all around my residence. I could die inside my house because of the toxicity. Even when I stepped outside to take care of our chickens I wanted to throw up because of the smell [‚Ä¶] They threw stones at our window, breaking glass and light bulbs. People who watch my house always have their weapon in their vehicles. I'm very worried.‚Äù Australian House Representative Chris Hayes for the Division of Fowler, New South Wales presented Nhat's situation before parliament, commending him for his courage as a human rights activist: ‚ÄúHe is a person whose human rights have certainly been offended, but his crime was that he stood up for the human rights of others. Wherever human rights abuse occurs‚Äîand particularly where it involves a valued trading partner‚Äîit should be a concern for all of us.‚Äù He demanded that the government take action immediately for this injustice, stating that ‚ÄúTo ignore is to excuse, which in turn leads to acceptance. We need to stand up for individuals who are brave enough to stand up for the rights of others.‚Äù The attacks on Nhat, his family, and his property was condemned by organizations and individuals worldwide including Amnesty International, English Pen, and Front Line Defenders.

In 2016, Correll was a leader in the effort to deny Donald Trump the Republican nomination through the use of a federal lawsuit, amendments to Convention rules, and floor action at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. On April 16, 2016, Correll was elected as a national delegate to represent the 10th Congressional District of Virginia to the convention. At the time of his election, Va. Code ¬ß 24.2-545(D) required national delegates to \\"be bound to vote on the first ballot at the national convention for the candidate receiving the most votes in the primary.\\" Voting in opposition could have resulted in a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and up to a $2,500 fine. Donald Trump won the Virginia primary, thereby entitling him to all of that state's delegate votes at the national convention under state law. Approximately 20 states had similar laws to Virginia's that would bind national delegates under state law at the time. Trump, in the lead in national delegate totals, publicly opposed efforts to unbind delegates and called it \\"illegal\\" for delegates not to vote for him. Arguing that Trump's nomination would lead to a Republican loss to Clinton and, if successful, a weak, chaotic presidency and that he would risk jail rather than vote for Trump, Correll sued Virginia's Attorney General Mark Herring in Correll v. Herring, an effort to unbind the delegation under state law. The suit was filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia. Correll was represented by David Rivkin of BakerHostetler. Correll is also the founder of Free The Delegates, a Super PAC, created to oppose the ascent of Trump to the Republican nomination and paving the way for a new nominee. In addition to Correll v. Herring, Correll and the PAC supported both favorable modifications to RNC rules and actions voted on by delegates at large, rather than members of the Rules Committee. In order to aid in the selection of a different nominee, the organization supported efforts to allow delegates to vote their conscience, secret balloting, and the selection of their own Vice- Presidential candidate. On July 11, 2016, the federal court ruled in Correll's favor, striking down the binding statute on First Amendment grounds, thus, unbinding delegates under state law. Correll's efforts to oppose Trump were chronicled by VICE News as well as the Washington Post. He has been a commentator for Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, CBS, NBC, and ABC and resides in Winchester, Virginia.

The Eastern Wall is the oldest of the four visible walls of the Temple Mount; the Northern, Western and Southern Walls date from the period of Herod the Great, who expanded the area of the Temple Mount to the north, west and south. Older walls on these sides are presumed to survive underground. The Eastern Wall now visible was built in at least four stages, during the reign of Hezekiah, during the time of Zerubbabel, in the Hasmonean period and in the Herodian period. Repairs and major renovations were made in later periods. Major renovations to the Golden Gate were made in the Umayyad period. History of construction =First Temple period= Architectural archaeologist Leen Ritmeyer identifies specific courses of visible ashlars located on to the northern and south of the Golden Gate as Judean Iron Age in style, dating them to the construction of this wall by King Hezekiah. More such stones are supposed to survive underground. According to Hershel Shanks, \\"most scholars,\\" think that Ritmeyer is \\"correct.\\" Ritmeyer has pointed out that the Dome of the Rock is seated on a square platform atop the Temple Mount, the sides of which, defined by short flights of steps, are square and parallel to the modern walls of the Mount with one exception: the western steps deviate from parallel. Moreover, the bottom step on the western side of the Dome of the Rock platform is composed of a single line of distinctively large and \\"beautifully polished\\" ashlars. According to Ritmeyer, the measurements given in the Mishna, tractate Middot, \\"The Temple Mount measured 500 cubits by 500 cubits,\\" can be traced on the modern Temple Mount, with this step the outline of the western side of the square and the Eastern Wall the eastern side. The \\"precise\\" measurement of an ancient Judean royal cubit, 20.67 inches, outlines these landmarks area exactly. The northern edge of the ancient square was demarcated by Charles Warren, the last archaeologist permitted by the local waqf to explore the underground areas of the Mount, in his the underground structure he labeled as No. 29 in surveys he carried out in the 1860s. The southern side of the 500-cubit ancient platform square is marked by the so-called \\"Straight Joint,\\" a visible bend in the eastern wall.Leen Ritmeyer, ‚ÄúLocating the Original Temple Mount,‚Äù BAR, March/April 1992. Ritmeyer proposes that this 500 cubit walled square was constructed by King Hezekiah c. 700 BCE to expand the flat area in which the faithful could gather at the Solomonic-era Temple. The Foundation Stone around which is the ancient Jewish Temple was built and which is now sheltered under the Dome of the Rock, is a natural rock outcrop at the highest point of a Mount Moriah; the natural contour of the land fell away steeply on all sides, although on the eastern side the natural contour formed a flat plateau before falling sharply to the Kidron Valley along the line where the Eastern Wall stands.Leen Ritmeyer, Kathleen Ritmeyer, Jerusalem; The Temple Mount, Carta, Jerusalem, 2015, . The \\"Straight Joint\\" where the wall bends very slightly, demarcating the line between the Hezekiahan wall and the Hasmonean extension, is marked by a round column protruding from the wall near the top. =Hasmonean expansion= The Hasmonean dynasty expanded the 500 cubit Temple platform toward the south; distinctively Hasmonean ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall. The seam between the Hasmonean and Herodian extensions of the wall is visible as a vertical row of ashlars 32 meters north of the southeast corner. =Herodian expansion= King Herod expanded the Temple Mount still further toward the south; distinctively Herodian ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall, in the last stretch before the southeastern corner. Gates in the Eastern Wall =Golden Gate= Golden Gate The magnificent Muslim period Golden Gate (sealed) replaced the ancient Golden Gate. The present gate is understood to have been constructed during the Umayyad period atop the ancient footings. =Lion's Gate= Lions' Gate is the second gate in the Eastern Wall of Jerusalem, it is located north of the Golden Gate. Muslim cemetery There is a Muslim cemetery along the southern stretch of the Eastern Wall. A path through the cemetery and parallel to the wall lies atop the ancient city wall, explored by Charles Warren in excavations since covered over, which once lay just outside the Eastern Wall of the Temple Mount.

Historically it was the centre of agriculture and colonisation in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and was the most densely populated area of the Russian Empire. It was also the poorest. Before the emancipation of serfs, it was home to most of the Russian serf population, and later it was also the centre of the communal system, which contributed to the areas relative poverty compared to the rest of Russia. During the revolutionary years it was the centre of most agrarian violence, and later the centre of the Red Movement and Red Army during the Russian Revolution. Overview The Central Agricultural Zone was marked by lower living standards for peasants, and an extremely dense and poor rural population.Figes, p. 103‚Äì104Shanin, p. 93‚Äì94 It was surrounded by areas where commercial farming was prevalent: in the Baltic were capitalist farms able to hire wage-labour due to the Emancipation in 1817 with access to Western grain markets, in Western Ukraine nobles had established vast sugar- beet farms, in the fertile south of Russia, the Kuban and northern Caucasus (\\"New Russia\\", where there were fertile virgin lands with little population) there existed a 'wealthy stratum of mixed farmers' coming out of the peasantry and the Cossacks, and in Western Siberia where the Trans-Siberian Railroad had enabled smallholders to make a fortune producing dairy products and cereals for the larger market. These regions accounted for the general increase of peasant purchasing power (and living standards) noted in the Russian peasantry in the turn of the century and early twentieth century; there was however a growing divergence in the peasants' economic situation evolving between these relatively wealthy western, southern and eastern areas, and the central agricultural zone, where most of the estates of the gentry were located, where backward and old farming techniques and methods dominated, and which became increasingly overpopulated. Here the amount of land per capita was rapidly decreasing, while the population boom surpassed the increase in agricultural production.Shanin, p. 151 It was also one of the centres of 'hemp culture', i.e. the cultivation of hemp.Blum, p. 333‚Äì334 The Central Agricultural Zone in 1856, at the time the 'chief granary' of the Empire, were also the area where the gentry were most indebted: 71,3 percent of their revision souls were mortgaged.Blum, p. 380 The difference between the price of populated and unpopulated land was also less in this region than in non-agricultural regions, such as the Lake region, and land was more expensive in the central agricultural region because landowners realised more rent here than in these other regions. This also led to serfs being cheaper in these areas, as the main income of the gentry came from renting out land, and less came from serf labour; therefore to landowners in the central agricultural zone, land was considered more valuable than the serfs they owned.Blum, 374‚Äì375 These areas had few signs of commercialism, and the market economy remained weak. Most peasants were involved in a 'natural system of production', selling winter produce and handicraft to pay taxes and buy some new goods for the household, with the general production being geared towards their own food production. In Tambov Province, in the central agricultural zone, a survey conducted by zemstvo authorities in the 1880s found that two out of three peasant households could not feed themselves without also simultaneously going into debt; this was made worse by the fact that peasant farmers had to sell off grain in autumn, when prices were low due to high supply, and buy grain in the spring at double the prices ‚Äì often to the same kulaks, usurers who could have whole villages indebted, often leaving peasants in need to sell parts of their lands off to pay off their debts.Figes, p. 104 The differences in wealth and living standards of the peasantry between the central agricultural region and the surrounding agricultural areas were rooted in two factors, that is 'local differences in the quality of the soil', and 'historic legacies stretching back to the days of serfdom'. Villages composed of former serfs were also less rich in land than those consisting of 'state peasants', i.e. peasants settled on land owned by the state. Orlando Figes cites the basic problem of the central agricultural zone being that 'the peasantry's egalitarian customs gave them little incentive to produce anything other than babies'; the birth rate in Russia at the second half of the 1800s were almost twice that of the European average, at about 50 to a 1000, with the highest rates in the lands with communal tenure, where the size of the family determined the size of land.Figes, p. 105 This population boom were due to land shortage: the population density of Central Russia matched Western Europe, with the average peasant allotment similar in size to those in Germany and France (at about 2,6 desyatina, roughly 1,1 hectare in 1900), but with only half the grain yield; this sharp difference from the rest of Europe was caused by the heavily outdated methods used by the Russian peasants in Central Russia: instead of the heavy iron plough low pulled by four to six horses in Western Europe, central Russian farmers often used a light wooden plough pulled by one horse or two oxen; they also used a small hand-sickle compared to the scythe or reaping hook which had been in use in Western Europe for over 50 years; sowing, winnowing and threshing was still done by hand compared to mechanised production in the rest of Europe; the use of chemical fertilisers were greatly below European standards; and advanced field rotations (alternative between cereals and root crops) were still largely unknown, while having been introduced in Western Europe in the mid-eighteenth century during the agricultural revolution.Figes, p. 105‚Äì106 To feed themselves more land was cultivated as few peasants had the money to modernise their farms, and this was accomplished by reducing the amount of communal pasture lands in the three-field system, which had the effect of reducing the livestock size and therefore also the main source of fertiliser, and exhausting the soil. By the end of the century one in three households did not own a horse, and had to either rent one or attach it to themselves and pull the plow themselves.Figes, p. 106 The seed of further conflict in the central agricultural zone was found in the 'most tempting solution' of the peasantry's land hunger, which they could see every day from their villages: the estates of the squires, with nobles owning one third of all arable land in Russia in the 1870s. By 1905 this number was 22 percent, mainly due to the peasant communes' buying up land, increasing the percentage of peasant landownership to 68 per cent from 58 in the same time-span.Figes, p. 106‚Äì107 The need for more land to cultivate caused by the boom in peasant population also led to one-third of the gentry's land being rented out, often at extortionate prices, with peasants agreeing to high prices out of necessity; this made the rental values increase to seven times the size, and this gave income for the gentry of the late 1800s to live on. An arc of provinces at the southern edge of the Central Agricultural Zone was where the agrarian violence ‚Äì the peasants' war against the squires ‚Äì of the revolution was concentrated, presenting a distinctive distribution: from Samara and Saratov, through Tambov, Voronezh, Kursk, Kharkov, Chernigov, Ekaterinoslav, Kherson and Poltava, all the way to Kiev and Podolia in the southwest. This 'transitional region' of overpopulation and large landownership by the gentry, with high land rents and low wages, but with fertile soil and decently long growing seasons favourable to the development of commercial mechanised farming and cultivation of wheat, sugar-beet, etc. were, according to Figes, 'caught in the worst of all possible worlds: between the old pre-capitalist system of agriculture in the centre, and the emergent system of commercial farming at the periphery'. Though at extortionate prices, the leasing of land from the gentry managed most peasants to just about survive during the economic agricultural price depression between 1876 and 1896. As the price of cereals rose and the price of transportation fell, however, many landowners turned their estates into commercial farms, greatly increasing the share of landownership by the gentry between 1900 and 1914 (an increase of one third, but even higher in the 'transitional regions', like in Poltava Province where their share doubled). This resulted in rented out land being withdrawn, or rented out at even higher prices, and the lease system being altered from a money rent to labour rent (otrabotka), perceived by the peasants as a new form of serfdom. With a modernisation of their farms, the need for peasant labour also decreased, reducing wages in the process. Within the final decades of the Russian Empire, millions of peasants had been driven off the land due to poverty, or a misfortune like the death of a family member, which was very difficult to handle economically for a severely indebted household. Saratov was one of the areas of where the communal system was dominant. Prime Minister Stolypin, who had been Marshal of the Kovno Nobility for thirteen years from 1889, was struck by the differences in peasant living standards and wealth between the Kovno region and Saratov Province where he was Governor from 1903. Stolypin whose wife O. B. Neidgardt owned an estate in Kovno Province, a Polish-Lithuanian province where the communal system had never been in place, where peasants owned farms privately, and with farming techniques like those in use in the neighbouring Kingdom of Prussia which were vastly superior to those used by communal tenures in Central Russia. Saratov Province on the other hand, albeit rich in land, was under the communal system, and its peasants were among the poorest and most rebellious in the entire Empire.Figes, p. 222‚Äì223 Saratov was also the site of the most destruction of gentry property during the Russian peasant uprising of 1905‚Äì6, and it was from these events and this province Stolypin got his conviction confirmed, and which brought him to St. Petersburg with his agrarian reform whose cornerstone was the abolishing of the communal system and the establishing of a peasant landowning class. His reforms were resisted by the nobility, unionised as the United Nobility, and commune elders, which tended to be reactionary and dominant, resisting modernisation, and conflict arose between those wanting to separate and become private landowners and the communes; this can be seen in the life of Sergey Semyonov and his struggle against the commune elder Maliutin.Figes, p. 232‚Äì235 Most peasants of Central Russia and the Central Agricultural Region, the communal area to which Stolypin's reforms had been addressed, were not affected, and the reform failed to alter the communal way of life.Figes, p. 239 History The Central Agricultural Zone was the main area of colonisation in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. The centre of agricultural production moved to the region at the same time, and barschina emerged as principal peasant obligation. In these areas nearly 85 per cent of the serf population lived during the latter third of the seventeenth century.Blum, p. 394 At the time of the Emancipation, the Central Agricultural Region was one of the areas, alongside the 'black earth governorates' where the nobility wanted to free the serfs with as little land as possible (or none), and were willing to free their serfs without indemnification (or even a small one) if they were able to keep all of or most of the land for themselves.Blum, p. 583 At the time of the Crimean War, the Russian Army was overstretched: it was an army consisting of peasants and serfs, and the relatively small population of European Russia compared to the rest of Europe (which was its size) was compounded by the fact that most of the serfs were located in the central agricultural zone, far from any border where they might be needed. =First World War= During the First World War the commercial farms and big estates were hit badly by the war as mobilisation left them without much of the needed hired labour, and who could not buy needed equipment due to the altered production during the war. This resulted in large portions of gentry land being rented out to the more economically sound peasants, as they were less hit by labour shortage as the government only drafted the excess peasant population, and who made their own simple tools. Therefore, the productive area of the peasantry in the central agricultural zone increased from 47 to 64 million desyatina (513 to 699 million hectares), while the estates productive area fell from 21 to 7 million (229 to 76,5 million hectares) in the same time-span, 1913‚Äì1916.Figes, p. 298 =Revolution= The differences between the central agricultural zone and the wealthier periphery areas could be clearly seen during the Russian Revolution, when the strongholds of the revolution fell within the central agricultural zone, while the more wealthy agricultural regions on the periphery remained firm areas for the counter-revolution. During the Russian Constituent Assembly election of 1917, the Socialist Revolutionary Party gained 16 million votes (38 per cent of the total), where most of the votes came from peasants in the Central Agricultural Zone and Siberia.Figes, p. 507 References Bibliography   Russian Empire Regions of Russia ","title":"Central Agricultural Zone (Russia)"},{"id":"51325607","text":"Evelyn Rivera Banquett (born 3 December 1997) is a Colombian sprinter.

The apse of the Langon Chapel is in the background The Doorway from Moutiers-Saint-Jean is a portal dating from c 1250, originally for the monastery of Moutiers-Saint- Jean, near Dijon, Burgundy, France, and installed at The Cloisters, New York City, since 1932.Barnet, 70 It was designed in the Gothic style and carved from white oolitic limestone. The abbey was founded in the 5th century, and became a major center of influence. The abbey was patronised by a line of kings and nobles over the centuries; at one the time it was financed by the dukes of Burgundy.Young, 78 Moutiers-Saint-Jean was sacked, burned and rebuilt a number of times; in 1567 the Huguenot army struck off the heads of the two kings.Little, 67 In 1797, after the French Revolution, the entire building was sold as rubble for rebuilding. It lay in ruin for decades, with the sculpture severely defaced, before the door's transfer to New York, where it is now situated between the Romanesque Hall and the Langon Chapel. The doorway, the main portal of the abbey, was probably built as the south transept door, facing the cloister. It can be linked stylistically to a number of other similar contemporary works in France. The sculptured forms of the donors, flanking either side of the doorway, probably represent the early Frankish kings Clovis I (d. 511), who converted to Christianity c 496, and his son Chlothar I (d. 561).\\"Doorway from Moutiers-Saint-Jean\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 14 August 2016.Rorimer (1972), 28 The piers are lined with elaborate and highly detailed rows of statuettes which are mostly set in niches,Forsyth, 57 and are badly damaged; most have been decapitated. The doorway has been described as \\"without doubt the finest Gothic portal in America\\",Forsyth, 33 while the Cloisters considers it amongst their most prized objects,Rorimer (1972), 31 due mainly to the richness and delicacy of its style and the care shown to its overall composition. Style Art historians detect at least two different hands working simultaneously on the structure's architectural elements, in particular the two outer pier capitals (which seem to be earlier in style than the other capitals)Forsyth, 43 on either side are of a different style and type. However, it is thought that both sculptors worked on either embrasure, so that neither right nor left can be fully attributed to either hand.Forsyth, 41 Given the size and form of the outer piers, it is likely that the portal was originally beneath vaulting covering an ambulatory passage. A 1689 engraving also suggests this. Art historian Bonnie Young observes that although individual styles are mixed, the frame overall forms a \\"harmonious and magnificent whole\\", and contains naturalistic carvings wholly different from the more common Romanesque type.Young, 7 The overall style of the carvings has been described as \\"pseudo- realism\\", in that for example the heads of the kings at first seem to be portraits, but on closer examination they are idealised types, while the foliage may seem to be botanically correct and based on direct observation, but in reality they are generalised, rather than based on specific and identifiable species.Forsyth, 42 File:Doorway from Moutiers-Saint-Jean a.JPGFile:Doorway from Moutiers-Saint-Jean c.JPGFile:Doorway from Moutiers-Saint- Jean b.JPGFile:Doorway from Moutiers-Saint-Jean d.JPGArchitecture The two kings are positioned beneath canopies, and are flanked by colonnettes. They were for a time believed to be David and Solomon, but were identified as Clovis and Chlothar in part from the large scrolls held in their hands, which are more associated with early medieval nobles than biblical figures. The scroll held by Clovis is thought to be the founding document for the abbey, that held by Chlothar the legal confirmation. The capitals are elaborately decorated with carvings of foliage. Carvings of angels hover in the archivolts above the kings.Forsyth, 38 Tympanum with the Coronation of the Virgin There are three arches linking the doorway to the overhead vault.Forsyth, 40 A trilobed arch over the tympanum, a middle arch with kneeling angels, and an outermost arch resting on the piers.Forsyth, 39 The tympanum contains carvings showing the Coronation of the Virgin, a popular theme for the tympana of 13th century French doorways.Forsyth, 44 The passage has suffered some damage, and some figures have lost their heads or hands. The passage shows the Virgin sitting to Christ's right (the place of honor), bending toward him as he crowns her with his right hand. Her arms are raised in a gesture of veneration. He is holding a jeweled disk, representing his dominion, and is positioned on two lions, indicating that he is occupying the throne of Solomon.Forsyth, 49 Mary's feet rest on a serpent-like creature, probably an adder. Most of the statuettes have been decapitated, but the figures are thought to include representations of John the Baptist, Simeon and the Christ child, Moses with the serpent, Abraham and Isaac, either David or Jeremiah, and Elijah alongside a raven. They can mostly be grouped into pairs, though are not arranged chronologically.Forsyth, 58 Other elements from the Moutiers- Saint-Jean abbey, including Romanesque capitals, are kept at the Louvre, at the Fogg Museum, Harvard University, and in a private collection in Bard-les- Epoisses. A foilete capital from the abbey, with a head very similar to those of the two kings, is in Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.Little, 66 Acquisition and installation In place and in ruin at Moutiers-Saint-Jean before removal to New York The abbey was sacked in 1567, in 1595, and in 1629. The doorway suffered damage during the Wars of Religion and during the French Revolution the abbey was almost completely destroyed.Forsyth, 35 Most of the archival documents related to the abbey were lost, but we know from some accounts and engravings how it might have looked. For a period in the 19th century it was walled up. Its acquisition and installation was led by curator James Rorimer. It was sold by a Mr. Cambillard, a farmer on whose land the abbey was situated, to Jean Peslier, a dealer working out of Vezelay, who passed it to Joseph Brummer, from whom the Metropolitan made their purchase.Forsyth, 37 Around 1790 or 1791 the kings' heads were removed, but located by Rorimer,Rorimer, James. \\"Thirteenth-Century Statues of Kings Clovis and Clothar at The Cloisters\\".

His arrest was part of the Vietnamese government's latest crackdown on bloggers and citizen journalists including Formosa reporter Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Ho√°. He was also later charged with \\"failing to execute judgements\\" under Article 304 of the Vietnamese Penal Code. Oai's trial was scheduled to begin Monday August 21, 2017 but the court postponed the trial for unknown reasons. On September 18, 2017 the People's Court in Hoang Mai town, Nghe An province sentenced Nguyen Van Oai to three years in prison for the first charge and two years for the second charge giving him a total of five years imprisonment. He was also sentenced to four years of house arrest. Relatives of Oai were not permitted to enter the courtroom, despite authorities calling the trial to be a \\"public trial\\".  Prison Treatment and Conditions  Amnesty International reported in 2013 that Vietnamese prisoners of conscience ‚Äúare held in harsh conditions amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.‚Äù Dissident prisoners receive rations that are spoiled, littered with garbage and provided only up to 10 litres of water for drinking and washing. Inmates of the Catholic faith are further discriminated against by being denied religious reading materials and prohibited from praying or observing their rights, with no other means of expressing their protests beyond hunger strikes.  International Response  On July 25, 2012, Allen Weiner, director of the Stanford Program in International and Comparative Law at Stanford Law School, filed a petition with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UNWGAD) in Geneva contesting the illegal arrest and on-going detention of seventeen Vietnamese social and political activists. The petition requests the UNWGAD to call upon the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) to release all of the detainees immediately to remedy the human rights violations stemming from their arbitrary arrest and detention. On November 28, 2013, the UNWGAD had ruled in favor of the petition, stating that Vietnam violated its international human rights obligations and must ‚Äúimmediate[ly] release‚Äù the prisoners of conscience. Following the 2013 trial, Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, condemned the arrest and calls for the \\"convictions to be squashed immediately\\". He states \\"The conviction of yet more peaceful activists is another example of a government that is increasingly afraid of the opinions of its own people. Instead of imprisoning critics, the Vietnamese government should be honoring them for their efforts to address the myriad problems facing the country that the government itself has also identified.‚Äù On August 18, 2017 RSF called for the immediate release of Oai in response to his trial scheduled on August 21, 2017 (which was postponed to September 18). RSF said: ‚ÄúThe charges against him are just a pretext for putting a stop to online posts that annoy the regime.

He is married to Anat Rotem, a lawyer, and the father of three children. Research Rotem's research focuses on governmental or regulatory concessions extended by the government to businesses in financial distress. A regulatory concession may help the business and its claimholders‚Äîcreditors, employees and shareholders‚Äîbut it also undermines the interest of the general public, represented by the relevant regulator. Rotem suggested a way to balance these conflicting interests and minimize the harm to the public interest and to the claimholders. He claimed that when forced to extend a regulatory concession the government should be made a formal claimant of the firm seeking the concession. The purpose of this approach is, first, to ensure that the government's entitlements against the financially distressed firm mirror its unique position as a potential investor with external interests that relate generally to the public. The general public can be compensated directly, not only indirectly, for its \\"investment\\" in the financially distressed business. Second, to deter potential firms from seeking government concessions. Third, to demonstrate equal treatment to a firm receiving a regulatory concession and to firms which do not receive such a concession. Fourth, to compensate the general public for any possible \\"residual\\" harm to its welfare as a result of any subsequent breach of the regulatory regime which may unavoidably occur once the regulatory concession is extended and the general regulatory scheme is breached. Rotem's research also focuses on private international law (conflict of laws, in US terms). His research focuses on the effects of extraterritorial regulation, the jurisdiction of local courts to adjudicate civil lawsuits against foreign defendants; the recognition of foreign judgments; and choice of law in collective action and derivative action lawsuits. Another area of Rotem's research focuses on the financial distress of small and medium-sized businesses. Rotem analyzed the phenomenon of \\"The Phoenix Syndrome\\" underwhich shareholders of small to medium-sized business transfer the assets of their financially distressed business to a new enterprise while hiding such a transfer from the unsecured creditors of the business, thus securing, at least for a limited period of time, the possibility of continuing operation of their business. Rotem explained the complexities arising in such situations and offered a novel regulatory solution taking into consideration the costs associated with opting to a formal rehabilitation procedure for financially distressed small- to medium- sized businesses.

It occupies a modest square parcel, now completely surrounded by D.A.R. State Park. It is a large two-story brick building, covered by a hipped roof with a triangular gable at the center of the east-facing front facade. The roofline has a dentillated cornice, with a half-round fan in the front gable. The main facade is five bays wide and symmetrical, with the main entrance at the center of the ground floor, and an elaborate Palladian window above it on the second floor. The entrance is flanked by wide sidelight windows, and is sheltered by an early 20th-century Colonial Revival gabled porch.

He built his first house not far from the site of this one, supposedly on the site of a previous French home that had been burned during the French and Indian War. He served in the Vermont militia during the Revolution, and his house was burned by the British during the war. He rebuilt that house after the war ended, and built this imposing residence in the 1790s as its replacement. His land was acquired in 1934 by the state chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, who donated most of it to the state for the formation of the state park.

To celebrate the occasion during its annual meeting that year, federation members burned the mortgage papers on the front lawn of its headquarters.Rollins, Hatfield, and Utz, pp. 6 and 8 (Item number 8, pages 3 and 4). =Membership= By 1914 the Indiana federation included ninety-seven clubs and 1,568 members. Although it had eighty-nine clubs with a combined membership of 1,670 by 1924, the federation's membership declined during the Great Depression to fifty-six clubs in 1933. Membership also dwindled in subsequent decades.Hine, pp. 59‚Äì60. Building history and description The clubhouse was erected in 1897 at 2034 North Capitol Avenue in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was initially built as a private dwelling for John W. and Sarah P. Minor, the original owners. John Minor was a self-taught lawyer who established the Sentinel Printing Company in Indianapolis in 1883. He served as company secretary-treasurer from 1884 to 1922, and as the company president for the two years prior to his death in 1924. His widow, Sarah, and daughter, Caroline Rodecker, lived in the home until the Indiana State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs purchased it in 1927. Since that time the building has served as the Indiana federation's headquarters.Rollins, Hatfield, and Utz, p. 3 (\\"Statement of Significance\\"). The clubhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The Indiana Historical Bureau and the Indiana Federation of Colored Women's Clubs erected a state historical marker at the site in 1997. The two-and-one-half-story frame building sits on a brick foundation. It has a gable roof with hipped dormers, an enclosed front porch, and a two-story rear wing. The \\"T\\"-plan, Colonial Revival-style home is covered in siding. A carriage house once stood at the rear of the property.Rollins, Hatfield, and Utz, p. 2 (\\"Description\\"). The clubhouse's main facade (east side) has two dormers, each one with three double-hung sash windows. The two-story bay window is now only visible on the second story due to the enclosed front porch. The second story also has two fixed-sash windows and two double-hung windows. The one-story front porch contains the main entrance and two picture windows. The building's south facade has double-hung windows flanking a chimney on all three floors. It also had an enclosed porch, which was later converted to a bathroom. The west facade (rear of the building) has an exterior brick chimney, sash windows, an enclosed back porch, a two-story wing, and a one-story plywood addition on a brick foundation. The north facade has an oriel window, in addition to two fixed-sash windows above two double-hung windows. The clubhouse's interior includes a large meeting room on the first floor. The main space includes two fireplaces, one each on the west and south sides of the room. The building also has two stairways, one at the front and another at the rear of the building.

It was shown on 20 May 1971 on BBC 1 as part of the Play for Today series. It is included in the Ken Loach at the BBC boxset released in 2011, although the recording is of unusually poor quality for a DVD release. Background In 1970, an unofficial strike took place at the Pilkington Glass Works in St. Helens, Lancashire, initially after an error in wage packets but the strikers later demanded a wage rise to ¬£25 per week. The cause was described in the New Statesman as 'the cumbersome structure of different bonus and shift payments which meant that men doing similar jobs took home different and unpredictable pay packets'. Six thousand workers went on strike for two months. The BBC insisted that the name of the company be changed from \\"Pilkington\\" to \\"Wilkinson\\", and the location moved from St. Helens to the Staffordshire Potteries. However, the film begins with an on- screen caption that reads, \\"A film based principally on events that took place in Lancashire in the Spring of 1970\\". The Trotskyist dramatist Jim Allen visited the strikers to show support and showed them the film The Big Flame, which he had written and Ken Loach had directed. Jim Allen has given an account of how he was subsequently persuaded to write a similar script about the strike at Pilkington. :So, one old bloke said to me, \\"Will you write a film for us?\\" And I was really up to my neck in work, committed. I said, \\"I'm pressed for time.\\" So this old fella said, \\"come to the toilet with me, I'll show you my 'war medals'.\\" We got to the toilet and he whips his shirt off, and his back was lacerated, as if he'd been whipped by glass, and then he put his shirt back on. He said, \\"I've worked here all my life, never been on strike and I've been told that unless I scab, they'll take my pension away.\\" Anyway, this fella refused to scab, and he finished up with no pension and he was sweeping up in a Co-Op shop in St. Helens. Well, that was moral blackmail. So, I said, \\"yes, of course, I'll write a script.\\" This man became the inspiration for the character Charlie in the film. The strike took place near the end of Harold Wilson's first government. The unofficial strikes and student protests in France in May 1968 were influential amongst the left-wing in the UK, and there was a subsequent increase in strikes taken outside of the union framework, most notably the miners' strike of October 1969. The union at Pilkington, the General and Municipal Worker‚Äôs Union, was strongly supportive of Wilson and did not support the strike launched by the glass workers in 1970. Passed under the new government of Edward Heath, the Industrial Relations Act 1971 made such unofficial strikes illegal. This Act is mentioned towards the end of the film. The Rank and File has numerous similarities to The Big Flame. As well as sharing the same director and playwright, the films also share most of the lead actors: Peter Kerrigan, Bill Dean, Tommy Summers and Joan Flood. As The Big Flame was the more popular film, The Rank and File has become overlooked. Plot A family glassware company dominates the town. There have been no strikes in a hundred years, but sheet workers walk out over a pay discrepancy. When other grievances come to light, all six factories go on strike. The union, the General Municipal, does not support the strike. Eddie Marsden then sets up a Rank and File Strike Committee to organise the strike outside of the union, doing business such as organising pickets and collecting for a hardship fund. The Committee meets in a room above a pub with seven members: Les, Johnny, Eddie, Billy, Bert, Mike and Jerry. They befriend a journalist who was sent to cover the strike, even though he normally only covers gardening news. Whilst Les is typing out a strike bulletin, a brick is thrown through the back window. Les fails to catch the perpetrators. During the next committee meeting, they receive a phone call from the journalist to inform them that the General Municipal has secretly accepted a ‚Ç§3, (12%) pay rise, which is lower than the Committee was demanding. When the General Municipal's leader Holtby arrives to address the meeting, he is booed and pelted with stones, and has to be given a police escort away. A vote by show of hands is passed for the strike to continue. Holtby then tells the media that the Communist Party have infiltrated the workforce, but the workers deny this when asked by journalists. Many strikers are falling behind with rent and evicted from their homes. A female striker is shown sleeping with her baby on the street. She is afraid that the baby will be taken away if she presents herself to a charity or to a welfare office. A march takes place to the union headquarters to demand appropriation of the union's hardship fund. After some marchers (including Les) are arrested, the others discover an old union banner from the 1926 General Strike and carry on marching with it. Les's wife subsequently leaves him, but agrees to give the typewriter for the strike bulletins to Eddie. A group of men walk back to work under police escort. They are called scabs (a term that is extremely offensive in some parts of England) and spat at, before a scuffle between pickets and police. Shortly afterwards, Johnny takes a taxi to Wood Street, but the taxi driver takes an unexpected term and ignores instructions. When Johnny gets out, he is beaten up by hired muscle. The other members of the committee wait for Johnny at the hospital, and then mock him when he emerges in bandages. The Trade Union Congress invites the Committee to negotiate on the strike in London. As the strike is taking its toll on the committee both financially and physically, they decided to enter negotiations. Eddie is elected to attend the meeting and obtain written confirmation of the promises made by the General Municipal and the TUC. They return with a signed document which states that there will be no victimisation once the men return to work. The strike is then called off. Once back at work, the agreement is not honoured. Eddie is followed around by the foreman and production manager constantly. The victimised leaders return to London to discuss the agreement signed with the General Electric and TUC, but the request for a meeting is denied. A new unofficial strike is then called, but collapses after three days. Eddie, Billy and other members of the Committee are sacked and blacklisted. Charlie is allowed to keep his job, but loses his pension rights and his wage is reduced to the level of an apprentice. The film ends with Eddie critiquing the Industrial Relations Act 1971 for forbidding unofficial strikes. He quotes Trotsky's vision of hope that the young will go on to make a brighter future.

Loach has said that the film is too specific to the events of the Pilkington strike, which were quickly forgotten. Allen has questioned whether his script was a success. :Having written plays like The Rank and File about collective action, the Pilkington Glass Strike, I think that if you don't take an individual you lose the thread. The Lump is expressed in individuals. It's strong men hustling, fighting. The Rank and File was written in three weeks, and had to be done the way it was. The trouble was the imagination limps behind the reality behind Pilkington... If you get too didactic, politically or otherwise, as I probably did in The Rank and File, it can be a lantern lecture. To express political ideas you need to fuse the individual and the collective... You should allow objective reality to filter through the subjective. As well as being attacked by right-wing newspapers, the film is also criticised by many on the political left for its portrayal of trade unions. A member of the Communist Party of Great Britain suggested that the film was put out by the BBC to attack trade unions as bureaucratic and dominated by Stalinists. John Williams described the film as \\"an unashamedly partial work that shows both the strengths and weaknesses of a politically committed approach to art, in that those characters who have Allen's sympathy are convincingly written and portrayed, while others are often little more than pantomime villains\\". He writes that it differs from The Big Flame in that the latter contains characters who theorise the strike in Marxist terms and portrays a dispute with far-reaching consequences, whereas The Rank and File is more constrained by the facts of the Pilkington case, which was a brief strike led by workers who were not aligned with any Marxist group. Williams feels that the Trotsky quote at the end of the film \\"seems clumsily inserted, as if Allen and Loach needed to add a wider, revolutionary aspect to the play\\". He also suggests that the two films were broadcast by the BBC at a time when many of those in the Plays department held similar politics to Allen and Loach. Jacob Leigh wrote that The Rank and File concentrates more than The Big Flame on the collective experiences of the strikers, by showing cases in which strikers are attacked, arrested and deserted by their spouses. The scene in which Charlie is \\"given a chance to mend his ways\\" is analysed by Leigh. :\\"The film proposes that the employers do not care about Charlie: they have exploited him all his life and continue to do so, yet he takes his job back. Apart from one shot of the personnel officer, Loach films this scene with a close-up of Charlie: his face is haggard and he appears worn out: but he can only acquiesce. Throughout the shot, the personnel officer's head is on the left side of the frame, taking up about a quarter of the framed space. In the foreground, and close in, is Charlie's gloomy face: cracked glasses perched on his nose, eyes tired, greying hair greased back. \\"Right, thank you sir,\\" he says. The scene ends with a freeze-frame on his face: he is one of the casualties of the strike.\\" References External links *IMDb entry for The Rank and File * 1971 television films 1971 television plays BBC television dramas Docudrama films British films Labour disputes in the United Kingdom Social realism Films directed by Ken Loach ","title":"The Rank and File"},{"id":"51326190","text":"Flanner House Homes is a national historic district located at Indianapolis, Indiana.

A post office called Lindberg was established in 1911, and remained in operation until 1925. While pushing through the last leg of the Tacoma Eastern Railroad from Ashford (1904) to Morton (1910), they established a station at the crossing of East Fork Tilton River called Glenavon. In 1911, Gustaf Lindberg, established a logging camp and company town near the Glenavon station, which in addition to the logging camp included a shingle mill and saw mill. Due to financial difficulties, Lindberg lost his property in the mid 1920s, but the camp continued with the name Lindberg & Hoby Logging Camp into the 1940s. As of 1928, there were two train stops bracketing Lindberg, East Fork (formerly Glenavon) to the north and Coal Canyon to the south, the latter name eventually replaced Lindberg.

This is normally lower than collective agreement coverage rate, which refers to all people whose terms of work are collectively negotiated. Trade unions bargain with employers to improve pay, conditions, and decision-making in workplaces; higher rates of union density within an industry or country will generally indicate higher levels of trade union bargaining power, lower rates of density will indicate less bargaining power. Causes The causes of higher or lower union membership are widely debated. Common causes are often identified as including the following: *whether a jurisdiction encourages sectoral collective bargaining (higher coverage) or enterprise bargaining (lower coverage) *whether collective agreements to create a closed shop or allow automatic enrollment in union membership are lawful *whether the government, for instance through a Ministry or Department of Labour, actively promotes collective agreement coverage with a power to impose terms if employers refuse to bargain with the workforce *whether a country enables collective agreements to be extended by government regulations to all workers when the coverage rate reaches a majority in a sector, or similar level *whether laws on collective bargaining and strikes are more or less favourable By country In the United States in 2015 there were 14.8m union members, and 16.4m people covered by collective bargaining or union representation.

He is known for his realistic still life paintings.  Biography  Jackson graduated in 1986 from the University of Delaware with a BS degree in electrical engineering. As an elective during his senior year in college, Jackson took his first painting class. From 1986 to 1990 he worked at Motorola as a systems engineer and designed radio systems. He was an assistant pastor for Cedar Ridge Community Church in the Washington DC suburbs from 1990 to 1996. He has been working full-time as an artist since 1996. Jackson was the Evansville Museum of Arts, History and Science's 2012 artist-in-residence.  Career  Jackson's paintings are considered representational and influenced by pop art. His usual medium is oil painting on stretched linen. He primarily works from life, setting up unique arrangements when possible in his studio before executing the paintings. His works contain themes of humor and nostalgia. A monograph about his work was published in 2012 by Philip Eliasoph: ‚ÄúThe paintings ... are inescapably a bundle of contradictions, satirical complexities, and witty subterfuge. Essentially, Jackson is a uniquely self-realized painter. His feisty independence is fortified with healthy dosages of non-conforming eccentricity, with a small touch of screwball nuttiness.‚Äù His work has been shown in over 30 solo exhibitions and 100 group exhibitions in the United States and is in numerous private, corporate, and museum collections.

It was discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft on its \\"Second Light\\" mission. It is located about 570 light-years (174 parsecs, or nearly km) away from Earth in the constellation of Virgo. The object was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. The minor planet is notable because it is the first observed planetary object to transit a white dwarf, providing clues of its possible interactions when its parent star reached the end of its lifetime as a red giant. Characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= WD 1147+017 b is a sub-Earth, an exoplanet that has a mass and radius smaller than that of Earth. It likely has a surface temperature of around based on its extreme proximity to its star. It has a likely radius of 0.15 , around 1,000 kilometers, which is about twice the size of the dwarf planet Ceres in the Solar System, which has a radius of about . The exoplanetary object has a mass of 0.0006678 (4.45 times the mass of Ceres). =Host star= The planetary object orbits a (DB-type) white dwarf. It has ended its main sequence lifetime and will continue to cool for billions of years to come in the future. Based on recent studies and its mass, the star was likely an early F-type main sequence star (spectral type F0) before it became a red giant. The star has a mass of 0.6 and a radius of 0.02 (1.4 ). It has a temperature of 15900 K and its cooling age is 175 million years. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 17. Therefore, it is far too dim to be seen with the naked eye. =Orbit= WD 1145+017 b orbits its host star with an orbital period of 0.1875 days (4.5 hours) and an orbital radius of about 0.005 times that of Earth's (750,000 km), twice the distance between the Moon and the Earth, while Mercury orbits the Sun at about 0.38 AU (57 million km). It is one of the shortest orbital periods known so far, with several other exoplanets having shorter periods.  Vaporization  WD 1145+047 b is currently being vaporized by its star because of its extreme proximity to it. White dwarfs are usually the size of the Earth, and have half as much mass as they did during the main sequence. Due to this and the searing hot temperature of the stellar remnant, rocky minerals are being vaporized off the surface of this object, into orbit around the star, which is responsible for a hot dusty disk that was observed around its host star. It is likely that WD 1145+017 b is bound to disintegrate in the future (around 100‚Äì200 million years from now) due to further vaporization and ablation. The minor planet is likely being pelted by several smaller objects of up to , as it is likely not just a single object orbiting the white dwarf star, but likely several planetesimals, which is probably responsible for some of the variations in the light curve data. The smaller objects can also throw debris into orbit upon impact, which may also be responsible for the variations. In some way, it helps explain how a planetary system may evolve after its host star has thrown off its outer layers in a planetary nebula, eventually dying as a black dwarf.  Discovery  The planetary object was discovered by the Kepler spacecraft on its secondary mission, K2: Second Light, an extension of its original mission from 2009 to 2013. Observations were taken over a period of about a month starting from April 2015 using the 1.2-meter telescope at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory along with another telescope located in Chile. The white dwarf star was not originally targeted as part of the mission, however data revealed that there was dips in this star's light curve, and as such investigations were made to figure out what causing the dips, just like the same procedure that was used on the stars that were targeted by the K2 mission. Two transits were detected on 11 April over a period of 4 hours apart, and again on 17 April, however this one was 180¬∞ out of phase (inclination probably) from the 11 April transits. The spectra of WD 1145+047 was studied and it revealed that the star contained magnesium, aluminum, silicon, calcium, iron, and nickel. The settling times for these elements were much shorter than the cooling age of the white dwarf (175 Myr), so they must have been deposited fairly recently, as much as probably only 1‚Äì2 million years ago. It was suggested that this was evidence for a disintegrating rocky minor planet orbiting around WD 1145+047 with a low mass of 0.0006678 , comparable to the mass of some of the large asteroids in the Solar System. The discovery was then published in the online journal Nature on 22 October 2015, describing the nature of the system.A disintegrating minor planet transiting a white dwarf 22 October 2015.

In his work, Feintuch ‚Äúuses the body to pursue psychologically suggestive meanings,‚Äù and in many of his paintings he has used himself as a model. In their combination of the ‚Äúsublime with the banal, the serious and the ridiculous,‚Äù Feintuch‚Äôs paintings have been consistently seen as both comic and rooted in psychological life. Life Robert Feintuch was born in 1953 in Jersey City, New Jersey, and raised in Levittown, Pennsylvania. He moved to New York in 1970 to study at Cooper Union, and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1974. He graduated with a Master of Fine Arts degree from Yale University School of Art in New Haven, Connecticut in 1976. Feintuch began to exhibit in galleries in the mid-1980s, and his work has been shown in galleries and museums in the United States and Europe. Early Work: Abstract and Ear Paintings Trained as an abstract painter in the 1970s, when minimalism was a dominant way of working, Feintuch made a slow and gradual transition towards painting figuratively. His first solo exhibition in New York in 1988 included abstract paintings with broad expanses of color, alongside paintings of ears isolated on black fields. In his subsequent solo exhibition at Daniel Newburg Gallery in 1992, Feintuch exhibited large-scale black paintings, all containing life- sized images of ears, and he continued to work exclusively in black and white until 1996. Figurative Paintings In the early 1990s, Feintuch began working from objects he had in the studio. His 1996 exhibition at CRG Gallery was titled ‚ÄúThe Middle Ages‚Äù and it included black and white paintings of mundane objects like buckets, clocks, and ladders, juxtaposed with life-sized paintings of suits of armor. Having worked with body fragments, including ears and arms, since the 1980s, Feintuch started to use himself as a model in the mid-90s, and he simultaneously returned to working in full color. Shortly after, he started a series of paintings of clouds, and clouds began to show up as a suggestive and ongoing metaphoric motif in his figure paintings, as in his 2013 painting, entitled Feet Up. Feet Up, 2013, combines parts of the artist‚Äôs body with clouds in an image that ‚Äúconjures Gothic renderings of heaven and the slapstick of ‚ÄúTom and Jerry‚Äù cartoons.‚Äù Critical reception In the catalogue for an exhibition of the Sonnabend Collection at the Serralves Foundation, Suzanne Cotter said that ‚ÄúFeintuch‚Äôs work embraces a kind of productive ambiguity‚Ä¶he uses the tension between the heroic, eternal quality of mythological figures and themes of mundane quotidian life to reinterpret myth '...figuring and reliving it with deadpan theatricality, almost to the point of farce.‚Äô\\" Other writers have remarked on relationships between Feintuch‚Äôs work and slapstick, seeing in the paintings a presentation of self, that in its ‚Äúmix of heroism and humiliation (or myth and cartoon),‚Äù is both vulnerable and comic. ‚Äú‚ÄôCro-Magnon Bacchus‚Äô‚Äù is the title given‚Ä¶to the portrait of an unathletic, rather ectomorphic, hen-breasted type (whose) club dangles down like a languid phallus.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶if Mr. Feintuch is a cynic about human nature ‚Äî or the making of art, or the nature of truth, or the possibility of beauty ‚Äî he is, fortunately, almost as funny as Diogenes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese works wrestle with the debilitations and humiliations mortality imposes on us, but also with the possibility of grace, which we find in beauty and in hope.‚Äù Often seen as addressing painterly concerns, many writers have remarked on the unusual luminosity of his paintings: ‚ÄúFeintuch‚Äôs a terrific painter, whatever the subject.

Zander and published by Artworx for the Atari 8-bit family. In 1984, Artworx considered re-publishing the game as a tie-in to the television series The Dukes of Hazzard. Gameplay Hazard Run is played from an overhead perspective, with vertically scrolling arcade-style gameplay. The player, controlling the Gee Lee car, must escape a crooked sheriff while avoiding hazards such as ducks, fences, rocks, rivers, and trees. The player is given five cars, which act as lives. The player will lose a car if an obstacle is hit. The player's car can be driven on two tires when it is necessary to maneuver through tight areas. The game features five courses, known as \\"runs\\", with each one longer than the previous one. The player is required to save up extra gasoline in later levels, and must do so by driving over gas cans. The game's perspective switches to a side view when the player's vehicle approaches a river. If the vehicle successfully jumps across the river, the perspective reverts to an aerial view. Upon clearing the final river, the pursuing police vehicle lands in the water. Bars from the song \\"Dixie\\" play after each river jump, regardless of the player's outcome. Reception Derrick Bang, writing for Softline magazine, wrote that the game's \\"major problem\\" was its joystick control scheme. Bang also criticized the \\"Dixie\\" music played in each of the game's river sections: \\"it would be nicer (and preferable psychologically) to hear something different as a reward for making the jump.\\" Bang concluded that the game \\"is just a bit too primitive for today's market and will be of interest mostly to neophytes and young children.\\" Ted Salamone of Electronic Games called the game \\"well conceived\\" but \\"poorly executed.\\" Salamone criticized the game's \\"sloppy play action\\" and wrote that the graphics \\"finish in first and last place. Some (the overhead view of a car and trees) are done well, while others (the auto's side view when jumping water) look like a sixth grader's first art project.\\" In 1991, New Atari User gave the game a \\"mediocre\\" score of two stars out of four, calling it \\"Pretty shallow\\" while also noting its rarity. Legacy In 1984, Artworx considered licensing the title of the television series The Dukes of Hazzard in order to re-publish Hazard Run as a tie-in. Artworx later rejected the idea considering the aftermath of the 1983 video game crash, which involved many licensed games receiving a negative reputation for their simple concepts and gameplay. The cost to purchase the license was also deemed too high, considering the small size of the software market at the time. The Dukes of Hazzard was the only title Artworx ever seriously considered licensing.

Biography  The son of a goldsmith, Grouvelle was placed with a notary, who, seeing him busier making verses than acts, dismissed him. Chamfort then took him as secretary, and when he left the job of secretary to the Prince of Cond√©, Chamfort arranged for Grouvelle to take his place. Grouvelle was successful in Versailles where the Queen had his little opera Prunes performed which he had written with Desprez. 20 June 1788, he had a comedy entitled l‚Äô√âpreuve d√©licate presented at the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais but it had one performance only and was not published. When the French Revolution broke out, Grouvelle adopted its principles, was a founder of the Society of 1789 and published a policy brochure dated from the very Palais Bourbon. Therefore, he could no longer remain in service to the Prince. After he left him, he engaged into an association with Chamfort, Joseph-Antoine Cerutti and Rabaut de Saint- √âtienne in order to publish '. After he became Secretary of the Provisional Executive Council in August 1792, he had to bring to Louis XVI at the Prison du Temple the sentence condemning him to death. Jean-Baptiste Clery, in his memoirs, said that \\"Grouvelle read off with a low, trembling voice, and he came out of prison in a marked agitation\\".

Synopsis A magician, playing the flute, makes a large caterpillar emerge from its cocoon, and then turns it into a woman- butterfly. Infatuated, he tries to capture her with a blanket, turning her into an Arab princess he covets more. But in trying to seduce it, he himself ends up being transformed into a large caterpillar. Production The Brahmin and the Butterfly was inspired by Buatier de Kolta's 1885 magic act Le Cocon, ou Le Ver √† Soie. In the act, de Kolta drew a silkworm on paper; the paper broke to reveal a cocoon, which opened to reveal de Kolta's wife dressed as a butterfly. M√©li√®s appears in the film as the Brahmin. The effects for the film were created using stage machinery and substitution splices. Release and reception Like many of M√©li√®s's films, The Brahmin and the Butterfly was sold both in black-and-white and in a version hand-colored by the studio of Elisabeth Thuillier. The film survives only in black-and-white; in 1979, the film scholar Jacques Malth√™te recreated the hand-colored version using historically authentic technology, applying eight color tones to a black-and- white print.

She captured a number of small prizes in the Channel, including one armed sloop, before she was lost in 1807. Service Jackal was built to a design by Sir John Henslow. The Royal Navy commissioned her in April 1801 under the command of Lieutenant George Pattison, for the Nore. In 1802 Lieutenant William Hicks replaced Pattinson. An investigation by the Victualling Commissioners resulted in a court martial dismissing Hicks from the Navy for what was a kick-back scheme. Further investigation implicated the commanders of six more vessels in accepting over-charging by suppliers at Margate. Lieutenant Charles Tovey Leaver recommissioned Jackal in April 1803. On the afternoon of 29 September 1803, Jackall sighted and chased a sloop running along the shore between Nieuport and Dunkirk. The wind fell so Leaver sent 11 men in a boat to board the quarry. As the British approached, the sloop ran ashore near three field pieces and a small battery of two guns, and her crew of 10 or 12 men escaped on shore. Jackall, which had been using her sweeps, and with the assistance of a light breeze that had arisen, came up and provided support for the boat and the sloop, which the boarding party had gotten off. The sloop turned out to be from Dunkirk, armed with four 2-pounder guns, and possibly serving to transport troops. Despite the fire from the sloop before she grounded, and the guns on shore, which were within 25 yards of the sloop, the British sustained no casualties. The sloop turned out to be San Fa√ßon. In June 1804 Jackall detained and sent into Dover Vrow Elina, of Embden, which was sailing from Dort to France.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4461. Accessed 14 August 2016. In 1804 Lieutenant Charles Stewart replaced Leaver. Stewart was captain on 14 June when Jackall intercepted three luggers off Kent. She was able to capture two, Io, of Deal, and Nancy, both of which turned out to be smuggling brandy and gin from Guernsey. Stewart sent them into Dover. Jackall came into Deal with the loss of her fore top-mast on 23 September.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.318. Still, in October, Jackal detained and sent into Dover Juno, Schels, master, which had been carrying wheat from Amsterdam to Cadiz.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4500. Accessed 14 August 2016. On 10 January 1805 Jackal sailed from Deal with a pilot, Mr Kercaldie, on board to replace the floating light on the Galloper Sand.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 13, p.332. This had broken loose from its moorings in the December gales that swept it through the Downs on 18 December when a Deal boat put two men on board and took it in to Dover.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 13, p.330-1. Jackall was in company with and on 20 April and so shared in the capture on that day of Dorothea. In mid-August Vrow von Scholten, Fitzpatrick, master, came into the Downs after Jackall detained her. Vrow von Scholten had been sailing from St Thomas's to Amsterdam.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4245. Accessed 14 August 2016. On 10 February 1806 Jackall recaptured Pomona, John Lemon, master. Pomona had been sailing from St Kitt's to London when a Dutch privateer had captured her. Jackall sent Pomona into the Downs.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4296. Accessed 14 August 2016. Then on 12 April Jackall arrived in the Downs with two vessels she had detained.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4045. Accessed 14 August 2016. The next day Jackall captured Printz Henrick, Krohn, master. At the end of the month, on 30 April, Jackall captured Mentor, Lutjberg, master. Mentor, of and for Uddevalla, had been sailing from Rochelle.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4055. Accessed 14 August 2016. On 25 June, , , Jackall, and captured sundry Dutch fishing boats. In February 1807, Jackall towed Thames, Maule, master, on a voyage from London to Jamaica, into Ramsgate after Thames ran into difficulties off Fecamp. Maule reported that he had seen the French carry into Dieppe a large ship that had been dismasted. Stewart reported that there were a number of dismasted ships near the coast and that many may have been driven on shore. Furthermore, he had seen a number of men of war dismasted and anchored near the French coast.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4129. Accessed 14 August 2016. Jackall, Furious, , and Minx shared in the proceeds of the capture on 13 April of Twee Gebroeders, Moller, master. Lloyd's List reported the vessel as Twee Gesusters, and that she had been sailing from Normande to Norway when and Jackall had detained her and sent her into the Downs.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4145. Accessed 14 August 2016. Fate On 29 May 1807 Jackal was in the North Sea when she sighted and gave pursuit to a French privateer lugger, which eventually escaped into Dunkirk. As the weather worsened in the evening Jackal attempted to head back to the Downs, but grounded in the night. The crew manned the pumps until dawn, when they discovered that they were on the French shore, about three miles from Calais. As the tide rose, Jackal sank around 5 a.m., at which point the crew took to the rigging. By 8 a.m. the tide had gone out sufficiently that all were able safely to go ashore, whereupon the French took them prisoner. The court martial for the loss of Jackal did not take place until 16 June 1814, presumably after her officers and crew returned from captivity.

She is an actress, author, diplomat, and motivational speaker. Early years Shabazz was born in Queens, New York, on November 16, 1958. Shabazz says her name is Arabic for \\"the gift of God\\" and she is not named after Attila the Hun as her father's autobiography states. In February 1965, her sister Qubilah woke the family in the middle of the night with her screams; the house was on fire.Rickford, pp. 222‚Äì224. Shabazz recalled that night in a 1989 interview: \\"I almost didn't realize how dangerous it was‚Äîmy father was that calm, that together a parent. My eyes were burning, I was coughing, but before you knew it, he had us all out of there, and we were safe at a friend's house. My mother's like that too. Together.\\" A week later, Shabazz was at Manhattan's Audubon Ballroom, with her mother and sisters, when her father was assassinated.Rickford, pp. 226‚Äì232. She was six at the time and reportedly the only one of his children who has clear memories of him. In 2005, she told journalist Gabe Pressman that she remembered the events of that day \\"vividly\\": Shabazz told People in 1983 that she sometimes had flashbacks. \\"I would bump into people from the Nation of Islam, and I thought they were going to do the same thing to me.\\" Childhood and education Shabazz had an apolitical upbringing in a racially integrated neighborhood in Mount Vernon, New York. Her family never took part in demonstrations or attended rallies. She received religious education at the Islamic Center at Riverside Drive and 72nd Street in Manhattan. With her sisters, she joined Jack and Jill, a social club for the children of well-off African Americans. As a teenager, she attended the United Nations International School.Rickford, pp. 347‚Äì348. Although officials at the school prepared for \\"an onslaught of militancy\\" when 13-year-old Shabazz enrolled, \\"instead I walked in wearing my lime-green dress, my opaque stockings, my patent leather shoes, and carrying my little patent leather pocketbook,\\" she recalled in a 1982 interview.Rickford, p. 348. After graduating, she studied international law at Briarcliff College, but the school shut down before she graduated. Collaboration with Yolanda King In 1979, Moneta Sleet Jr. of Ebony brought Shabazz together with Yolanda King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, for a photo shoot. Before the meeting, both women were worried that the bad feelings between their fathers might spoil the encounter. Instead, they found that they liked one another and had many things in common besides being in their early 20s: they both lived in New York City, they were aspiring actresses, their birthdays were one day apart, and they shared an optimism and interest in activism that one might expect from the eldest children of civil rights martyrs. Within a few months, King and Shabazz went on a joint lecture tour and co-wrote a play for teenage audiences, Stepping into Tomorrow. The play explored difficult themes about growing up through the story of six friends seeing one another again at a ten-year high school reunion. Responding to critics who found the play too soft, Shabazz said that it was not meant to be a \\"cerebral piece of writing\\", but to be \\"socially uplifting\\" and \\"give direction\\". Stepping into Tomorrow quickly grew into a collaboration called Nucleus, an eight-member theatre troupe based in New York and Los Angeles that performed in about 50 cities a year. Ebony included Shabazz and King among its \\"Fifty Young Leaders of the Future\\" in 1983. In the mid-1980s, Shabazz and King co-wrote another play, Of One Mind, about their fathers and what course history might have taken had they not been killed. Their collaboration lasted about twelve years. In December 1990, shortly after celebrating the tenth anniversary of Stepping into Tomorrow, King and Shabazz found themselves at the center of a controversy concerning a long-scheduled performance of the play in Arizona. In November, voters in that state had defeated two competing ballot measures that would have established a paid holiday for state employees on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. (The day was an unpaid holiday.) Civil rights groups called for a boycott of the state as a result of the vote. Days after the two women announced they would proceed with their performance, King cancelled her appearance, saying an understudy would take her place. Shabazz performed as scheduled. Since Nucleus In February 1992, Shabazz spoke at the funeral of her godfather, Alex Haley. Before his death, he had asked her to write a foreword to The Autobiography of Malcolm X, which her father had written with him. The new edition of the book, featuring Shabazz's foreword, was published in 1999. Black Issues Book Review called the foreword \\"superbly realized\\". Shabazz signed a contract in 1994 to write her memoirs. The book's publication was postponed several times. A 1997 review of the book, From Mine Eyes, called it the \\"powerful and uplifting story of a young girl who came of age during the height of the civil rights movement and is now able to share, in vivid detail, the most tragic events of her life\\". At her mother's funeral service in June 1997, Shabazz eulogized her on behalf of the family. Standing in the small pulpit of New York's Riverside Church with her five sisters, she recalled the loving relationship her parents had shared and imagined her father stretching his arm to her mother, inviting her to join him. Then Shabazz asked everybody in attendance to \\"look to the person to the left and to the right of you and genuinely say, 'I wish you the best.'\\" In May 2000, Mike Wallace brought together Shabazz and Louis Farrakhan for a joint interview on 60 Minutes. Farrakhan, then known as Louis X, had been a prot√©g√© of her father's in the Nation of Islam. After Malcolm X left the Nation, Louis X turned on his mentor and became one of his sharpest critics, writing in Muhammad Speaks (the Nation's organ) that \\"such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death.\\" The Shabazz family are among those who have accused Louis Farrakhan of involvement in Malcolm X's assassination.Evanzz, pp. 298‚Äì299. Rickford, pp. 437, 492‚Äì495. During the interview, Farrakhan said he \\"truly loved\\" Malcolm X. He said: \\"I may have been complicit in words that I spoke leading up to\\" the assassination; \\"I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being.\\" Farrakhan also said that the U.S. government was involved in the assassination; \\"This is bigger than the Nation of Islam.\\" Shabazz replied: \\"You can't keep pointing fingers. My father was not killed from a grassy knoll.\\" After the interview, she issued a statement thanking Farrakhan for \\"acknowledging his culpability\\" and wishing him peace. In 2002, Prime Minister Said Musa of Belize asked Shabazz to serve as Ambassador-at-large to represent Belize internationally in perpetuity. When actor and activist Ossie Davis died in February 2005, Shabazz spoke at his funeral. She recalled the first sentence of the eulogy Davis had delivered at her father's funeral forty years earlier, \\"Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its finest hopes\\", and added, \\"Ditto\\". She also thanked her \\"Auntie Ruby\\" and \\"Uncle Ossie\\" for their love and support, especially at times when her family had been shunned by others. Shabazz spoke at the funeral of Coretta Scott King in February 2006. She told of the special bond her mother had shared with King and Myrlie Evers-Williams, the widow of Medgar Evers, and the closeness she felt with the King family, especially Yolanda. Shabazz also told how she and Coretta Scott King had kept up regular phone calls after her mother's death, and how King sent a card and a gift to her and her sisters on each of their birthdays, even after she had suffered a stroke. In June 2016, Shabazz spoke at the funeral of boxer and activist Muhammad Ali. Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, had been inspired by her father to join the Nation of Islam and the two men became very close‚ÄîClay paid for Malcolm X to bring his family to Miami Beach for his 1964 championship fight against Sonny Liston, which Malcolm X watched from a ringside seat‚Äîbut Clay severed all ties with him when Malcolm X left the Nation. Ali later left the Nation himself and, like Malcolm X, became a Sunni Muslim; many years later, he wrote: \\"Turning my back on Malcolm was one of the mistakes that I regret most in my life.\\" Ali reconciled with Shabazz during production of the 2001 film Ali, on which she served as a consultant. At his funeral, Shabazz said that having Ali in her life \\"somehow sustained my dad's breath for me just a little while longer‚Äî51 years longer‚Äîuntil now.\\" Personal life Shabazz guards her privacy. In interviews, she generally declines to answer questions about her age, where she lives, and her marital and family status.

The battle was fought between the dynastic army of Zhou Youwang and the combined armies of the rebel states of Shen and Zeng and the vicious Quanrong barbarians. The outcome was a crushing victory for the insurgents that led to the dynasty's weakening and fragmentation.  Background  King You of Zhou assumed the throne at a very young age. Being immature and rebellious, he couldn't care less for state affairs. He was married to the daughter of the mighty Marquess of Shen, a fieflord under Zhou vassalage, and they had a son named Yijiu. King You was given a new concubine named Baosi by one of his officers' son in charge for his father's release from prison. Baosi was extremely beautiful and King You favoured her over the queen, which caused major grievances within the court. These grievances increased when Baosi gave birth to a boy called Bofu. One day Yijiu and his supporters entered the room where Baosi was and tried to kill her. King You was furious and stripped Yijiu of his royal position and sent him back to the Marquess of Shen, and also deposed his mother the queen and sent her to a prison-room, making Bofu the new prince and Baosi the new queen. The Marquess of Shen was outraged and desperate to free his daughter. Meanwhile, Youwang was deeply amazed by Baosi. He didn't yet suspect that the long and great reign of the Zhou house was about to suffer a deadly blow, of which it would never recover. He hardly thought of anything but Baosi, but there was something about her that made him concerned: she hardly smiled. Being an unwilling wife and state gift, she naturally had few reasons to be happy, but it didn't prevent You from trying his best. At first, none of his efforts was successful. She showed little interest in music, drink, jokers, and anything else. The king went to such state of despair that he merged all of the court officers and offered the wealthy reward of one thousand pieces of gold to anyone who could make the queen laugh. A corrupt officer suggested using the beacon towers of Mount Li to call the allied armies. Youwang liked the idea and brought Baosi in his chariot to the top of the mountain, bringing drink and the whole court with him. The beacons were lit and the vassal states sent their armies in a hurry to the capital, where they met in great numbers. Messengers were sent from the top to inform them there was no danger and the sign was nothing but a prank. Baosi was caught giving laughter as the allies left the mountain foothills in confusion. The king liked it so much that he repeated the prank many times. One day, however, he received a letter from the Marquess of Shen demanding his daughter to be released, but the king was furious and planned to attack Shen. The Marquess of Shen made an alliance with the Quanrong barbarians and the state of Zeng and attacked Haojing first. The battle King You ordered his men to light the beacon tower, and put his minister Guo Shifu in charge of his infantry and Guogong in charge of his chariots and sent them ahead to hold on the enemy. Seeing his numerical disadvantage, Guo Shifu ordered Guogong to tease the enemies and ordered his own regiment to run back to the capital. Guogong was left alone and desperately led his 200 chariots to try to stop the attack, but failed and was killed. Upon seeing that not a single ally would come to his aid, Duke Huan of Zheng, King You's uncle, summoned his own guard and merged it with the remnants of the royal army, called along all the court ministers and their families and fled the capital with the King through the east gate. Shortly after, the city was taken by the Quanrong, who sacked its riches, enslaved its people and burned down all of its buildings. The Marquess of Shen's men tried to stop the fire to no avail, and went into a desperate search for their lord's daughter. They found her at last in the burning palace and took her out. The forces of Shen refused to persecute the king, so the Quanrong did it alone. King You's refugees were fleeing hastily eastwards, but the mounted units of the Quanrong began to approach them quickly and surround them from the sides. King You could already see the fort of Mount Li in the horizon when his fellows' wives and children tired out and could follow no longer. Standing already on the foothills of Mount Li, the Zhou people stopped and fell under heavy attack. Duke Huan was slain and King You tried to form up his men, but they were soon annihilated - king, soldier, woman and child alike. Baosi was taken as trophy for the Quanrong leader.  Aftermath  The battle ended in a decisive victory for Shen. The twin cities were sacked and left in ruins, Baosi was captured and Bofu, still a child, was killed in front of her. The Son of Heaven was slain in Mount Li side by side with Huan, Duke of Zheng. The land surrounding Fenghao and Lishan was conquered and occupied by the Quanrong. The Marquess of Shen later managed to get Baosi for himself and freed her. Yijiu was made king in Shen with the name Ping of Zhou, but his coronation was supported only by three states, including Shen and Zeng. The vassal nobles sent escorts to rescue treasures and survivors in the ruined capital. The states of Qin and Jin thought of Yijiu as the only possible person to inherit the throne in order to preserve the Zhou dynasty, so together they helped him and his court move to the new capital at Wangcheng. The Qin soon partially avenged the fallen king by attacking and destroying the Quanrong and taking back the lost territory for the Zhou. The new king was unpopular and poorly supported by most states due to the circumstances of his coronation, and Wangcheng was never as great and imposing as Haojing. Besides, the Zhou dynasty relied totally on its allies for protection since its own army had just been annihilated in battle. Although the Mandate of Heaven remained with the Zhou, China became increasingly fragmented after that, and would soon fall into a long age of conflict for hegemony that would last over five centuries.

Sane Trilogy is a platform game developed by Vicarious Visions and published by Activision. It is a compilation of remasters of the first three games in the Crash Bandicoot series: Crash Bandicoot (1996), Cortex Strikes Back (1997), and Warped (1998); which were originally developed by Naughty Dog for the PlayStation. The game was released as a timed exclusive for PlayStation 4 in June 2017, with versions for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One being released in June 2018. It received positive reviews from critics, and sold over 10 million copies by February 2019. A racing spin- off, Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled was released in June 2019, while a direct sequel, Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, was released in October 2020.  Gameplay  Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is a collection of remasters of the first three games in the Crash Bandicoot series; Crash Bandicoot, Cortex Strikes Back and Warped. Each game features Crash Bandicoot traversing various levels in order to stop Doctor Neo Cortex from taking over the world. Like in the original games, Crash uses spinning and jumping techniques to defeat enemies, smash crates, and collect items such as Wumpa Fruits, extra lives and protective Aku Aku masks. The trilogy adds new features across all three games, including unified checkpoints, pause menus and save systems, including both manual and automatic saving, time trials, which were first introduced in Warped, and the ability to play most levels in each game as Crash's sister, Coco. It also features remastered audio and cutscenes, including new recordings of the games' dialogue given by the franchise's more recent voice actors.  Development  A comparison between the first level of the original game (top) and the N. Sane Trilogy version (bottom) Prior to the announcement of the N. Sane Trilogy, the Crash Bandicoot franchise had been on hiatus for approximately six years, the last entry being released in 2010. In a Kotaku interview with then-Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg regarding the future of the Crash series, he said, \\"I don't have anything official to announce, but I can speak as an individual, I love Crash Bandicoot. Those were some of my favorite video games growing up. And I would love to find a way to bring him back, if we could.\\" Andy Gavin, cofounder of Naughty Dog and co-creator of Crash Bandicoot, has said that he would love to see an HD version of the marsupial's first four games, or even a full blown reboot. Fellow co-creator Jason Rubin, said he was hopeful that Activision would \\"Bring Crash back to their glory days and that the character is still very dear to fans between 18‚Äì49 years\\". In June 2013, Andy Gavin suggested ways to revitalize the series. \\"Crash needs a total reboot. There's an opportunity to reset the history, and go back to his creation story and the original conflict with Cortex. In that context, you could reprise classic Crash 1 and 2's settings and villains. It would make sense to use a more modern, free-roaming style. I would concentrate on Looney Tunes-esque animation and really addictive action. That's what we did with the original Crash, and there's no reason it couldn't be done today. Given the current Crash games, people forget that he was once cool. Our Crash had a certain whimsical edge to him. Sure, it was goofy ‚Äì but it wasn't dumb.\\" In July 2014, Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Andrew House revealed that they had thought about reviving the Crash Bandicoot series, saying \\"It's never off the table.\\" At E3 2016 during Sony's press conference, Crash Bandicoot made his return when it was announced, in a timed partnership with Activision, that the first three games from the original PlayStation would be remade from the ground up. Crash would also be a playable character in Activision's then- upcoming toys-to-life game Skylanders: Imaginators, released on October 16, 2016. It was announced at Gamescom 2016 that Dr. Neo Cortex would also be playable in Imaginators, and that a Crash-themed level was created for the game, \\"Thumpin' Wumpa Islands\\". The remakes of the original trilogy were developed by Vicarious Visions under the title Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and were released for PlayStation 4 on June 30, 2017. Vicarious Visions has also expressed interest in making a new Crash Bandicoot game following the N. Sane Trilogy's release. Vicarious Visions coined the term \\"Remaster Plus\\" to describe the collection, as they did not fully remake the original games, but rather used Naughty Dog's original level geometry to rebuild the gameplay from scratch. As the levels were coming together, they added their own art, animation, and audio. Almost none of the source codes for the original games were available to the developers, as the game engines were specially written for the original PlayStation and Vicarious Visions could not find a way to use it on more powerful systems. Sony and Naughty Dog were able to provide various polygon meshes from the original, although many important elements from these were missing and the team found that \\"they were compressed in some wacky format that we had to decode\\". Vicarious Visions looked at various internet communities to make sure they had essences of the games captured. The team had some fans test the game and give notes about it compared to the originals. In April 2017, there was a contest for fans to submit ideas for idle animations for the character, with the winners announced the following month. Two additional levels were added as post-launch downloadable content: Stormy Ascent, a level originally designed for the first game but was cut due to its difficulty, and Future Tense, a new level created by Vicarious Visions for the third game. After one year of timed exclusivity, the N. Sane Trilogy was ported to Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and on June 29, 2018; which were developed by Iron Galaxy, Toys for Bob, and Vicarious Visions, respectively. The Switch port in particular was not originally intended until a lone engineer at Vicarious Visions successfully ported the game's first level to the platform, proving it was feasible to port the trilogy. Sega published the Japanese Switch version on October 18, 2018, while Sony Interactive Entertainment published the Japanese PlayStation 4 version.  Reception  Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics across all platforms on which it was released, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised multiple aspects, such as the upgraded graphics, unifying gameplay aspects, and overall faithfulness to the originals. Jonathon Dornbush of IGN lauded the graphics as having \\"the glow of a Saturday morning cartoon\\", and noted the addition of time trials to the first two games as a welcome change that \\"offer[s] plenty of new challenges.\\" Andrew Reiner of Game Informer also praised the addition of time trials, along with the ability to play as Coco and the unified autosave system; additionally, the review noted the technical feat of remastering the games \\"from the ground up\\" without the use of Naughty Dog's original source code. Jeuxvideo called the ground-up production \\"[a] real performance\\" while also praising \\"the nostalgia factor\\" and the rerecorded music. Criticism of the game centered around aspects such as character controls and the original trilogy's pitfalls. Justin Clark of Slant criticized the trilogy as \\"stultifying in [its] need for absolute precision\\" and stated that achievements provoked \\"little reward\\". Dornbush was less critical of the level design, but noted that the first game was \\"easily the weakest\\" for its limited move set, while Ashley Oh of Polygon found some design choices \\"unforgiving and frustrating\\" and agreed that there was \\"no margin of error\\" in much of the platforming. = Sales = Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy was a commercial success, selling over 2.5 million copies in the first three months of its release, increasing to ten million by February 2019. In the United Kingdom, the N. Sane Trilogy was the best-selling game for eight consecutive weeks since its initial release. Its release also saw the biggest launch of a game in the first half of 2017, behind Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands. It was also the second-best-selling game in its first month in the US. = Accolades = The game won the award for \\"Best Remake/Remaster\\" at IGN's 2017 awards, while the readers and staff of Game Informer voted it as the \\"Best Remastered Action\\" and \\"Best Remastered/Remade\\" game in theirs. It was also nominated for the Tappan Zee Bridge Award for \\"Best Remake\\" at the New York Game Awards 2018, and won the award for \\"Game, Classic Revival\\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards, whereas its other nomination was for the \\"Original Light Mix Score, Franchise\\" category. It was also nominated for \\"People's Choice\\" at the Italian Video Game Awards.

Founded in 1992, it appeared annually until 2001, and then resumed in 2011. Held on and around the site of the razed Club Harlem (today a parking lot), the weekend fair commemorates the R&B; and jazz nightspots that once lined Kentucky Avenue and that attracted both black and white clientele in its heyday from the 1940s through 1960s. The festival features live performances by R&B; and jazz musicians and bands, dance performances, street performers, arts and crafts for children, and food concessions, and draws hundreds of attendees. Background Club Harlem, 1964 Kentucky Avenue was the hub of the black entertainment district in Atlantic City from the 1940s through 1960s. The district (known as \\"Kentucky Avenue and the Curb\\") had been home to African- Americans in the racially-segregated city since the end of World War I. Kentucky Avenue, between Arctic and Atlantic Avenues, was home to many black- owned businesses, among them nightclubs that attracted both black and white clientele. The premier nightclub was Club Harlem, where the leading black entertainers of their time appeared. Other popular nightclubs were Grace's Little Belmont, the Wonder Gardens, and the Paradise Club. The street also had numerous barbecue chicken and ribs joints, such as Jerry's Ribs, Sapp's, and Booker the Bone Cooker, and a small soul food restaurant, Wash's Restaurant, popular with the black entertainers and patrons of the clubs. On summer weekends, the music and entertainment went on around the clock. The district went into decline after an April 2, 1972 Easter morning shootout at Club Harlem. Four members of the Black Mafia entered the club during a show attended by an estimated 600 people and shot a rival operative point-blank at his table, ostensibly in retaliation for a drug deal. The dealer's bodyguard and three other women were killed in the melee that ensued. The introduction of hotel casinos to Atlantic City further eroded the popularity of the district. Club Harlem was the last nightclub operating by the 1980s; it was shuttered in 1986 and demolished in 1992. History The first Kentucky Avenue Renaissance Festival was held a few months after Club Harlem's demolition, in June 1992. The festival was held on and around the site of the club, now a parking lot. In addition to saluting the entertainment of yesteryear, organizers hoped the festival would spark interest in redeveloping the former entertainment district on Kentucky Avenue. The festival was staged every summer after that until 2001. In 2011 the Polaris Development Group, headed by Steven Young, in cooperation with the Atlantic City Public Library, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, and local business owners, reintroduced the festival as a way to cultivate interest in reviving the former entertainment district. The festival has been held annually since, aside from another break in 2014. In 2015 bad weather led to the rescheduling of the festival in November at The Claridge Hotel. Description The first festival, in 1992, featured free concerts, arts and crafts, and concessions selling barbecued ribs and other foods. Chris Columbo, who conducted the Club Harlem orchestra for 34 years, performed, as did a dance troupe recreating the \\"Smart Affairs\\" revue headquartered at Club Harlem. Reintroduced in 2011 after a ten-year hiatus, the renamed Historical Kentucky Avenue Renaissance Festival drew an estimated 1,000 attendees over the course of the day. Together with live R&B; and jazz music, dance groups, and street performers, the festival features historical exhibits. Attendees come from Atlantic City as well as nearby Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Kentucky Avenue Renaissance Mural In July 1996 the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority commissioned a mural honoring the former Kentucky Avenue entertainment district. Painted on a brick wall near the corner of Kentucky and Baltic Avenues, the mural depicts leading musicians who once performed in the area's nightclubs, such as singers Sammy Davis, Jr., Billy Eckstine, and Ella Fitzgerald, and drummer Chris Columbo. The mural was painted by students of Atlantic City High School, who received $6 per hour from the Casino Authority and were entertained by jazz musicians while they painted.

Garmon, 359 U.S. 236 (1959), is a US labor law case, concerning the scope of federal preemption against state law for labor rights..  Background  Garmon claimed that state law applied to grant damages against a union that picketed his business, and federal law did not apply. Garmon had a business selling lumber in California. The San Diego Building Trades Council was a labor union that wanted Garmon only to hire workers who were union members, or applied in 30 days of beginning a job. Garmon refused, the union sent peaceful pickets to persuade customers and suppliers to stop dealing with Garmon. The Superior Court for the County of San Diego found that the union had acted unlawfully under state law, and enjoined the union from picketing until they had won an election and become a collective bargaining agent, awarding $1000 in damages. The NLRB declined jurisdiction for a representation hearing, \\"presumably because the amount of interstate commerce involved did not meet the Board's monetary standards in taking jurisdiction.\\" The California Supreme Court held, because the NLRB declined jurisdiction, California courts had power over the dispute and the union committed an unfair labor practice under ¬ß 8(b)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The US Supreme Court then decided in Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board,. that the refusal of the National Labor Relations Board to assert jurisdiction did not mean the states had power, and vacated the judgment of the California court. The California court set aside the injunction, but still granted an award of damages.Garmon v. San Diego Bldg. Trades Council, 49 Cal.2d 595, 320 P.2d 473 (three judges dissenting). It said this was based on tort for unfair labor practices under the Civil Code.California Civil Code, ¬ß¬ß 1667, 1708 The case was granted certiorari again to decide if the California court had jurisdiction to award damages arising out of peaceful union activity which it could not enjoin. Judgment The Supreme Court held that the California Supreme Court was not entitled to award remedies against a union for picketing, because if \\"an activity is arguably subject to ¬ß7 or ¬ß8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board\\".

Location Kindlestown Castle is located astride the slopes of Kindlestown Hill, to the north of Delgany, west of Greystones railway station, and near the Dromont housing development. History Kindlestown Castle is a late stone example of the hall house, commanding a good view of the countryside and the Irish Sea. The castle takes its name from its association with Albert de Kenley (Sheriff of Kildare in 1301), who is believed to have erected it in the late 13th century. Others give it an earlier date of 1225, associating it with Walter de Bendeville. De Kenley married Joan, the widow of Ralph Mac Giolla Mocholm√°g (Sir Ralph Fitzdermot) in 1292 and had custody of his lands for his stepson, John Fitzdermot. He retained some of the land for himself as can be seen from a deed dated 1304, and may have built the castle to protect against attack from the native Irish. In 1301 the U√≠ Broin (O'Byrnes) burned down nearby Rathdown Castle; the occupants may have taken refuge at Kindlestown. But John Fitzdermot had not the stomach for the fight with the Irish, conveying the manor of Rathdown about 1305 to Nigel le Brun, Escheator of Ireland. In 1377 the U√≠ Broin took Kindlestown itself. It was recovered by Robert Wikeford, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and it later passed into the possession of the Archbold family. Around 1402 there was another attempt by the O'Byrnes to take over, but Donnacha O'Byrne was defeated by the Archbolds. Kindlestown Castle flourished during this time and we know from the Inquisitions of James I that in 1621 it was surrounded by of land and had a water mill. The Archbolds fell into debt and Edward Archbold sold Kindlestown to William Brabazon, 1st Earl of Meath in 1630. Building The castle, also called a hall house, measures externally by and is in height, with walls thick. The northern wall and part of the eastern wall survive intact to parapet level, but the southern and western walls were demolished in the post-medieval period. The surviving castle, two storeys high, is built of rough limestone, and the main features consist of a small projecting tower in the north-west corner, an original barrel vault at ground-floor level, and an entrance (at ground-floor level) and mural staircase in the eastern wall. The windows are small defensive arrowslits in the exterior, widening into segmental-arched embrasures in the interior. Window-seats survive at first-floor level. The remains of a slated parapet and stone string-course are also visible in the front fa√ßade.

Facts The Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission sought to hold a union liable for an unfair labor practice, by refusing to work overtime. An employer claimed to the National Labor Relations Board that his staff had committed an unfair practice by refusing to work overtime, but this was dismissed, as there was no violation. The employer then tried to make the same claim to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, which upheld the claim and made a cease-and-desist order against the union. The Wisconsin Circuit Court affirmed this and so did the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed. The union appealed to the US Supreme Court.

In politics the Liberal Party collapsed and the Labour Party became the main challenger to the dominant Conservative Party throughout the period. The Great Depression affected Britain less severely economically and politically than other major nations, although there were severe pockets of long-term unemployment and hardship, especially in mining districts and in Scotland and North West England. Historian Arthur Marwick sees a radical transformation of British society resulting from the Great War, a deluge that swept away many old attitudes and brought in a more egalitarian society. He sees the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, arguing there were major positive long-term consequences of the war to British society. He points to an energised self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, the coming of partial women's suffrage, and an acceleration of social reform and state control of the economy. He sees a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and the weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behaviour. The chaperone faded away; village chemists sold contraceptives.John Peel, \\"The manufacture and retailing of contraceptives in England.\\" Population Studies 17.2 (1963): 113‚Äì125. Marwick says that class distinctions softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.Arthur Marwick, The Deluge: British Society and the First World War (1965) Politics of 1920s =Enlarging democracy= The Representation of the People Act 1918 finally gave Britain universal manhood suffrage at age 21, with no property qualifications. Even more dramatically it opened up woman suffrage for most women over the age of 30. In 1928, all women were covered on the same terms as men.Robert Blackburn, \\"Laying the foundations of the modern voting system: The Representation of the People Act 1918.\\" Parliamentary History 30.1 (2011): 33‚Äì52. With the emergence of revolutionary forces, most notably in Bolshevik Russia and Socialist Germany, but also in Hungary, Italy and elsewhere, revolution to overthrow established elites and aristocracies was in the air. The Labour Party largely controlled working-class politics, and it strongly supported the government in London and opposed violent revolution. Conservatives were especially worried about \\"Red Clydeside\\" in industrial Scotland. Their fears were misplaced, for there was no organised attempt at any revolution. Indeed, the far left white working men in Red Clydeside were chiefly concerned with excluding blacks and women from good jobs.Jacquelin Jenkinson, \\"Black Sailors on Red Clydeside: rioting, reactionary trade unionism and conflicting notions of ‚ÄòBritishness‚Äô following the First World War.\\" Twentieth Century British History 19.1 (2007): 29‚Äì60.Kay Blackwell, \\"Women on Red Clydeside: The Invisible Workforce Debate.\\" Journal of Scottish Historical Studies 21.2 (2001): 140‚Äì162. Nevertheless, there were concerns about republicanism. The king and his top advisors were deeply concerned about the republican threat to the British monarchy, so much so that it was a factor in the king's decision not to rescue his cousin the overthrown Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.Kenneth Rose, King George V (2000) p 215 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9BuIAgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA40 online excerpt. Nervous conservatives associated republicanism with the rise of socialism and the growing labour movement. Their concerns, although exaggerated, resulted in a redesign of the monarchy's social role to be more inclusive of the working class and its representatives, a dramatic change for George, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. In fact the socialists by 1911 no longer believed in their anti-monarchy slogans and took a wait-and-see attitude toward George V. They were ready to come to terms with the monarchy if it took the first step.Neville Kirk, \\"The conditions of royal rule: Australian and British socialist and labour attitudes to the monarchy, 1901‚Äì11.\\" Social History 30.1 (2005): 64‚Äì88, especially p. 80. During the war George took that step; he made nearly 300 visits to shipyards and munitions factories, chatting with and congratulating ordinary workers on their hard work for the war effort.H. C. G. Matthew, \\"George V (1865‚Äì1936)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He adopted a more democratic stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public. The king also cultivated friendly relations with leading Labour party politicians and trade union officials. George V's abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter. For example, in 1924 the king proved willing, in the absence of a clear majority for any one of the three parties, to replace Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin with Ramsay MacDonald, the first Labour Party prime minister. King George's tactful and understanding reception of the MacDonald government allayed the suspicions of the party's supporters throughout the nation.Frank Prochaska, \\"George V and Republicanism, 1917‚Äì1919.\\" Twentieth Century British History 1999 10(1): 27‚Äì51. = Ireland = An armed insurrection by Irish republicans known as the Easter Rising took place in Dublin during Easter Week, 1916. It was badly organised, and quickly suppressed by the Army. The government responded with harsh repression, 2000 arrests, and quick execution of 15 leaders. The Catholic Irish then underwent a dramatic change of mood, and shifted to demand vengeance and independence.Fearghal McGarry, The Rising: Easter 1916 (2010). In 1917 David Lloyd George called the 1917‚Äì18 Irish Convention in an attempt to settle the outstanding Home Rule for Ireland issue. It had little support. The upsurge in republican sympathies in Ireland following the Easter Rising coupled with Lloyd George's disastrous attempt to extend conscription to Ireland in April 1918 led to the wipeout of the old Irish Home Rule Party at the December 1918 election. They had supported the British war effort and were then displaced by Sinn F√©in, which had mobilised grass-roots opposition to helping the British rule.Caoimhe Nic Dhaibheid, \\"The Irish National Aid Association and the Radicalisation of Public Opinion in Ireland, 1916‚Äì1918.\\" The Historical Journal 55.3 (2012): 705‚Äì729. Sinn F√©in MPs did not take up their seats in the British Parliament, instead setting up their own new parliament in Dublin, and immediately declared an Irish Republic.Nick Pelling, Anglo-Irish Relations: 1798‚Äì1922 (2003) pp. 98‚Äì109. British policy was confused and contradictory, as the cabinet could not decide on war or peace, sending in enough force to commit atrocities that angered Catholics in Ireland and America, and Liberals in Britain, but not enough to suppress the rebels outside the cities. Lloyd George waxed hot and cold, denouncing murderers one day, but eventually negotiating with them. He sent in 40,000 soldiers as well as newly formed para-military units‚Äîthe \\"Black and Tans\\" and the Auxiliaries‚Äîto reinforce the professional police (the Royal Irish Constabulary). British firepower prevailed in the cities forcing the Irish Republican Army (IRA) (the paramilitary force of Sinn F√©in) into hiding. However the IRA controlled much of the countryside and set up an alternative local government.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the Wars (1955) pp. 58‚Äì72. The British units were poorly coordinated while Michael Collins designed a highly effective organisation for the IRA that used informers to destroy the British intelligence system by assassinating its leadership.J.J. Lee, Ireland: 1912‚Äì1985 (1989) pp. 42‚Äì45. Although it was called \\"Irish War of Independence\\" historians generally agree that it was quite unlike the later Irish Civil War that was fought in 1922‚Äì23 between the forces of Collins and √âamon de Valera. The 1919‚Äì21 clash \\"was no war in any conventional sense of the term, but a highly contingent, very small-scale and low-intensity conflict in which assassination was as important as ambush or fixed battle.\\"Shane Nagle, \\"Review of Leeson, D. M., The Black and Tans: British Police and Auxiliaries in the Irish War of Independence in H-Empire, H-Net Reviews. October, 2012. Lloyd George finally solved the crisis with the Government of Ireland Act 1920 which partitioned Ireland into Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland in May 1921. Sinn F√©in won control of the south and agreed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921 with Irish leaders. Collins took power when de Valera refused to sign and led a breakaway faction.D.G. Boyce, The Irish question and British politics (2nd ed. 1996) pp. 58‚Äì76. Under the treaty southern Ireland seceded in 1922 to form the Irish Free State. Meanwhile, the Unionists under Edward Carson controlled Ulster and Northern Ireland remained loyal to London.Thomas Hennessey, A History of Northern Ireland: 1920‚Äì1996 (1997)C. L. Mowat, Britain between the Wars (1955) pp. 79‚Äì108. By 1922 the Irish situation had stabilised, and no longer played a major role in British politics. Nevertheless, disputes sputtered for decades regarding the exact relationship to the monarchy, a trade war in the 1930s, and British use of naval ports. The Irish Free State cut many of its ties to Britain in 1937. As the Republic of Ireland it was one of a handful of neutrals in Europe in the Second World War.J.J. Lee, Ireland: 1912‚Äì1985 (1989), ch 2-3. =Expanding the welfare state= Two major programmes dealing with unemployment and housing that permanently expanded the welfare state passed in 1919 and 1920 with surprisingly little debate, even as the Conservatives dominated parliament. The Unemployment Insurance Act 1920 expanded the provisions of the National Insurance Act 1911. It set up the dole system that provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to practically the entire civilian working population except domestic servants, farm workers, and civil servants. Funded in part by weekly contributions from both employers and employed, it provided weekly payments of 15s for unemployed men and 12s for unemployed women. It passed at a time of very low unemployment. Historian C. L. Mowat called these laws \\"Socialism by the back door,\\" and notes how surprised politicians were when the costs to the Treasury soared during the high unemployment of 1921.Mowat, C. L., Britain between the Wars: 1918‚Äì1940 (1955) pp. 43‚Äì46 Housing  The rapid expansion of housing was a major success story of the interwar years, standing in sharp contrast to the United States, where new housing construction practically collapsed after 1929. The total housing stock In England and Wales was 7.6 million in 1911; 8.0 million in 1921; 9.4 million in 1931; and 11.3 million in 1939. The influential Tudor Walters Report of 1918 set the standards for council house design and location for the next 90 years.Mark Swenarton, \\"Tudor Walters and Tudorbethan: reassessing Britain's inter-war suburbs.\\" Planning perspectives 17.3 (2002): 267‚Äì286. It recommended housing in short terraces, spaced at at a density of 12 to the acre.John Burnett, A Social History of Housing : 1815‚Äì1985 (2nd ed. 1986) pp. 222‚Äì26. With the Housing, Town Planning, &c.; Act 1919 Lloyd George set up a system of government housing that followed his 1918 campaign promises of \\"homes fit for heroes.\\"Paul Wilding, \\"The Housing and Town Planning Act 1919‚ÄîA Study in the Making of Social Policy.\\" Journal of Social Policy 2#4 (1973): 317-334. Also known as the \\"Addison Act,\\" it required local authorities to survey their housing needs, and start building houses to replace slums. The treasury subsidised the low rents.John Burnett, A Social History of Housing : 1815‚Äì1985 (1986) pp. 226-34. Older women could then vote. Local politicians consulted with them and in response put more emphasis on such amenities as communal laundries, extra bedrooms, indoor lavatories, running hot water, separate parlours to demonstrate their respectability, and practical vegetable gardens rather than manicured lawns.Martin Pugh, We Danced All Night: A Social History of Britain Between the Wars (2009), pp. 60‚Äì62Noreen Branson, Britain in the Nineteen Twenties (1976) pp. 103‚Äì17. Progress was not automatic, as shown by the troubles of rural Norfolk. Many dreams were shattered as local authorities had to renege on promises they could not fulfill due to undue haste, impossible national deadlines, debilitating bureaucracy, lack of lumber, rising costs, and the non-affordability of rents by the rural poor.Annette Martin, \\"Shattered hopes and unfulfilled dreams: council housing in rural Norfolk in the early 1920s, Local Historian (2005) 35#2 pp. 107‚Äì119. In England and Wales 214,000 multi-unit council buildings were built by 1939; the Ministry of Health became largely a ministry of housing. Council housing accounted for 10 percent of the housing stock in Britain by 1938, peaking at 32 percent in 1980, and dropping to 18 percent by 1996, where it held steady for the next two decades.Pat Thane, Cassel's Companion to 20th Century Britain 2001) 195‚Äì96. Increasingly the British ideal was home ownership, even among the working class. Rates of home ownership rose steadily from 15 percent before 1914, to 32 percent by 1938, and 67 percent by 1996. The construction industry sold the idea of home ownership to upscale renters. The mortgage lost its old stigma of a millstone round your neck to instead be seen as a smart long-term investment in suburbanised Britain. It appealed to aspirations of upward mobility and made possible the fastest rate of growth in working-class owner-occupation during the 20th century.Peter Scott, \\"Marketing mass home ownership and the creation of the modern working-class consumer in inter-war Britain.\\" Business History 50#1 (2008): 4‚Äì25.Mark Swenarton and Sandra Taylor. \\"The scale and nature of the growth of owner‚Äêoccupation in Britain between the wars.\\" Economic History Review 38#3 (1985): 373-392. The boom was largely financed by the savings ordinary Britons put into their building societies. Starting in the 1920s favourable tax policies encouraged substantial investment in the societies, creating huge reserves for lending. Beginning in 1927, the societies encouraged borrowing through gradual liberalisation of mortgage terms.Jane Humphries, \\"Inter-war house building, cheap money and building societies: The housing boom revisited.\\" Business History 29.3 (1987): 325-345. =Conservative control= Stanley Baldwin was Conservative Prime Minister between 1923‚Äì1924, 1924‚Äì1929 and 1935‚Äì1937. The Lloyd George ministry fell apart in 1922, and Bonar Law became prime minister of a Conservative government. In May 1923 Bonar Law resigned because of ill health and was replaced by Stanley Baldwin. Baldwin, as leader of the Conservative Party (1923‚Äì37) and as Prime Minister (in 1923‚Äì24, 1924‚Äì29 and 1935‚Äì37), dominated British politics.Stuart Ball, \\"Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867‚Äì1947)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2004; online edn, January 2011 His mixture of strong social reforms and steady government proved a powerful election combination, with the result that the Conservatives governed Britain either by themselves or as the leading component of the National Government. In the general election of 1935 Baldwin's was the last government to win over 50% of the vote. Baldwin's political strategy was to polarise the electorate so that voters would choose between the Conservatives on the right and the Labour Party on the left, squeezing out the Liberals in the middle.Andrew J. Taylor, \\"Stanley Baldwin, Heresthetics and the Realignment of British Politics,\\" British Journal of Political Science, (July 2005), 35#3 pp. 429‚Äì63, The polarisation did take place and while the Liberals remained active under Lloyd George, they won few seats. Baldwin's reputation soared in the 1920s and 1930s, but crashed after 1940 as he was blamed for the appeasement policies toward Germany, and as Churchill was made the Conservative icon by his admirers. Since the 1970s Baldwin's reputation has recovered somewhat.Philip Williamson, \\"Baldwin's Reputation: Politics and History, 1937‚Äì1967,\\" Historical Journal (March 2004) 47#1 pp. 127‚Äì68 in JSTOR 1929 Conservative poster attacking the Labour Party Having won an election just the year before, Baldwin's Conservative party had a comfortable majority in the Commons and could have waited another four years, but the government was concerned. Baldwin felt the need to receive a new mandate from the people. Oxford historian (and Conservative MP) J.A.R. Marriott depicts the gloomy national mood: > The times were still out of joint. Mr. Baldwin had indeed succeeded in > negotiating (January 1923) a settlement of the British debt to the United > States, but on terms which involved an annual payment of ¬£34 million, at the > existing rate of exchange. The French remained in the Ruhr.

Confronted by these > difficulties, convinced that economic conditions in England called for a > drastic change in fiscal policy, and urged thereto by the Imperial > Conference of 1928, Mr. Baldwin decided to ask the country for a mandate for > Preference and Protection.J. A. R. Marriott, Modern England: 1885‚Äì1945 (4th > ed. 1948) p. 517Paul W. Doerr, British foreign policy 1919‚Äì1939 (1998) p. > 75‚Äì76 The result however backfired on Baldwin, who lost a host of seats to Labour and the Liberals. For the first time in history, Labour formed a government. However, in 1924 Baldwin and the Conservatives returned with a large majority. Ross McKibbin finds that the political culture of the interwar period was built around an anti-socialist middle class, supported by the Conservative leaders, especially Baldwin.Ross McKibbin, Parties and people: England, 1914‚Äì1951 (Oxford, 2010) =King George V= King George V (reigned 1910‚Äì1936) was scandal free. He appeared hard working and became widely admired by the people of Britain and the Empire, as well as \\"The Establishment\\".John Gore, King George V: A Personal Memoir (1941) pp. x, 116 It was George V who established the modern norm of conduct for British royalty, reflecting middle- class values and virtues rather than upper-class lifestyles or vices.Brian Harrison, The Transformation of British Politics, 1860‚Äì1995 (1996), 332 Anti- intellectual and lacking the sophistication of his two royal predecessors, as well as their cosmopolitan experiences, he nevertheless understood the British Empire better than most of his ministers; indeed he explained, \\"it has always been my dream to identify myself with the great idea of Empire.\\" Brian Harrison, The Transformation of British Politics, 1860‚Äì1995 pp. 320, 337. He used his exceptional memory for details and faces to good effect in small talk with commoners and officials.Harold Nicolson, King George the Fifth: His Life and Reign (1952) p 474. He invariably wielded his influence as a force of neutrality and moderation, seeing his role as mediator rather than final decision maker.Brian Harrison, The Transformation of British Politics, 1860‚Äì1995 pp. 51, 327 For example, in 1921 he had General Jan Smuts draft a speech calling for a compromise truce to end the Irish war of independence and secured cabinet approval; the Irish also agreed and the war ended.Francis Costello, \\"King George V's Speech at Stormont (1921): Prelude to the Anglo- Irish Truce.\\" √âire-Ireland (1987) 22#3: 43‚Äì57. Historian A. J. P. Taylor praises the king's initiative as, \\"perhaps the greatest service performed by a British monarch in modern times.\\"A. J. P. Taylor, English History 1914‚Äì1945 (1965) p. 157.Kenneth Rose, King George V (1984) pp. 237‚Äì40. His transparent sense of duty, his loyalty, his impartiality, and his unfailing example of good taste inspired the people and discouraged politicians from manipulating him to their own advantage. King George V was by temperament a cautious and conservative man who never fully appreciated or approved the revolutionary changes underway in British society. Nevertheless, everyone understood that he was earnestly devoted to Britain and the British Commonwealth.Harold Nicolson, King George the Fifth pp. 33, 141, 510, 517; John Gore, King George V (1941), p 293 The king's popularity was enhanced during the World War when he made more than a thousand visits to hospitals, factories, and military and naval installations. He thereby gave highly visible support to the morale of ordinary workers and servicemen.Miranda Carter, \\"How to keep your crown.\\" History Today 59.10 (2009): 5+. In 1932, George delivered his Royal Christmas speech on the radio, an event that became a popular across the British Empire every year.Edward Owens, The Family Firm: monarchy, mass media and the British public, 1932-53 (2019) p. 91 online. His Silver Jubilee in 1935 became a national festival of fervent rejoicing, tinged with a few complaints.Neil Robson, \\"Fervent rejoicing and muted protest: London at the time of King George V 's Silver Jubilee,\\"Local Historian (2015), 45#2 pp. 143‚Äì157. His funeral and following commemorations were elaborately staged, very well attended ceremonies that redefined the role of royalty in a newly democratic nation. The people had new ways to affirm their loyalties, such as close attention to live radio broadcasts and follow-up newsreels. New ceremonies born of the commemoration of death in the Great War included the two-minute silence. Britain set up living memorials to honour and expand the king's lifelong belief in the physical, moral and social benefits of recreation and sports. The royal death thereby acted to enhance a shared Britishness. The funeral of King George VI in 1952 followed the same formula. Thereby the monarchy grew stronger and, more importantly, national cohesion was built up in the era of total war.Ina Zweiniger‚ÄêBargielowska, \\"Royal death and living memorials: the funerals and commemoration of George V and George VI, 1936‚Äì52.\\" Historical Research 89.243 (2016): 158‚Äì175. The king was the most active monarch in many ways since George III (reigned 1760‚Äì1820). Biographer H. C. G. Matthew concludes: :His was the busiest service of any nineteenth- or twentieth-century British monarch. He dealt with a remarkable and arduous series of crises: the reaction of the Unionists to the Parliament Bill and the home rule crisis, the complex coalition-forming of the First World War, the incorporation of the Labour Party into the working of constitutional government, the replacement of orthodox politics by a national government. George V's assiduous and non-partisan approach smoothed the process of political change which these crises represented. Economics Taxes rose sharply during the war and never returned to their old levels. A rich man paid 8% of his income in taxes before the war, and about a third afterward. Much of the money went on unemployment benefits. About 5% of the national income every year was transferred from the rich to the poor. A. J. P. Taylor argues most people \\"were enjoying a richer life than any previously known in the history of the world: longer holidays, shorter hours, higher real wages.\\"A.J.P. Taylor, English History, 1914‚Äì1945 (1965) p 176, quote on p 317 The British economy was lackluster in the 1920s, with sharp declines and high unemployment in heavy industry and coal, especially in Scotland and Wales. Exports of coal and steel halved by 1939 and the business community was slow to adopt the new labour and management principles coming from the US, such as Fordism, consumer credit, eliminating surplus capacity, designing more structured management, and using greater economies of scale. For over a century the shipping industry had dominated world trade, but it remained in the doldrums despite various stimulus efforts by the government. With the very sharp decline in world trade after 1929, its condition became critical. Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill put Britain back on the gold standard in 1925, which many economists blame for the mediocre performance of the economy. Others point to a variety of factors, including the inflationary effects of the World War and supply- side shocks caused by reduced working hours after the war.Solomos Solomou and Dimitris Vartis, \\"Effective Exchange Rates in Britain, 1920‚Äì1930,\\" Journal of Economic History, (September 2005) 65#3 pp. 850‚Äì59 in JSTOR By the late 1920s, economic performance had stabilised, but the overall situation was disappointing, for Britain had fallen behind the United States as the leading industrial power. There also remained a strong economic divide between the north and south of England during this period, with the south of England and the Midlands fairly prosperous by the Thirties, while parts of South Wales and the industrial north of England became known as \\"distressed areas\\" due to particularly high rates of unemployment and poverty. Despite this, the standard of living continued to improve as local councils built new houses to let to families rehoused from outdated slums, with up to date facilities including indoor toilets, bathrooms, and electric lighting being included in the new properties. The private sector enjoyed a housebuilding boom during the 1930s.R.J. Unstead, \\"A Century of Change: 1837‚ÄìToday\\" =Labour= During the war, trade unions were encouraged and their membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918. They peaked at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.B.R.

Coal was a sick industry; the best seams were being exhausted, raising the cost. Demand fell as oil began replacing coal for fuel. The 1926 general strike was a nine-day nationwide walkout of 1.3 million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, iron workers and steelworkers supporting the 1.2 million coal miners who had been locked out by the owners. The miners had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices.W. N. Medlicott, Contemporary England 1914‚Äì1964, pp, 223‚Äì30 The Conservative government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. To support the miners the Trades Union Congress (TUC), an umbrella organisation of all trades unions, called out certain critical unions. The hope was the government would intervene to reorganise and rationalise the industry and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued in operation using students and middle-class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The Labour Party leaders did not approve and feared it would tar the party with the image of radicalism, for the Comintern in Moscow had sent instructions for Communists to aggressively promote the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lock-out continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history, for TUC leaders such as Ernest Bevin considered it a mistake. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but Martin Pugh says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.Alastair Reid, and Steven Tolliday, \\"The General Strike, 1926,\\" Historical Journal (1977) 20#4 pp. 1001‚Äì12 in JSTOR The Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union dues to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946. The coal industry used up the more accessible coal. As costs rose, output fell from 267 million tons in 1924 to 183 million in 1945.B.R. Mitchell, Abstract of British Historical Statistics (1962) pp. 116‚Äì17 The Labour government nationalised the mines in 1947. Starting in 1909, Liberals, led especially by Lloyd George, promoted the idea of a minimum wage for farm workers. Resistance from landowners was strong, but success was achieved by 1924.Alun Howkins and Nicola Verdon. \\"The state and the farm worker: the evolution of the minimum wage in agriculture in England and Wales, 1909‚Äì24.\\" Agricultural history review 57.2 (2009): 257‚Äì274. According to Robin Gowers and Timothy J. Hatton, the impact in England and Wales was significant. They estimate that it raised wages for farm labourers by 15 percent by 1929, and by more than 20 per cent in the 1930s. It reduced the employment of such labourers by 54,000 (6.5 per cent) in 1929 and 97,000 (13.3 per cent) in 1937. They argue, \\"The minimum wage lifted out of poverty many families of farm labourers who remained employed, but it significantly lowered the incomes of farmers, particularly during the 1930s.\\"Robin Gowers and Timothy J. Hatton,, \\"The origins and early impact of the minimum wage in agriculture.\\" Economic History Review 50#1 (1997): 82‚Äì103. =Food= After the War many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. The shortage of servants was felt in the kitchen, but instead of an experienced cook spending hours on difficult custards and puddings the housewife could purchase instant foods in jars, or powders that could be quickly mixed. Breakfast porridge from branded, more finely milled, oats could be cooked in two minutes, not 20. American- style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. Shops carried more bottled and canned goods and fresher meat, fish and vegetables. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choices, the 1920s saw many new kinds of foods‚Äîespecially fruits‚Äîimported from around the world, along with better quality packaging and hygiene. Middle-class households often had ice boxes or electric refrigerators, which made for better storage and the convenience of buying in larger quantities.Robert Graves and Alan Hodge, The Long Week-End: A Social History of Great Britain 1918‚Äì1939 (1940) pp. 175‚Äì176. Numerous studies in the Depression years documented that the average consumer ate better than before. Seebohm Rowntree reported that the \\"standard to workers in 1936 was about 30 percent higher than it was in 1899.\\"Noreen Branson and Margot Heinemann, Britain in the 1930s (1971) pp. 241‚Äì42. The dairy industry was producing too much, and profits were too low. So the government used the Milk Marketing Board to give a guaranteed price to dairy farmers ‚Äì a policy ridiculed by The Economist as the \\"economics of Bedlam.\\"Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the wars, 1918‚Äì1940 (1955) p. 439. Food prices were low, but the advantage went overwhelmingly to the middle and upper classes, with the poorest third of the population suffering from sustained poor nutrition. Starvation was not a factor, but widespread hunger was. The deleterious effects on poor children were obvious to teachers. In 1934, the government began a program of charging school children a halfpenny a day for a third of a pint of milk. This dramatically improved their nutrition, and the new demand kept up the wholesale price of milk paid to farmers. About half the nation's school children participated by 1936. Milk was distributed for free in the Second World War, and participation rose to 90 percent. Indeed, the rationing system of the wartime years sharply improved the nutrition of poorest third, together with their capacity for manual labour.Branson and Heinemann, Britain in the 1930s (1971) pp. 202‚Äì20. Great Depression The Great Depression originated on Wall Street in the United States in late 1929, and quickly spread to the rest of the world. The main impact of the economic slump was felt in 1931.John Stevenson and Chris Cook, The Slump: Britain in the Great Depression (2009) Unlike Germany, Canada and Australia, Britain had not experienced a boom in the 1920s, so the downturn was less severe and ended sooner. =Worldwide crisis= By summer 1931 the world financial crisis began to overwhelm Britain; investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of ¬£2¬Ω million a day.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the wars, 1918‚Äì1940 (1955) pp. 379-385.David Williams, \\"London and the 1931 financial crisis.\\" Economic History Review 15.3 (1963): 513‚Äì528. Credits of ¬£25 million each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of ¬£15 million in fiduciary notes slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits by 20%. The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but the King insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition \\"National government.\\" The Conservative and Liberal parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the gold standard, and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as Prime Minister of a largely Conservative coalition.C. L. Mowat, Britain between the wars, 1918‚Äì1940 (1955) pp. 386‚Äì412.Sean Glynn and John Oxborrow, Interwar Britain : a social and economic history (1976) pp. 67‚Äì73. The flight of gold continued, however, and the Treasury finally was forced to abandon the gold standard in September 1931. Until then the government had religiously followed orthodox policies, which demanded balanced-budgets and the gold standard. Instead of the predicted disaster, cutting loose from gold proved a major advantage. Immediately the exchange rate of the pound fell by 25%, from $4.86 for one pound to $3.40. British exports were then much more competitive, which laid the ground for a gradual economic recovery. The worst was over.Peter Dewey, War and progress: Britain 1914‚Äì1945 (1997) 224‚Äì32Diane B. Kunz, The battle for Britain's gold standard in 1931 (1987). Britain's world trade fell in half (1929‚Äì33); the output of heavy industry fell by a third. Employment and profits plunged in nearly all sectors. At the depth in summer 1932, registered unemployed numbered 3.5 million, and many more had only part-time employment.William Ashworth, An economic history of England, 1870‚Äì1939 (2005) pp. 325-33. The government tried to work inside the Commonwealth, raising tariffs for products from the United States, France and Britain, while giving preference to Commonwealth members.C.L. Mowat, Britain between the Wars, pp. 366‚Äì68, 415‚Äì16.Sean Glynn and Alan Booth, Modern Britain: An economic and social history (1996) pp. 118‚Äì24, 138‚Äì40. =Organized protests= The north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales suffered particularly severe economic problems, especially if they depended on coal, steel or shipbuilding. Unemployment reached 70% in some mining localities at the start of the 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally). The government was cautious and conservative, rejecting the Keynesian proposal for large-scale public works projects.John Stevenson and Chris Cook, The Slump: Britain in the Great Depression (3rd ed. 1994) pp. 64‚Äì115. Doomsayers on the left such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb, J. A. Hobson, and G. D. H. Cole repeated the dire warnings they had been making for years about the imminent death of capitalism, only this time far more people paid attention.Richard Overy, Twilight Years, ch 2 Starting in 1935 the Left Book Club provided a new warning every month, and built up the credibility of Soviet-style socialism as an alternative. In 1936, by which time unemployment was lower, 200 unemployed men made a highly publicised march from Jarrow to London in a bid to show the plight of the industrial poor. Although much romanticised by the Left, the Jarrow Crusade marked a deep split in the Labour Party and resulted in no government action. Unemployment remained high until the war absorbed all the job seekers. George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier gives a bleak overview of the hardships of the time. =Historiography= The economic crisis of the early 1930s, and the response of the Labour and National governments to the depression, have generated much historical controversy. Apart from the major pockets of long- term high unemployment, Britain was generally prosperous. Historian Piers Brendon writes: \\"Historians, however, have long since revised this grim picture, presenting the devil's decade as the cradle of the affluent society. Prices fell sharply between the wars and average incomes rose by about a third. The term \\"property-owning democracy\\" was coined in the 1920s, and three million houses were built during the 1930s. Land, labour and materials were cheap: a bungalow could be purchased for ¬£225 and a semi for ¬£450. The middle class also bought radiograms, telephones, three-piece suites, electric cookers, vacuum cleaners and golf clubs. They ate Kellogg's Corn Flakes (\\"never miss a day\\"), drove to Odeon cinemas in Austin Sevens (costing ¬£135 by 1930) and smoked Craven A cigarettes, cork-tipped \\"to prevent sore throats\\". The depression spawned a consumer boom.\\" In the decades immediately following the Second World War, most historical opinion was critical of the governments of the period. Some historians, such as Robert Skidelsky in his Politicians and the Slump, compared the orthodox policies of the Labour and National governments unfavourably with the more radical proto-Keynesian measures advocated by David Lloyd George and Oswald Mosley, and the more interventionist and Keynesian responses in other economies: Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal in the United States, the Labour government in New Zealand, and the Social Democratic government in Sweden. Since the 1970s opinion has become less uniformly hostile. In the preface to the 1994 edition, Skidelsky argues that recent experience of currency crises and capital flight make it hard to be so critical of the politicians who wanted to achieve stability by cutting labour costs and defending the value of the currency.Roderick Floud and D.N. McCloskey, eds. The economic history of Britain since 1700 (2nd ed. 1994) vol 2 pp. 291‚Äì414.For the econometric debate see Michael Collins, \\"Unemployment in Interwar Britain: Still Searching for an Explanation,\\" Journal of Political Economy 90#2 (1982): 369-379. Commonwealth and Empire After taking over the League of Nations mandates on certain German and Ottoman territories in 1919, the British Empire reached its territorial peak. The interwar years saw extensive efforts for economic and educational development of the colonies. The Dominions were prosperous and largely took care of themselves. By far the most troublesome areas for London were India and Palestine.Judith M. Brown and Wm. Roger Louis, eds. The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume IV: The Twentieth Century (1999).Paul Knaplund, ed. Britain: commonwealth and empire, 1901‚Äì1955 (1957)W. K.

Medlicott, Contemporary England 1914‚Äì1964 (1967), 272‚Äì31 British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921 The Dominions (Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand) achieved virtual independence in foreign policy in the Statute of Westminster 1931, though each depended heavily upon British naval protection.K. C. Wheare, The Statute of Westminster, 1931 (1933). After 1931 trade policy favoured Imperial Preference with higher tariffs against the U.S. and all others outside the Commonwealth.David L. Glickman, \\"The British imperial preference system.\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics 61.3 (1947): 439‚Äì470. in Jstor In India, the forces of nationalism were being organised by the Indian National Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. India contributed significantly to victory in the World War, and was bitterly disappointed by the very limited benefits conferred in the Government of India Act 1919.Amales Tripathi, Indian National Congress and the Struggle for Freedom: 1885‚Äì1947 (2014) ch 2. British fears of German wartime plots or postwar Communism following the Ghadar Mutiny ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Act of 1919 that suppressed dissent. Tensions escalated particularly in the Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion.Kim A. Wagner, \\"‚ÄòCalculated to Strike Terror‚Äô: The Amritsar Massacre and the Spectacle of Colonial Violence,\\" Past and Present 233#1 (2016): 185‚Äì225. Gandhi developed the technique of nonviolent resistance, claiming moral superiority over the British use of violence.Sean Chabot, \\"The Gandhian Repertoire as Transformative Invention.\\" International Journal of Hindu Studies 18.3 (2014): 327-367. Multiple negotiations were held in the 1930s, but a strong reactionary movement in Britain, led by Winston Churchill, blocked the adoption of reforms that would satisfy Indian nationalists. Historian Lawrence James states: :From 1930 to 1935 [Churchill] was a Cassandra, warning the country that the government's policy of allowing self- determination for India would be a catastrophe for Britain and mark the beginning of the end for her Empire. His language was stark and his imagery apocalyptic: India was facing a prolonged crisis which successive governments had failed to resolve. The Conservatives in Parliament designed the Government of India Act 1935 to create a federation that would facilitate continued British control and deflect the challenge of Congress.Andrew Muldoon, Empire, politics and the creation of the 1935 India Act: Last Act of the Raj (2009) The Labour Party, although in a weak minority in the 1930s, gave support to Congress and worked with Indians in Britain; after 1945 it was in a position to grant India independence.Judith M. Brown, \\"India\\" in Judith M. Brown and Wm. Roger Louis, eds. The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume IV: The Twentieth Century (1999) pp. 421‚Äì46. Egypt was nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, although under British rule, until 1914, when London declared it a protectorate. Independence was formally granted in 1922, though it continued to be a British client state until 1954. British troops remained stationed to guard the Suez Canal. Egypt joined the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. Iraq remained under firm British guidance regarding foreign affairs, defence policy, and oil policy. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine. Tens of thousands of Jews immigrated from Europe. The Arab population revolted in 1936. As the prospect of war with Germany loomed larger, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency. =Dominions control their foreign policies= George V with the British and Dominion prime ministers at the 1926 Imperial Conference As Britain's Prime Minister, Lloyd George requested military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis in Turkey in 1922. He was rejected.J. G. Darwin, \\"The Chanak Crisis and the British Cabinet\\", History (1980) 65#213 pp 32‚Äì48. online The World War had greatly strengthened the sense of nationalism and self-confidence in the dominions. They were by then independent members of the League of Nations, and refused to automatically follow requests from Britain's leaders. The right of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference. The 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration of 1926, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. India, however, was denied dominion status and its foreign policy was set by London. Newfoundland was overwhelmed by the economic disasters of the Great depression and voluntarily gave up its dominion status. It reverted to a crown colony under direct British control until it voted to join Canada in 1948.James Overton, \\"Economic Crisis and the End of Democracy: Politics in Newfoundland During the Great Depression.\\" Labour (1990) 26: 85‚Äì124. The Irish Free State broke its ties with London with a new constitution in 1937, making it a republic in all but name. Foreign policy Britain had suffered little physical devastation during the war but the cost in death and disability and money were very high. In the Khaki Election of 1918, coming a month after the Allied victory over Germany, Lloyd George promised to impose a harsh treaty on Germany. At the Paris Peace Conference in early 1919, however, he took a much more moderate approach. France and Italy demanded and achieved harsh terms, including German admission of guilt for starting the war (which humiliated Germany), and a demand that Germany pay the entire Allied cost of the war, including veterans' benefits and interest. Britain reluctantly supported the Treaty of Versailles, although many experts, most famously John Maynard Keynes, thought it too harsh on Germany Margaret MacMillan, \\"Making War, Making Peace: Versailles, 1919.\\" Queen's Quarterly 121.1 (2014): 24-38. online Margaret MacMillan, Paris 1919: Six Months that Changed the World (2001).Antony Lentin, Lloyd George and the lost peace: from Versailles to Hitler, 1919‚Äì1940 (Palgrave Macmillan, 2001). Britain began to look on a restored Germany as an important trading partner and worried about the effect of reparations on the British economy. In the end the United States financed German debt payments to Britain, France and the other Allies through the Dawes Plan, and Britain used this income to repay the loans it borrowed from the U.S. during the war. Vivid memories of the horrors and deaths of the World War made Britain and its leaders strongly inclined to pacifism in the interwar era.Michael Pugh, Liberal internationalism: the interwar movement for peace in Britain (2012). =1920s= Britain maintained close relationships with France and the United States, rejected isolationism, and sought world peace through naval arms limitation treaties,B.

A main goal was to restore Germany to a peaceful, prosperous state.Frank Magee, \\"‚ÄòLimited Liability‚Äô? Britain and the Treaty of Locarno.\\" Twentieth Century British History 6.1 (1995): 1‚Äì22. With disarmament high on the agenda, Britain played a major role following the United States in the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 in working toward naval disarmament of the major powers. By 1933 disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany.Raymond G. O'Connor, \\"The 'Yardstick' and Naval Disarmament in the 1920s.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 45.3 (1958): 441‚Äì463. in JSTOR At the Washington Conference Britain abandoned the Two power standard - her long-time policy of paramount naval strength equal to or greater than the next two naval powers combined. Instead it accepted equality with United States, and weakness in Asian waters relative to Japan. It promised to not strengthen the fortifications of Hong Kong, which were within range of Japan. The treaty with Japan was not renewed, But Japan at the time was not engaged in expansion activities of the sort that grew momentous from 1931 onward. London cut loose from Tokyo but moved much closer to Washington.W.N. Medlicott, British foreign policy since Versailles, 1919‚Äì1963 (1968). pp. 18-31 Politically the coalition government of Prime Minister David Lloyd George depended primarily on Conservative Party support. He increasingly antagonised his supporters with foreign policy miscues. The Chanak Crisis of 1922 brought Britain to the brink of war with Turkey, but the Dominions were opposed and the British military was hesitant, so peace was preserved. This was one of the factors causing Conservative MPs to vote, at the Carlton Club meeting, to fight the next election as a separate party; Lloyd George then resigned as Prime Minister, ending the coalition government.Michael Laird, \\"Wars Averted: Chanak 1922, Burma 1945‚Äì47, Berlin 1948,\\" Journal of Strategic Studies (1996) 19#3 pp. 343-364. The success at Locarno in handling the German question impelled Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain, working with France and Italy, to find a master solution to the diplomatic problems of Eastern Europe and the Balkans. It proved impossible to overcome mutual antagonisms, because Chamberlain's programme was flawed by his misperceptions and fallacious judgments.Dragan Bakiƒá, \\"'Must Will Peace': The British Brokering of 'Central European' and 'Balkan Locarno', 1925‚Äì9.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 48.1 (2013): 24‚Äì56. =1930s= The great challenge came from dictators, first Benito Mussolini of Italy from 1923, then from 1933 Adolf Hitler of a much more powerful Nazi Germany. Britain and France led the policy of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). The League of Nations proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators. British policy was to \\"appease\\" them in the hopes they would be satiated. League-authorised sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Ethiopia had support in Britain but proved a failure and were dropped in 1936.James C. Robertson, \\"The Origins of British Opposition to Mussolini over Ethiopia.\\" Journal of British Studies 9#1 (1969): 122‚Äì142. Germany was the difficult case. By 1930 British leaders and intellectuals largely agreed that all major powers shared the blame for war in 1914, and not Germany alone as the Treaty of Versailles specified. Therefore, they believed the punitive harshness of the Treaty of Versailles was unwarranted, and this view, adopted by politicians and the public, was largely responsible for supporting appeasement policies down to 1938. That is, German rejections of treaty provisions seemed justified.Catherine Ann Cline, \\"British Historians and the Treaty of Versailles.\\" Albion 20#1 (1988): 43‚Äì58. =Coming of Second World War= By late 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. British military leaders warned that Germany would win a war, and Britain needed another year or two to catch up in terms of aviation and air defence. Appeasement of Germany‚Äîgiving in to its demands‚Äîwas the government's policy until early 1939. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the Munich Agreement of 1938.David Faber, Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II (2010) Instead of satiation Hitler then seized the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and menaced Poland. In response Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain rejected further appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler unexpectedly cut a deal with Joseph Stalin to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead.Donald Cameron Watt, How War Came: Immediate Origins of the Second World War, 1938‚Äì39 (1990) Religion While the Church of England was historically identified with the upper classes, and with the rural gentry, William Temple (1881‚Äì1944) was both a prolific theologian and a social activist, preaching Christian socialism.Adrian Hastings, \\"Temple, William (1881‚Äì1944)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/36454 He served as bishop of Manchester and York, and in 1942 became Archbishop of Canterbury. He advocated a broad and inclusive membership in the Church of England as a means of continuing and expanding the church's position as the established church. Temple was troubled by the high degree of animosity inside, and between the leading religious groups in Britain. In the 1930s he promoted ecumenicism, working to establish better relationships with the Nonconformists, Jews and Catholics, managing in the process to overcome his anti-Catholic bias.Dianne Kirby, \\"Christian co-operation and the ecumenical ideal in the 1930s and 1940s.\\" European Review of History 8.1 (2001): 37‚Äì60.F.

Iremonger, William Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury: His Life and Letters (1948) pp. 387‚Äì425. =Slow decline in religiosity= Although the overall population was growing steadily, and the Catholic membership was keeping pace, the Protestants were slipping behind. Out of 30‚Äì50 million adults, they dropped slowly from 5.7 million members in 1920, and 5.4 million in 1940, to 4.3 million in 1970.McKibben pp. 273‚Äì65 The Church of England decline was parallel. Methodism, the largest of the Nonconformist churches reached a peak of 841,000 members in Great Britain in 1910, slipped to 802,000 in 1920, 792,000 in 1940 729,000 in 1960, and 488,000 in 1980.David Hempton, Methodism: Empire of the Spirit (2005). p 214. The Nonconformists had built a strong base In industrial districts that specialised in mining textiles agriculture and fishing; those were declining industries, who share of the total male workforce Was in steady decline, from 21 percent in 1921 to 13 percent in 1951. As the families migrated to southern England, or to the suburbs, they often lost contact with their childhood religion.McKibben p. 282 The political reverberations were most serious for the Liberal Party, which was largely based in the nonconformist community, and which rapidly lost membership in the 1920s as its leadership quarrelled, the Irish Catholics and many from the working-class moved to the Labour Party, and part of the middle class moved to the Conservative party.John F. Glaser, \\"English Nonconformity and the Decline of Liberalism,\\" American Historical Review 63#2 (1958), pp. 352‚Äì363 in JSTOR Hoping to stem the membership decline, the three major Methodist groups merged in 1932. In Scotland the two major Presbyterian groups, the Church of Scotland and the United Free Church, merged in 1929 for the same reason. Nonetheless the steady declension continued.McKibben pp. 284‚Äì85. The nonconformist churches showed not just a decline in membership but a dramatic fall in enthusiasm. Sunday school attendance plummeted; there were far fewer new ministers. Antagonism toward the Anglican church sharply declined, and many prominent nonconformists became Anglicans, including some leading ministers. There was a falling away in the size and fervour of congregations, less interest in funding missionaries, a decline in intellectualism, and persistent complaints about the lack of money.Adrian Hastings, A History of English Christianity: 1920‚Äì1985 (1986) pp. 264‚Äì72 Commentator D.W. Brogan reported in 1943: :in the generation that has passed since the great Liberal landslide of 1906, one of the greatest changes in the English religious and social landscape has been the decline of Nonconformity. Partly that decline has been due to the general weakening of the hold of Christianity on the English people, partly it is been due to the comparative irrelevance of the peculiarly Nonconformist (as a part from Christian) view of the contemporary world and its problems.\\"Quoted in One aspect of the long-term decline in religiosity was that Protestant showed less and less interest in sending their children to religious schools. In localities across England, fierce battles were fought between the Nonconformists, Anglicans, and Catholics, each with their own school systems supported by taxes, and secular schools, and taxpayers. The Nonconformists had long taken the lead in fighting the Anglicans, who a century before had practically monopolised education. The Anglican share of the elementary school population fell from 57% in 1918 to 39% in 1939.David Parker, \\"'Stand Therefore!'‚ÄîBishop Michael Bolton Furse, the Diocese of St. Albans, and the Church Schools Controversy, 1919‚Äì1939.\\" History of Education Quarterly 39#2 (1999): 161‚Äì192. online With the sustained decline in Nonconformist enthusiasm their schools closed one after another. In 1902 the Methodist Church operated 738 schools; only 28 remained in 1996.John T. Smith, \\"Ecumenism, economic necessity and the disappearance of Methodist elementary schools in England in the twentieth century.\\" History of Education (2010) 39#4 pp. 631‚Äì657. Britain continued to think of itself is a Christian country; there were a few atheists or nonbelievers, but unlike the continent, there was no anti-clericalism worthy of note. A third or more prayed every day. Large majorities used formal church services to mark birth, marriage and death.McKibben pp. 280‚Äì90. The great majority believed in God and heaven, although belief in hell fell off after all the deaths of the World War. After 1918, Church of England services stopped practically all discussion of hell. =Prayer Book crisis= Parliament had governed the Church of England since 1688, but was increasingly eager to turn control over to the church itself. It passed the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 to establish the Church Assembly, with three houses for bishops, clergy, and laity, and permitted it to legislate regulations for the Church, subject to formal approval of Parliament.Roger Lloyd, The Church of England in the 20th Century (1950) 2:5‚Äì18 A crisis suddenly emerged in 1927 over the Church's proposal to revise the classic Book of Common Prayer, which had been in daily use since 1662. The goal was to better incorporate moderate Anglo-Catholicism into the life of the Church. The bishops sought a more tolerant, comprehensive established Church. After internal debate the Church Assembly gave its approval. Evangelicals inside the Church, and Nonconformists outside, were outraged because they understood England's religious national identity to be emphatically Protestant and anti-Catholic. They denounced the revisions as a concession to ritualism and tolerance of Roman Catholicism. They mobilised support in parliament, which twice rejected the revisions after intensely heated debates. The Anglican hierarchy compromised in 1929, while strictly prohibiting extreme and Anglo-Catholic practices.G. I. T. Machin, \\"Parliament, the Church of England, and the Prayer Book Crisis, 1927‚Äì8.\\" Parliamentary History 19.1 (2000): 131‚Äì147.John G. Maiden, \\"English Evangelicals, Protestant National Identity, and Anglican Prayer Book Revision, 1927‚Äì1928.\\" Journal of Religious History 34#4 (2010): 430‚Äì445. =Divorce and the abdication of the King= Standards of morality in Britain changed dramatically after the world wars, in the direction of more personal freedom, especially in sexual matters. The Church tried to hold the line, and was especially concerned to stop the rapid trend toward divorce. In 1935 it reaffirmed that, \\"in no circumstances can Christian men or women re-marry during the lifetime of a wife or a husband.\\" The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang, held that the King, as the head of the Church of England, could not marry a divorc√©e.G. I. T. Machin, \\"Marriage and the Churches in the 1930s: Royal abdication and divorce reform, 1936‚Äì7.\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History 42.1 (1991): 68‚Äì81. Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin objected vigorously, noting that \\"although it is true that standards are lower since the war it only leads people to expect a higher standard from their King.\\"Holmes, p 45. Baldwin was supported by his Conservative Party (except Churchill), as well as the Labour Party, and the prime ministers of the Commonwealth. King Edward VIII therefore was forced to abdicate the throne in 1936 when he insisted on marrying an American divorc√©e. Although public opinion gave him considerable support, elite opinion was hostile, and he was practically forced into exile. Archbishop Lang in a radio broadcast lashed out, blaming the upper-class social circles that Edward frequented: : Even more strange and sad it is that he should have sought his happiness in a manner inconsistent with the Christian principles of marriage, and within a social circle whose standards and ways of life are alien to all the best instincts and traditions of the people....Let those who belong to this circle know that to-day they stand rebuked by the judgment of the nation which loved King Edward.McKibbin, Classes and Cultures p 279, Edward's biographer Philip Ziegler argues that Edward was poorly prepared to be King, because of deep personal weaknesses; he was inconsistent, superficial and incapable of resisting distractions, and handled the constitutional issues poorly.Philip Ziegler, King Edward VIII (1991) p. 560. Frank Mort argues that cultural historians have read the abdication story not so much as a constitutional crisis, but as an indicator of: :The ascendancy of a female ethos of domesticity and privacy....Intense interest in the King's affair ...[exemplified] this obsession with personal life, which was itself part of the media-fuelled emotional character of the late 1930s.Frank Mort, \\"Love in a Cold Climate: letters, public opinion and monarchy in the 1936 abdication crisis.\\" Twentieth Century British History 25.1 (2013): 30‚Äì62, quote on p 34. John Charmley argues in the history of the Conservative Party that Baldwin was pushing for more democracy, and less of an old aristocratic upper-class tone. Monarchy was to be a national foundation, whereby the head of the Church. the State, and the Empire, by drawing upon 1000 years of tradition, could unify the nation. George V was an ideal fit: \\"an ordinary little man with the philistine tastes of most of his subjects, he could be presented as the archetypical English paterfamilias getting on with his duties without fuss.\\" Charmley finds that George V and Baldwin, ‚Äúmade a formidable conservative team, with their ordinary, honest, English decency proving the first (and most effective) bulwark against revolution.‚Äù Edward VIII, flaunting his upper-class playboy style, suffered from an unstable neurotic character. He needed a strong stabilising partner‚Äîa role Mrs. Simpson was unable to provide. Baldwin's final achievement was to smooth the way for Edward to abdicate in favour of his younger brother who became George VI. Father and son both demonstrated the value of a democratic king during the severe physical and psychological hardships of the world wars, and their tradition was carried on by Elizabeth II. Popular culture =Newspapers= After the war, the major newspapers engaged in a large-scale circulation race. The political parties, which long had sponsored their own papers, could not keep up, and one after another their outlets were sold or closed down.Stephen E. Koss, The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain: The Twentieth Century (1984) 2:471‚Äì73. Sales in the millions depended on popular stories, with a strong human interesting theme, as well as detailed sports reports with the latest scores. Serious news was a niche market and added very little to the circulation base. The niche was dominated by The Times and, to a lesser extent, The Daily Telegraph. Consolidation was rampant, as local dailies were bought up and added to chains based in London. James Curran and Jean Seaton report: : after the death of Lord Northcliffe in 1922, four men‚ÄìLords Beaverbrook (1879‚Äì1964), Rothermere (1868‚Äì1940), Camrose (1879‚Äì1954) and Kemsley (1883‚Äì1968)‚Äìbecame the dominant figures in the inter-war press. In 1937, for instance, they owned nearly one in every two national and local daily papers sold in Britain, as well as one in every three Sunday papers that were sold. The combined circulation of all their newspapers amounted to over thirteen million. The Times of London was long the most influential prestige newspaper, although far from having the largest circulation. It gave far more attention to serious political and cultural news.Koss, The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain: The Twentieth Century (1984) 2:516‚Äì17. In 1922, John Jacob Astor (1886‚Äì1971), son of the 1st Viscount Astor (1849‚Äì1919), bought The Times from the Northcliffe estate. The paper advocated appeasement of Hitler's demands. Its editor Geoffrey Dawson was closely allied with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and pushed hard for the Munich Agreement in 1938. Candid news reports by Norman Ebbut from Berlin that warned of warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy. In March 1939, however, it reversed course and called for urgent war preparations.Gordon Martel, ed. The Times and Appeasement: The Journals of A L Kennedy, 1932‚Äì1939 (2000).Frank McDonough, \\"The Times, Norman Ebbut and the Nazis, 1927-37.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 27#3 (1992): 407‚Äì424. online =Expanded leisure= As leisure, literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the late 19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes.Peter J. Beck, \\"Leisure and Sport in Britain.\\" in Chris Wrigley, ed., A Companion to Early Twentieth-Century Britain (2008): pp. 453‚Äì469. Drinking was differentiated by class. with upper-class clubs, and working-class and middle- class pubs. However, drinking as a way of spending leisure time and spare cash declined during the Depression and pub attendance never returned to 1930 levels; it fell far below prewar levels.Peter Haydon, The English pub: a history (1994). Taxes were raised on beer, but there were more alternatives at hand, such as cigarettes (which attracted 8/10 men, and 4/10 women), the talkies, the dance halls, and Greyhound racing. Football pools offered the excitement of betting on a range of results. New estates with small, inexpensive houses offered gardening as an outdoor recreation. Church attendance declined to half the level of 1901.Noreen Branson and Margot Heinemann, Britain in the 1930s (1971) pp. 269‚Äì70. The annual holiday became common. Tourists flocked to seaside resorts; Blackpool hosted 7 million visitors a year in the 1930s.John K. Walton, The English Seaside Resort. A social history 1750‚Äì1914 (1983). Organised leisure was primarily a male activity, with middle-class women allowed in at the margins. Participation in sports and all sorts of leisure activities increased for the average Englishman, and his interest in spectator sports increased dramatically. By the 1920s the cinema and radio attracted all classes, ages and genders in very large numbers, with young women taking the lead.John K. Walton, Leisure in Britain, 1780‚Äì1939 (1983). Working-class men were boisterous football spectators. They sang along at the music hall, fancied their pigeons, gambled on horse racing, and took the family to seaside resorts in summer. Political activists complained that working-class leisure diverted men away from revolutionary agitation.Peter J. Beck, \\"Leisure and Sport in Britain.\\" in Chris Wrigley, ed., A Companion to Early Twentieth-Century Britain (2008) p 457 =Cinema and radio= Film director Alfred Hitchcock, 1955 The British film industry emerged in the 1890s, and built heavily on the strong reputation of the London legitimate theatre for actors, directors, and producers.Charles Barr, All our yesterdays: 90 years of British cinema (British Film Institute, 1986).Amy Sargeant, British Cinema: A Critical History (2008).Jeffrey Richards, Age of the Dream Palace: Cinema & Society in Britain 1930‚Äì1939 (1990). The problem was that the American market was so much larger and richer. It bought up the top talent, especially when Hollywood came to the fore in the 1920s and produced over 80 percent of the total world output. Efforts to fight back were futile ‚Äî the government set a quota for British made films, but it failed. Hollywood furthermore dominated the lucrative Canadian and Australian markets. Bollywood (based in Bombay) dominated the huge Indian market. The most prominent directors remaining in London were Alexander Korda, an expatriate Hungarian, and Alfred Hitchcock. There was a revival of creativity in the 1933‚Äì45 era, especially with the arrival of Jewish filmmakers and actors fleeing the Nazis.Kevin Gough-Yates, \\"Jews and exiles in British cinema.\\" The Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook 37#.1 (1992): 517‚Äì541.Tobias Hochscherf, The Continental Connection: German-Speaking √âmigr√©s and British Cinema, 1927‚Äì45 (2011). Meanwhile, giant palaces were built for the huge audiences that wanted to see Hollywood films. In Liverpool 40 percent of the population attended one of the 69 cinemas once a week; 25 percent went twice. Traditionalists grumbled about the American cultural invasion, but the permanent impact was minor.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the Wars 1918‚Äì1940 (1955) pp. 246‚Äì50McKibbin, Classes and Cultures: England 1918‚Äì1951 (2000) pp. 419‚Äì56. In radio British audiences had no choice apart from the highbrow programming of the BBC, which had a monopoly on broadcasting. John Reith (1889 ‚Äì 1971), an intensely moralistic engineer, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast, \\"All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement.... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance.\\"C. L. Mowat, Britain between the Wars 1918‚Äì1940 (1955) p 242. Reith succeeded in building a high wall against an American-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue. There was no paid advertising on the BBC; all the revenue came from a licence fee charged for the possession of receivers. Highbrow audiences, however, greatly enjoyed it. At a time when American, Australian and Canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball, rugby and ice-hockey, the BBC emphasised service for a national, rather than a regional audience. Boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing, but the BBC was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games, regardless of their popularity.Mike Huggins, \\"BBC Radio and Sport 1922-39,\\" Contemporary British History (2007) 21#4 pp. 491‚Äì515.McKibbin, Classes and Cultures: England 1918‚Äì1951 (2000) pp. 457‚Äì76. =Sports= The British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, than any rival.Ross McKibbin, Classes and Cultures: England 1918‚Äì1951 (2000) pp. 332‚Äì85. They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play. Cricket became symbolic of the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire. Football proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. In some sports there was significant controversy in the fight for amateur purity especially in rugby and rowing. New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones. The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing.Derek Birley, Land of sport and glory: Sport and British society, 1887‚Äì1910 (1995)Derek Birley, Playing the Game: Sport and British Society, 1914‚Äì1945 (1995) Cricket had become well-established among the English upper class in the 18th century, and was a major factor in sports competition among the public schools. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals to learn cricket so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Dominions of the Empire embraced cricket as a major sport, with the exception of Canada. Cricket test matches (international) began by the 1870s; the most famous are those between Australia and England for The Ashes.Derek Birley, A Social History of English Cricket (1999) excerpt For sports to become fully professionalised, coaching had to come first. It gradually professionalised in the Victorian era and the role was well established by 1914. In the First World War, military units sought out the coaches to supervise physical conditioning and develop morale-building teams.Dave Day, Professionals, Amateurs and Performance: Sports Coaching in England, 1789‚Äì1914 (2012) =Reading= As literacy and leisure time expanded after 1900 reading became a popular pastime. New additions to adult fiction doubled during the 1920s, reaching 2800 new books a year by 1935. Libraries tripled their stock, and saw heavy demand for new fiction. A dramatic innovation was the inexpensive paperback, pioneered by Allen Lane (1902‚Äì70) at Penguin Books in 1935. The first titles included novels by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheaply (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworth's. Penguin aimed at an educated middle class \\"middlebrow\\" audience. It avoided the downscale image of American paperbacks. The line signalled cultural self-improvement and political education. The more polemical Penguin Specials, typically with a leftist orientation for Labour readers, were widely distributed during the Second World War.Nicholas Joicey, \\"A Paperback Guide to Progress Penguin Books 1935‚Äìc. 1951.\\" Twentieth Century British History 4#1 (1993): 25‚Äì56. online However the war years caused a shortage of staff for publishers and book stores, and a severe shortage of rationed paper, worsened by the air raid on Paternoster Row in 1940 that burned 5 million books in warehouses.Joseph McAleer, Popular Reading and Publishing in Britain: 1914‚Äì1950 (1992). Romantic fiction was especially popular, with Mills and Boon the leading publisher.Joseph McAleer, Passion's fortune: the story of Mills & Boon (1999). Romantic encounters were embodied in a principle of sexual purity that demonstrated not only social conservatism, but also how heroines could control their personal autonomy.Nicola Humble, The Feminine Middlebrow Novel, 1920s to 1950s: Class, Domesticity, and Bohemianism (2001).Alison Light, Forever England: femininity, literature and conservatism between the wars (1991). Adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by DC Thomson; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines, comic books and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.Ernest Sackville Turner, Boys Will Be Boys: The Story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton et al. (3rd ed. 1975). D.C. Thomson issued the first The Dandy Comic in December 1937. It had a revolutionary design that broke away from the usual children's comics that were published broadsheet in size and not very colourful. Thomson capitalised on its success with a similar product The Beano in 1938.

She was the first president of the Maricopa Pottery Maker's Association and was widely credited with the revival of ancient Maricopa pottery techniques and forms. Her polished black-on-redware pottery was highly prized with collectors. Texas photographer Ted Sayles shot a series documenting Redbird sculpting her pottery. The series toured museums throughout the Western United States Early life Ida Redbird was born March 15, 1892, in Laveen on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona to Hoot Somegustava. Hoot, Ida's mother, is sometimes described as Tohono O'odham and at other times as Maricopa- Halchidhoma. Ida was the granddaughter of Kutox (also known as Kut≈è‚ÄôxÃ£ or Uw»ß‚Äôny»ß), who was Halchidhoma and wife of Charlie Redbird (also known as Mat»ßkwƒ≠snunyƒï‚Äô), who was Maricopa-Halchidhoma. Ida attended Phoenix Indian School, where her former teacher remembered her a being a shy, serious student, who learned pottery at a young age. Career In the 1920s, Redbird acted as an interpreter for Leslie Spier's work Yuman Tribes of the Gila River. By the 1930s, her work became known and was selling to dealers from Los Angeles, though for mere pennies. Even though the Great Depression had reduced all wages, the price was still a pittance‚Äìa situation Redbird sought to change. Organizing other potters, and backed by Elizabeth Hart, a Home Extension Agent for the U.S. Indian Service, Redbird strove to improve their products so potters could increase their prices. Her efforts earned her the respect of fellow potters, who elected her first president of the Maricopa Pottery Maker's Association. Redbird's pottery was typically a highly polished redware painted with designs in black slip. She built her pots with the paddle-and-anvil technique rather than a coil method. Her method was developed by ancient Hohokam artisans and used local clay from the Gila Riverbed. Once the vessel had dried for several days, a red clay from the Superstition Mountains was liquefied in and applied. When that slip dried, it was burnished with a stone and then fired outside. When the firing had been completed and while the piece was still hot, geometric shapes were painted on it with a boiled mesquite-bark dye. In 1940, E. B. \\"Ted\\" Sayles took images of Redbird and her pottery making techniques. Sales, who was curator of the Arizona State Museum in Tucson, took the photographs to Abilene, Texas, for a show at the Abilene Fine Arts Museum. They were also featured in Arizona Highways Magazine in January 1948. From 1941 until her death, Redbird taught summer classes and exhibited her works at the Heard Museum of Phoenix, Arizona. She and Mary Juan also held pottery classes at Casa Grande. In 1949, Redbird served as an interpreter for Lenora S. M. Curtin in her study of the Pima people, By the Prophet of the Earth. Curtin described Redbird as one of the two best potters of the Maricopa and noted that she was also a skilled herbalist. Guy Acuff regarded Redbird and Lena Mesquerre as two of the best Maricopa potters. Paul Huldermann, founder of the Scottsdale National Indian Arts Exhibition; Tom Cain, curator of the Heard Museum; Dr. Carl Guthe, a one-time president of the American Museum Association; and Kermit Lee, an Arizona Indian art collector all described her as one of the very best Southwestern Native American potters, but Redbird herself thought that Mary Juan was better than she. She exhibited at fairs, museums, and gatherings such as the All-Indian Fair in Lake George, New York and the 1968 Tohono O'odham Powwow held at Casa Grande. Death and legacy After completing work on some pots, Redbird sat them out to dry and laid down to take a nap on August 10, 1971. The tree under which she was sleeping on the reservation fell on her and killed her. A special display of Redbird's works was held shortly after her death at the Heard Museum. Redbird was inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. In 2015, Redbird's work was shown along with other Arizona Native American potters' work in an exhibition at the Amerind Museum and Art Gallery.

Several kinds of archaeological remnants of the Jerusalem Temple exist. Those for what is customarily called Solomon's Temple are indirect and some are challenged. There is extensive physical evidence for the temple called the Second Temple that was built by returning exiles around 516 BCE and stood until its destruction by Rome in the year 70 CE. First Temple The term First Temple is customarily used to describe the Temple of the Biblical period, which is thought to have been destroyed by the Babylonian conquest. It is described in the Bible as having been built by King Solomon and is understood to have been constructed with its Holy of Holies centered on a stone hilltop now known as the Foundation Stone which had been a traditional focus of worship in Jerusalem. Archaeology Because of the religious and political sensitivities involved, no archaeological excavations and only limited surface surveys of the Temple Mount have been conducted since Charles Warren's expedition of 1867‚Äì70. Kathleen Kenyon claimed that there was no archaeological evidence for the existence of Solomon's Temple, but this view is disputed by Ernest-Marie Laperrousaz.King Solomon‚Äôs Wall Still Supports the Temple Mount, Ernest-Marie Laperrousaz, Biblical Archaeological Review, https://accordance.bible/link/read/BAR_Archive#38872 Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman argue that the first Jewish temple in Jerusalem was not built until the end of the 7th century BCE, around three hundred years after Solomon. They believe the temple should not really be assigned to Solomon, who they see as little more than a small-time hill country chieftain, and argue that it was most likely built by Josiah, who governed Judah from 639 to 609 BCE. However, Alan R. MillardAlan R. Millard, ‚ÄúDoes the Bible Exaggerate King Solomon‚Äôs Golden Wealth?.‚Äù BAR paragraph 47187. https://accordance.bible/link/read/BAR_Archive#47187 argues that this minimalist view is essentially a subjective judgement. Philip Alexander argues against the minimalist viewIn Our Time with Melvyn Bragg, BBC, King Solomon from minute 28 https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b01jhjc7 based on the detail presented in the written record. * An ostracon (excavated prior to 1981), sometimes referred to as the House of Yahweh ostracon, was discovered at Tel Arad, dated to 6th century BCE which mentions a temple which is probably the Temple in Jerusalem. * A thumb-sized ivory pomegranate (which came to light in 1979) measuring in height, and bearing an ancient Hebrew inscription \\"Sacred donation for the priests in the House of ---h,]\\", was believed to have adorned a sceptre used by the high priest in Solomon's Temple. It was considered the most important item of biblical antiquities in the Israel Museum's collection. However, in 2004, the Israel Antiquities Authority reported the inscription to be a forgery, though the ivory pomegranate itself was dated to the 14th or 13th century BCE. This was based on the report's claim that three incised letters in the inscription stopped short of an ancient break, as they would have if carved after the ancient break was made. Since then, it has been proven that one of the letters was indeed carved prior to the ancient break, and the status of the other two letters are in question. Some paleographers and others have continued to insist that the inscription is ancient, some dispute this so the authenticity of this writing is still the object of discussion. * Another artifact, the Jehoash Inscription, which first came to notice in 2003, contains a 15-line description of King Jehoash's ninth-century BCE restoration of the Temple. Its authenticity was called into question by a report by the Israel Antiquities Authority, which said that the surface patina contained microfossils of foraminifera. As these fossils do not dissolve in water, they cannot occur in a calcium carbonate patina, leading initial investigators to conclude that the patina must be an artificial chemical mix applied to the stone by forgers. As of late 2012, the academic community is split on whether the tablet is authentic or not. Commenting on a 2012 report by geologists arguing for the authenticity of the inscription, in October 2012, Hershel Shanks (who believes the inscription is genuine) wrote the current situation was that most Hebrew language scholars believe that the inscription is a forgery and geologists that it is genuine, and thus \\"Because we rely on experts, and because there is an apparently irresolvable conflict of experts in this case, BAR has taken no position with respect to the authenticity of the Jehoash Inscription.\\" * By 2006, the Temple Mount Sifting Project had recovered numerous artifacts dating from the 8th to 7th centuries BCE from soil removed in 1999 by the Islamic Religious Trust (Waqf) from the Solomon's Stables area of the Temple Mount. These include stone weights for weighing silver and a First Temple period bulla, or seal impression, containing ancient Hebrew writing which includes the name Netanyahu ben Yaush. Netanyahu is a name mentioned several times in the Book of Jeremiah while the name Yaush appears in the Lachish letters. However, the combination of names was unknown to scholars. * In 2007, artifacts dating to the 8th to 6th centuries BCE were described as being possibly the first physical evidence of human activity at the Temple Mount during the First Temple period. The findings included animal bones; ceramic bowl rims, bases, and body sherds; the base of a juglet used to pour oil; the handle of a small juglet; and the rim of a storage jar. Surviving evidence of the Second Temple The term \\"Second Temple\\" describes the temple described in the Bible as having been built after the accession of Cyrus the Great to the throne of the Persian Empire in 559 BCE made the re-establishment of the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple possible. The physical evidence for the existence of this Temple is extensive. Consecrated in 516 BCE by the exiles returning from Babylon under Ezra and Nehemiah, it is contained within a far grander edifice. This edifice of the ancient Temple Mount was expanded at least twice more, once under the Hasmonean dynasty and then under Herod the Great, who turned it into one of the largest built structures in the ancient world.The Archaeology of the Holy Land: From the Destruction of Solomon's Temple to the Muslim Conquest, Jodi Magness, Cambridge University Press, 2012, . =Hasmonean expansion= The Hasmonean dynasty expanded the 500 cubit square Temple platform toward the south; distinctive Hasmonean ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall.Leen Ritmeyer, Kathleen Ritmeyer, Jerusalem; The Temple Mount, Carta, Jerusalem, 2015, . =Herodian expansion= The massive Herodian expansion produced the Temple of Jesus' time.

The siege was initially led by Halaf al-HƒÅdim, a renowned engineer, but he was killed and replaced by SawƒÅda Ibn Mu·∏•ammad. The city withstood the siege for some weeks or months, but it ultimately fell to the invaders, and its inhabitants were massacred and the city was sacked. Background The Maltese islands had been part of the Byzantine Empire since 535 AD, and archaeological evidence suggests that they probably had an important strategic role within the empire. When the early Muslim conquests began in the 7th century, the Byzantines were threatened in the Mediterranean, so probably efforts were made to improve the defences of Malta. At this point, they might have built a retrenchment which reduced Melite to one third of its original size. A Muslim reconnaissance raid to Malta might have taken place in 221 AH (835‚Äì36 AD). Of all the islands around Sicily, Malta was the last to remain in Byzantine hands, and in 869 a fleet under Ahmad ibn Umar ibn Ubaydallah ibn al-Aghlab al-Habashi attacked it. The Byzantines, having received timely reinforcements, resisted successfully at first, but in 870 Muhammad sent a fleet from Sicily to the island, and the capital Melite fell on 29 August 870. The local governor was captured, the town was plundered‚ÄîAhmad al-Habashi reportedly took along the local cathedral's marble columns to decorate his palace‚Äîand its fortifications razed. The fall of Malta had important ramifications for the defence of what remained of Byzantine Sicily: with Reggio Calabria and now Malta in their hands, the Muslims completed their encirclement of Sicily, and could easily interdict any aid sent from the east. Ibn Khaldun reports that the conquest of Malta by the Aghlabids happened as early as 868. Ibn al-Khatib dates the conquest of Malta, and the capture of its \\"king\\" between 11 February and 12 March 875, while Al-Nuwayri refers to the same general period, without giving a specific date. Ibn al-Athir recounts that in 869-870, the Emir of Sicily sent an army to Malta, as the island was being besieged by the Byzantines who then fled. This date is also confirmed by a Greek chronicle from Cassano, Calabria, saying that the island of Melite surrendered on 29 August 870. This date is again confirmed in another Arab source, the Kitab al-'Uyun, which says that Malta was conquered by Abdallah I, and gives the date for the conquest to be three days before Ramadan 256 AH, that is, 28 August 870. Historians explain the slight discrepancy due to uncertainties in lunar observations relating to the Islamic calendar. Al-Himyarƒ´'s account Most details about the siege of Melite are known from Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar, which was written by Muhammad bin 'Abd al-Mun'im al-Himyarƒ´ in the 15th century. This account states that the attack on Melite was initially led by an engineer Halaf al- HƒÅdim, who was killed during the siege. The invaders wrote to the Aghlabid ruler Abu ‚ÄòAbd AllƒÅh, who ordered Mu·∏•ammad Ibn HafƒÅƒüa, the governor of Sicily, to send a new leader. The wali SawƒÅda Ibn Mu·∏•ammad was sent, and he continued the siege and captured Melite. Its ruler Amros (possibly Ambrosios) was taken prisoner, and the invaders \\"demolished its fortress, and they looted, and desecrated whatever they could not carry.\\" Marble from Melite's churches was used to build the castle of Sousse (in modern Tunisia) and the bridge leading to it. Al-Himyarƒ´ further states that the island of Malta remained an uninhabited ruin after the siege, at times being visited by shipbuilders, fishermen, and those who collect honey. The island was repopulated by Muslims in 440 AH (1048‚Äì49 AD), who built a settlement known as Medina on the ruins of Melite. The Byzantines besieged the new settlement in 445 AH (1053‚Äì54 AD) but were repelled. Analysis The castle of Sousse, Tunisia, which incorporates marble looted from Melite's churches Al-Himyarƒ´'s account was discovered in 1931, and the first full edition was published in 1975 in Beirut. The passage relating to Malta remained unknown until being translated to English in 1990. It is the most detailed source about the siege, and it contains some information which is not found in any other sources. The account suggests that the siege lasted for a few weeks or possibly some months. The rulers mentioned in the source confirm that the siege took place sometime between 255 and 257 AH (between 868 and 871 AD). Some other sources state that in 870 Malta was already a Muslim settlement, and at the time it was besieged by a Byzantine fleet. After an Aghlabid relief force was sent from Sicily, the fleet retreated without a fight on 28 Ramadan 256 (29 August 870). This resulted in ill-treatment of the island's Greek population, and the bishop was arrested and imprisoned in Palermo, while the island's churches were destroyed. The use of marble from the churches of Melite in the castle of Sousse is confirmed by an inscription on the castle which translates to:https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/46603707.pdf Although al-Himyarƒ´ states that Malta remained an \\"uninhabited ruin\\" after the siege and it was only repopulated in 1048‚Äì49, archaeological evidence suggests that Mdina was already a thriving Muslim settlement by the beginning of the 11th century, so 1048‚Äì49 might be the date when the city was officially founded, possibly the date of construction of the city walls.

He is the world's most record-breaking explorer, and holds the world's highest number of performance-based Guinness World Records ever achieved within a single athletic discipline (41 total / 33 performance based), ranking above Michael Phelps (max 26 / 24, current 23 / 20), and Roger Federer (max 29 / 25, current 30 / 18) as of 2020. Fiann is known for being the fastest ocean rower (2016) and the most record-breaking ocean rower (2017). As of 2020, he is the first and only person to achieve the Ocean Explorers Grand Slam (performing open-water crossings on each of the five oceans using human-powered vessels). For comparison, about 70 people have achieved the land Explorers Grand Slam. Fiann holds many of the highest honors in ocean rowing history, including the world's highest number of performance-based \\"World‚Äôs First\\" Guinness titles (a total of 14, overcoming Reinhold Messner, who holds a total of 9 as of 2020). These titles are known also as \\"Historical Firsts\\", typically awarded by Guinness for achievements such as \\"First to row 5 oceans\\", \\"First to hold current speed records on all 4 oceans\\". Fiann holds several \\"World's First\\" titles for polar explorations, such as being the first to row some of the most extreme major water basins of both polar regions.. He was the captain of the most record-breaking expedition in history, stroke of the fastest boat in ocean rowing history and stroke of the overall speed record-breaking crossings of each ocean. As of 2020, he was the captain of the only three successful human-powered pioneering expeditions into the open-waters of both polar regions. Fiann's achievements were a major contributor to Iceland becoming the country to hold the world's highest number of sports-related Guinness World Records per capita. Since 2017, his records constituted the majority of the total number of Iceland's sports Guinness World Records. Fiann is also active in the fields of art and psychology, and has raised attention as someone uniquely combining different fields of activity.  Sports  = Speed records = Fiann has crossed all five oceans in an unsupported human-powered row boat with world-record-breaking speed, setting the overall speed records for the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific and Arctic Ocean (he achieved the only human-powered crossing of the Antarctic Ocean and as a result no speed record was adjudicated due to lack of competition).  Background  Fiann was introduced to ocean rowing in 2007 while working for Swedish charity Chiparamba Foundation coaching athletes in Africa.  2011  In 2011 Fiann acted as a stroke of Sara G which earned the title of \\"the Fastest Boat in ocean rowing history\\", established an overall speed record for the Atlantic Ocean and won the Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing. Their course, The Atlantic Trade Winds I is the most competitive ocean rowing route, sought by rowing legends, such as James Cracknell OBE, and endurance athletes such as Mark Beaumont BEM. The level of challenge for the crossing was multiplied by a broken center board, which broke less than halfway across the expedition. The story was portrayed in a movie One Ocean, No Limits which was broadcast by Irish National TV.  2014, 2 oceans  In 2014 Fiann became the first person to simultaneously hold overall speed records for the fastest rowing across 2 oceans (Atlantic and Indian). Throughout his career Fiann broke four oars. Three were destroyed in maritime storms and the fourth was shattered during an evacuation mission on the Indian Ocean aboard Avalon, when a tanker, Nordic River arrived to save an injured crew member, yet began to pull the small craft disastrously into its propeller, five times the height of the boat itself. The oar broke in Fiann's hands while pushing the rowers‚Äô boat away from the tanker, saving the crew from collision, as the crew radioed the tanker to cut its engines just in time. In addition to another collision, this time with a blue whale, the critical steering cable broke, which forced the crew to manually steer the boat, thereby reducing the rowing deck to two rowers per shift; half of what it is designed for. Finally, after sustaining injuries passing through a hurricane, the crew narrowed down to only 3 rowers in total (1.5 per shift), who had to power a 2-ton heavy boat designed to be rowed by 8. The incomplete crew had to row 2:40hr on, 1:20hr off shifts instead of the standard 2h:2h pattern in order to maintain their course. This extreme challenge put crew members into a lengthy delirium, lasting many days due to severe exhaustion and sleep deprivation.  2016, 3 oceans  left In 2016 Fiann became the only rower ever to achieve all three overall speed records (Atlantic, Indian, Mid-Pacific) and the only rower to hold all three records simultaneously. Upon this achievement, he was awarded by Guinness World Records the title of \\"The first person to hold simultaneous overall speed records for ocean rowing all three oceans\\", one of the highest honors in the history of ocean rowing. Prevailing winds on Earth Of significance is the fact that Fiann achieved 3 overall speed records in purely human-powered boats, against open-class boats, which are advantaged by partly wind-supported designs on a Trade Winds routes. In a documentary called Corrida of the Pacific made by Globo TV, Fiann reported that his total sleep time during the first week was 5 hours due to strategically attempting to achieve an advantage by racing ahead, as he stated that it was psychologically much easier to win the race from the front. The world record was broken by 4 days. The next boat arrived 6 days later. Out of 12 boats that announced their participation in the race, only 6 managed to complete the challenge.  2017, 4 oceans  Ocean boundaries following the 4 oceans model In 2017 he expanded his title by rowing the Arctic Ocean, becoming the first person to row 4 oceans and earning the Arctic Ocean overall speed record. In order to receive a permit to row to Svalbard, Fiann needed to apply to the Governor of Svalbard, to introduce an evaluation of the chances and the team's ability to accomplish the expedition. Fiann estimated an average speed for the expedition of 2.7 Knots. The Governor's representative declared the claim a bluff, due to the present Arctic Ocean rowing overall speed record being 0.7 Knots and that small sail boats average 4 Knots. Thus, they pressed the highest possible insurance bond, which became the biggest element of the expedition budget. The accuracy of the ETA declared by Fiann deviated by 4h. As per plan, the rowers flawlessly caught the rising tide of the 108 km long Icy Fjord off of Longyearbyen. The Polar Row I was the biggest record demolition in the history of ocean rowing: the existing Arctic Ocean record was broken by 3.5 times, despite the Polar Row I team being buffeted by headwinds 60% of the time. Fiann stated that the headwinds they faced were \\"a validation of our manpower performance\\". Upon this achievement he received Guinness Titles of: \\"First to row 4 Oceans\\" and \\"First to hold current speed records on all 4 oceans\\".  2019, Ocean Explorers Grand Slam  left In 2019 Fiann Paul led the first human-powered transit (by rowing) across the Drake Passage, and the first human-powered expedition on the Southern Ocean. It was accomplished on 25 December 2019 and he became the first and only person (as of 2020) to achieve the Ocean Explorers Grand Slam: performing open-water crossings on each of the five oceans using human-powered vessels. He also acted as stroke on the expedition. = Other information = Fiann achieved the highest success rate in the history of ocean rowing, measuring the number of attempted-speed-records to successful expeditions. He was on stroke position for each row, the role that sets the boat's pace. His total effort performed in ocean rowing was compared to consecutively running approximately 300 marathons. In an interview with Washington Times he mentioned that his resting heart rate during off-shift times throughout the record breaking crossings was 95 BPM, almost twice the normal resting heart rate. His record-breaking performance was listed by Grapevine Magazine as one of 7 most notable \\"Smitings\\" delivered in the history of Icelandic sports. In this act he was suspected of comradery with √Ügir. Presently, he is one of the world's most accomplished rowers. Despite reaching the top of various ocean rowing statistics, Fiann declared that he perceives the accomplishments of certain past ocean rowers as more admirable than his own, due to their performance taking place in conditions described by the Ocean Rowing Society as \\"not very different from the times of Columbus\\". Thus, their level of challenge was incomparably higher.  Pioneering and explorations  = Arctic Ocean Open Waters = Contrary to human-powered explorations on open waters, coastal explorations of the Arctic Ocean have been pursued for centuries by indigenous people. In 2017, Fiann acted as Captain, Stroke and Head of the project Polar Row, the most record-breaking ocean row and most record-breaking expedition in history (over a dozen Guinness World Records). It was the first recorded human-powered expedition and the first recorded row across the Arctic Ocean Open Waters, within the minimum Guinness World Record criteria: \\"across major water basins above the Polar Circle from land to land ... not around islands, within archipelagos or coastal rows, i.e. not within the vicinity of land nor the possibility to get ashore.\\" Polar Row confronted inconsistent wind patterns, diametrically different from the most frequently attempted rows, typical to lower latitude Trade Winds routes. The crew used no sails, no engine, nor support other than human-power. The magnitude of the challenge was amplified by the unavoidable slalom between icebergs and drift ice. Encountering ice is not unique to coastal rows on the Arctic Ocean, but was multiple times more difficult for the first historical row on the open waters of the Arctic Ocean, where relatively high swells threaten the highly un-maneuverable row boat among the drift ice. Prior to Polar Row, non-open waters Arctic Ocean rows and coastal Arctic Ocean rows experienced more static seas and the ability to access land at any moment. According to existing historical records, Polar Row achieved the first complete human-powered crossing of the Barents Sea and the Greenland Sea. However, it is unknown if any such crossing had ever been performed by indigenous people in the past.  \\"Devil's Jaw\\"  Polar Row consisted of two teams: Polar Row I and Polar Row II. In total, the teams covered approximately 1400 Nautical Miles (1611 Miles or 2593 km), 1250 Nautical Miles measured in a straight line (1440 Miles or 2316 km) across the Arctic Ocean. Polar Row pioneered new ocean rowing routes from Troms√∏ to Longyearbyen, from Longyearbyen to Arctic ice pack (79¬∞55'50 N) and from ice pack to Jan Mayen. It was the first complete, recorded human-powered crossing of the Barents Sea and of the Greenland Sea, some of the world's northernmost waters, which had long been called by sailors of the past, the \\"Devil's dance floor\\". Upon completion of Polar Row I and arrival to Longyearbyen, Fiann was asked by Norwegian TV2 how a rower would name the Barents Sea. Fiann responded that he would call it \\"Devil's Jaw\\", adding that the winds you constantly battle are like the breath from the devil's nostrils while he holds you in his jaws. = Antarctic Ocean Open Waters =  \\"The Impossible Row\\"  in 2019 Fiann led the 530 nautical miles first human-powered traverse of the Drake Passage and first row on the Southern Ocean, waters dubbed as \\"the most dreaded bit of ocean on the globe‚Äù by Ernest Shackleton's biographer Alfred Lansing.  History  The Antarctic Row was conceived in April 2017. Upon completion of Polar Row II in August 2017, in an interview with The New York Times, Fiann vowed he would row an even more difficult route. Next he needed to irreversibly prepay substantial sums of money 18-months in advance of the expedition in order to secure the assisting vessel, which is a requirement of the Antarctic Treaty and IAATO in order to receive a departure permit. Maritime law requires that small human-powered boats and primitive sailboats be accompanied by an assisting vessel during open-water journeys within the actual boundaries of the Southern Ocean. Fiann mentioned that it was all the money he had at the time. In September 2017 Fiann recruited the first team members, Andrew Towne and Jamie Douglas-Hamilton. The row was initially scheduled for December 2018 but was postponed due to lack of availability of the assisting vessel. In January 2019 he recruited Cameron Bellamy and John Petersen, completing the two-year-long team recruitment process in April 2019 when the final member, Colin O‚ÄôBrady without prior rowing, ocean rowing or seafaring experience joined the team to serve as Fiann‚Äôs first mate and aid the project financially. Colin's participation in the expedition was filmed by Discovery Channel as a series, \\"The Impossible Row\\" produced in part by Colin O‚ÄôBrady himself, whose story the cameras follow.dry suits offered more flexibility to row, instead of traditional safety suits that tend to chafe and immobilize. The suits were tailor-made for each team member, following 25 different measurements.|alt=|left Yamana people who had resided in the Cape Horn area for 10,000 years have been ‚Äúrounding the horn‚Äù solo, fully human- propelled as teenagers as young as 12.y.o. in their primitive self-made paddle boats, as part of their traditional canoe-faring hunter-gatherers lifestyle. By the middle of the 20th century Chilean government restricted their small boat journeys due to being \\"too dangerous\\". Just before the team left South America, a Chilean Air Force C-130 crashed in the Drake Passage. The search area covered their planned route. As the captain, Fiann had to make a decision of how to avoid the 150x150 miles no-go zone announced by Chilean Navy. His capacity to deal with the route had to withstand a one-day-long scrutiny at Cape Horn, conducted by the navy officials. Logic dictated routing west of the search area, just as suggested the advisers, because the wind and swell tend to move east while the current moves east, which would likely have pushed the search zone east too. Moreover, for the same reason, sailors crossing the Drake Passage typically choose to compensate west. However, Fiann, trusting his intuition, went against logic and went east anyway. It proved the correct call as the military had shifted their hunt to the opposite direction. Crew member Jamie Douglas-Hamilton said this call was crucial to their success. Abercrombie & Kent‚Äôs Luxury Expedition Cruise detoured from its route to cheer Fiann in his efforts, the same cruise line which in Summer 2020, Fiann is signed as special guest lecturer, among lecturers such as Lech Walesa. The row took 12 days, 1 hour and 45 minutes, breaking several Guinness World Records. The team experienced sub-zero temperatures, snow and hail, and slalomed gigantic ice bergs unique to Antarctica. Sea anchor was deployed 5 times due to difficult seas. Apart for the sea anchor days, significant mileage was made good against the wind, which differentiates human-power routes from the Trade Winds routes. Guinness World Records Editor-in-Chief, Craig Glenday congratulated captain Fiann Paul in person and commented: > \\"This row represents one of the most significant human-powered adventures > ever undertaken.\\" Upon arrival to Antarctica, Fiann recited The Great Sea Song poem by Canadian Inuit poet Uvavnuk, cousin of Aua. On Christmas day, Icelandic national newspaper published an article about Fiann‚Äôs accomplishment, dubbed: \\"Feasted with √Ügir on Christmas.\\" Fiann Paul received congratulations in person from the president of Iceland, Gu√∞ni Th. J√≥hannesson. As of 2020, Fiann is the captain of the only three successful human-powered pioneering expeditions into the open-waters of both polar regions. Despite rowing many of the world‚Äôs most difficult seas, Fiann never capsized the boat under his command. The expedition coincided with 2 major anniversaries, the first sighting of the Antarctic continent by Bellingshausen, taking place exactly 200 winters ago and the voyage of Magellan 500 years ago. Fiann commented that prior to this expedition Antarctica was a Terra Australis Incognita to human-power endeavors just like it was to cartographers prior to Bellingshausen. = Approach = When asked what makes one a successful ultra-endurance athlete, Fiann often outlined that love for the adventure is not enough, and that being tough is a must, but it is just the foundation. The critical advantage in his opinion is rarely achieved by men today: good understanding of and communication with one's body, a quality often inaccessible to individuals attached to the cliche version of masculinity. On explorations: > ‚ÄúThe last great physical explorations left on the surface of this planet are > the boundaries of human-power performance. Every mountain has been summited > by a helicopter, but the person who climbs it first is still a pioneer. > Every land has been reached by a motor or wind-powered vessel. But many of > the major water basins have never been crossed by human power‚Äù = Viking mark = Fiann was the first modern day ocean rower to introduce a system of shifts depending on the mileage mark reached by rowers, instead of the more typically used time mark. This system allows rowers to choose how fast they complete their shift and allows the resting rowers to rest longer if the active shifts are completed with a slower pace. Recently, such a system is credited to be linked to the etymology of the word ‚ÄòViking‚Äô. = Other information = Fiann is one of two Icelandic members of the American-based international multidisciplinary professional society: The Explorers Club. He carried The Explorers Club Flag to Svalbard, to the Arctic ice pack and to Jan Mayen during the Polar Row, and from Cape Horn across the Drake Passage to the Antarctic Peninsula during The Impossible Row. It is the same type of flag that decorated the raft of Thor Heyerdahl during the Kon Tiki expedition.  Art  \\"Dialog\\", large-scale, outdoor art installation in 2008 \\"See It\\", large-scale, outdoor art installation in 2011 As an artist, Fiann is the author of numerous national-level Icelandic and international exhibitions including several large-scale, outdoor art installations. His work mainly focuses on themes of indigenous people, children, breastfeeding and animal rights. He was one of two authors of \\"Dialog\\", an outdoor art installation that spanned two main streets in the heart of the capital city with photographs of Icelandic children, 2008. He was also the author of the visual art project, \\"See It!\\" promoting the awareness of breastfeeding, an outdoor art installation in downtown Reykjav√≠k at the facade of street Tryggvagata in 2011. As an artist, Fiann was also involved in supporting the welfare of an endangered local breed of horses unique to the Faroe Islands. As a photographer he also documented many of his expeditions. Since 2009 his Arctic photographs have been on permanent display at the International Terminal of Kulusuk Airport, the main airport of East Greenland. Some of his photographs of breastfeeding are displayed in √çsafj√∂r√∞ur Hospital. Together with photographs of RAX, Fiann's Arctic photographs were selected to represent Greenlandic Art at the Arctic Winter Games in Canada, 2012. In 2011 Fiann swam with seals in a freezing pond next to an outdoor display of his photographs at the Family Garden in Reykjavik. His name was officially added to the seals' family list and mentioned along with the other seals on the portal of Reykjavik City.  Intersection of activities  On certain occasions, Fiann raised attention not as an athlete or an artist, but as someone uniquely combining different fields of activity. He was featured in a German TV documentary \\"On 3 Sofas\\" as a rare example of a person who achieves notable results in rarely combined disciplines, in this case, sports and art. Once in an interview with Icelandic National TV, Fiann was asked whether ocean rowing was in any way similar to art. Fiann responded affirmatively, adding that \\"They both connect to Depth\\". In this way, Fiann was also referring to his current postgraduate studies of Depth Psychology. In an international television program, Trans World Sports, he was portrayed as someone active in the fields of art, sports and psychology. He discussed the concept of ‚ÄòArete‚Äô, an ancient Greek training of young men into manhood, which included physical, intellectual and artistic training. Arete emphasized that development in each of these aspects must be present in order to achieve manhood. = Public Speaking = endurance hunting presented by Fiann Paul during TEDx talk. Since 2017, Fiann has been conducting lectures on the Dark Side of the Hero's Journey, detailing the psychological aspects of ultra endurance sports and the psyche of explorers. In 2019 Fiann spoke at TEDxBend, where he elaborated on the potential generated by psychological wounds and the possibility of deriving constructive outcomes based on the personality traits related to these wounds. Since December 2019 the talk has been featured by main TED.  Charity and other activities  Fiann's very first creative project to receive public recognition was a charity event that he organized, in which Fiann collected funds and supervised the construction of a new facility building for G√∂tusmi√∞jan, the center for youth at risk, in Iceland in 2007. In 2011 Fiann and Natalie Caroline founded Fiann Paul Foundation, which built a primary school in the Himalayas in 2013. The school educates 150 pupils per year.Himshikhar, Nepalese National TV, Multiple appearances between 15 and 22 December 2013 The project demonstrates two of his main academic interests, architecture and pedagogy. Fiann holds a master's degrees in each discipline. In addition to his formal education, Fiann spent 2 years in the Himalayas and 1 1/2 years in remote parts of Greenland. He considers this time as one of the most transformational periods in his life. Presently, Fiann is pursuing postgraduate level studies in Depth Psychology. He is undergoing training to become a Jungian Analyst at the C.G. Jung institute in Z√ºrich. His main focus is the psychology of ultra endurance performance, and the psychological dynamics within the psyche of explorers and endurance athletes. He has conducted multiple lectures, and workshops in different parts of the world. In 2019 Fiann was appointed a coordinator for Ocean Rowing Society International, the governing body for international ocean rowing. In 2020 he was awarded an Honorary Master Mariner from the Association of Master Mariners at Maritime University in Gdynia, Poland. Master Mariner is the highest seafarer qualification. In Poland, one needs to study for approximately 8 years to achieve this qualification.  Personal life  Fiann chooses to consume no alcohol. He mentioned music to be his only addiction. The only meat present in his diet is of fish origin, as he states that fish are the only animals he could handle killing by himself. He is also known for eating raw eggs, instead of protein shakes after training. His favorite places in Reykjavik are Nauth√≥lsv√≠k, and √Årb√¶jarlaug where his personalized outdoor workout is a major part of his daily training routine.

This usually requires what is commonly known as a \\"dating method\\". Several dating methods exist, depending on different criteria and techniques, and some very well known examples of disciplines using such techniques are, for example, history, archaeology, geology, paleontology, astronomy and even forensic science, since in the latter it is sometimes necessary to investigate the moment in the past during which the death of a cadaver occurred. These methods are typically identified as absolute, which involves a specified date or date range, or relative, which refers to dating which places artifacts or events on a timeline relative to other events and/or artifacts. Other markers can help place an artifact or event in a chronology, such as nearby writings and stratigraphic markers.  Absolute and relative dating  Dating methods are most commonly classified following two criteria: relative dating and absolute dating. = Relative dating = Relative dating methods are unable to determine the absolute age of an object or event, but can determine the impossibility of a particular event happening before or after another event of which the absolute date is well known. In this relative dating method, Latin terms ante quem and post quem are usually used to indicate both the most recent and the oldest possible moments when an event occurred or an artifact was left in a stratum, respectively. But this method is also useful in many other disciplines. Historians, for example, know that Shakespeare's play Henry V was not written before 1587 because Shakespeare's primary source for writing his play was the second edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles, not published until 1587. Thus, 1587 is the post quem dating of Shakespeare's play Henry V. That means that the play was without fail written after (in Latin, post) 1587. The same inductive mechanism is applied in archaeology, geology and paleontology, by many ways. For example, in a stratum presenting difficulties or ambiguities to absolute dating, paleopalynology can be used as a relative referent by means of the study of the pollens found in the stratum. This is admitted because of the simple reason that some botanical species, whether extinct or not, are well known as belonging to a determined position in the scale of time. For a non- exhaustive list of relative dating methods and relative dating applications used in geology, paleontology or archaeology, see the following: * Cross- cutting relationships * Harris matrix * Law of included fragments * Law of superposition * Principle of original horizontality * Principle of lateral continuity * Principle of faunal succession * Melt inclusions * Nitrogen dating * Fluorine absorption dating * Seriation (archaeology) * Sequence dating (a type of seriation) * Palynology (the study of modern-dated pollens for the relative dating of archaeological strata, also used in forensic palynology) * Paleopalynology (also spelt \\"Palaeopalynology\\", the study of fossilized pollens for the relative dating of geological strata) * Morphology (archaeology) * Typology (archaeology) * Varnish microlamination * Vole clock * Lead corrosion datingChemistry Professor Shimon Reich, a specialist in superconductivity, has demonstrated a method for dating artifacts based on the magnetic properties of lead, a material widely used in Israel and elsewhere in antiquity. Reich and coworkers found that at cryogenic temperatures, lead becomes a superconductor, but the corrosion products formed from centuries of exposure to air and water (lead oxide and lead carbonate) do not superconduct. On the basis of magnetic measurements and comparison with artifacts that were known (using other techniques) to be up to 2500 years old, the group showed that the mass of lead corrosion products is directly proportional to an object's age (New Journal of Physics, 2003, 5, 99) (exclusively used in archaeology) * Paleomagnetism * Tephrochronology * Marine isotope stages based on the oxygen isotope ratio cycle = Absolute dating = Thermoluminescence was used to provide an absolute date for its construction. Absolute dating methods seek to establish a specific time during which an object originated or an event took place. While the results of these techniques are largely accepted within the scientific community, there are several factors which can hinder the discovery of accurate absolute dating, including sampling errors and geological disruptions. This type of chronological dating utilizes absolute referent criteria, mainly the radiometric dating methods. Material remains can be absolutely dated by studying the organic materials which construct the remains. For example, remains that have pieces of brick can undergo the process of thermoluminescence (TL) dating in order to determine approximately how many years ago the material was fired. This technique was used to discover the date of St. James Church in Toru≈Ñ by testing the thermoluminescence of removed bricks. In this example, an absolute date was determined which filled a gap in the historical knowledge of the church. These techniques are utilized in many other fields as well. Geologists, for example, apply absolute dating methods to rock sediment in order to discover their period of origin. Some examples of both radiometric and non-radiometric absolute dating methods are the following: * Amino acid dating * Archaeomagnetic dating * Argon‚Äìargon dating * Uranium‚Äìlead dating * Samarium‚Äìneodymium dating * Potassium‚Äìargon dating * Rubidium‚Äìstrontium dating * Uranium‚Äìthorium dating * Radiocarbon dating * Fission track dating * Electron spin resonance dating * Luminescence dating ** Thermoluminescence dating ** Optically stimulated luminescence * Iodine‚Äìxenon dating * Lead‚Äìlead dating * Oxidizable carbon ratio dating * Rehydroxylation dating * Cementochronology (this method does not determine a precise moment in a scale of time but the age at death of a dead individual) * Wiggle matching * Datestone (exclusively used in archaeology) * Obsidian hydration dating (exclusively used in archaeology) * Tephrochronology * Molecular clock (used mostly in phylogenetics and evolutionary biology) * Dendrochronology * Herbchronology  Dating methods in archaeology  Same as geologists or paleontologists, archaeologists are also brought to determine the age of ancient both ancient and recent humans. Thus, to be considered as archaeological, the remains, objects or artifacts to be dated must be related to human activity. It is commonly assumed that if the remains or elements to be dated are older than the human species, the disciplines which study them are sciences such geology or paleontology, among some others. Nevertheless, the range of time within archaeological dating can be enormous compared to the average lifespan of a singular human being. As an example Pinnacle Point's caves, in the southern coast of South Africa, provided evidence that marine resources (shellfish) have been regularly exploited by humans as of 170,000 years ago. On the other hand, remains as recent as a hundred years old can also be the target of archaeological dating methods. It was the case of an 18th-century sloop whose excavation was led in South Carolina (United States) in 1992.\\"Clydesdale Plantation 18th-Century Sloop Excavation\\", Institute of Nautical Archaeology, Texas, USA Thus, from the oldest to the youngest, all archaeological sites are likely to be dated by an appropriate method. Dating material drawn from the archaeological record can be made by a direct study of an artifact, or may be deduced by association with materials found in the context the item is drawn from or inferred by its point of discovery in the sequence relative to datable contexts. Dating is carried out mainly post excavation, but to support good practice, some preliminary dating work called \\"spot dating\\" is usually run in tandem with excavation. Dating is very important in archaeology for constructing models of the past, as it relies on the integrity of dateable objects and samples. Many disciplines of archaeological science are concerned with dating evidence, but in practice several different dating techniques must be applied in some circumstances, thus dating evidence for much of an archaeological sequence recorded during excavation requires matching information from known absolute or some associated steps, with a careful study of stratigraphic relationships. In addition, because of its particular relation with past human presence or past human activity, archaeology uses almost all the dating methods that it shares with the other sciences, but with some particular variations, like the following: =Written markers= * Epigraphy ‚Äì analysis of inscriptions, via identifying graphemes, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers. * Numismatics ‚Äì many coins have the date of their production written on them or their use is specified in the historical record. * Palaeography ‚Äì the study of ancient writing, including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts. = Seriation = Seriation is a relative dating method (see, above, the list of relative dating methods). An example of a practical application of seriation, is the comparison of the known style of artifacts such as stone tools or pottery. =Age-equivalent stratigraphic markers= * Paleomagnetism (a relative dating method, see the corresponding list above) * Marine isotope stages based on the oxygen isotope ratio cycle (a relative dating method, see the corresponding list above) * Tephrochronology (an absolute dating method, see the corresponding list above) = Stratigraphic relationships = The stratigraphy of an archaeological site can be used to date, or refine the date, of particular activities (\\"contexts\\") on that site. For example, if a context is sealed between two other contexts of known date, it can be inferred that the middle context must date to between those dates.
