She broke up and sank in 1982 in the Bulgarian waters of the Black Sea, south-south east of the Cape Kaliakra at a depth of after a mysterious explosion. The crew totalled 43 members of which 42 were rescued by Romanian and Soviet boats. The sinking of Unirea was classified by Lloyd's List as the largest ship accident of 1982. Investigations The exact cause of accident is unknown but official reports suggest that during a vapor evacuation of the central number 3 tank an explosive mixture formed alongside the evacuation hole that could have been ignited by multiple sources but especially electrostatic energy. The explosion of the central number 3 tank had a devastating effect on the integrity of the ship triggering a series of explosions that destroyed the separating wall of the central and starboard tanks favoring the expansion of the volatile elements across the ship. The fire that followed also contributed to the vertical breaking of the ship's shell and the eventual sinking. Other official reports claim that the accident was caused by a collision with a World War II mine. A different opinion (unofficial) came from some naval architects and marine engineers stating that the ship broke up because of incorrect ballasting (the ship had no cargo at the time of the accident). The Romanian shipping company \\"Navrom\\" claimed the insurance payout, amounting to US$36.6 million. This action resulted in a thorough inspection of the ship's wreck by independent survey teams, employed by the insurance company from Lloyd's Register, Japan. As the inspection did not reveal any major faults in construction, the insurance was finally paid. Rescue operations The rescue operation was coordinated from the Bulgarian shore and involved eight Romanian ships, Motru , Tg. Bujor , Mărăşeşti , Căciulata , Gostinul , Grădiştea , Topliţa and the Voinicul tugboat, five Bulgarian ships, Perun, Rusalka, Icar, Europa, and Kiten, two Soviet ships, Ianghi Iuli and Gordelivi, and rescue helicopters from Romania and Bulgaria. The Romanian ships Motru and Tg. Bujor each rescued 18 crew members, the Soviet ship Ianhghi Iuli rescued 5 and the last crew member, Gabriel Georgescu, was rescued by a Bulgarian helicopter after staying eight hours in the cold waters of the Black Sea. The only casualty was the ship's waitress Ganţă Elena. Sister ships M/T Unirea was the second of a series of five Romanian supertankers that were constructed by the Constanța Shipyard in the 1980s. The sister ships were as follows: M/T Independenţa (Independence) - collided in 1979 with a freighter at the southern entrance of Bosphorus, Turkey and exploded. She caught fire and grounded. Almost all of the tanker's crew members died. The wreck of the Independenţa burned for weeks causing heavy air and sea pollution in the Istanbul area and the Sea of Marmara. M/T Biruinţa (Triumph) - Owned and managed by the then Romanian state-owned shipping company, Navrom. In the 1990s the ship was passed to the Romanian private shipping company Petromin, changing its name to M/T Iris Star. Iris Star lost power because of engine failure during a passage through the Bosphorus on 27 July 2000, and drifted towards Kandilli point. There was no extensive damage reported. Finally the ship was bought by the Romanian shipping company Histria Shipmanagement having its name changed again to M/T Histria Crown. The ship was finally decommissioned in 2006 after more than 20 years of service. M/T Libertatea (Liberty) - had the same history (including ownership) as her older sister M/T Biruinţa with the only exception that the ship is still in operation under the name M/T Histria Prestige. M/T Pacea (Peace) - was never fully completed. At the end of the 1980s it was passed to Czechoslovakia as a part of Romania's foreign debt.

Development By the late 1970s, Fokker had two ageing aircraft models in production and were looking for a new move in the market. Fokker recognized the huge size of the replacement market as thousands of Boeing 727s and 737s, Douglas DC-9s and BAC 1-11s would shortly be twenty years old. Fokker proposed the F.29 airliner in 1979, a 138-seat aircraft. By that time, Fokker had already spent 150 million guilders in development costs. Its first flight was planned for late 1983, entry into service was planned for early 1985. The aircraft was initially priced at $17 million. A stretched version with a 160 to 180 seat capacity was projected for the second half of the 1980s. Competition was formidable. Boeing launched the 737-300 and McDonnell-Douglas had already marketed a stretched and updated version of the DC-9, the DC-9 Super 80. Airbus was also considering their SA1, which would eventually become the A320. Design The overall layout of the aircraft took the stretched fuselage of the F.28, with an all-new supercritical wing and two wing-mounted turbofan engines. The tailsection was also a derivative of the F.28, with its high mounted elevators and characteristic airbrakes. Cabin layout however, was to be six abreast. Fokker openly admitted that the fuselage cross section was a copy of Boeing's fuselage from the 707/727/737. Two types of engines were considered, the CFM International CFM56 and the proposed Rolls-Royce/JAEC RJ500. Collaboration Fokker positively searched for industrial partners, as this project was simply too big for them to handle on their own. Negotiations were held with Airbus, Boeing and the Japanese aircraft industry. The search failed as it quickly became apparent that Airbus had its own plans with the SA1 and Boeing was using all its resources on design and preproduction of the Boeing 757 and 767. Moreover, Boeing was revamping the 737 into the -300 series. The Japanese industry was more inclined towards cooperation with larger partners, like Airbus or Boeing. Demise Fokker found it difficult to attract industrial partners or to interest airlines into ordering the F.29. It eventually found a partner in McDonnell-Douglas. The American company already had plans to design a new model, the 180-seat DC-XX. Together the two parties came up with the MDF.100, a mix of the F.29 and the DC-XX.

The blue and white livery for the 2017 season commemorates the 100th year of Finland's independence from Russia. Midnight Hawks is a Finnish aerobatics team. The team is organised by the Finnish Air Force. The aircraft used is the BAe Hawk advanced jet trainer History The history of the Midnight Hawks began before World War II, when the Finnish Air Force Academy used Gloster Gamecocks and other aircraft for display flying. The tradition of formation flying continued after the war and it became a trademark of the Finnish Air Force Training Air Wing's annual Midnight Sun Airshow. Midsummer Eve is normally the third Friday in June. Originally the show was just the Training Air Wing's Midsummer party for the families, relatives and the people of the Kauhava village where the academy was located. Over the years this event has grown to become the Midnight Sun Airshow and Festival with many foreign participants and over 20,000 spectators. Because of the midnight sun the airshow starts at around 7 p.m. and lasts until midnight when the last display is flown. Finnish Air Force Training Air Wing's flight instructors have always performed formation flying in the Midnight Sun Airshow. The formation flying had been part of the normal training syllabus and no special team names or aircraft had been used. There had been several nicknames for the teams, often based on the name of the team leader, but no official team name had been used until 1997. The flight instructors had simply showed their skills and aircraft to the spectators. The aircraft flown have been Training Air Wing's standard trainer aircraft. Between 1960 ando 1980 Saab Safir and Fouga Magister were used, and from the beginning of the 1980s Valmet Vinka and BAe Hawk Mk 51. So for the last forty or so years the Finnish Air Force Training Air Wing has had two formation display teams; one flying with the basic prop trainer, and the second with the jet fighter trainer. Both teams had performed almost solely at the Midnight Sun Airshow once in a summer. During the 1990s the Finnish Air Force Training Air Wing's jet display team started to expand their appearances, performing in airshows other than just the 'Midnight Sun'. The sight of four BAe Hawks in a tight formation became familiar to thousands of airshow spectators around the country. The jet display team started to operate more and more like an official display team, even though it was still without name or official status. In 1997 this changed. In the biggest ever airshow in Finland, Oulu International Airshow, the Finnish Air Force Training Air Wing's jet display team appeared as the Midnight Hawks. Immediately the name spread around the country and the wider world - the Finnish Air Force Display Team Midnight Hawks had been born. All the members of the team are flight instructors in the Finnish Air Force Academy, and in active service. They usually hold the rank of Captain or Major. Aircraft The Midnight Hawks perform classic formation flying. During the show the team displays in front of the crowd line all the time. The team's trademark is a very tight diamond formation. The most important display for the team is still the Midnight Sun Airshow at Kauhava Airport, the home of Finnish Air Force Training Air Wing and the Midnight Hawks. The Midnight Hawks and their predecessors have always had their display slot close to midnight, and therefore the team can say that it has flown more night jet formation displays than any other team or group in the world. They also are the only display team in the world which has trained for formation flying at night. Finnish weather conditions can be very challenging and so the team devotes a lot of practice and preparation to the low level displays that they are often required to perform. The Midnight Hawks use standard Finnish Air Force BAe Systems Hawk MK 51 and MK 51A aircraft from Fighter Squadron 41. They are not dedicated display team aircraft, but selected within the squadron pool of the operational aircraft. During the week the team's aircraft fly advance combat training missions according to training syllabi. The aircraft are painted in the standard Finnish air force camouflage.

History The castle of Incisa is mentioned for the first time in 984. The marquisate originated from Alberto del Vasto, a descendant of the Aleramici who had been exiled to southern Italy; here he helped Roger II of Sicily against the rebel baron, and was made count of Gravina. His son Alberto in 1161 obtained several lands near Incisa. He died in 1181 during a battle, in which his son was also severely wounded; Alberto's wife, Domicella, acted as regent. In 1189 she imprisoned two ambassadors of the Republic of Genoa, a feat which caused emperor Henry VI to transfer her fiefs to Boniface I of Montferrat; she was however able to keep her lands by allying with the commune of Asti. In 1203 her junior sons Manfredo and Pagano obtained Montaldo and Rocchetta, starting the branch of Incisa di Rocchetta. During the Angevine wars in Piedmont of the 14th century, the marquisate of Incisa found itself in a dangerous situation, being forced to recognize the authority of Montferrat. In the following century their policy wavered from the alliance with Montferrat or with the Visconti of Milan. In 1428 marquis Petrino fought with Milan against Amadeus VIII of Savoy. In 1497 Oddone d'Incisa was able to regain the control of the whole marquisate, which had been previously split between several branches of the family. In 1513 he allied with Charles II of Savoy to obtain the investiture as marquis of Montferrat; however, he was discovered, and Incisa was besieged and easily captured in 1514 by William IX of Montferrat. Oddone and his son Badone were executed at Nizza della Paglia. After a dispute with the emperor, Incisa was annexed to Montferrat in 1518. The marquisate was returned to the Incisa in 1536, with Giangiacomo. He died in 1545, being succeeded by his cousin Boarello II. The latter renounced to Incisa in 1548 in exchange for the territories of Camerana and Gottasecca in favour of the Gonzaga family of Milan, who were also namely marquisses of Montferrat at the time.

She founded the Franciscan order of Sisters of St. Joseph's Society for Foreign Missions.  Biography  She was born 8 March 1830 in Rochdale to George and Margaret Ingham. Her mother died in 1842; her father remarried. After an elementary education, Alice went to work in a cotton mill, after which she was apprenticed to her father, a draper based in Yorkshire Street, where she worked with her step-mother. By 1861 as he had become invalid, and she was running the family business, which was then called \\"Ingham's Caps and Confectionery\\". She was known locally for her charitable work. In 1861 she joined the third order Franciscans. Her father died in 1865 and, after receiving advice and encouragement from a Franciscan priest and a Passionist nun, she started a small religious and charitable organisation of women in 1871. As the community grew, she opened a second shop on nearby John Street. In 1878, Herbert Vaughan, then Bishop of Salford, suggested that Ingham's group take on domestic duties at St Joseph's Foreign Missionary College, in Mill Hill, London. Although some of the women preferred to continue with their local welfare work, the shops were sold and the group moved to London. The move would eventually provide the opportunity for the sisters themselves to become missionaries.Clark, Emily. Women and Religion in the Atlantic Age, 1550-1900, Routledge, 2016, p. 159 Franciscan Missionaries of St. Joseph In 1883 Ingham and eleven of her congregation took temporary vows, and her congregation became established as the \\"Sisters of St. Joseph’s Society, Associates of Mill Hill\\". In 1884 she took her full vows. She was given the name \\"Mary Francis\\". The sisters also took charge of the domestic economy first at St. Peter′s school in Kelvedon, and then at Freshfield. In Salford, they managed the first home for waifs, and opened others in Manchester and Blackburn. They came to be known as \\"the Rescue Sisters\\". In 1885 five of the sisters went as missionaries to Borneo. Ninety-three years later they left flourishing local Congregations of Sisters to serve the Church. In 1886 the sisters moved back to Lancashire, first running the Children′s Rescue and Protection Society at Ardwick Hall and moving to Blackburn in 1888. Ingham was bedridden in the last years of her life and died in August 24, 1890 at Blackburn at the age of 60. She was buried at Mill Hill.\\"Death of the Foundress of St. Joseph's Foreign Missionary Sisters\\", The Tablet, September 6, 1890 Today the Sisters of St. Joseph run homes at Patricraft, Mill Hill, Blackburn, Freshfield, Waterford, Cork, Rozendaal and various stations in Borneo. The first community was sent to Holland in 1891 and in 1906 the Sisters began work in Ireland. In 1925 their name was changed to Franciscan Missionaries of St. Joseph. In 1929 the sisters were made a Pontifical Congregation separate from the Mill Hill Society, but continue to work closely with the Mill Hill Fathers. In more recent times, the congregation's work in managing colleges has been superseded by care for the elderly.\\"Early beginnings\\", Franciscan Missionaries of St. Joseph The Generalate is located at St. Joseph’s Convent, Manchester, As of 2019, there are sisters working in seven countries.

She is perhaps best remembered for her book The Diary of Juliet Thompson though she also painted a life-sized portrait of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. From the Library of Congress Photo Collection, Juliet Thompson with her portrait of First Lady Grace Coolidge Early life and education Thompson was born in or near Washington, D.C., on 23 September 1873. Her parents, James W. Thompson and Celeste, sent her to the Corcoran School of Art (before it was renamed as a college). Her father died when she was 12 and left little money for the family, but Thompson was already able to sell paintings. Thompson was an active member of the community of artists in Washington D.C. and painted a centerpiece of the 1897 Cosmos Club annual show.  Baháʼí Faith  After learning of the Baháʼí Faith in Washington DC near 1898 she traveled to Paris at the invitation of Laura Dreyfus-Barney's mother. Later in 1901 in Paris she met Thomas Breakwell, (see Baháʼí Faith in the United Kingdom), who gave her Arthur de Gobineau's description in French of the Execution of the Báb which confirmed her faith. Paris is where Charles Mason Remey first met Thompson when she was taking classes on the religion from Mírzá Abu'l-Faḍl. Among many talks ʻAbdu'l-Bahá gave in the United States he gave one at her residence on 15 November 1912 at 48 West Tenth Street, New York. At this meeting he described distinctive qualities of the religion. During World War I she offered talks on a Baháʼí topic of the Most Great Peace. In the 1940s Thompson made several extended trips to Mexico to promulgate the religion. (See Baháʼí Faith in Mexico.) Contact with artists Thompson recalled Khalil Gibran, a neighbor and acquaintance of hers, and reports several anecdotes relating to Gibran: She recalls Gibran met ʻAbdu'l-Bahá a couple times circa 1911-1912. In 1918 Mark Tobey came in contact with Thompson and posed for her. During the session Tobey read some Baháʼí literature and accepted an invitation to Green Acre where he converted. O.Z. Whitehead attended an informational meeting of the religion in Thompson's home in 1950.  Portrait of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá  ʻAbdu'l-Baha by Juliet Thompson, painted in three sitting in June 1912 And during ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's first trip to the west in the fall of 1911 she met him at Thonon-les-Bains, France. During the second trip he reached New York - over several days he sat for a life-sized portrait starting June 1. Of the portrait, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá said \\"I want you to paint my servitude to God.\\" On another day of sitting for the portrait, June 19, Thompson witnessed Lua Getsinger given a mission of conveying ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's status in the religion as the Center of the Covenant (see Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá) and that New York was the City of the Covenant (see perhaps 1992: Second Baháʼí World Congress.) The original of this life sized portrait has been lost, but there are original photographs of the portrait. A reproduction was on display at the Second World Congress, and one is housed in the Seat of the Universal House of Justice just outside its meeting room for the members. Pilgrimages Over her life she made two Baháʼí pilgrimages. Her first was in July, 1909 when she began her diary which was eventually published. Her work is a main source on ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West when he was in Europe in 1911 as well as some of his travels in the United States in 1912. Thompson's second pilgrimage was in 1926. Death Thompson died on December 4, 1956 (photo of gravestone) at home in New Rochelle, NY. At the memorial service held for her at the Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette, several notable people spoke or sent messages - several Hands of the Cause and Paul E. Haney, Charles Mason Remey, Horace Holley, and Amelia Engelder Collins, and later Universal House of Justice member Charles Wolcott, as well as many notable Baháʼís. Painting Thompson's first show as a portrait painter was at the Knoedler's galleries. Thompson worked as a portrait painter for years in Washington D.C. and later in New York though she also had interests in other arts.Writing: Photography: Circa 1898 to 1900 she undertook studies while in France and showed her work while there. On return to the States, Thompson moved to New York circa 1902. She was on the Board of Control of The Pastellists founded in 1910, which included Jerome Myers, and Everett Shinn -the president was Leon Dabo. She also donated of her art for support of various causes - an early free clinic, Women's Suffrage, a project for minding children off street life, and relief for women and children in World War I. Among the portraits she painted are: Julia Dent Cantacuzène Spiransky-Grant, Hallie Davis, (wife of Stephen Benton Elkins), Rev.

Yuri Shafranik is the chairman of the board of the Union of Oil and Gas producers of Russia, chairman of the Committee on Energy Strategy and the development of the fuel and energy complex of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation, and a co-chair of Russian delegation to the Dartmouth Conferences.  Education  Born in a worker’s family in the Siberian village of Karasul (Tyumen Oblast), Yuri Shafranik graduated from Tyumen State Oil and Gas University in 1974 with a degree in electrical engineering of automation and remote-control systems. He earned his second degree in 1980 from the same university, majoring in mining engineering technology and the complex mechanization of oil and gas fields. Yuri Sharanik then received his Doctor of Economics degree in 2006.  Early career  Shafranik began his career while still studying and he made a successful industrial career in the oil industry of the former Soviet Union, moving from a locksmith to the general director of the Langepasneftegaz one of the largest oil producers of the time. Shafranik also remained active outside of his existing achievements and in 1990, he was elected Chairman of the Tyumen Regional Council of People’s Deputies in an alternative election. In September 1991 Shafranik was appointed Head of the Administration (Governor) of the Tyumen Region. During that period as Governor of the Tyumen Region, Yuri Shafranik became one of the initiators and authors of the Law \\"On Subsoil\\". In 1993 Shafranik was appointed the Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, a post he held for three years until 1996. While being the Minister of Energy he promoted the adoption of the Law on Production Sharing Agreements (1995). Energy Minister Shafranik was one of the initiators of the creation of and actively participated in, the work of the Russian-American Intergovernmental Commission (Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission) . The energy agreements and policies of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission were supported by Energy Minister Hazel R. O'Leary and Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik.  Business  Following those years as Energy Minister, Shafranik then returned to business and in 1997, founded the Central Fuel Company. The Central Fuel Company became a member of the Inam international project in partnership with SOCAR, Amoco, Monument Oil & Gas, which was sold to Shell for $ 18 mln. In 2000 Yuri Shafranik went on to found international investment group of companies, SoyuzNefteGaz, where he serves as Chairman. The Group completed projects in over 20 countries ranging from oil and gas exploration and production to provision of oil and gas field services and construction.

It is the second most populous city in the Malleco Province, and is the gateway to the area known as Araucanía Andina, with attractions such as the Tolhuaca National Park, the Tolhuaca Hot Springs, Malalcahuello National Reserve, and the communes of Curacautín and Lonquimay. The climate is influenced by the vicinity of the temperate rainforest in Chile.  History  Victoria was founded in 1881 by Bernardo Muñoz Vargas by order of General Gregorio Urrutia, on a plateau overlooking the Traiguén River valley.  The beginning  Initially when founded in 1881, the city was very poor: consisting of only a few huts and some trade - mainly for the garrison of the fort. Swiss settle came to Victoria in 1883. The commander of the fort, Bernardo Muñoz Vargas was responsible for some of the early urban planning. Creating some dumps, open streets, and a wooden bridge crossing the nearby river Traiguén. The Swiss settlers were followed by Germans in Valdivia, who established a mill and a brewery on the banks of Traiguén; and exploited the extensive virgin forest creating some sawmills.

It covers all of the historical Alentejo Province and part of the historical Estremadura Province. The greater region is defined within Portugal by the land bordering the left bank of the river Tagus to the North and extending to the South where it borders the Algarve region. The origin of its name, \\"além\\" + \\"Tejo\\" combined as Alentejo, literally translates to \\"Beyond-the-Tagus\\". However, a large part of the subregion Lezíria do Tejo is located on the right bank of the Tagus. The Alentejo is completely located beyond the left margin of the Tagus River. Its main cities are Évora, Elvas, Portalegre, Beja, Moura, Serpa, Sines and Santarém. Subdivisions The region is subdivided into five intermunicipal communities (NUTS 3 regions): * Alentejo Litoral * Alentejo Central * Alto Alentejo * Baixo Alentejo * Lezíria do Tejo  Demographics  The resident population of the Alentejo stands at around 759,000 (fourth quarter, 2008 – 2 700 less than the fourth quarter of 2007), with 49% men and 51% women. It is the least populated region in the country, representing over one third of national territory but only 7.1% of its population. It is also the region with the oldest population, 22.9% being 65 years of age or more (while the national average is 17.5%). The population is still declining – especially in the east of the Alentejo. Locals are said to migrate from the villages to the towns and from the towns to cities beyond the Alentejo. Some migration into the Alentejo is from Northern Europeans looking to escape their overcrowded regions, though not always permanently, just for sunny holiday retreats. People from China, Brazil, and mostly from (South-)Eastern Europe add to curbing population decline.  Economy  In 2006, the region had an estimated GDP per inhabitant rating of 17,200 EUR. In 2018, the Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 13.1 billion euros, accounting for 6.4% of Portugal's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 21,700 euros or 72% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 73% of the EU average.

It was compiled by Maarten Jozef Vermaseren and published at the Hague by Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1956, 1960 in 2 vols. Publication was sponsored by the Royal Flemish Academy and the Netherlands Organization for Pure Research. It is based on an earlier 1947 work of the same title that began as an entry in a competition organized by the Department of Fine Arts and Literature of the Flemish Academy. It is viewed as \\"an undiscriminating work\\", with \\"unpredictable topographic zig-zagging\\", but it remains indispensable for its access to the great bulk of the archaeological evidence. Although now years old, no updated corpora have been published since Vermaseren's, and CIMRM thus remains the standard reference catalog of inscriptions and monuments of the Mithraic Mysteries. Between 1960 and the time of his death in 1990, Vermaseren had accrued a substantial amount of material for a third volume of CIMRM. After his death, this collection was passed on to some Dutch scholar, and the trail of the material was lost. In August 2004, Richard Gordon posted an appeal on the website of the Electronic Journal of Mithraic Studies, requesting information on the whereabouts of the material.

The now defunct secondary school verges on three boroughs Hackney, Haringey and Islington. The school was opened in 1955, closing in 1981 when it was amalgamated with Clissold School and renamed Stoke Newington School. The new school was founded in 1982 in the building of the former Clissold School. A mixed school, the pupils were divided into four houses: Keller (Gold), Curie (Blue), Einstein (Red) and Scott(Green). During the school's first term in 1955 the pupils were tasked to choose the names of the four houses. Many suggestions were put forward by pupils and staff and eventually it was decided to draw up a list of men and women who, by their lives and work, epitomised the school motto, 'Fellowship is Life', and after a campaign, to have an election of four candidates. From 17 international figures Scott of the Antarctic, Albert Einstein, Helen Keller and Marie Curie were selected and gave their names to the four school houses. The school motto 'Fellowship is Life' was taken from a quote by early Socialist, designer and poet William Morris: \\"Fellowship is heaven, and lack of fellowship is hell; fellowship is life, and lack of fellowship is death; and the deeds that ye do upon the earth, it is for fellowship's sake that ye do them.\\" The School badge was specially designed to represent the area the school was located: the Red Griffin was the Stoke Newington Borough Arms, the Green Trees symbolised the Seven Sisters, and the Blue Water symbolised the reservoirs on whose banks the school was built. History In its earliest days it was regarded as a model school, and a contemporary newspaper article even advocated that The Princess Anne attend the new comprehensive, to see its state of the art teaching at first hand. The Headmistress at the onset was Mrs H R Chetwynd and her Deputy was Mr Jack Hackett. Through most of the 1970s the headmaster of Woodberry Down School was Michael Marland, who was appointed a CBE in 1977 for services to education. He was one of the leading educational pioneers of the second half of the 20th century, making a significant contribution to inner-city education. Marland left the school on its merger to focus on creating a new school, North Westminster Community School. The school was renowned for sporting achievements, especially rugby, and its alumni have included former professional footballer Marcus Gayle. Many other former pupils have gone on to a diverse range of successful and meaningful careers. Theo Paphitis of television series Dragon's Den also attended, while the band Bad Manners were formed at the school in 1976. They commemorated the 1981 closure of the school on the back sleeve of their Gosh It's... Bad Manners album, which reached number 18 in the UK Albums Chart that year. The school celebrated a Jubilee Reunion on the 2 September 2006. The school building has now been largely demolished and new flats are to be built on the site.

Executive producer Diederick Santer left EastEnders on 26 February 2010, handing over to Bryan Kirkwood, who fully took control from 1 March 2010. Santer introduced five new main characters in January, three from the online spin-off EastEnders: E20 (Zsa Zsa Carter, Leon Small and Fatboy) as well as two members of the long-established Mitchell family, Glenda Mitchell and her son Danny. February saw the show's first birth of 2010, with Kamil Masood, the fourth child of the established Zainab Masood and Masood Ahmed. The character of Harvey Freeman was introduced in April, and the fourth main character from EastEnders: E20, Mercy Olubunmi, joined EastEnders in May. Kirkwood's first major casting was Zöe Lucker in the role of Vanessa Gold and later cast her daughter Jodie and husband Harry, as well as Mercy's grandmother Grace, all of whom appeared in June. June also saw the show's second birth of the year, that of Lily Branning, the daughter of Stacey Branning and Ryan Malloy. In September, Richard Mitchell became the third birth of the year, born to Sam Mitchell and Jack Branning. Three characters arrived in October: Greg Jessop, Tanya Branning's fiancé; Michael Moon, Alfie Moon's cousin; and Julie Perkins, an old friend of Billy Mitchell. In November, Kirkwood introduced the ex-husband of Zainab Masood, Yusef Khan. Two more babies were born in December, James Branning and Tommy Moon, which triggered a long-running storyline for Ronnie Mitchell and Kat Moon. Fatima Inzamam Fatima Inzamam is the wife of Inzamam Ahmed (Paul Bhattacharjee) and mother of Jamila (Sara Aisha Kent) and Ali (Omar Kent). She made her first screen appearance on 1 January 2010 played by an uncredited actress. Anu Hasan took over the role for Fatima's return from 15 May 2015. She first appears before Syed Masood's (Marc Elliott) wedding to Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas) but leaves when Inzamam's brother Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) tells Inzamam he is no longer welcome at the wedding. In May 2015, Fatima visits after being contacted by her niece Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar) to find her a husband for an arranged marriage, frustrated at her boyfriend Kush Kazemi's (Davood Ghadami) inability to commit. Fatima invites the suitor, Asim (Nitin Kundra), to the house and introduces him to Shabnam. However, when Shabnam dodges the question of future children, Fatima confronts her, revealing she knows Shabnam abandoned her daughter on her doorstep seven years earlier. She tells Shabnam that she does not keep in touch with the child's adoptive parents but assures her that she is in good health. After Shabnam accepts Kush's proposal, Fatima confesses to Masood that she and Inzamam have separated, he has moved back to Pakistan and that she lied to Shabnam about her daughter; she knows where she is. Fatima later visits again with Shabnam's wedding dress and makes alterations to it so it hides her pregnancy bump. Fatima is shocked when Shabnam brings up Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and Stacey Branning's (Lacey Turner) past relationships, discovering that Denise's ex-husband, Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet), is a serial killer and that Stacey had an affair with her father-in-law, Max Branning (Jake Wood). Fatima is also shocked to discover Shabnam had been in numerous relationships previously and is unimpressed when Denise, Stacey and Kush's mother Carmel (Bonnie Langford) drink alcohol, worrying about the effect it will have on Masood's reputation. When Carmel questions her relationship with Masood, Fatima is forced to reveal that she is just his sister-in-law, stopping short of revealing that her marriage is over. Once she has finished with Shabnam's dress, Carmel is disapproving of the alterations, telling Fatima that Shabnam shouldn't be ashamed to be pregnant, which Shabnam agrees with and Fatima is unimpressed and goes home. Masood later calls her back to the house and she tells him that she felt that she had married the wrong brother. Shabnam then walks in on them kissing and leaves in shock. Fatima is then outraged to discover that Masood had slept with Carmel, and leaves angrily, telling her nephew, Masood's son, Tamwar (Himesh Patel), that Masood is just as bad as Inzamam. She returns on the eve of Shabnam and Kush's wedding and helps Shabnam, Carmel, Stacey and Denise with the wedding preparations.

Jarvis said on his casting: \\"I'm absolutely thrilled to be a potential thorn between two roses working with two actresses I greatly admire and have had the pleasure of working with before. I'm delighted to be reunited with Pam and Barbara and to have a part in EastEnders.\\" He arrives in The Queen Victoria public house to interview Peggy on the upcoming council elections in which she is running. He later interviews Pat for the same reason, but Peggy plies them with free drinks and Pat gets drunk. Peggy tells Harvey that Pat cheated on her husband with Peggy's husband, and that anything she has said about the Mitchell family is a lie. After Pat pours a drink on Peggy's head, Harvey announces that he has more candidates to interview and leaves, after wiping Peggy's face. After hearing that Pat and Peggy have both chosen to withdraw from the election, Harvey visits them individually, giving them his card and inviting them out for drinks. A week later, they both decide to call him on the same day. He takes Pat out for lunch and Peggy out for dinner without them knowing he is seeing them both. The next day he tries his best to stop them finding out but eventually they realise what he has been doing, so he quickly leaves. Pat and Peggy argue over him but eventually agree not to let him come between their friendship. They tell him so and tell him to get out in unison. Later, Harvey talks to Pat and she asks who he would have chosen if he had to choose. He says Pat as he prefers a more intelligent woman. He then waits for Peggy and she asks him the same question, to which he says he would have chosen Peggy as he prefers a woman with class. Pat and Peggy meet again and agree they did the right thing, but then both their mobile phones receive text messages at the same time and they walk away from each other smiling.

Pat and Peggy catch him up and take over the tour guide's microphone, saying that Harvey is vermin and slapping him before they get off.

Mojekwu's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, and It was subsequently announced on 24 January 2010 that she would feature in EastEnders due to positive reaction to the character. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that once he had seen the completed episodes of EastEnders: E20, he wanted Mercy in the main show as well. She is described as \\"funny, warm, sensitive and rather mysterious.\\" She has always been a good girl but she feels abandoned when her parents move back to Nigeria, leaving her with her grandmother, Grace (Ellen Thomas). She first appears in EastEnders on 31 May. Her storylines include suffering a miscarriage after discovering she is pregnant by her local church's youth minister, Benjamin (Damien Lynch), and facing deportation back to Nigeria. She left EastEnders on 12 July 2011. Grace Olubunmi Grace Olubunmi is the grandmother of Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu). She appears in episode 8 of the first series of EastEnders spin-off EastEnders: E20, credited only as Mrs Olubunmi and played by Jay Byrd. New executive producer Bryan Kirkwood introduced the character to EastEnders in his first episode on 4 June 2010, this time played by Ellen Thomas. She also appeared in series 3 of E20 along with Mercy's younger sister, Faith Olubunmi, who Grace sent to Nigeria to get back on the straight and narrow, but she returns to the UK and is worse than ever. Grace is portrayed by Ellen Thomas, marking her third of four roles in the series. In EastEnders: E20, Grace tells Mercy that her friend Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) is a bad influence on her. When the character arrives in EastEnders, she urges Mercy to tell Fatboy that they are moving to Lagos. She makes friends with Liz Turner (Kate Williams), mother of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) and later tells Fatboy about their plans. She hosts a lunch at the community centre and tells Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) that she has grown fond of London but is going to Lagos for Mercy's sake. Fatboy then realises that neither Grace nor Mercy want to go and makes them realise this after Mercy has returned the key to their former home. Fatboy then says he has a plan for somewhere for them to live, and they move into a property on Albert Square. Grace attends a bible class with Mercy, held by Lucas. She apologises for Mercy's behaviour when she continues to ask about false prophets and a passage that states that anyone who questions a priest should be put to death, causing Lucas to leave. Grace makes Mercy write Lucas a letter of apology, but Mercy bins it. Upset with the amount of litter around the streets, she urges Mercy and Fatboy to volunteer to pick it up. She takes Mercy's friends Zsa Zsa Carter (Emer Kenny) and Leon Small (Sam Attwater) to get their GCSE results and says she used to be a teacher. The next month Leon breaks one of her commemorative plates and Fatboy tries to create a new one in the hope Grace will think it is real, but she does not fall for it. However, she praises Fatboy for his eventual honesty and displays the plate with her others. However, when she discovers Mercy has been serving drinks in Alfie Moon's (Shane Richie) illegal den, she berates her granddaughter and says Fatboy has corrupted her. Grace overhears Dot Branning (June Brown) planning to collect jumble for her church. Grace collects the jumble instead, leaving Dot upset. They quote bible passages to each other to try to show who is in the right, but Grace later admits that she is lonely and just wanted to meet new people. The next day, Mercy tries to get Grace and Dot to make up, by suggesting Grace work in the launderette. Grace puts some shirts in a broken washing machine, which annoys Dot, and after Grace gets it open Dot is still not happy. Grace later gives Dot her CV to give to her boss, and Dot says there is not a job for her but Grace tells her that Jesus disagrees. The next day, Grace asks Dot if she has looked at her CV yet. Dot says Grace is overqualified as she used to be a teacher. Grace says she will not be teaching again as she was dismissed from her last job. Later, Dot finds a tin of cakes in the launderette with a note from Grace saying it was not about the job. Dot visits Grace and offers her a few weeks work while Dot is away. Grace feels honoured, and tells Dot she was dismissed for slapping a pupil. Dot thanks her for her honesty. However, when Dot joins a local choir that Grace is a member of, the pair start quarrelling again, as Dot is unimpressed with the singing standard of the group. She later holidays in her native Nigeria but returns in time for the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. She does not watch the wedding, however, as Mercy is leaving because she faces deportation. Grace and Mercy say goodbye to each other but as Mercy's taxi drives off, Fatboy stops it and asks Mercy to marry him. Grace is opposed to the idea at first, until she realises that Fatboy loves Mercy. After Mercy and Fatboy's wedding, Grace attends Mercy's hearing and is annoyed that they will not get a decision over whether she can stay in the country straight away. Mercy is allowed to stay in the UK but decides to leave anyway over guilt at her deception. Grace waves Mercy off as she leaves in the back of a black cab. Two days later Grace worries when Fatboy does not come home, and finds he stayed with Dot. Fatboy later tells Grace that he will be living with Dot as Grace's house holds too many memories of Mercy. Grace is surprised when Mercy's sister Faith Olubunmi (Modupe Adeyeye) arrives from Nigeria and moves in with her. Faith later holds a party at Grace's house and she has sex with Fatboy but they are caught by Grace. The next day, when Faith returns home drunk, Grace slaps her and kicks her out of the house. Following this, Grace makes appearances in EastEnders: E20, where Faith continues to ask her for a place to stay, but Grace refuses. Grace is also upset when Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) and Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) prank call her and then break her hanging basket. When Faith returns home drunk, Grace slaps her telling her to leave. Although Grace is not seen on-screen after this, she still lives locally and is mentioned on occasion. In April 2013, Max Branning (Jake Wood) informs his wife Kirsty (Kierston Wareing) that Grace has left Walford to move back to Nigeria, and that her flat is for sale. Ava Hartman (Clare Perkins) also likes the flat, and eventually buys it, before Max and Kirsty. Grace is not mentioned since. Mercy and Grace's introduction to EastEnders made them the first Nigerian family to appear in the series. Mojekwu, who plays Mercy, was surprised at how long it took the programme to represent her community in the series, but congratulated them for doing so. On the announcement of Mojekwu's departure, it was revealed that Mercy's family would remain in the series. Bryan Kirkwood confirmed this. In October 2011, Thomas received a special mention at the Screen Nation Awards, which celebrate the best British Black talent.

She is the mother of Jodie (Kylie Babbington) and wife of Harry (Linal Haft). It was announced in April 2011 that Lucker was to depart from the series and would have an \\"explosive\\" departure. Vanessa was introduced as a love-interest for local car salesman Max, intended to facilitate a reunion between Max and his former wife Tanya (Jo Joyner). Concurrent to their romance, which was extended to span Lucker's increased tenure, Vanessa separates from her controlling husband Harry, and reveals that he is not the father of her teenage daughter Jodie. Lucker describes Vanessa as a glamorous risk-taker, who does not fit into the soap's Albert Square setting. She received critical praise for her comic timing in the role, and was nominated Most Popular Newcomer at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards. She departed on 6 October 2011.

She is a love interest for Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins) and is described as big-hearted with \\"an infectious smile and a personality to match.\\" Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood told entertainment website Digital Spy, \\"I'm really excited about Kylie taking on the role of Jodie. She brings yet more fresh energy to the show—she's a ray of sunshine.\\" The character is 19 years old on her arrival and Jodie is Babbington's first television role.

Jade first appears when Lucas visits a bar and sees her on her own. He offers to take her somewhere more quiet and they leave together. He takes her to a secluded spot and tells her that drinking and throwing herself at men is wrong and that her soul is lost. He says she needs to be cleansed and forces her to pray, but she attempts to fight back. She escapes but Lucas catches up to her, again telling her to beg for God's forgiveness. Lucas then removes his tie, and when he returns home, there are deep scratch marks on his neck. Jade's fate is unknown until Lucas's wife Denise (Diane Parish) suspects Lucas is cheating on her, so Lucas takes her to see where he got the scratches. They go to Jade's flat where she tells Denise that she prayed with Lucas and he baptised her, though initially she tried to resist and scratched Lucas. She says she will get help for her alcohol dependence and get her daughter back, who was taken away from her. Jade was originally scripted as a prostitute who Lucas picks up and forces to pray for forgiveness before apparently strangling her. However, following the charging of Stephen Griffiths with the murder of three prostitutes in Bradford, the decision was made to reshoot the scenes to remove the prostitute references, less than a week before the scenes were due to air. A spokesperson for the programme said the decision was made to \\"ensure we do not cause distress to the families involved in these tragic events.\\" Harry Gold Harry Gold, played by Linal Haft, is Vanessa Gold's (Zöe Lucker) husband and stepfather to Jodie (Kylie Babbington).

He left on 9 November 2010, and returned again on 29 August 2011. Harry first appears when Vanessa returns home from seeing Max Branning (Jake Wood). He asks her for a drink and then says he smells cigarette smoke on her. She lies that she was out with friends but he says one of her friends called earlier that day and has not seen Vanessa for weeks. Vanessa then says she went out on her own as she could not face being bored at home, and admits to smoking, which Harry dislikes. He wonders if she is seeing someone else, and after he watches Vanessa go upstairs to bed, he moves an ornament back to where it was before Vanessa moved it when she came home. He comes to Walford several weeks later, looking for Max. He asks Liam Butcher (James Forde) and his younger brother, Morgan (Devon Higgs) if he knows Max. Liam tells him where he lives, and Harry gives them some money. However, he mistakes Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins) for him and knees him in the groin, telling him to keep off his property, leaving Darren in immense pain as he has just returned from having a circumcision operation. He takes Vanessa to Walford and dumps her bags outside Max's house, realises who Max really is, and asks Vanessa what Max has that he does not, to which she says he can manage sex more than once a week. Harry says they are welcome to each other and leaves, taking Vanessa's car. However, when Jodie reveals to Vanessa that Harry is heartbroken, Vanessa ends her affair with Max and moves back to Chigwell. Harry then comes to Walford with Vanessa and Jodie to meet Darren. At Vanessa's birthday party, Max's ex-wife Tanya (Jo Joyner) tells Vanessa that Max misses her and she should go back to him. Jodie sees that Harry is not very interested in celebrating Vanessa's birthday and tells her mother that she agrees with Tanya as Vanessa deserves better than Harry, so Vanessa goes back to Max again. Harry attempts to contact Vanessa but she continues to ignore him as it is Billie Jackson's (Devon Anderson) funeral. He sends Vicky Saunders (Jessica Ellerby) to issue Vanessa with some papers but she sends her away. Harry later turns up at Vanessa's house and hands her the papers, revealing that he wants Vanessa to get nothing in their divorce. He also threatens her with Jodie, saying he can get her to take his side, saying she has always been a daddy's girl, but Vanessa reveals he is not her father. In spite, Harry spray-paints the word \\"slapper\\" on Max's door, and plasters Walford with nude photos of Vanessa. When Darren catches Harry about to spray- paint a car, he stops him and Harry tells him that he is not Jodie's father. Later, Darren begs Harry not to tells Jodie but when Jodie says Harry phoned her, Darren assumes he told her and accidentally reveals the truth. Vanessa meets Harry and he says he will do anything to hurt Vanessa, even keeping Jodie from her despite no longer feeling anything for her. He takes Vanessa's jewellery and calls her a prostitute, saying that he will let Jodie stay with her if they have sex. Harry takes revenge by throwing a brick through Max and Vanessa's window and slashing the tyres of the cars on Max's car lot. Jodie's cat goes missing and while everyone looks for it, Harry slashes Vanessa's clothes, and when she goes to throw them away, she finds the cat dead in the bin. Max and his brother Jack (Scott Maslen) then decide to take revenge on Harry. They send Harry a text message from Vanessa's phone asking to meet, and when he turns up, they threaten him and tell him to never contact Vanessa again or next time it will be worse. After they all go their separate ways, Jack is grabbed by two men and bundled into a car. Jack is later released, but reveals to Max that Harry was behind the kidnapping. Nine months later, Vanessa contacts Harry in need of money to pay for Jodie and Darren's wedding. Harry agrees so he can make amends with Jodie, as long as Vanessa does not attend.

Development Described as a feisty character who is an \\"antidote to the snarling women of Albert Square\\", Julie's arrival leaves Billy shocked and turns his life upside down. The character is also described as a \\"cockney geezer bird [who] is more at home down the pub with the boys but underneath her robust layer, there's a little girl abandoned by her mum wanting to be loved.\\" Her profile on the EastEnders website additionally describes her as straight talking, good, tough, kind-hearted with a good sense of humour and vulnerable. She tells the truth and is not intentionally malicious, and deals with the world by putting up a barrier. She never complains, gets on well with children and young people, has a firm sense of morality and questions everything around her. Speaking about the role, Murphy said: \\"Like our characters, I've known Perry since I was 16 and he is a brilliant actor. We've never worked together before so I am looking forward to getting stuck into our fantastic rollercoaster of a story.\\" Julie is Murphy's third role in the soap, having appeared in 1991 as Lorna and again as Trisha Taylor in 2005. An EastEnders spokesperson commented on Julie's storyline: \\"Julie and Billy have a real connection despite being out of each other's lives since they were teenagers. She's a true Cockney sparrow and tells it like it is. However, Billy is staggered to learn he may have more skeletons in the closet waiting to be discovered.\\" Fenwick discussed the storyline saying, \\"They were both 15 when Julie got pregnant, but Billy, like everyone else in the children's home, thought it was this carer who knocked him and the other kids about. But when she explains it wasn't her fault and they took the baby away from her, he shifts his anger to the authorities. They haven't told me exactly what's going to happen, but I know they're going to be really clever with this story. There'll be lots of twists and turns...\\" In June 2011, it was announced that Danielle Harold had joined the cast, playing Julie and Billy's 15-year-old granddaughter Lola Pearce. It was reported that Billy and Julie would be shocked to learn of Lola's existence, not knowing the son they once gave up for adoption had a daughter, but would decide to track her down and find her living in a care home. On 21 June 2011, it was revealed that Murphy had left EastEnders. Digital Spy reported that she had finished filming and her last scenes would air over the following weeks.

Edward organises tea at the Ritz with Betty, but cancels so he can go with Dot. However, Dot has to cancel because Jim is returning home unexpectedly. Edward visits Dot again and invites her to watch a film at home. While they watch, Edward holds Dot's hand, but she pulls away. He admits that he likes her but she says she is married, so thanks Edward for the nice things he has done but tells him to leave and never return. The next day he calls her several times but she tells him to stop. He arrives on Albert Square to talk to Dot and she agrees to hear him out, but she ends up telling him again to leave her alone. Development In March 2011, June Brown discussed Dot and Edward's relationship in an interview with Digital Spy. She opined that the two characters have a lot in common, Edward enjoys Dot's company and would probably want a more romantic relationship but respects the fact she has a husband. Dot also enjoys spending time with Edward but is mortified when Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) calls him her \\"fancy man\\" and is worried that other people will think they are more than friends. He was described by TV Scoop as \\"Dot's doting pal\\". An insider explained: \\"Carol doesn't really mean anything by it, but she makes a comment about Dot's relationship with Edward that really stings. Dot thinks Carol is implying there is something inappropriate about their friendship, and she’s outraged and humiliated.\\" In May 2011, Brown said that Dot feels guilty about her relationship with Edward as \\"there is an attraction there, but because of her religious views she feels it is wrong.\\" Tommy Moon Tommy Moon is the son of Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd). Tommy is initially played by two babies named Ralfie White and Shane though in November 2013, Richie talked about Ralf (now aged three years) playing Tommy and made no mention of Shane. Additionally, a 2014 cast photo showed only one child in the role of Tommy. Shay Crotty took over the role from White in December 2015 and returned to it when Tommy returned in December 2018 despite previously being recast. In the Kat and Alfie series Redwater, which began airing from May 2017, he is played by Henry Proctor.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2873674/?ref_=tt_cl_t1 On 25 November 2018, it was announced Tommy and his half-brothers, Bert Moon and Ernie Moon, would be returning to EastEnders. Tommy is born on screen on 30 December 2010. In the following episode, Kat is taken to hospital and leaves her father Charlie Slater (Derek Martin) to look after Tommy. However, Charlie joins a party downstairs in The Queen Victoria public house. Meanwhile, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) discovers that her own son, James Branning, who was born on the same day as Kat's, has died of sudden infant death syndrome and desperately tries to get help. When she hears Tommy crying, she sneaks into The Queen Victoria and decides to swap the children. Ronnie eventually regrets her actions but by the time she decides to swap them back, James has been found by Alfie and Jack has returned to the country and meets Tommy, thinking he is James. When Kat sees the baby in hospital, she refuses to believe it is Tommy as he looks different, but Alfie convinces her it is because he has died. When a midwife visits Ronnie, she is surprised at how quickly James's club foot appears to have gone. Ronnie is denied access to the funeral by Kat but goes anyway, hiding behind a tree. She later realises she has to put an end to the situation and takes Tommy back to Kat during the wake. Ronnie's attempts to explain that the baby is Tommy are all misunderstood and Kat demands that the baby be taken away from her. Ronnie continues to care for Tommy but starts behaving erratically. She later returns to the hospital where she gave birth and meets her midwife, Diane McLean (Hannah Kew), and realises she has to give Tommy back to Kat immediately. She tells Jack that the baby is not his son, and then explains to Kat what happened on the night James died. Kat refuses to believe it but takes Tommy, while Ronnie hands herself into the police. Jack says an emotional goodbye the next day as he hands Tommy over to social services. Alfie is interviewed by a social worker, but Kat leaves the hospital unable to cope. However, Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) tells Kat that it is a miracle that Tommy is alive, so Kat returns to the hospital to be interviewed, and they are reunited with Tommy. Although Kat struggles to bond with Tommy at first, and refuses to say his name, she soon adjusts and she and Alfie have Tommy christened; his godparents are Jean and Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). However Alfie and Kat end their marriage and they share custody of Tommy. Michael tells Tommy that he is his real father, angering Alfie, though Tommy is still too young to understand. Michael dies in November 2013 after being stabbed by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), however, later that month Kat and Alfie reunite. In 2014, Kat gives birth to Tommy's twin brothers Bert and Ernie Moon (Freddie and Stanley Beale). Kat is badly burnt in a fire and after she becomes depressed, separating from Alfie, which affects Tommy negatively. Kat eventually reunites with Alfie. They win a million pounds on a scratchcard and depart for a new life in Spain. Kat returns on Christmas Day to surprise her relative, Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner), without Alfie and the children. Later, Alfie returns with Tommy, Bert and Ernie, annoyed that Kat has left them without warning. Development In September 2010, Shane Richie, who plays Kat's husband Alfie Moon, teased an upcoming storyline involving Alfie and Kat. Although he gave no details of the plot, he said that when he was offered the chance to return to the show to reprise his role as Alfie, he was informed of the storyline, which would be ongoing for \\"the best part of a year or maybe two years.\\" He said it would be \\"the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps,\\" and that he and Wallace were excited to be involved. On 11 November 2010, details of the upcoming storyline were revealed by the BBC. Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said of the baby swap storyline: \\"This story built on the rich history both characters have built up over the years and the story team have worked hard to make this convincing and powerful. Although EastEnders is a fictional drama we have, of course, taken great care to thoroughly research this storyline, which will reflect issue close to the hearts of some of our audience. We're fortunate to have two wonderful actresses, Jessie Wallace and Samantha Womack, who understand the need to portray such an emotive subject sensitively. Viewers will know that Ronnie has had a difficult past, losing both her daughter and father in the last couple of years. When she loses the one thing she's always wanted, she acts on impulse in a moment of sheer grief and desperation.\\" Kirkwood later said the scenes would be believable and the storyline bold and gritty. He confirmed that a maternity nurse had been consulted on what would happen in real life, saying the crew made sure the two babies were born in different circumstances. The baby swap scenes are balanced with scenes of celebration elsewhere, to show \\"a community with a lot of love\\" in the hope it would \\"counter the inevitable darkness of this story.\\" It was reported on 24 December that several scenes had been edited prior to the broadcast. Shots of Ronnie touching James's cold hand were reportedly edited out and the sound of Tommy crying was toned down. A scene showing Kat in blood-soaked pyjamas after haemorrhaging was also edited. The baby's funeral was filmed on 20 November 2010, at a graveyard in north London. The scene where Ronnie swaps the children was called \\"powerful\\". Around 3,400 viewer complaints were received by the BBC, with viewers branding the storyline \\"insensitive\\", \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"desperate\\". Roz Laws from the Sunday Mercury called the plot \\"shocking and ridiculous\\" and asked \\"are we really supposed to believe that Kat won't recognise that the baby looks different?\\", although this comment was made prior to the episode where Kat didn't recognise 'her' baby. The Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths (FSID) praised the storyline, and its director Joyce Epstein explained, \\"We are very grateful to EastEnders for their accurate depiction of the devastating effect that the sudden death of an infant can have on a family. We hope that this story will help raise the public's awareness of cot death, which claims 300 babies' lives each year.\\" According to overnight figures, 10.6 million people watched 3 January 2011 episode, in which Kat claims the dead baby is not her son and Ronnie struggles to bond with Tommy. In February 2011, the storyline was nominated in the Soap Bubble Awards under the name of 'baby swap', in the category 'Best Baby Drama'. In May, it was nominated for 'Best Storyline' at the 2011 British Soap Awards, under the title \\"Ronnie swaps her baby for Kat's\\".

C. Stribling Barn is a brick barn built ca. 1890 to 1900 at 220 Isaqueena Trail in Clemson, South Carolina. It is also known as the Sleepy Hollow Barn or the Stribling-Boone Barn. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on October 22, 2001. History Jesse Cornelius Stribling (1844–1927) was a private in the Confederate Army. He served with the 1st South Carolina Rifles (Orr's Rifles) and the Rutledge Mounted Riflemen. After the war, he married Virginia Eliza Hunter (1847–1934). During the violent Reconstruction period, Stribling was an officer in the Red Shirts, a white military club focused on voter intimidation. He was a progressive farmer. Along with W.D. Warren of nearby Ashtabula, Stribling brought Jersey cattle into South Carolina in 1873. He also introduced Percheron horses into the state. He was the president of the Pendleton Farmers' Society from 1908 until he died in 1927. Sleepy Hollow is the name for a farm between Clemson and Pendleton. The house was originally built in 1837 to replace a log cabin. Sleepy Hollow was sold to Virginia Stribling in 1887. The Stribling family lived at Sleepy Hollow until 1930. In 1890, the original barn and other out buildings were lost and the house was damaged in a fire. The house was repaired and a new barn was built. Sleepy Hollow is now a bed and breakfast. The grounds are rented for weddings and other events. Architecture The barn is a three-story, brick bank barn. Bank barns are less common in the Southeastern United States than in New England or the Midwest. Its brick construction is considered unusual for South Carolina barns. This was built after the fire that destroyed the plantation's outbuildings around 1890. It was built as early as 1890 or as late as about 1900. The barn has a stone foundation. The barn is long and wide. Its hand-made, native bricks were fired in a kiln on the plantation. Mud mortar was used to lay the bricks in six to one common bond. The barn has a jerkin head, V-crimp metal roof that is supported by eight square wooden piers and timber trusses. There is a clerestory, center ridge vent for light and ventilation. A base, which may have been for a cupola, is in the center of the ridge vent. The main entrance is in the center of the west elevation at the second level of the barn. It is an arched entry with brick pilasters. There is a wooden keystone and a lozenge-shaped vent above the arch. There are metal-track sliding, lattice doors on the north and south elevations on the first and second levels. Two lozenge-shaped vents are on north and south elevations near the jerkin-head roofline. There are fourteen windows with a six-light wooden sash. The first level was for fifty Jersey cows while the second level was for the horses. The latter had four trap doors that served as hay chutes for the cattle. The third level was for storage and included platforms at each end of the barn for drying seeds. To use the barn for recreation, the central section of the third level and the drying platforms were removed and overhead lighting was installed. A new wooden floor was put on the second level and concrete was poured over the dirt floor at the entrance. Also a concrete retaining wall about was put along the rear foundation. Additional pictures of the barn are available.

It was originally broadcast on NBC on January 7, 1985. Plot Gus Stewart (Peter Fonda) finds his relationship with his wife Dolores (Deidre Hall) is becoming strained when he becomes jealous of one of Dolores' male co-workers, whom she has invited to the house for Thanksgiving dinner. After dinner, Gus retreats to the attic, where he pulls out a .45 pistol from a desk drawer. Concerned about Gus' behavior, his 13-and-a-half-year-old son Alex (Ricky Schroder) follows him, but doesn't see the pistol. Later that night, Alex overhears his parents arguing. Unable to sleep, he goes downstairs, where he sees his dad leave a note on the table. He also sees Gus working on a will, but when he asks about it, Gus brushes him off. The next day, Alex loads up the car for a weekend lodge trip, but notices his dad's pistol is missing when he and his friend Ellen (Tracey Gold) explore the attic. He also learns that Gus has decided not to go on the trip. Alex becomes even more worried when his dad gives him an expensive fishing rod, which he knows Gus highly values. Alex and Dolores leave, but Alex convinces his mom to go on without him. Back home, Alex finds his dad's note, which has the phone number to the local Suicide Prevention Center. Alex goes to the boat harbor where his dad works, but learns that Gus was fired a week ago. Alex visits the center, where he tells counselor Bob Cousins (Bruce Weitz) about his dad's behavior the past couple of days. Saying the center can't really help unless the person contemplating suicide calls them first, Cousins tells Alex to talk to his dad, giving him a list of behavioral warning signs. On the bus ride home, Ellen tells Alex that she has been hearing rumors about his mom having an affair. Alex finds Gus reviewing his will and some old photographs, and tries to get him to open up. Unwilling to do so, Gus tells Alex that he'll have him stay with a cousin for the weekend. Alex tries to get one of his dad's friends to invite him out. When that fails, he visits Isabel Bennett (Carrie Snodgress), a woman who Gus once had a relationship with, and gets her to drop by. While Isabel talks to Gus, Alex and Ellen try unsuccessfully to locate the gun. Isabel and Ellen leave, and Gus and Alex share a few drinks as Alex tries to cheer his dad up. Gus finally relents and tells Alex he doesn't have to go see his cousin. The next morning, Gus calls Dolores at the lodge. Dolores says she's not coming back and also admits that she's not at the lodge alone. After Gus hangs up, he becomes agitated and tells Alex he's going to take him to the airport. Panicking, Alex tries to call Cousins at the center, but Gus interrupts him, causing Alex to hide in his bedroom. Gus forces his way in, grabs Alex, and shoves him into the car. As Gus speeds toward the airport, Alex confronts Gus about the past few days and his knowledge that Gus is contemplating suicide. When Gus doesn't respond, an exasperated Alex jumps out of the car, leading to a foot chase on the highway that nearly results in Alex being run over. Gus rescues Alex and promises his son that he won't ever leave him.

Biography William was born in Warrington in 1840, the son of the locomotive engineer Thomas Kirtley (1810–1847). He was educated by his uncle Matthew Kirtley, Locomotive Superintendent of the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway and later of the Midland Railway, following his father's premature death. He served as a pupil at Derby Works from 1854–1860, and from 1861 to 1864 he was Running foreman for the Midland Railway for the London District. In 1864 he was appointed superintendent of Derby Works.

The mine has the largest known deposit of pollucite and is also the world's largest producer of caesium. History The pegmatite ore body now mined by the Tanco Mine was discovered in the late 1920s and the first mining started in 1929. Several times the mine was closed, reopened and closed, until in 1969 when it was reopened as a tantalum mine. Cabot Corporation bought the mine in 1993, and began the production of caesium brine from pollucite in 1996. Tanco Mine was purchased by Sinomine Corporation in 2019 https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190628005482/en/Cabot- Corporation-Completes-Sale-Specialty-Fluids-Business. The caesium brine is converted into caesium formate which is used mostly as additive for drilling fluids to increase the fluid's density. A concentrated solution of caesium formate has a density of 2.3 g/cm3. The mine has the largest tantalum reserves in Canada having estimated reserves of 2.1 million tonnes of ore grading 0.22% tantalum. The mine also has additional reserves amounting to 7.3 million tonnes of ore grading 2.76% lithium. Geology The pegmatite found at the north west shore and below the lake floor of Bernic Lake is a granitic igneous rock enriched in the incompatible elements, for example caesium, lithium, tantalum and beryllium. Pegmatite forms if magmatic rock slowly crystallizes, and the incompatible elements are concentrated in the residual molten magma. Examples of minerals found in the mine are the lithium-containing spodumene and amblygonite, caesium-containing pollucite, beryllium-containing beryl and tantalum- and niobium-containing simpsonite and tantalite. Deposit The pollucite ((Cs,Na)2Al2Si4O12·2H2O) deposit associated with the pegmatite is the largest known deposit of this mineral and with 350,000 tons, it accounts for two thirds of the known resources. With an estimated average global use of 30,000 kg/year the reserves of the mine would last for 2,000 to 3,000 years. The mined pollucite contains approximately 24% Cs2O. The ore body is 1400 m long, 600 m wide and 100 m deep. For several decades the pegmatites at Bernic Lake have supplied the world with the needed caesium.

Milan and Lombardy had a GDP of €400 billion ($493 billion) and €650 billion ($801 billion) respectively in 2017. Milan has surpassed Berlin in economy in 2014, which since then has made it the richest city among the Four Motors for Europe. It is a member of the Blue Banana, the economic leaders of Europe. Milan's hinterland is Italy's largest industrial area. Milan also has Italy's highest GDP per capita, about €49,500 (US$55,600). Milan's Porta Nuova District is Europe's richest subdivision within any city, with a 2016 GDP of €257 billion ($308 billion) similar to that of the world's 34th richest country, Philippines. The city center also houses Europe's most expensive street, Via Montenapoleone and the National Stock Exchange, Borsa Italiana. Milan is considered as one of the fashion capitals of the World together with New York, Paris, and London. Major fashion houses and labels, such as Versace, Gucci, Armani, Valentino, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Moschino, Luxottica, OVS, Tod's, Trussardi, and Missoni are headquartered in Milan. Milan was Europe's most expensive city in 2015 and 2016 for hotel rates above 3 stars. Milan is the world's 11th most expensive city for expatriate employees and its influence in fashion, commerce, business, banking, design, trade and industry makes it a global city. Economic history Duomo is clearly visible. The plant, built in 1883, was the first power plant in Europe Since the late 12th century, Milan has been a wealthy and industrious city with the production of armours and wool. During the Renaissance, Milan was a center of production of luxury goods, textiles, hats and fabrics, along with Venice, Rome and Florence. The English word millinery, referring to women's hats in the 19th century, came from the word Milan. Towards the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Milan became a major European industrial centre for the automotive industry, chemicals, textiles, tools, heavy machinery and book and music publishing, with thousands of companies already headquartered in the city. After the city's World War II bombings and the opening of the Milan camp for refugees, the city witnessed an \\"economic miracle\\", with new buildings being built (such as the Pirelli Tower), more industries opening up and hundreds of thousand of immigrants from Southern Italy migrating to the city. Beginning in the 1980s the city experienced a strong flow of immigrants, and became a major international and cosmopolitan centre for expatriate employees. A study showed that by the late-1990s, more than 10% of the city's workers were foreigners. According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), 181,393 foreign-born immigrants lived in the city in January 2008, representing 13.9% of the total population. Production and sectors Milan had a strong industrial and economic production after the war, however, it fell slightly in the late 1990s and early 2000s, especially with the tangentopoli political scandal. However, from 2004 onwards, economic growth started to increase again, with an average of 1%, below Lombardy (whose growth rate was 4.6%) and the Italy's 2004 6% average, and a significant reduced production in some industries: footwear (-11.4%), textiles (-6.1%) and clothing (-5%). The bulk of the plastic (-2%), chemicals (-1.8%) and mechanics (-1.6%) industries show a downward trend. Publishing production decreased by -2.6%, while the wood-processing industry production decreased by -1.2%. In contrast, despite an industrial decrease in production, Milan has had a rapid and strong growth in the tertiary and quaternary sectors, with logistics and transport (+6.8%) and food (+1.7%). Milan also has an important role in book production and publishing. It is the most important city in the nation for publishing.Forgacs, David, and Stephen Gundle. Mass Culture and Italian Society from Fascism to the Cold War. Indiana University Press, 2007. Banks and other services Banks throughout Italy went through many changes in the late 1800s to early 1900s. One of the Milanese banks, the SBI, had many issues resolving its resources. It did not have support from foreign banks nor enough savings domestically. Other banks during this time in Italy, specifically during the 1907 international crisis, had high liquid assets and would have had to go bankrupt without the help from Banca d'Italia. A group of industrialists and bankers from Milan transformed the banking institute Figli di Weil Schott e C. into the Società Bancaria Milanese.The Economic History of Italy 1860-1990 Most traditional industries have relocated to other locations other than cities or have even closed down since the late 1970s in Italy. However, Milan, became Italy's most successful postindustrial city. Milan's service sector has benefited from the efficiency of the city's banks and the stock market, the Borsa Italiana located in Piazza degli Affari in the centre of the city. The majority of the services revolve around the Fashion industry, but the city is also a world centre of design at whole. There are specialties in the city in furniture design, graphic design, among other specialties. The design industry is centrally located to the Besana in the Brianza area north of the city. Communications is also a major service sector of the city. Milan is home to Mondadori, one of Italy's largest publishing group. In addition, the newspapers Corriere della Sera and La Gazzetta dello Sport along with the newsmagazine L'espresso. Porta Nuova is the main business district of Milan, and one of the most important in Italy. AXA, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, China Construction Bank, FinecoBank, Finanza & Futuro Banca, FM Global, HSBC, KPMG, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, UniCredit, UnipolSai and many other companies have their headquarters in Porta Nuova. Milan's service sector has benefited from the efficiency of the city's banks and the stock market, the Borsa Italiana, located in Piazza degli Affari in the centre of the city. Exports, imports, and trade Milan's main trading partners are Switzerland, Russia, Turkey and the European Union (especially other Italian cities). In non-European trade, the main trading, exporting and importing partners are China, Hong Kong, the countries of North Africa, Singapore and United Arab Emirates. The city's main export products are electronics, electrical engineering, steel, textile and clothing products and motor vehicles (which, however, has dropped drastically in 2005 by 28.6%). On the import side of things, the main partners in Milan South Korea, Thailand, India, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. The imported goods from around 86% of these countries. Also, the city imports a significant amount from South American countries and the European Union (Germany, Belgium, Netherlands are the main partners) Employment Employment in Italy is linked to manufacturing as it has been seen that when there are technological changes in place, there is typically a positive effect on job growth; therefore, on employment rates. This was seen in the late twentieth century in the country as a whole.Innovation and Employment: Evidence from Italian Microdata, Mariacristina Piva and Marco Vivarelli, Journal of Economics, Vol. 86, No. 1 (October 2005), pp. 65-83 There is a steady workforce in the city of Milan due to the presence of new graduates from the five major universities located in the city. In the province, there are 1.6 million individuals employed, and about twenty five percent of that population are recorded as self-employed. The unemployment rate in Milan is recorded to be less than half of the national average, at about 4.6% in 2001. In 2011, the unemployment rate of the city of Milan was recorded to be 5.8%, which is much lower than the entire nation of Italy's unemployment rate being at 8.4% in that year. Today, the unemployment rate in all of Europe is much higher, and in January 2014, the unemployment rate in Italy rose to 12.9% from 12.7% from December, which was the highest growth since 1977 in the nation, the entire nation was affected by this job loss and growth in rate of unemployment. Fashion Fashion Week 2013 Since 2009, Milan is regarded as the world fashion capital, or formally \\"Capital of Fashion Capitals,\\" ruling New York, Paris, Rome and London. Most of the major Italian fashion brands, including Valentino, Gucci, Versace, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana, are currently headquartered in the city. Milan also hosts a fashion week twice a year, just like other international centres such as Paris, London, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles and Rome. Italian Ready-to-Wear has grown tremendously in Milan, in addition to the Fashion industry on a general note. Many economists don’t pay a great deal attention to the fashion sector of the business in Milan. However, there is a great deal of quantitative weight being held by the fashion industry in terms of the economy of Milan, yet not much research has been conducted by historians or economists. The industrial center of Milan had been creating textiles and clothing for centuries, but it became an international superstar of fashion in 1970, and a leading international fashion hub or center.Turning Fashion into Business: The Emergence of Milan as an International Fashion Hub, Elisabetta Merlo and Francesca Polese, The Business History Review, Vol. 80, No. 3 (Autumn, 2006), pp. 415-447 Companies in Milan Milan is home to many of Italy's major corporations, and 27 of the world's 100 largest companies, including Italy's largest bank (UniCredit) and the world's biggest eyewear company (Luxottica) are headquartered in the Lombard metropolis. Other major Milan-based corporations and banks include Luxottica, Borsa Italiana, Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM), Intesa Sanpaolo, Banca Popolare di Milano, Vodafone Italy, Odeon TV, Fininvest, Edison, Esselunga, FinecoBank, Versace, Gucci, La Rinascente, OVS, Alfa Romeo, Prada, Etro, Pirelli, Compagnia Generale di Elettricità, 10 Corso Como, Valentino, Armani, Missoni, Moschino, Telelombardia, RCS MediaGroup, Anfatis SpA and BBPR.http://expo- magazine.com/inside.asp?p=566 ) Tourism The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is one of Milan's most popular tourist attractions. Milan is one of EU's most important tourist destinations; with 1.902 million arrivals in 2007 and 1.914 million in 2008, it places itself 42nd and 52nd respectively, most visited city in the world. According to a particular source, 56% of international visitors to Milan are from Europe, whilst 44% of the city's tourists are Italian, and 56% are from abroad. The most important European Union markets are the United Kingdom (16%), Germany (9%) and France (6%). According to a study, most of the visitors who come from the USA to the city go on business matters, whilst Chinese and Japanese tourists mainly take up the leisure segment. The city boasts several popular tourist attractions, such as the city's Duomo and Piazza, the Teatro alla Scala, the San Siro Stadium, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the Castello Sforzesco, the Pinacoteca di Brera and the Via Montenapoleone. Most tourists visit sights such as Milan Cathedral, the Castello Sforzesco and the Teatro alla Scala, however, other main sights such as the Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio, the Navigli and the Brera district are less visited and prove to be less popular. Results from the same study also say that 60% of tourists who visit Milan are male, whilst 40% are female. Over 58% of visitors travel by air, and 26% by car. The city also has numerous hotels, including the ultra-luxurious Town House Galleria, which is the world's first seven-star hotel according to Société Générale de Surveillance (five-star superior luxury according to state law, however) and one of The Leading Hotels of the World. The average stay for a tourist in the city is of 3.43 nights, whilst foreigners stay for longer periods of time, 77% of which stay for a 2-5 night average. Green economy In addition to Milan being regarded as one of the major fashion capitals of the world, being home to many services, banks, and industries, the city has also become important to the world of environmental matters and energy issues. It is home to about 350 companies that are active in areas of interest such as, water, energy efficiency, air, external noises, energy from renewable sources and hydrogen. In addition, the metropolitan city holds some of these companies that have components of research and development (about 30% of the companies) and is one of the most active areas in terms of patents for energy efficiency In fact, in July 2014, the city of Milan hosted the first meeting of the European Employment and Environmental Ministers. Milan, looking to create new jobs for the nation with a rising unemployment rate, and have many of these jobs be in the environmental sector, such as those employment areas being linked to renewable energy, energy efficiency, development of green infrastructure, as well as waste reduction.

History The church is dedicated to John the Baptist, the patron saint of Gouda, and was built during the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1552 a large part of the church burned, including the archives. Most information of the early period is taken from the diaries of Ignatius Walvis. Around 1350 a tower was built (only the lower part remains). In 1485 the foundation was built for the present-day choir. This expansion made the church the longest in the Netherlands, with a length of 123 meters. The stained glass windows were made and installed primarily by the brothers Dirk and Wouter Crabeth I, in the years 1555-1571, and after a short stop for the Protestant Reformation, until 1603. During the Reformation the church was spared, because the city fathers sided with the reigning king Philip II of Spain, rather than William the Silent, representing the Orange rebels. Later, after the orangists conquered the northern half of Holland, Gouda reverted to Orange in 1572. It was only during this period that the church was in danger, and three weeks later an angry mob stormed the church and plundered the contents, but left the windows intact. The church was closed, but many wealthy regents of the city attempted to have it reopened. In 1573 the Gouda council prohibited the practice of Roman Catholic religion and in the summer it was opened for the Protestant Dutch Reformed faith, which it still has today. In 1954 the Van der Vorm chapel was added to house the 7 regulierenglazen from the Monastery of the Clerks Regular (Regulierenklooster) in Gouda. In earlier days this Monastery, in which Erasmus lived from 1486-1491, was located in the land van Stein (in the neighborhood of Gouda). Relocation to Gouda, in 1551, was necessary for safety reasons. The 7 panes were in that period (1556-1559) designed and placed in the monastery chapel. When the monastery was demolished in 1580 the panes were moved to the Sint Janskerk. They were initially placed in positions 20 and 21. After restoration they were moved to the newly build Van der Vorm chapel. In 1939 the stained glass was removed in anticipation of war with Germany. Later during the war, in 1944, when 51,000 men were called for service from Schiedam and Rotterdam, about 2800 were marched to Gouda, where they spent the night in this church on November 10. The church tower contains an historic carillon, currently played by Boudewijn Zwart and formerly played by Maria Blom from 1943-1985. The carillon was originally installed in 1676, with 37 bells cast by Hemony, of which 16 have survived. In 1966, the Royal Eijsbouts Bell Foundry enlarged the carillon with 33 bells, bringing the total to 50 bells. The carillon also includes a bell cast by Hendrick Wegewaert in 1605.

Ivanov graduated from Lenigrad Airforce Academy in 1959. While at the academy, he came up with the idea of using the recently discovered phenomenon of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance for imaging purposes. In 1959, he filed his first application for Invention Certificate (a patent -like document used in the Soviet Union) titled \\"Free-precession proton microscope\\". Soon afterwards he filed three more applications. The second of his application (filed in March of 1960) comprised a detailed description of the MRI principles, as was confirmed more recently. Originally this application was rejected as \\"unrealizable\\". However, in 1984 an Invention Certificate № 1112266 \\" A method for determination of internal structure of material objects\\" was finally issued in 1984, only after this method was demonstrated in other countries. After leaving the military, Ivanov returned to Leningrad, where he enrolled in Saint Petersburg Electrotechnical University, which he graduated from in 1966 with a PhD in Engineering. In 1967 he became a lab director at \\"Elektroavtomatika\\" design bureau, and in 1969 a lab director at D.I. Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM). In 1980 he received his habilitation, and 1984 he was promoted to the rank of professor at ITMO University. Despite his failure to commercialize his MRI invention, Ivanov continued his career as a prolific inventor. His name is listed on over 100 patents. He was a developer of apparatuses for space, aviation, marine and underground applications. He was the lead designer of two Soviet National standards: of angular velocity and of acceleration. Ivanov was a member of the American Mathematical Society and the International Society of Automation. Ivanov wrote over 300 books and articles, including 3 books of poetry (published in 1991, 1997, and 1999).  Honors  The Nysian asteroid 5991 Ivavladis was named in his honor.

Based in Kimberley, it was while working in the mine compounds that he initially encountered African migrant workers, stimulating an interest in ethnographic subjects. Duggan-Cronin was born on 17 May 1874 in Innishannon, County Cork, Ireland, and died on 25 August 1954 in Kimberley, South Africa.. Background and career Born in Ireland, Duggan-Cronin was educated at Mount St Mary's College in Derbyshire, England. Giving up an original goal of becoming a Jesuit priest, he went to South Africa in 1897, taking a job with De Beers Consolidated Mines in Kimberley, where he served as a security officer in one of the mine 'native compounds'. His daily interaction with the men who worked in the mines was undoubtedly influential when he later developed an interest in photographic portraiture and documentation. He worked for De Beers until his retirement in 1932.Robert Hart The McGregor Museum's Photographic Collections with a special emphasis on the historic negatives. In 1904 Duggan- Cronin bought himself a simple box camera, while on a return visit to Britain, and his first photograph was of a swan house on Madeira. He honed his photographic skill taking still-life pictures of flowers, and animal studies including images of poultry and horses. He documented holidays to the Cape, Johannesburg and Bulawayo in the period 1906 to 1914, also compiling albums from trips in Europe. Important series include portraits of Kimberley personalities and, later, of visitors to the Duggan-Cronin Gallery. Geological photographs by Duggan-Cronin were commissioned for De Beers, while a significant contribution was his documentation of rock engravings, published as plates in Maria Wilman's 1933 book on the rock art of Griqualand West. During World War I, Duggan-Cronin took part in campaigns in German South West Africa and in East Africa, generating a photographic record of these events. Duggan-Cronin embarked on the first of his major ethnographic endeavours in 1919 when he went to the Langeberg to photograph the San people living there – the first of many expeditions into Kimberley's Southern African hinterland. Between the world wars he travelled some 128 000 kilometres, making at least 18 expeditions to photograph the peoples of southern Africa. He was accompanied by his Mfengu assistant, Richard Madela, on some of these expeditions. A significant number of his photographs were published in The Bantu Tribes of South Africa: Reproductions of Photographic Studies by A.M. Duggan-Cronin, eleven volumes of which appeared under the imprint of the McGregor Memorial Museum, Kimberley, between 1928 and 1954. In 1925 he opened his first 'Bantu Gallery' at his home on Kimberley's outskirts, his collection of some 8,000 photographs and ethnographic objects being more permanently housed at what was named the Duggan-Cronin Bantu Gallery at The Lodge in Kimberley from the late 1930s.Hart, Robert. 2007. \\"Alfred Martin Duggan- Cronin\\".

To date they have released four albums on the UK label Real World Records. History The band was formed in 1993 by violinist and composer Jane Harbour, whose classical and electronica influences met with the punk influences of Vann and Hunt. Their early experiments centred around reworking traditional folk tunes, particularly those of the North of England, but Harbour's growing fascination with minimalist systems began to impact on the group and were evident by the time of the independently released Pole Star (1997), which fused both influences. The album was critically well received, and the band continued to play live, including writing and performing for theatre. However no further albums were released until the BBC's use of several Pole Star tracks brought them to the attention of manager Alan James and Real World Records, for whom they have recorded three further studio albums, Lightbox (2009), Kaleidophonica (2012) and Welcome Joy and Welcome Sorrow (2015). The latter two in particular largely feature original melodies and more intricate composition.Review of Kaleidophonica by Colin Irwin. BBC website, 2012. Real World also re-released Pole Star (2014), a vinyl-only compilation album Repeater (2016) and a mini- album, The Vapourer (2013), with live recordings by the group and Moog versions of two of their compositions by Portishead's Adrian Utley.

It was established at 977 °F (525 °C, 798 K) by John William Draper in 1847. Bodies at temperatures just below the Draper point radiate primarily in the infrared range and emit negligible visible light. The value of the Draper point can be calculated using Wien's displacement law: the peak frequency u_\\\\text{peak} (in hertz) emitted by a blackbody relates to temperature as follows: u_\\\\text{peak} = 2.821 \\\\frac{kT}{h}, where *k is Boltzmann's constant, *h is Planck's constant, *T is temperature (in kelvins). Substituting the Draper point into this equation produces a frequency of 83 THz, or a wavelength of 3.6 μm, which is well into the infrared and completely invisible to the human eye. However, the leading edge of the blackbody radiation curve extends, at a small fraction of peak intensity, to the near-infrared and far-red (approximately the range 0.7–1 μm), which are weakly visible as a dull red. According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, a black body at the Draper point emits 23 kW of radiation per square metre, almost exclusively infrared.

Founding and philosophy Sodeisha was formed in 1948. Its principal founder was Yagi Kazuo (1918–1979). Its leaders were Yamada Hikaru (born 1924) and Suzuki Osamu (born 1926). Sodeisha was formed in opposition to the Mingei or folk-craft movement that was the dominant ceramic style and philosophy in Japan at the time, exemplified by Shoji Hamada (1894–1978), and also in reaction to the aesthetic of rusticity associated with the tea ceremony inspired Shino and Bizen ceramics of the Momoyama Revival pottery of artists such as Kaneshige Toyo and Arakawa Toyozu. Sodeisha was disbanded in 1988. In 1948 the Sodeisha artists mailed out postcards with their 'motto' or artistic credo: > \\"The postwar art world needed the expediency of creating associations in > order to escape from personal confusion, but today, finally, that > provisional role appears to have ended. The birds of dawn taking flight out > of the forest of falsehood now discover their reflections only in the spring > of truth. We are united not to provide a ‘warm bed of dreams’, but to come > to terms with our existence in broad daylight\\". In an article written for The Japan Times, Robert Yellin wrote of the Sodeisha philosophy that: > \\"They had as their unwritten laws that they would not submit work to > official exhibitions, to avoid being judged on others criteria, and not to > copy antique wares of the past. That was the basic credo, quite bold and > naive. A major hurdle in the beginning, believe it or not, was whether or > not the mouth of a work should be closed or not-if left open it gives the > feeling of a common vessel, and thus to close it was the only way to have it > taken seriously as ceramic sculptural art\\". Style Their work was characterized by biomorphic and slab-built geometric forms. An emphasis on the sculptural as opposed to the functional meant that typically their pieces didn't have holes, or 'mouths', that might allow the work in question to be seen as a vase or pot. In the late 1940s and early 1950s the works of Klee, Miro and Picasso were an influence on members of the group, as were the ceramics produced by Isamu Noguchi in the studio of Rosanjin in 1952.Winther-Tamaki,p130 Influence Two notable artists in the Sodeisha mold are Akiyama Yo (1953- ) and Takiguchi Kazuo (1953- ), both prize-winning ceramists and former students of Yagi Kazuo.

An express passenger train ran into a goods train that was shunting; 11 people lost their lives immediately, and one further person succumbed later. The cause was a failure to communicate between the station master in charge of the shunting operation, and the signalman. There was not full interlocking of the points, and the block system of signalling was not in use.Captain H W Tyler, Report to the Secretary of the Board of Trade, 4 October 1872 The location was very close to the point where the present-day A74(M) road crosses the line. Description A magazine graphic of the scene after the collision; the view is looking south and the relevant sidings are not shown properly; the signal box is behind the artist and the Solway Junction line and platforms are off the frame to the right.Kirtlebridge station was nearly 17 miles (27 km) north of Carlisle, on the Caledonian Railway main line to Glasgow and Edinburgh. North of the passenger platforms there was a trailing (in the northbound direction) junction from the Solway Junction Railway, and a signalbox controlled the junction; the points there were interlocked with the signals. South of the station there were sidings on both sides of the main line, and a crossover, but these points were not controlled by the signalbox, being operated by ground levers, and not interlocked, nor protected by the home signal.The crossover was between south of the signal box, and the home signal south of it, so that an approaching train running up to the home signal would pass the location of the crossover. The block system was not in operation, and communication with adjacent locations was limited. The line may be considered to run south to north at Kirtlebridge, the down direction being northwards. Down sidings were on the west of the line and up sidings on the east. Kirtlebridge collision locationAt 07:55 on 2 October 1872 a down goods train arrived at the station and started shunting operations; there were several wagons to be dropped off and collected from sidings both sides of the main line. The work was under the control of the Station Master, and he authorised the operation of a crossover that gave the goods train access to cross the main line. An express passenger train had left London at 21:00 the previous evening, and it left Carlisle station at 07:50. It consisted of 18 vehicles pulled by two locomotives. Running at about 40 mph (65 km/h) under clear signals, the passenger train ran into wagons of the goods train that were fouling the down line. The collision took place at 08:13.The Times newspaper, 3 October 1872, London; the booking office clock was stopped at this time, apparently by the concussion of the collision.The Illustrated London News (periodical), 12 October 1827 The goods train The goods train had left Carlisle at 06:55 and made calls at Floriston, Gretna and Kirkpatrick stations, arriving at Kirtlebridge at 07:55. At Gretna the driver had been informed that the following passenger train had not left Carlisle at 07:27. On arrival at Kirtlebridge, the train crossed to the up line and detached a brake van and three wagons, and left them on the running line. The engine and part train returned to the down line and entered the down sidings, dropping two wagons there. It then returned to the up line and recoupled the detached wagons, and entered the up siding. The accommodation was very cramped and full, and the engine now drew 17 wagons from the siding to make space, and then propelled them forward on the up line and partly through the crossover towards the down line so that the rear of the movement would clear the up line siding points. It was the intention to move the last (southernmost) wagon by hand into the up siding. At this moment the down express passenger train approached and struck the middle wagons of the seventeen being propelled. The passenger train The passenger train was the 06:00 from Carlisle, the continuation of the 21:00 from London Euston. Due to an unrelated accident south of Carlisle, it was running late and left Carlisle at 07:50. It consisted of two tender engines and 18 trailing vehicles.Tyler's contemporary report gives the consist as \\"a break-van, a composite, a third-class, a composite, a third-class, and a composite carriages, two empty carriage- trucks, an empty horse-box, a family saloon carriage, a composite, a third- class, and a composite carriages, a break-van, a composite, a third-class, and a composite carriages, and a break-van.\\" (Tyler's spelling retained.) It made its journey in the ordinary way and passed Kirtlebridge distant signal at \\"clear\\" but on rounding the right-hand curve past an overbridge, the fireman of the leading engine saw the wagons of the goods train partly obstructing the line ahead. He thought he said to the driver, \\"Pull up!\\" but the train was running at 40 mph (65 km/h) and the train was only a short distance from the obstruction; the collision followed inevitably. The leading engine came to rest across the up line, and was turned so as to face south. Its tender mounted the platform, and the second engine came to rest in its proper alignment. The rails were \\"torn away\\" by the first engine and the coaching vehicles were considerably telescoped as they overran the derailed engine.The coaching stock of the period consisted of a strong underframe surmounted by a relatively light body framework. In the event of collision, it frequently happened that the underframe of one vehicle overrode the underframe of the preceding vehicle and slid along it, destroying the body of the latter and causing serious injury to any occupants. The process is referred to as \\"telescoping\\". Of the fatalities, several persons died instantly, but many of the injured died \\"within an hour of the accident, or on their being taken out of the débris\\". Tyler reported that the engine driver and ten passengers were killed, and fifteen injured. One further person died of injuries after Tyler made his report. The signal box The signal box was located to the north of the passenger platforms, and controlled the junction with the Solway line. The down main line home signal was at the converging junction there, and there was a down main line distant signal on the approach side. There were several sidings in the Solway part of the station, controlled from the signal box, but the sidings in the main line were located south of the station and were not operated from the signal box; moreover they were on the approach side of the home signal. Although the electric telegraph system of signalling had been installed on the Solway line, there was no block system on the main line and the signalman had no means of communicating with other main line signalboxes. The signalman did not have a clear view of the siding connections. The system of work Kirtlebridge collision planIt is evident that there was no safe system of work in force. The signalman operated his main line signals independently of the operation of the siding and crossover points. The station master, named Corrie, was nominally responsible for the shunting arrangements, but he seems to have limited this to directing what wagons were to be taken on rather than working with the signalman. He was apparently oblivious of the need to consider the approaching express train. Tyler commented: > During these shunting operations, the goods-engine driver took his > instructions from the goods guard, but the latter was acting principally on > his own responsibility. The only communication, according to the guard, that > passed between him and any person at the station was shortly after his > arrival, when the station-master asked him what he was shunting for, and he > replied, \\"The 6.00 a.m. passenger train from Carlisle\\". > The signalman on duty in the cabin at the north of the station saw the goods > train arrive at 7.55, and immediately set his home and distant-signals to > danger to protect it. He noticed that this train was shunted from the down > to the up line, but it was done without any communication with him. In 1872 modern notions of a safe system of work did not exist, and the management of the Caledonian Railway evidently thought it adequate to rely on the common sense of the local staff. The station master set about ordering shunting movements fouling the main lines without any liaison with the signalman, and it is clear that this had become a routine method of working, relying on assumptions about the running of other trains. Normally the express passenger train would have passed Kirtlebridge well before the goods train required to shunt. On this occasion the delay to it earlier in its journey meant that the unsafe working led to tragedy.L T C Rolt and Geoffrey Kichenside, Red for Danger, 1982 (4th edition), David & Charles, Newton Abbot, , pages 63 and 64 The aftermath The site of the collision was clearly a scene of death and injury. \\"A large staff of medical men were telegraphed for\\" and a doctor and a nurse on the train did much to alleviate immediate suffering. Train working was over the Glasgow and South Western Railway route via Dumfries and then the Dumfries to Lockerbie branch line, for the remainder of the day.The Times newspaper, 3 October 1872 The station master Corrie was arrested and charged with culpable homicide (i.e. manslaughter), although he was reported to have been released on bail by 7 October. The inspector of permanent way, Gilmour, was then sought by the police on a charge of murder allegedly committed at Shotts the day before the accident.The Times newspaper, 7 October 1872. At this time the Railway Inspectorate section of the Board of Trade were pursuing a policy of urging the railway companies to fit interlocking and the block system on their lines; Tyler repeated this insistence in his report. Proper interlocking would have prevented the clearing of the main signals when the crossover was open; a block system would have given the signalman the means of ascertaining the approach of trains, and the means of refusing the approach if his station was blocked by shunting operations. The Times newspaper also demanded the introduction of improved couplings and buffing gear between the coaches so as to reduce the risk of telescoping.

Early life and education  DiGeorge was the son of two Italian immigrants, Antonio DiGiorgio and his wife Emilia (née Taraborelli). He was born in South Philadelphia on April 15, 1921. His teacher at primary school changed his Italian surname DiGiorgio into the \\"American\\" DiGeorge. He graduated at the top of his class from South Philadelphia High School for Boys in 1939 and was awarded the competitive White Williams Scholarship at the Temple University, where he graduated with distinction in chemistry in 1943. DiGeorge received his medical degree with honors from Temple University School of Medicine in 1946, and completed his internship at Temple University Hospital. He then left Philadelphia from 1947 to 1949 to serve as Captain and Chief of the Medical Service for the U.S. Army 124th Station Hospital in Linz, Austria. After returning to Philadelphia, Angelo met his future wife, Natalie Picarello, who was a registered nurse at Temple Hospital. He completed his pediatric residency at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children and did a postdoctoral fellowship in endocrinology at the Jefferson Medical College in 1954.  Academic career  DiGeorge joined the Department of Pediatrics of Temple University School of Medicine in 1952. In 1967, he became a Professor of Pediatrics and an Emeritus Professor in 1991. Concurrently, he was also an attending physician at St. Christopher's, where he became the Chief of Endocrinology and Metabolism (1961–1989), and the Director of the Pediatric Clinical Research Center (1965–1982). He served on the Pediatric Endocrinology Subboard of the American Board of Pediatrics from 1987 until 1992. He was a founding member and past president (1983–1984) of the Lawson-Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society and was the primary author of the endocrinology chapter for the Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, known by pediatricians around the world as the \\"Green Bible\\" for more than 40 years. DiGeorge first gained international recognition in the mid-1960s for his ground breaking discovery of a disorder characterized by congenital absence of the thymus and associated abnormalities. This birth defect is now referred to as DiGeorge syndrome; alternate names include Velocardiofacial syndrome, Shprintzen Syndrome, and chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (the majority of affected individuals lack a distinct part of the long arm of chromosome 22). DiGeorge syndrome includes a pattern of more than 200 different defects, including hypoplastic thymus and parathyroid glands, conotruncal heart defects, and a characteristic facial appearance. Velocardiofacial syndrome is marked by the association of congenital conotruncal heart defects, cleft palate or velar insufficiency, facial anomalies, and learning difficulties. It is now accepted that these two syndromes represent the different expression of a unique disorder manifesting at different stages of life. DiGeorge Syndrome is one of the most common genetic disorders known, occurring in about one every 4,000 livebirths. DiGeorge's original 1965 reportA comment on another paper, and the initial paperDiGeorge AM. Congenital absence of the thymus and its immunologic consequences: concurrence with congenital hypoparathyroidism. IV(1). White Plains, NY: March of Dimes-Birth Defects Foundation; 1968:116-21 reporting on this anomaly have been widely quoted and continues to garner citations. On a personal level, he was described as a compassionate physician who viewed the patient as a whole person, a superb diagnostician, a keen observer, a great teacher, a masterful lecturer, an absorbing storyteller, an avid reader, a literary writer, and above all, a kind-hearted, fair-minded person. In addition to medicine, he had many other hobbies, including gardening, all of the performing arts, politics, stamp collecting, and Philadelphia sports, especially the Phillies. Dr. DiGeorge loved all things \\"Philly\\" and all things Italian. He first learned the art of debate on the debate team at South Philadelphia High School for Boys and he gladly engaged in animated debates on virtually any topic from sports to politics with his professional colleagues and at the family dinner table throughout his life. Dr Angelo DiGeorge was often invited to Italian scientific meetings, including the San Giovanni Rotondo Medical Genetic School and the Rome \\"Deletion 22q11\\" Meeting in 2002. It Rome, Angelo DiGeorge and Bob Shprintzen, the fathers of a unique disorder, met for the first time (see photo), although they had long been working on the same syndrome, living close to one another in the United States.

Biography Benkei was born in 1923 into a poor day labourer family. After finishing four elementary classes, he worked as a manual worker (engine fitter assistant, then tobacco fermenter) in Nyíregyháza. From August 1944, he served in the Royal Hungarian Army during the Second World War and was captured on the Eastern Front and deported to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war in January 1945. He returned to Hungary in July 1948, and soon he involved in the tobacco fermenting trade union. He joined Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP), the ruling Communist party in 1950. He held several functions at party and trade union's organizations. He functioned as secretary of the Szabolcs- Szatmár-Bereg County committee of the Food Industry Workers' Union. From April 1954 to November 1956, he was the leader of the MDP in Nyíregyháza. Following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he served as First Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party's Szabolcs-Szatmár County branch between November 1956 and 7 December 1963. After that he was appointed Minister of the Interior in the Second Cabinet of János Kádár. Despite the lack of professional qualifications, Benkei held the office for 16 and a half years, until 27 June 1980. Thus he is the longest-serving Interior Minister since the establishment of the ministry during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Benkei was one of the most faithful supporters of General Secretary and Prime Minister János Kádár. He studied for a year at the MSZMP's Party College. Beside his government position, Benkei was also a member of the Socialist Workers' Party's Central Committee from 25 December 1959 to 28 March 1985. Benkei was also a Member of Parliament three times (1958–1967, 1971–1975, 1980–1985), representing Szabolcs-Szatmár county list, Nyíregyháza (Constituency II) and the second district of Budapest (Budapest Constituency III), respectively. He became a pensioner in 1980. Personal life According to historians Tabajdi–Ungváry's Az elhallgatott múlt work, for most of his life, Benkei became a drunkard.Tabajdi Gábor – Ungváry Krisztián: Az elhallgatott múlt – A pártállam és a belügy, Corvina Kiadó, 2008, József Végvári, an intelligence officer within the secret services, who allowed the infiltration of the case Duna-gate, said that both Benkei's son in law (Tamás Augusztini and Zoltán Nyitrai), and his daughter worked as a counterespionage officer in the III./II. section of the Ministry for Interior prior to 1989.MTI: Bemutatkozott a magyar Watergate-ügy kulcsfigurája (1990) References External links * Rulers.org Category:1923 births Category:1991 deaths Category:People from Nyíregyháza Category:Members of the Hungarian Working People's Party Category:Members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Category:Hungarian Interior Ministers Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1958–1963) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1963–1967) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1971–1975) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1980–1985) ","title":"András Benkei"},{"id":"24724833","text":"Domnei or donnoi is an Old Provençal term meaning the attitude of chivalrous devotion of a knight to his Lady, which was mainly a non-physical and non- marital relationship. \\"The Accolade\\" by Edmund Blair Leighton, painted in 1901, clearly expresses the concept of Domnei Principles This type of relationship was highly ritualized and complex but was generally considered to be non-physical. In discussing the history of Provençal Poetry (Occitan literature), Claude Charles Fauriel asserts: \\"He who wants to fully possess his lady knows nothing of 'donnoi'.\\"Fauriel, C. Histoire de la Poesie provencale. Paris, 1846. Guilhem de Montanhagol (1233–1268), a Provençal troubadour, declared: \\"E d'amor mou castitaz\\", or, \\"From love comes chastity\\". The chevalier's devotion to his lady functioned by his servitude to her both in terms of his code of conduct and courtly duties. Chivalry as a code, as indicated by the concepts of courtly love and the quality of Domnei, necessitated in theory as in practice a level of devotion to the lady, or high mistress, that went beyond mere professionalism and graciousness in etiquette. Truth and honesty were core virtues, and therefore, a knight's actions were to stem from honorable intentions, sincere motives, and purity of heart. Therefore, in matters of the heart, courtly love wasn't always plausibly separable or indistinguishable from romantic love. However, by Eros, by Cupid's arrow, the object of a knight's affections may have resided elsewhere outside of his formal duties to his lady. In some instances, the lady was chosen, as in assigned to a knight by happenstance, whereby direct interaction may have been unlikely. As a princesse lointaine, she may have lived in a far away castle by which the chevalier could never, and would never have the chance to know her. Despite the confines of romantic impossibility, obligations of courtly love and Domnei were to persevere out of a chivalrous sense of loyalty and devotion for a knight to his lady. Realities as they were, such as unrequited love as an example, often provided the basis for contributing to many tales of love and legend in Medieval Literature and Medieval poetry. Other modern usage The Cabell book In modern times, the term \\"Domnei\\" is especially known for its usage in the title and plot of Domnei: A Comedy of Woman-Worship, a 1913 fantasy novel by James Branch Cabell, which is set in the imaginary French province of Poictesme during the second half of the thirteenth century.In The Lineage of Lichfield Cabell fixed the period covered by the novel as August 1256 to July 1274. See James Branch Cabell The Cream of the Jest, The Lineage of Lichfield: Two Comedies of Evasion (London: Pan/Ballantine, 1972) p. 265. The Gallico book In Paul Gallico's novel Adventures of Hiram Holliday the protagonist is a twentieth century American consciously seeking to model himself on the Medieval knights of romantic literature and to live by the Code of Chivalry in modern society. Domnei-style woman-worship is offered to an exiled Habsburg princess who he saves from Nazi agents and with whom he falls in love.

Biography Saylor was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. In 1952, his family moved to Springfield Township, just outside the city, where he attended suburban public schools. Active as a musician in high school, he played, sang, and conducted. During this time, Saylor also functioned as the organist and choirmaster of a small Anglo-Catholic parish in the city. He attended the Juilliard School of Music from 1964 to 1969, where he studied composition with Hugo Weisgall and Roger Sessions. From 1969 to 1970, he studied with Goffredo Petrassi at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome under a Fulbright fellowship. He received his PhD in 1978 from the City University of New York Graduate Center, where he studied composition with Weisgall and George Perle, and theory with Felix Salzer. Saylor won numerous prizes and scholarships during his years at Juilliard as both a student and a teaching fellow there. In 1970, he began teaching at Queens College. From 1976 to 1979, he taught at New York University, then was appointed a Mellon Foundation professor at Queens. He has won fellowships and awards from the National Society of Arts and Letters, the American Academy of Arts and Letters (Charles E. Ives Scholarship and Music Award), the Ingram Merrill Foundation and the Guggenheim Foundation. As of 2012, he is a professor at the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens as well as at the City University of New York Graduate Center in Manhattan. Works Saylor’s musical idiom evolved from highly dissonant neo-classicism, though dense chromaticism, to a more streamlined harmonic language. Though he has written instrumental works such as Turns and Mordents for flute and orchestra, Notturno for piano and orchestra, Archangel for large orchestra, Cantilena for strings, and much chamber music, Saylor’s vocal music dominates his output. His two-act opera Orpheus Descending was premiered in 1994 at end of his stint as composer-in-residence at Lyric Opera of Chicago. J. D. McClatchy fashioned the libretto from the Tennessee Williams play. He has also written two one-act operas: My Kinsman, Major Molineux, after Nathaniel Hawthorne, and The Scrimshaw Violin, after the story of Jonathan Levi. The poetry of James Merrill has inspired Songs from Water Street, Five Old Favorites, incidental music for live readings of Voices From Sandover, and instrumental music as well. His vocal chamber music has most often been performed and recorded by his wife, the mezzo-soprano Constance Beavon, who created Saylor's monodrama It Had Wings, a story by Allan Gurganus. Saylor has written ten substantial pieces for chorus and orchestra, among them The Idea of Us and The Book in Your Hearts (both to texts by J. D. McClatchy), The Star Song (Robert Herrick), Dreams (slave narratives and spirituals), and Proud Music of the Storm (Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson). He has written several elaborate scores for Nine Circles Chamber Theater, among them The Inferno of Dante and Falling Bodies. He has also been composer in residence at The Yard, an artists’ colony for dancers and choreographers on Martha's Vineyard. Additionally, Saylor has composed numerous works for religious or ceremonial occasions in a tonal idiom: O Freedom! for President Bill Clinton’s Second Inaugural, Grand Central for the rededication of Grand Central Terminal, Fanfares and Echoes for the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, In Praise of Jerusalem (Psalm 122) for Pope John Paul II’s visit to New York City, two Christmas recordings for soprano Jessye Norman, and concert arrangements of sacred music by Duke Ellington for Norman’s Honor! festival for Carnegie Hall in 2009. Saylor has written dozens of anthems, hymn tunes, and service music for church and concert use.

It depicts a pair of common goldeneye ducks at the moment they are hit by a hunter's shotgun blast as they attempt to take flight. Completed less than two years before his death, it was Homer's last great painting,Cikovsky, 374 and has been the subject of a variety of interpretations regarding its origin, composition and meaning. As with his other late masterworks, it represents a return to the sporting and hunting subjects of Homer's earlier years, and was to be his final engagement with the theme. Its design recalls that of Japanese art, and the composition resembles that of a colored engraving by John James Audubon. Background In May 1908 Homer suffered temporary impairment of his speech and muscular control as the effects of a mild stroke; on June 4 he wrote his brother Charles that \\"I can paint as well as ever. I think my pictures better for having one eye in the pot and one eye up a chimney— a new departure in the art world.\\"Cikovsky, 405 By July 18 he was able to write that he had regained his abilities with the exception of tying \\"my neck tie in the way that I have done for the past 20 years....Every four or five days I try to do it but....it has been of no use.\\"Cooper, 238-239 Although he never completely recovered, Homer was well enough to attempt a major work, and it is probably Right and Left that he referred to in a letter to his brother Charles dated December 8, 1908: \\"I am painting when it is light enough on a most surprising picture\\".Cikovsky, 375Cikovsky, 406 Winslow Homer. A Good Shot, Adirondacks, 1892. Watercolor. National Gallery of Art. With the hunter a distant element and the stricken animal placed in the foreground, this watercolor anticipates the composition of Right and Left.Cooper, 184 Homer's biographers offer varying accounts of the events surrounding both the painting's conception and initial development. Homer's first biographer, William Howe Downes, wrote that the ducks used for the painting had been purchased by the artist for his Thanksgiving dinner; he so admired their plumage that he painted them instead.Cikovsky, 388 Homer's nephew told another of Homer's biographers, Philip Beam, that a friend of the artist named Phineas W. Sprague shot the birds in Prouts Neck that autumn and hung them on Homer's studio door, and the arrangement inspired the painting's design.Cikovsky, 388 Given the goldeneye's taste— Audubon called the duck \\"fishy, and in my opinion unfit for being eaten\\"— insofar as the implication is that the ducks were intended for food, neither story is altogether credible.Cikovsky, 388 Likewise there are different versions regarding Homer's preparatory methods. Downes recounted that Homer took to sea in a boat, accompanied by a man with a double-barreled shotgun, and studied the movements of birds as they were shot.Cikovsky, 388 In Beam's telling, Homer stood atop a cliff at Prouts Neck while his neighbor Will Googins, fired blank charges in his direction from a rowboat offshore.Cikovsky, 388 However, Homer was already familiar with this angle of shotgun blast, having in 1864 painted Defiance, a Civil War subject of a soldier being shot at, and in 1892 A Good Shot, Adirondacks, which shows the puff of distant rifle smoke and a mortally wounded deer hit in the foreground;Cikovsky, 388 the latter especially anticipates the composition and intent of Right and Left.Cooper, 184 Painting For its \\"restrained color and extraordinary composition\\" the painting's debt to Japanese art has been noted by art historians.Cikovsky, 374Gardner, 206Cikovsky, 389 It has been compared to avian subjects by Okyo Maruyama, Hiroshige, and Hokusai, and was included in a major Japonisme exhibition in Paris in 1988.Cikovsky, 389 As well, it resembles John James Audubon's plate Golden-Eye Duck.Cikovsky, 374 John James Audubon, Golden-Eye Duck Against the tradition of birds painted as dead still life objects, Right and Left is unique for its depiction of the very moment of death.Lubbock Despite their rapid movement, the birds are seen as if frozen in a snapshot, and the viewer is literally afforded a bird's eye view, in the line of the hunter's fire. Though the painting represents violent action, its formal aesthetic is that of sharply focused detachment, and has been described by Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr. of the National Gallery of Art as \\"a staggeringly beautiful and almost oriental arrangement of birds--just abstract shapes against bands of the subtlest cream and grey\\".National Gallery of Art The design consists of four horizontal bands of sea and sky which are connected by a series of vertical and diagonal shapes formed by the ducks' bodies— the one at left (male) struggling to ascend, its partner in a similar position but turned 90 degrees, already falling limp— and wave crests.Cooke, 118 Additionally, the birds' webbed feet and beaks and the boat's bow repeat the jagged contours of the waves.Cooke, 118 Half hidden, the hunters occupy an ambiguous position, and it is uncertain whether the line above them denotes the horizon or a fog bank.Cooke, 118 Atop this line is the rim of the sun, depicted as a red sliver.Cooke, 118 At the right is a stray feather which \\"serves as an exclamation point for the whole composition.\\"Cooke, 118 The painting was received by Knoedler & Co. gallery in New York by January 30, 1909, and was described by the gallery as The Golden Eye or Whistler Duck.Cikovsky, 389 According to Downes the painting was initially exhibited without Homer's having titled it, and received its name from a hunter who shouted appreciatively \\"Right and left!\\", the term for a rifleman's accomplishment in taking down two birds in quick succession with a double- barreled shotgun.Cikovsky, 388National Gallery of Art Upon viewing the painting in New York, its first owner, Randal Morgan, asked several questions regarding Homer's intent: he inquired as to the direction of the largest wave, and the cause of the disturbance in the water at the front of the picture, which he believed was the impetus for the ducks' movement to leave their feeding.Cikovsky, 389 The questions were forwarded to the artist, but his reply is unknown. On August 3, 1909 Morgan bought the painting for $5,000, $4,000 of which went to Homer.Cikovsky, 389 Meaning Although it is a painting of a sporting subject, and thus was part of a popular anecdotal tradition, given both the violence of the subject and the fact that it was painted the year before Homer's death, Right and Left has invited metaphysical interpretation.Cikovsky, 389Cikovsky, 374-375 For art historian John Wilmerding, the painting embodied \\"a sense of the momentary and the universal, mortality illuminated by showing these creatures at the juncture of life and death\\".Cikovsky, 389 It represents the summation of Homer's sporting pictures, and presents its subject with an \\"almost testamentary finality\\".Cikovsky, 374 It has also been suggested that in addition to summarizing interests that were lifelong for Homer, as well as referring to the works of previous artists, a modern and ironic meaning may have been intended as well: in 1908 air travel was a novel and transforming human achievement, one fraught with the adventure and danger of flight.Cikovsky, 375 Considering his worldly and pictorial intelligence, it is possible that Homer intended Right and Left as an oblique reference to this aspect of modern life.Cikovsky, 375 Notes References * Cikovsky, Jr., Nicolai; Kelly, Franklin.

The film is about a parents' struggle with the raising of their teenage daughter whose rebellious temperament erupts into violence. Filming took place in Utah.Review Summary The New York Times  Plot  Deena Marten is a 15-year-old who has become a rebel since dating Garret Lexau, another rebellious teen who was suspended from school for hitting a teacher. Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant. Although Cynthia's alcoholic mother advises her daughter to be stricter with Deena, Cynthia does not heed the advice. For example, she tidies Deena's bedroom, a chore which Cynthia has consistently and politely reminded her daughter to do. When Deena discovers what Cynthia has done, she is less than grateful and reacts violently and ends up pushing her mother. Adam, Deena's younger brother notices the impact that Deena's behavior has upon his mother and drinks alcohol in order to forget about the family problems. At one point, Cynthia and Deena's relationship seems to improve, until Cynthia finds out that she has been skipping school. Her confrontation leads to an argument, during which Deena slaps her. Although she admits to Garret that she liked hitting her, Deena later apologizes to her mother, only to ask her to cover for her absence at school. Cynthia agrees to lie for her, but she soon has another setback when she finds out that Deena has been kicked off the swim team at school. Todd, her father, announces that there are going to be changes in the house to put an end to Deena's rebellious behavior. Todd punishes their daughter for her behavior, but Deena gets more rebellious towards them. Todd stipulates that his daughter is not allowed to go out anymore, she has to do all of her chores and cannot miss another day of school. Deena reluctantly agrees, but soon finds ways to do what she wants by lying and being manipulative. Her violent eruptions still continue and after an argument with her father over incomplete homework, she goes as far as slamming the door on his hand breaking one of his fingers, for which he has to go to the hospital. Upset over everything going out of hand, Deena considers committing suicide, but Garret stops her, by convincing her to run away from home to California with him. Meanwhile, Cynthia and Todd have no idea what to do about Deena. When they find out that she has been flunking school and taking drugs, they forbid her from seeing Garret again and threaten to call the police. To their surprise, she responds by threatening to tell the police that Todd tried to rape her. Later, Deena sneaks out again to see Garret, but when he arrives, he reveals he got into a violent confrontation with his mom and a man she brought home, so he decides to leave town immediately and tells Deena to pack up and meet back up with him. As Deena returns home, her father reacts furiously. This leads to Deena hitting her mother with a phone and threatening to stab her father. Afraid, Adam calls the police and has Deena arrested. Although her parents attempt to withdraw the charges, she is put on probation for 6 weeks and she has to visit a therapist. She moves in with her aunt Judith and convinces her that her behavior can be explained by her mother's so-called alcoholism. Cynthia doesn't want Deena to visit a therapist, claiming that she will make a victim out of herself, blaming her for alcoholism and Todd for rape. She constantly argues with Todd over Deena and when she turns to her mother, she gets slapped. Upset, she goes to Judith, confronting Deena with her behavior and blaming Judith for never having thanked her for all she has done for her in the past. Deena runs away and tries to find comfort with Garrett, only to find him cheating on her. Later, Cynthia receives a visit from Judith, who blames her for being just like their alcoholic mother. Cynthia tries to prove that she is a good mother by pointing Adam as an example, but then finds out he is drinking alcohol. She tries to convince Todd to support her, but he makes clear that he thinks that she is drinking too much as well. In the end, the entire family agrees to enroll in therapy. Deena returns home, but is still on probation, having to do 300 hours of community service and attend anger management classes. She ends her plans of going to California with Garret, during which she sees Garret for who he really is when he reacts angrily and nearly slaps her.

History Iniva was founded in 1994 with a remit to address an imbalance in the way culturally diverse artists and curators were being represented in the UK. Funded by Arts Council England and governed by a Board of Trustees, the institute has worked with artists, curators, creative producers, writers and the public to explore and reflect cultural diversity in the visual arts. Rivington Place Iniva and Autograph ABP partnered to build Rivington Place, a five-floor, visual arts centre in East London. The £5 million building was designed by architect David Adjaye and opened to the public on 5 October 2007. It was the first publicly funded, purpose-built international visual arts venue constructed in London since the Hayward Gallery opened more than 40 years earlier. Rivington Place housed two exhibition spaces and the Stuart Hall Library, established by Iniva, as well as art education and seminar rooms - plus the offices of Iniva and Autograph. Until 2008, cultural theorist and sociologist Stuart Hall was chair of Iniva and Autograph ABP (the Association of Black Photographers, also based in Rivington Place).Stuart Hall, 80th birthday bibliography, February 2012. Iniva's first director was Gilane Tawadros, followed in 2005 by international curator Sebastian Lopez, then the curator and cultural historian Dr Gus Casely-Hayford, Tessa Jackson, former chief executive of the Scottish Arts Council, and, from 2015, Melanie Keen, who was a curator at Iniva from 1996-2003, and most recently a senior manager at Arts Council England.Iniva announces its new director Its funding has been greatly reduced in recent years.

They were founded in the early 1990s as part of efforts of protection for Southeast Asian immigrants and refugees from the more numerous American gangs in their localities. According to the FBI, the gang is predominantly Southeast Asian-American, of which Cambodians account for their majority, while Filipinos, Vietnamese and other Southeast Asians comprise sizable numbers. With approximately 2,000 members, many are known to have enlisted in the U.S. military through which some were able to use their position to traffic drugs. According to the FBI's 2009 National Gang Threat Assessment, the Asian Boyz are active in 28 different cities, in 14 different states across the U.S. Their motto is \\"1226\\" which can mean \\"1 Life 2 Live, 26 to Die\\" or \\"1 Life 2 Live, 2 6icc to die\\", and the 1st, 2nd and 26th letters of the alphabet, which spells out ABZ. History In the early 1970s, the Asian Boyz gang was formed. The gang also included other races, like Filipino brothers named Marvin Mercado and Pierre Mercado in Southern California, as part of an effort to protect themselves from the more numerous pre-existing gangs situated in their respective neighborhoods. Controversy lies mostly around the official origin of the gang, as it was a unification of multiple gangs or founding gangsters rather than the formation of one. Their identity also attracts notable controversy, being that the Cambodian sets are notoriously influential and decorated as their own faction of Crips that is, among other things, racially or ethnically distinct. Although the Asian Boyz gang comprise their own identity as an organization, the identity itself is largely interpreted as an umbrella of individual Crip gangs or \\"sets\\"; hence their alternative monikers \\"Asian Crips\\" and \\"Asian Boyz Crip\\". Though the relationships between these individual sets are unclear, the various Southeast Asian members tend to work with people of their own national, ethnic or cultural background. More recent publications (since 2011) have revealed even more information about the gang, notable details include the alliance of a number of gangs based in Long Beach, California referred to as SEAs, an abbreviation of Suicidal Town, Exotic Family City Crip and Asian Boyz. Notable crimes In 1990–1991, Pierre Mercado was responsible for four murders, in an attempt to intimidate other gangs. He fled to the Philippines and remained there for 11 years until he was extradited to the United States in 2012. In 2013, Mercado was sentenced to 218 years to life in prison. In August 1997, the leader of the Asian Boyz Van Nuys set, Sothi Menh, was arrested in Phnom Penh, Cambodia and extradited to the United States after fleeing the country in the preceding January. He was wanted for committing five gang-related murders in the San Fernando Valley in 1995. In September 1998, Asian Boyz members were charged with three murders and five attempted murders. On August 12, 2006, a fight broke out between Asian Bloods and ABZ gang members at a house in Lowell, Massachusetts, where a birthday party was being held. Asian Boyz members left the party and allegedly started throwing bottles and other objects. Billeoum Phan, 14, began firing at the Asian Boyz members. One of the shots hit Asian Boyz member Samnang Oth, killing him. Phan was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to incarceration until the age of 21, with an additional requirement to serve a 5-year probation after his release. In December 2006, three members of the gang were charged with beating a 15-year-old boy named Sang Vu to death in New York. Richie Nguyen, who was 16, was sentenced to 5 to 15 years of prison for manslaughter. Samnang Chou was sentenced to 10 years of prison for second-degree assault. In March 2008, four men followed 24-year-old Vutha Au from Santa Rosa and stopped at a gas station near Jenner, California, where they fatally shot him in public. Quentin Russell, who was age 24 at the time, was the shooter, and Sarith Prak, David Prak, and Preston Khaoone were charged in connection with the murder. All four defendants were convicted and sentenced to life without parole on July 27, 2012.\\"Asian Boyz Gang Members Sentenced to Life without the Possibility of Parole Plus 25 Years to Life for Blind Gas Station Murder\\" , Press release, 27 July 2012, by the Office of the District Attorney, Sonoma County. Retrieved August 13, 2013 In March 2011, founder Marvin Mercado was sentenced to life imprisonment for his mid 1990s murder of eight people. In April 2018, two known Asian Boyz gang members, in Fall River, Massachusetts, fired multiple shots into home of rival gang member. Soon followed by two more drive-bys in rival gang territory. Upper ranking member, Vincent \\"Six Blue\\" Valois, age 27, and new member Damian \\"Peanut\\" Perez, age 16, were charged after a social media video of them and other gang members loading extended magazines and brandishing firearms appeared. This occurred after another known Asian Boy murdered a rival gang member in front of a court house sparking a feud between rival Crip sets. In December 2018, a high-ranking member named Derek Pires was arrested in Fall River, Massachusetts following a shooting that left no injuries. On April 15, 2019, five Asian Boyz and a Santa Monica 17th Street gang member were ambushed by a group of El Monte Flores 13 gang members at an Asian Boyz-run gambling den in Monterey Park, California. A shoot-out occurred, but there were no reported injuries, and a total of nine people were arrested in the days after.  Membership  According to the FBI's 2009 National Gang Threat Assessment, membership is estimated at 1,300-2,000 members. Originally, most members were Cambodian, with a small portion of Filipino members. In the 1980s, the Asian Boyz expanded across the United States. Many factions remained in California, where they are still concentrated. Other factions spread throughout the Midwest and into New England. Factions have their own regional differences, which may include distinctions in culture, identity, structure and ethnic exclusivity. On the West Coast, the Asian Boyz gang colors are blue and navy. These colors are similar to the Crips who the Asian Boyz learned from and were heavily influenced by. While their speech and mannerisms are similar to those of Crips, they are known to dress in the fashion of West Coast trends, dated to the 1980s and 1990s. Younger members are known to dress along with current fashion trends. In the Midwest and on the East Coast, along with blue and navy, the gang also dons forest green, black, and white. Their style of dress leans more towards hip-hop casual. In the Midwest, members are known to be of Hmong, Burmese, Karen Karenni and Thai descent while on the East Coast, specifically in New York, there are a lot more members of Korean and Chinese descent. Asian Boyz gang tattoos include a dragon head with crystal globes, a symbol of high rank and original Status. Also common are Sak Yant tattoos that are supposed to offer power, protection, fortune, charisma and other benefits for the bearer. They are also known to have members in Indiana, Minnesota, New York, Texas, and Massachusetts as well as within the U.S. Armed Forces. Rivalries The Asian Boyz has been in a long conflict with the Wah Ching gang. One of the first shootouts between the two gangs occurred in the 1990s in an El Monte pool hall. An Asian Boyz gang member, Lea Mek, was killed by Wah Ching gang member Chieu Luong Yang. Another shootout between the two gangs occurred in San Marino that led to the deaths of two youths at a San Marino High School graduation party in June. After an investigation by the authorities, police claimed that when the Asian Boyz gang members arrived at the party, they noticed that Wah Ching gang members were there, prompting them to leave and return with weapons. At least nine gang members were arrested, and police seized five weapons from homes searched in conjunction with the arrests. The shootouts between the two gangs were called \\"Summer Madness\\" by the Asian Boyz gang.

The Dibis Dam was constructed between 1960 and 1965 as part of the larger Kirkuk Irrigation Project for the irrigation of 300,000 ha of land.

Her plans are interrupted by a series of events and are further complicated when she hires an Irish innkeeper to take her to her boyfriend in Dublin. Principal photography took place in County Wicklow, Dublin, County Mayo, and County Galway, with filming taking place in and around the Aran Islands, Connemara, Temple Bar, Georgian Dublin, Wicklow National Park, and Olaf Street, Waterford. Leap Year premiered in New York City on January 6, 2010 and was released theatrically on January 8, 2010, by Universal Pictures in the United States and on February 28 by Optimum Releasing in Ireland. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, with many criticising the film’s pacing, plot and limited chemistry between Adams and Goode. Plot Successful real estate stager Anna Brady is frustrated that her cardiologist boyfriend Jeremy Sloane still has not proposed to her after four years. She decides to travel from Boston to Dublin, to propose to him on February 29, leap day, while he is there at a conference. Anna wishes to invoke an Irish tradition, Bachelor's Day, that a man who is proposed to on leap day must accept the proposal. During the flight, a storm diverts the plane to Wales. Anna hires a boat to take her to Cork. The severity of the storm, however, forces her to be put ashore at a small seaside village called Dingle. Anna requests Declan O'Callaghan, a surly Irish innkeeper, to taxi her to Dublin. At first he refuses, but after his tavern is threatened with foreclosure, he agrees to drive her for €500. Along the way, he mocks her belief in a leap year tradition of women proposing to men. A herd of cows blocks the road. Anna steps in cow-dung while attempting to move the animals, and tries to clean her shoes while leaning on Declan's car, which causes it to roll downhill into a stream. Continuing on foot, Anna flags down a van with three travellers who offer her a lift. Ignoring Declan's warning, Anna hands them her luggage. They drive off without her. Anna and Declan make their way on foot to a roadside pub, where they discover the three thieves going through Anna's luggage. Declan fights them and retrieves Anna's bag. While waiting for a train, they ask each other what they would grab if their homes were on fire and they had only 60 seconds to flee. They lose track of time and miss the train. They are forced to stay at a bed & breakfast at Tipperary, where they pretend to be married so that their conservative hosts will allow them to stay. During dinner, when other couples kiss to show their love for each other, Anna and Declan are \\"forced\\" to kiss as well. This stirs feelings that neither had expected. They sleep in the same bed, but do not admit their new feelings for each other. While hitchhiking, Anna and Declan are caught in a hailstorm and take shelter in a nearby church, where a wedding is taking place. They are invited to the reception, where Anna gets drunk. Anna questions her own intentions with Jeremy and realizes that she has feelings for Declan. Just as the two are about to kiss, Anna vomits and passes out. The following day they arrive in Dublin. Declan reveals he was once engaged but his fiancée ran off to Dublin with his mother's claddagh ring and his best friend. Anna suggests that while in Dublin, he should ask for his mother's ring back. When they arrive at the hotel where Jeremy is staying, Jeremy surprises Anna by proposing to her right in the lobby. Seeing that Declan had already walked out of the hotel, she accepts Jeremy's proposal. At their engagement party in Boston, Anna learns that Jeremy proposed because he thought it was the only way to appease the co-op board of the apartment building the couple wanted to move into. Dismayed, Anna pulls the fire alarm and waits, testing the 60-second concept she discussed with Declan earlier. Jeremy retrieves all of their electronic materials and neglects to check for Anna. Anna realizes there is nothing in the apartment that means anything to her, including Jeremy. Meanwhile, in Dublin, Declan retrieves his mother's claddagh ring from his ex-fiancée. Anna returns to the tavern in Dingle, where Declan has pulled together the balance he owed his property owner with the help of the community. She tells him she has broken off her engagement and proposes that they get together, and not make plans. Declan leaves. Thinking she has been rejected, Anna rushes outside to the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea. Declan emerges, revealing that he went out to retrieve his mother's claddagh ring. Declan says he wants to make plans with her, and proposes on the cliffside. Anna happily accepts. They drive away in Declan's car, leaving their destination open to fate.

Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 23% and an average rating of 4.23/10 based on reviews from 138 critics. The site's general consensus is that: \\"Amy Adams is as appealing as ever, but her charms aren't enough to keep Leap Year from succumbing to an overabundance of clichés and an unfunny script'.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score out of 33 out of 100, based on 30 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described Leap Year as a 'full-bore, PG-rated, sweet rom-com'. 'It sticks to the track, makes all the scheduled stops, and bears us triumphantly to the station'. Also, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B- stating that the film could have used more 'pizazz'. A middling review came from The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin, whose C– assessment concludes, \\"The film functions as the cinematic equivalent of a Shamrock Shake: sickeningly, artificially sweet, formulaic, and about as authentically Gaelic as an Irish Spring commercial\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times saw it as 'so witless, charmless, and unimaginative, that it can be described as a movie only in a strictly technical sense'. Richard Roeper gave it a C-, stating that it had a 'Recycled plot, lame sight gags, Leprechaun-like stock Irish characters,' adding that 'The charms of Amy Adams rescue Leap Year from Truly Awful status'. Donald Clarke of The Irish Times gave the film one star out of five, and in a scathing review, described it as 'offensive, reactionary, patronising filth' and cited the film as evidence that 'Hollywood is incapable of seeing the Irish as anything but IRA men or twinkly rural imbeciles'. Paul Whitington of the Irish Independent describes the film as \\"grotesque and insulting paddywhackery\\" and says Goode is out of his depth as he \\"struggle[s] badly with his accent\\". The film's lead actor Matthew Goode admitted 'I just know that there are a lot of people who will say it is the worst film of 2010' and revealed that the main reason he signed on to the film was so that he could work close to home and be able to see his girlfriend and newborn daughter.

Ram Prasad under the Great India Enterprises banner and directed by Krishna Vamsi. It stars Nagarjuna Akkineni, Ramya Krishna, Isha Koppikar in the lead roles and music composed by Sandeep Chowtha. This film is a remake of the Mohanlal-starring Malayalam film Chandralekha, directed by Priyadarshan. It is the second combination of Nagarjuna-Vamsi- Chowtha after Ninne Pelladata. Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt made a special appearance for the first time in a Telugu film. Plot Sitarama Rao alias Seeta (Nagarjuna Akkineni) is a struggling unemployed youth who arrives in Hyderabad to meet his sister (Jhansi) and brother-in-law (Tanikella Bharani), his father has been falsely implicated in a bank fraud and wants to sell his ancestral property to pay towards the litigation, for that he needs his sister's approval, but is rebuked and banished by his brother-in-law. Disillusioned, Seeta seeks out his old school mate Tirupathi (Brahmaji), who is working in a fruit juice vending shop in Hyderabad. Tirupathi himself is a hapless uneducated youth working for his uncle (Rallapalli), who is a treacherous money lender, with a hope to marry his daughter Bangari (Priya). They plan to open a cool drink shop, but need 1.25 lakh Rupees to rent a shop as a prerequisite to getting a bank loan. With no other way in sight, the two of them swindle Tirupathi's uncle out of 1.25 lakh Rupees. Seeta then tries to get the loan sanctioned, but he is rebuffed by a new Bank manager (M. S. Narayana), who had taken charge by then. In a new development, Seeta happens to rescue a woman called Chandrika Varma or 'Chandra' (Ramya Krishnan) after a car accident, hospitalizing her. Chandra is the daughter of a wealthy businessman Varma (Murali Mohan). Seetarama Rao is mistaken by the hospital staff to be her husband Raj Kapoor. Soon her relatives including her father arrive and they too mistake him as Raj Kapoor because no one had ever seen or talked to him. Also, it happened that Chandra was a major client of Seetarama Rao's Bank Manager, who too mistook him for Chandra's husband, and was now eager to please him. Seetarama Rao, who is good at heart, initially intended to reveal the truth to everyone but later decides to masquerade as Raj Kapoor till he gets loan approval from the Bank Manager. Chandra lay bedridden, paralyzed, unable to react but was able to witness all the commotion around her. Some of the relatives of Chandra were never convinced about Seetarama Rao from the outset. To make matters worse for Seeta, enters Lekha (Isha Koppikar), a close friend of Chandra and who is a medical graduate. She had talked to Raj Kapoor on the phone previously and became immediately suspicious about Seeta. The relatives join with Lekha to find out the truth. Lekha and others play cat and mouse with Seeta trying to uncover his veracity, with Seeta staying ahead of the game for a while. Finally, Lekha fortuitously comes to know the real story of Seetarama Rao, but she is moved by his life struggles. In the meantime, Chandra revives from her paralysis, but she too forgives Seetarama Rao for everything; also, she had developed a liking for him. But one of the jealous relatives of Chandra (Pruthvi Raj) manages to expose Seeta before everyone. Then Chandra admits all the truth to everyone. She was not in fact in a car accident, but it was a suicide attempt after her fiancé, the real Raj Kapoor, had betrayed her, and their marriage had never commenced. But she was now in love with Seetarama Rao and hoped to marry him. Chandra recovers fully under the loving care of Seeta and Lekha. But later Chandra discovers that Lekha was already in love with Seetarama Rao and had in fact given way for her as a favor to Chandra's father, to whom Lekha was like a second daughter. Chandra gracefully withdraws from her planned marriage with Seetarama Rao. Finally, Seeta and Lekha are united together with everyone's hearty blessings.

It lies about southeast of Marlborough and south of Hungerford, Berkshire. With few inhabitants, it forms part of the civil parish of Tidcombe and Fosbury, which has a parish meeting.  History  The Iron Age hill fort of Fosbury Camp lies on high ground south of the village. Two estates at Fostesberie were recorded in Domesday Book of 1086, with altogether 14 households. The smaller one was granted for a time to Shaftesbury Abbey and then to the priory at Noyon-sur-Andelle, France (now Charleval, Eure). In 1414 it was granted to the new priory at Sheen, Surrey. Fosbury lay within Savernake Forest until 1330. A small medieval village has disappeared; most of the present buildings are from the 19th century. Fosbury House, northwest of Fosbury, was built around 1800. From 1810 it was the seat of the Bevan banking family, and later was the home of bibliophile Alfred Henry Huth until his death in 1910.  Church  Christ Church The Anglican Christ Church is Grade II* listed. It was built in 1854–56 by S.S. Teulon, declared redundant in 1979, and is now in private ownership. In flint with stone dressings, it has a three-stage tower with an octagonal stair turret. Pevsner writes that, apart from details of the chancel roof, there is \\"little otherwise of Teulon's obstinate originality\\". Teulon also designed the house for the perpetual curate, close to the church and known as Buchan House. In flint with brick decoration, and with stonework matching the church, it too was completed in 1856. Fosbury was anciently a tithing of Tidcombe parish. In 1856, after the consecration of Christ Church, an ecclesiastical district was created for it. The benefice was united with Tidcombe in 1926, although the parishes remained distinct; the incumbent was to live at the Fosbury parsonage. In 1962 the benefice was united with East Grafton. The parish was united with Tidcombe in 1979 and the church was declared redundant; soon after it was sold to the owner of Buchan House.

The term was coined by Hermann Simon. He first used the term as a title of a publication in a scientific German management journal, describing the small, highly specialized world-market leaders in Germany.Simon, Hermann: Hidden Champions: Speerspitze der deutschen Wirtschaft. Wiesbaden: Zeitschrift für Betriebswirtschaft (ZfB) 60(1990)9, P. 876 According to his definition, a company must meet three criteria to be considered a hidden champion:Simon, Hermann: Hidden Champions of the 21st Century : Success Strategies of Unknown World Market Leaders. London: Springer, 2009.- . P. 15. * Number one, two, or three in the global market, or number one on the company's continent, determined by market share * Revenue below $5 billion * Low level of public awareness  Discovering hidden champions  Annual exports 2003-2008 by different countries The first English book about the subject was Hermann Simon's Hidden champions: lessons from 500 of the world's best unknown companies.Simon, Hermann: Hidden champions: lessons from 500 of the world's best unknown companies. Boston (Mass.): Harvard Business School Press, 1996.- . The earlier version, published in German: Simon, Hermann: Die heimlichen Gewinner : die Erfolgsstrategien unbekannter Weltmarktführer. Frankfurt a. M.: Campus, 1996. - . The book explores how Germany was able to consistently be (at the time) the number one exporter in the world. While Germany has global corporations like Volkswagen, Siemens, BASF and Bosch, these organisations are not substantially different from organisations like Ford, GE, DuPont or Visteon. Simon postulates that Germany's strong exports are supported by a large number of midsize firms. These smaller companies are normally known only in their market by their customers and suppliers, and are relatively unknown to the wider public. When these companies are very successful on the international markets they are hidden champions. Simon conducted detailed research on 500 such companies and established a framework to describe them. The framework was also able to identify the main differences and traits common to hidden champions. With this framework in hand it was found that there are hidden champions everywhere around the world, but they are most frequently found in German speaking countries.  Success factors  Most of the hidden champions produce inconspicuous products. In the market for these products they are the top producer in the world. Often, but not always, these companies are family owned. They export most of their products, and so contribute significantly to the current account of their countries, and are more successful than the average. The idea of market leadership means more than counting market share. Leaders as employees need an \\"inner flame\\" to become, and to remain, the number one. Hidden champions normally work in niche markets. For these markets they design unique products, which are produced with a high real net output ratio. They have to accept the risk of being a single product manufacturer. They divide between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" market share. The good is earned by performance and a solid foundation, the bad from price aggression and discounting. One result of working with unique products in niche markets is quite often the need to deal on the global market in order to achieve economies of scale. For this reason, hidden champions feel a strong need to work abroad early in their company's development. Hidden champions also operate extremely close to their customers, and their customers' needs are an important driver for their innovations. On the other hand, customers of hidden champions depend on their products and they cannot easily change their source. This often makes for a high level of co-dependence between the producer and the customer, a result of the one product risk. A lot of the hidden champions established their main product as an innovation and were able to keep this single position in the market, or were at least able to keep a leading position. Their markets are mostly oligopolistic with intense competition. Competitive advantages of hidden champions are rarely because of cost leadership, more because of quality, total cost of ownership, high performance, and consultation close to the customer. They \\"earn\\" their market leadership through performance and not through price aggression. Their high real net output ratio is often achieved by working with proprietary processes which make it hard for competitors to imitate their products. On the other hand, management tasks like finance are often outsourced. It also seems to be evident that to maintain market leadership hidden champions do business on their own, rather than depend on working in cooperation with others. Even sales in countries abroad are often organized from the parent company base. This keeps significant know-how inside, and helps recruit highly qualified staff at a small company. The corporate culture of hidden champions is distinctive. Their values are conservative: hard work, strict selection, intolerance of underperformance, low sickness rates and high employee loyalty — and most are based in smaller towns. Leadership style is authoritarian on strategic issues but participative on operations level. The leaders identify themselves with the company, are focused on their products, and stay for a long time, much longer than is normal in large public corporations. A serious problem for hidden champions, as it is for SMEs in general, is to attract international professionals. Hidden champions need people who are happy to live in a remote location, who are attracted by job content, and who do not care much for a formal and prescribed career path. In Germany the concept of hidden champion is known to some extent, and therefore hidden champions there are able to utilise this label to recruit staff.Venohr, Bernd; Meyer, Klaus E.: The German Miracle Keeps Running : How Germany’s Hidden Champions Stay Ahead in the Global Economy Berlin: Working Paper No. 30, Institute of Management Berlin, Berlin School of Economics, 2007. In 2011, the first \\"Hidden Champions Day\\" was organized by the student initiative bdvb e.V. at the University of Mannheim in order to promote the advantages and opportunities of working for a SME.  Lessons to be learned from hidden champions  Hidden champions provide a best practice example. While a lot of business is local, it can be a goal to become the number one on such a local market. Also large companies may find some interesting lessons about international management. Hidden champions teach that exceptional management means doing small things better than the competitors instead of managing only one great thing. Simplicity in processes and organizational structures is another lesson.

Career Early career Born in Brasília, Distrito Federal, Jéferson debuted as a professional for Brasiliense. He spent four years at the club after being loaned out to Atlético Goianiense. During his short stay with Atlético Goianiense, Jéferson helped the club gain promotion by winning the Campeonato Goiano da Segunda Divisão.http://www.rsssfbrasil.com/tablesfq/go2005l2.htm He later spent time with Guarani, a São Paulo based club, after being transferred to Santo André, where he began the ascent of his playing career and leading the squad to a Campeonato Paulista Série A2 championship and runners-up in the 2008 Campeonato Brasileiro Série B campaign. Vasco da Gama Jéferson's role as a playmaker for Santo André caught the attention of more notable Brazilian clubs, in particular, Vasco da Gama, who signed him a year later in 2009. Early on, he struggled to find his place in the squad, due to the bevy of high caliber midfielders at Vasco da Gama. While with Vasco Jéferson enjoyed his best run of form during the Campeonato Carioca, where he made 32 appearances and scored 5 goals. Avaí After struggling to win a starting role, he was subsequently loaned to Avaí, a Brazilian club based in Florianópolis, in 2010.

He got his start in the mid to late 1960s, playing in local rock bands until going into service with the Air Force in 1971, and returning home around 1974. In the late 1970s, he sent some song demos to John Fahey's West Coast-based Takoma Records, and Fahey, impressed with what he heard, offered Fosson a recording deal. Fosson lost no time in relocating to Los Angeles and began recording, but as bad luck would have it, Takoma was in some difficulty, and the label soon folded. Fahey allowed Fosson to retain the master tapes of the sessions, however. Now located on the West Coast, Fosson met fellow songwriter Edward Tree, and the two began working together, forming the Bum Steers, a country- tinged group, in the late 1980s, eventually being invited to play the Grand Ol' Opry at the request of Porter Wagoner. Fosson's material appeared on several soundtracks through the 1990s. In 2001, he began collaborating with singer-songwriter Lisa O'Kane, who recorded several of his songs, including the No. 1 European single \\"Little Black Cloud\\" and Fosson also began recording a solo project, Jesus on a Greyhound, which was released on New Light Entertainment/Universal. The record drew positive reviews and Fosson was frequently compared to Americana music artists such as Ramblin' Jack Elliot, Joe Ely, John Prine and Guy Clark. The Fahey material finally saw the light of day as The Lost Takoma Sessions from Drag City Records in 2006. His song \\"Another Fine Day\\" was included on Volume 3 of the Imaginational Anthem acoustic guitar compilation from Tompkins Square Records. On June 26, 2012, Tompkins Square released Digging In The Dust, a collection of early home recordings which led to Fosson's signing to Takoma Records. In May 2015, he released kY, a collection of instrumentals inspired by his time growing up in Kentucky and, in July 2017, his final album, Solo Guitar was released on Drag City Records. Death On November 2, 2018, Fosson died of cancer in Catonsville, Maryland.

It was written by Warren Lieberstein and Halsted Sullivan and directed by Reggie Hudlin. It originally aired on NBC on October 29, 2009. The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The cold open of this episode featured a 'haunted warehouse'. During a tour by the children of workers of the building, Michael simulates committing suicide in an attempt to scare the children. NBC have subsequently tried to prevent this being aired in reruns. In this episode, Michael and Jim head off to a meeting and Michael comes back soaked after having fallen in a koi pond. Meanwhile, Pam and Andy, as the two worst salespeople in the branch, have to go cold calling for sales. Synopsis Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) sets up a meeting with a client, who requests that Michael Scott (Steve Carell) come with him. Jim is upset since he wants to be able to do meetings by himself. When they come back from the meeting, Michael is soaked because he fell into a koi pond. When they find out the reason, the rest of the office makes fun of him. Michael responds by holding a sensitivity meeting where he asks everyone to say things they wish were not said about them, and has them write down things they don't want discussed. The meeting does not seem to go anywhere, so Jim ends it. To help, Jim tells Michael that if he mocks himself about what happened, the rest of the office will be less inclined to mock him. Michael does this in front of the office staff; it works, but he gets carried away and rambles into a self-pitying confessional about his loneliness. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) receives a copy of the security tape showcasing Michael's fall. The tape shows that Jim could have stopped Michael from falling into the koi pond, but deliberately stepped out of the way. Jim admits to Michael that he wished he had gone by himself because he wants to be able to do things by himself as a co-manager; Michael's mood is lifted when he realizes that Jim is jealous of his sales skills. Jim then becomes the victim of office mocking, but he and Michael laugh it off later. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) go cold calling to drum up more sales as they have the lowest quarterly sales numbers in the branch. At the first place they go to, the receptionist notices Pam's pregnancy and assumes Andy is the father. Pam reacts to the mistake with alarm, offending Andy. During the next meeting, the client also assumes that Andy is the father, and in an act of revenge Andy harshly mocks the idea, leaving Pam frustrated and costing them any chance at a sale. At the next place they go to, that client also assumes Andy is the father, and this time they play along with it in order to avoid further antagonizing each other and ruining their sales. Andy takes it too far by touching her belly, even kissing it, and indulging in extensive baby talk, but the client says \\"maybe\\" to signing with them. In the car back to the office, Andy admits that he enjoyed pretending to be a father and is unhappy that he is still single. He then admits his attraction to Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), whom Pam expresses indifference about. Sympathizing with Andy, Pam approaches Erin and tries to play matchmaker. However, when Erin responds by praising Andy in even stronger terms, she tries to set them up.

The episode aired on November 22, 2009 on Fox in the United States. In this episode Cleveland Brown celebrates his first Thanksgiving with his new family, including his own parents and Donna's Auntie Momma. Plot Cleveland celebrates Thanksgiving with his new family and his parents, Cookie and LeVar \\"Freight Train\\" Brown. Things become hostile until Donna's Auntie Momma arrives. Cleveland soon discovers that Auntie Momma is a trans woman after he sees her urinating while standing. He tries to tell Donna but refrains because she would be crushed to learn the truth. LeVar becomes smitten with Auntie Momma. Cleveland tries to tell his father about her but refrains, believing it is best that his father find out the hard way. Cleveland also learns from Rallo that he had known all along from sitting on Auntie Momma's lap. When LeVar and Auntie Momma come back down from having sex, they start teasing each other at dinner by subtly acting out their antics with the food. Cleveland becomes so disgusted and surprised that his father did not notice that he vomits all over the table. Meanwhile, Roberta decides to spend a romantic Thanksgiving together with Federline, but Donna refuses to let her. Only Auntie Momma's influence convinces Donna to let her leave. As the couple kiss by a river, Federline's car is stolen by two homeless men. They track the car to a mission where the poor (including Lester's family) are eating, being served by the Bear family. The homeless man who stole the car gives back the keys. Roberta notices the unity around her and realizes that family is more important. She returns home and apologizes to her mother. Later Cleveland confronts Auntie Momma and learns that she is actually Uncle Kevin, who was acting as a strong, female influence for Donna in place of her parents. He disguised his physical sex from LeVar. Since she sees that Cleveland will take good care of Donna, \\"Auntie Momma\\" decides that it is time to leave. Soon after, Cleveland tells his father the truth, causing him to vomit over the front porch before convincing him to reconcile with Cookie. Production The episode also introduces Cleveland's father, Freight Train, who is portrayed by Craig Robinson, Cleveland's mother, Cookie, who is portrayed by Frances Callier, and Auntie Momma, who is portrayed by Kym Whitley. Reception The episode was viewed by 6.32 million people being the third most viewed episode in its time slot. The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff graded the episode a C+, stating \\"It's not a big deal if these shows don't want to do complicated character development (Lord knows Family Guy didn't need it), but Cleveland Show has headed in this direction so often that I was a bit disappointed the episode didn't tie all of this together better\\". \\"A Brown Thanksgiving\\" came under fire from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) after Bil Browning of the LGBT blog The Bilerico Project expressed shock at the organization's lack of response to the portrayal of a transgender character. GLAAD released a statement that it had already been in contact with Fox and the show's producers as \\"part of an ongoing discussion that GLAAD is having with Fox regarding consistent homophobic and transphobic jokes in some of its animated programming. The problematic transgender episode Bilerico points to is one of several instances that the Entertainment Team will be discussing with them, as well as advocating for more fair LGBT inclusion.\\" Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane said \\"It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side.\\" However, in May 2010 MacFarlane again drew GLAAD's ire when, in the Family Guy episode \\"Quagmire's Dad\\", another character (Brian) also reacts to learning he had sex with a trans woman by vomiting for close to 30 seconds. Cultural references * The dish detergent Cascade was mentioned twice. * Auntie Mamma compliments Cleveland's mustache by saying \\"mustache all, putting Wilt Chamberlain to shame!\\", referencing Wilt Chamberlain's mustache. She also references Wilt Chamberlain's sexual exploits, more specifically the 20,000 women claim when she says that she should know, because she was number 8,433 and 11,760. * Hall & Oates' appearance as Cleveland's shoulder angels involve a rendition of \\"She's a Man\\". * Cleveland briefly sings the Boy George song \\"The Crying Game\\".

A Japanese word also meaning \\"poppy\\" (ケシ, 芥子), it is used in Japanese for all pearls that grew without a nucleus. Originally, keshi pearls referred to those pearls formed when a bead nucleus was rejected. More recently, keshi has been used to refer to second harvest pearls and even to freshwater non-nucleated pearls. However the later usage referring to freshwater pearls is considered erroneous by many leading gem trade associations. Because they have no nucleus, keshi pearls are composed entirely of nacre. Origins All of the following can cause a keshi pearl to grow: # An attack on a pearl-producing mollusc by a predator that bores through its shell... similar to a way in which wild natural pearls are formed, except that captive molluscs are more susceptible. # Accidents causing injury to molluscs, for example driving shell fragments into mantle tissue. # Cultivation mishaps, generally separation of the mantle tissue graft from an inserted nucleus... this causes the intended nucleated pearl to fail, and a smaller keshi pearl to grow instead. # Deliberate non-nucleated cultivation, still the most common type in freshwater pearl farming. # Keeping freshwater molluscs with pearl sacs alive after harvesting the (first round of) pearls. Except to the extent of noting that extremely small pearls (<2mm) are not cultivated, since there is no incentive to do so because naturally occurring tiny pearls are relatively plentiful, it is usually not possible to determine which of these caused an individual keshi pearl to grow. Because most keshi pearls come from farms where they are commonly and deliberately cultivated, it is necessary to classify keshi as cultivated / cultured pearls. Any natural pearl (without nucleus) may be called a keshi pearl, but doing so would be rather meaningless without mentioning the species of mollusc in which the pearl grew, or at least its geographic provenance. Use of \\"keshi pearl\\" without provenance is confusing and should be avoided. Terminology Keshi pearl earrings Keshi pearl strands Keshi pearl necklace Keshi pearl necklace The term keshi (occasionally misspelled Keishi, apparently a confusion with \\"Heishi beads\\") was first used in Japan to refer to pearls without nuclei. Akoya pearl cultivation, which began in the 1920s in Japan, provided numerous small, most often greyish pearls as a by-product. Traders from India, where natural pearls were harvested and processed during past centuries, needed no sales talk to be convinced that they could sell Japan Akoya keshi in their market and to visiting Arabs as natural pearls, because their close similarities. Having access to Indian labor capable of sorting, drilling and stringing tiny pearls, arrangements were made to send Japanese keshi pearls to India (even during many years in which imports were not sanctioned), provide processing services at conditions without rival, and covertly retain pearls for sale in India under an allowance for pearls ruined in the course of processing. Pearl importers in consumer countries, and the trade associations they constitute, have recommended limiting the use of the term keshi to ocean pearls, and banning its use for freshwater pearls. This is justified to some extent by the fact that ocean pearl keshi were known as a product for some years before their freshwater counterparts. Japanese language usage of keshi certainly includes freshwater pearls. It has always been a generic term, not a trademark, and its application to freshwater pearls by the Chinese is based on visual similarity that is quite close. Chinese use of keshi for freshwater pearls is generally limited to those from a second (or subsequent) harvest. These differ considerably from the plump, full shapes of first-harvest freshwater pearls, which grow during a young mussel's growth period, when nacre production is at its peak. Older mussels produce nacre more slowly, and second-harvest freshwater pearls (if not nucleated) are generally flat and often thin, with concavities and texture mostly absent from first-harvest pearls. Curiously, the Chinese use keshi to differentiate between two distinct products, while Japanese usage, requiring only the absence of a nucleus, is equally applicable to both. Nature vs. nurture controversy Because it is impossible to determine whether an individual keshi pearl grew serendipitously or as a result of mantle tissue insertion, they are all classified as cultivated/cultured pearls. It is possible to speculate on the likelihood of keshi pearls from various cultivations based on supply and demand. Tiny \\"seed\\" pearls (<2mm) occur commonly in all types of molluscs used for pearl cultivation, both ocean and freshwater, thus there has never been a need to find a way to cultivate tiny sizes. Japan Akoya pearl production generated large numbers of tiny keshi pearls, the value of which was mostly in the labor-intensive processing, so there is little or no incentive to cultivate extra keshi. Southsea pearls on the other hand are farmed in larger molluscs, and keshi from these may reach considerable size and value. Freshwater cultivators in pre-1985 Japan commonly used up bits of active mantle tissue left over from in-body bead nucleation by slipping a few keshi into the mantle. Now the market of those keshi farmed in China is so low that they discard the leftovers rather than expending even a tiny fraction of their mussels' strength on producing freshwater keshi. Freshwater keshi pearls from China are for the most part unquestionably cultivated, but in an indirect way. Active mantle tissue grafts in a mussel's mantle are needed in order for the first harvest of pearls (pearls not considered keshi by most Chinese dealers) to grow. Except for the insertion of nuclei in selected pearl sacs to make coin pearls and bead-nucleated \\"flame\\" pearls, keshi pearls will grow without any further intervention following the careful harvesting of the first round of pearls. Since mussels may live for many years, the process may be repeated; however the amount of nacre produced continuously falls with age, and most cultivators harvest only twice. Keshi pearls consist of solid nacre, and tend to have high luster as a result. All nacre colors typical of the mollusc under cultivation may be represented among keshi pearls harvested from the same, but in the case of Akoya pearls a larger portion of keshi is usually grey than of bead-nucleated pearls.

The title is a line of Matinée d'ivresse \\\\- part of Illuminations by Arthur Rimbaud. The film was released as Deadlier Than the Male in the United States and as Twelve Hours to Live in the UK. It is a dark tale of a young and pretty femme fatale who ruins the life of a man and kills his best friend. Plot In Les Halles, in the heart of Paris, the long- divorced André Chatelin, an honest and respected man who runs a successful restaurant, is visited by an unknown young woman. She says she is Catherine, the daughter of his ex-wife Gabrielle, who has died leaving her homeless and penniless. André gives her a room and a job, but she soon starts abusing his kindness. She sows discord between André and his young friend Gérard, a medical student who is like a son to him. And she starts stealing money to support her mother, who is not dead but an ex-prostitute who is now a hopeless drug addict in a sordid hotel. Feigning drunkenness one night, she gets André to help her to her bedroom and undress her, with the result that he marries her. As his heir she would be rich and free, so the next plan of her and her mother is to get rid of André. She decides to use Gérard, because of his medical knowledge, and swiftly seduces him. When he refuses to kill André, however, she strangles him and then pushes his car into the river with his corpse and his dog César. A grieving André identifies the body, leaving his telephone number with the police, who ring him to ask if he knows the woman seen in Gérard's car. From the description, it is obvious to him that it was Catherine. When he confronts her, she runs off to her mother's hotel. The dog César, who escaped drowning, follows her there and kills her.

The metres used include some metres borrowed from other traditions, and indigenous metres. Kannada literature, especially Old Kannada poetry, clearly exhibits the importance poets placed on metre. This can be seen in the number of types of metre used in Kannada poetry. History The earliest Kannada work on prosody was the Guṇagānkiyam, which has been lost. Nagavarma I wrote a fairly complete work on prosody , called Chandombudhi. With a few additions by later writers, it still remains a standard work on Kannada prosody. Subdivisions Kannada metres are categorised as Amsha and Maatra (syllabic and quantitative), or as Vaidika and Laukika metres.Prof. T. V. Venkatachala Shastri, Kannada Chandaswaroopa, DVK Murthy Publication, Mysore 3rd Edition 2008 p.267-315 Amsha metres Amsha metres are based on Amsha or a unit consisting of short or long syllables which may be extended to modify time required to pronounce them. Amshas are named as Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra based on number of Amshas in it: 2, 3 or 4, respectively. Tripadi, Sangatya and some Amsha Shatpadi belong to Amsha metre category. Kannada vachanas and Yakshagana poems are composed in these metres. There are also Amsha Shatpadis. Maatra metres Maatra metres are based on Maatras. A Maatra is a unit of time. One Maatra is denoted as U and is called Laghu. Two Maatra is denoted as -. There are a set of rules to decide if a letter in a poem takes one or two Maatra time. Maatra Shatpadi and Ragale, for example belong to this group. Harichandra Kavya, Jaimini Bharata are poems composed in these metres. Vaidika metres Vaidika metres are based on Sanskrit Vedic metres such as Vaidika Anustup, Gayatri and Tristup etc. These are Akshara metres or syllabic metres based on number of syllables and lines. Laukika metres Laukika metres are Vaidika metres used in a more constrained manner to instill more rhythmic regularity. Anustup is an example. The Sanskrit Ramayana by Valmiki is composed in Laukika Anustup metre. There are very few poems composed in Kannada in these metres and this category is mostly of academic interest in Kannada. Popular indigenous metres :* Ragale :* Shatpadi :* Dwipadi :* Tripadi :* Chaupadi :* Saangatya - Siribhoovalaya, considered one of the finest mysteries of ancient Kannada literature, follows this style. Popular adopted metres :* Stragdara Mala :* Shardula Vikridita :* Mattebha Vikridita Modern Kannada metres :* Sarala Ragale Modern Kannada poets use flexible metrical structure, sometimes completely neglecting rhythm patterns and focusing completely on the emotional value of lyric. These lyrics are being studied and new patterns inherent in them are being formalized.

Early life and education She was born to a noble family of Lahore. She was the daughter of Munshi Maulvi Mehboob Alam, who owned the newspaper Paisa Akhbar (Penny Newspaper), famed and named for costing just one paisa (one penny). Fatima Begum received her early education at home and went on to complete her master's degree from Punjab University. She then became a teacher at Lady Maclagan School. Social and political activities In 1909, she was the editor of a fortnightly magazine for women Sharif Bibi. In 1908, the Islamic Association of Women was established. Begum Mian Muhammad Shafi was its first president and Fatima Begum was appointed as its general secretary. In 1921, she was married into a respectable and noble family of Hazara. But after only a few years, her husband died, and she returned to her father's home in Lahore. She was appointed as an honorary Inspector of Mumbai Municipal Corporation. Soon after that, upon advice from Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, she visited Lahore to raise the status of All-India Muslim League's logo. She was already working for the Ladies Wing of All-India Muslim League, Mumbai. She also used to publish a weekly magazine named Khatun (magazine). This magazine covered religious, social, educational and literary topics. She became active in many social and political organizations including Anjuman-i-Khawatin-i-Islam (Society of Ladies of Islam), the All India Women's Conference and the All-India Muslim League. She used to promote the ideology of Muslim League and Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Fatima Begum returned from Bombay to Lahore in 1937 to engage in political activities and public protest. She was very active in the re-awakening of Indian Muslims and creating political awareness among women of Punjab, NWFP and Bihar. She was the founder-principal of the Jinnah Islamia College for Girls at Lahore, British India.Singh, Armajit (2008), Foundation of Pakistan: A Study of the Women Leadership of the Punjab Provincial Muslim League. J.R.S.P., Vol. 45, No. 1 Jinnah College for Girls was the prime center of her activities and the main point for Women of Muslim League to confer upon. Every morning, Fatima Begum would address the young women about their responsibilities in the Pakistan Movement. In 1940, she arranged the annual All-India Muslim League convocation. After doing all this work in Lahore, she decided to go to the North-West Frontier Province. In 1943, she went to Peshawar and started gathering Muslim women under the flag of All-India Muslim League. When there was famine and very poor health conditions in Bengal, she took to action with her companions to distribute food and medicines to the afflicted. In 1946, when there was wide-scale slaughter of Muslims, she went to console and look after the affected families and help the widows and children. Before the Indian provincial elections, 1946, she along with the other eminent Muslim women, campaigned all over Punjab to persuade women to vote for Pakistan. In 1947, after the formation of Pakistan, she worked to rehabilitate the incoming refugees from India. After that she became the provincial president of Muslim League. Death and legacy Fatima Begum died in 1958. She had the honor to be the first female Muslim journalist in British India. Muslim women played a significant role before and after the independence of Pakistan. A research paper on Fatima Begum from the Journal of the Research Society of Pakistan pays a tribute to her services by saying, \\"It can be concluded safely that if less unknown but faithful and selfless workers like Fatima Begum were not available to the Muslim League and the Quaid-e-Azam, creation of Pakistan was a distant task\\".

Owona was first elected as a municipal councillor in Douala in 1987.\\"Grégoire Owona : L'ambition technologique en mouvement\\", RDPC website . He was subsequently elected to the National Assembly in the 1988 parliamentary election as an RDPC candidate in Littoral Province, and he served in the National Assembly from 1988 to 1992; during that time, he was Rapporteur-General of the National Assembly's Finance Commission. At the time of the March 1992 parliamentary election, Owona said that the RDPC's problem \\"lies in winning by too great a margin; we would be taken for cheats.\\"West Africa, volume 2,002 (1992), page 459. He became Deputy Secretary-General of the RDPC Central Committee in July 1992. Following the October 1992 presidential election, in which President Paul Biya was re-elected, Owona criticized what he saw as the excesses of the press: \\"The current trend in Cameroon is to resort to invective ... and all those who slander and denounce would like the public to see them as heroes, threatened and persecuted.\\"Francis B. Nyamnjoh, Africa's Media: Democracy and the Politics of Belonging (2005), page 187.

He was also Vice-President of the National Committee of Human Rights and Freedoms during the 1990s.Protectors or Pretenders?: Government Human Rights Commissions in Africa (2001), Human Rights Watch, page 120. Owona was appointed as Minister-Delegate at the Presidency for Relations with the Assemblies\\"Gouvernement du 07/12/1997\\" , Cameroon government website . on 7 December 1997. He remained on the National Committee of Human Rights and Freedoms after his appointment to the government, and some in the opposition pointed to that as evidence of the Committee's lack of impartiality. Following Biya's appointment of the members of the National Elections Observatory (NEO) on 10 October 2001, Owona, speaking on behalf of the RDPC, praised Biya's choices as wise and called on the members of the NEO to justify the confidence that was placed in them.\\"Les membres de l'ONEL prêtent serment devant la cour suprême\\", Panapress, 26 October 2001 . Owona denied claims that the Anglophone population was politically marginalized in a January 2003 CNN report, arguing that Anglophones had appropriate representation in the nation's political structures and observing that the Prime Minister was an Anglophone.Inside Africa, CNN transcript, 4 January 2003. In March 2003, after Biya visited the United States and met with its President, George W. Bush, at the time of that country's invasion of Iraq, Owona defended the visit, stressing that Biya was working to advance Cameroon's interests. He said that the visit should not be perceived as marking a weakening of Cameroon's relationship with France and that it did not indicate an endorsement of the invasion. Owona and RDPC Secretary-General Joseph Charles Doumba had a poor relationship; by 2003 they had reportedly not been on speaking terms for years, and Biya was said to primarily work with Owona, while largely ignoring Doumba, who was in poor health.Asong Ndifor, \\"CPDM in crisis: Has Charles Doumba resigned ?\\" , The Herald (Cameroon), 25 May 2003. 2006 defamation suit After the newspapers L'Anecdote and Nouvelles d'Afrique--as part of an effort to identify prominent individuals guilty of \\"deviant behavior\\"--reported that Owona and about 50 others were homosexuals, he filed a defamation suit in February 2006, along with two doctors who were also identified as homosexual. Although homosexuality was illegal in Cameroon, President Biya said that the newspapers involved in \\"outing\\" were acting irresponsibly by basing their reports on rumors and invading the privacy of individuals.\\"Cameroon papers sued for 'outing'\\", BBC News, 15 February 2006. Defending his newspaper in court on 28 February 2006, Jean Pierre Amougou Belinga, the editor of L'Anecdote, presented as evidence an audio recording in which an unidentified person asserted that Owona was guilty of homosexual acts and promised that further evidence was forthcoming. Owona's lawyers scorned the defense's evidence and argued that any responsible journalist would already have meaningful evidence prepared, as they would have used that same evidence in producing their reports. Amougou Belinga acknowledged under questioning that the evidence against Owona was not conclusive but said that his newspaper had only stated that Owona was suspected of homosexuality, rather than asserting it outright. Taking the stand, Owona denied that he had ever engaged in homosexuality and claimed that his reputation had suffered as a result of the newspaper's report.

Events since 2006 Following the February 2006 arrest of several prominent officials--including Alphonse Siyam Siwé, the Minister of Energy and Water--for alleged corruption, Owona said that the arrests had caused some sadness but stressed the RDPC's firm support for Biya's actions.\\"Paul Biya's anti-corruption drive gains support\\", Panapress, 28 February 2006. In response to claims in the press that Biya's mandate as National President of the RDPC had expired, Owona dismissed the claims in an interview with CRTV in early July 2006; he said that Biya's mandate had already been renewed by the RDPC Political Bureau and that an extraordinary party congress would not necessarily be held for that purpose. However, Biya scheduled an extraordinary congress to be held on 21 July soon after Owona gave his interview, and Owona reportedly felt embarrassed that Biya had effectively contradicted his own argument.Kini Nsom, \\"Biya Derides CPDM Scribe, Convenes Congress\\", The Post (Cameroon), 10 July 2006. Due to RDPC Secretary-General Doumba's health problems, which became particularly evident when he spoke at the 2006 extraordinary congress, Owona largely managed party affairs until Biya appointed René Sadi to succeed Doumba on 4 April 2007. On that occasion, Biya also retained Owona in his post as Deputy Secretary- General. In November 2007, Owona described the government's 2008 budget, which was only 1.1% larger than the 2007 budget, as \\"realistic\\", arguing that additional money should not be spent unless there were accomplishments to show that it would be put to good use.\\"Le gouvernement camerounais soumet à l’Assemlée un budget de 2.275 milliards de FCFA pour 2008\\", African Press Agency, 16 November 2007 .

The land on which the hospital was built was donated by the government and the $94,000 construction fee was donated by Mr. H. M.

The Conservancy Association Centre for Heritage, Western District Community Centre. The hospital was opened by the English missionary group London Missionary Society on 17 October 1922. It was originally opened as a maternity hospital, with the intention to meet society's increasing demand for neonatal services, including the training of midwives and obstetricians. The London Missionary Society recruited the first foreign female doctor in Hong Kong, Dr. Alice D. Hickling, and appointed her as the director of Tsan Yuk. In her development of obstetric services, she quickly recognized the abundance of women eager to become professional midwives in Hong Kong, and had the notion to provide such training through the hospital. She suggested this to Dr. S.W. Tso (), Chairman of the Chinese Public Dispensary Committee (), and he supported her proposal. Thus forward, Tsan Yuk became one of Hong Kong's foremost maternity teaching hospitals. Tsan Yuk Hospital was closed in 1944, during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, and most of the furniture and equipment was moved to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. By the early 1950s, Tsan Yuk was experiencing bed shortages and limited places for patients. The Hong Kong Jockey Club donated $3,570,000 to build a new hospital on nearby Hospital Road. On 13 June 1955, Sir Alexander William George Herder Grantham held the opening ceremony for the new Tsan Yuk Hospital. Following the move, the premises were then used to house the Western District Community Centre. Current use The Community Centre consists of activity rooms, exhibition rooms and lecture theatres. They are commonly used by the following organizations: * The Hong Kong Committee on Children's Rights * Sai Ying Pun Kai-fong Welfare Association * Central & Western District Committee on Promotion of IT * Hong Kong Breastfeeding Mothers' Association * The Conservancy Association Centre for Heritage * Yan Chai hospital Chinese Medicine Clinic * Scout Association of Hong Kong, Western District, Hong Kong Island Region * Tung Sin Tan * Yuen Yuen VLearn Women Centre * St James' Settlement Urban Renewal Social Service Team Conservation On 18 September 2009, the building was classified as a Grade III historic building.List of Graded Historic Buildings in Hong Kong (as at 18 September 2009) This means it has been deemed of some significant merit by the Hong Kong Antiquities and Monuments Office, but does not yet qualify for consideration as a monument.

The soil of the island is extremely fertile, and the climate is tropical making excellent conditions for growing tropical fruits and other exotic plants. In the past, agriculture was the primary source of income for the island, though this has changed over recent years as demand for important exports like sugar has declined and damage to crops as a result of hurricanes has increased. At present agriculture accounts for around 6% of Martinique's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) which ranks it far below tourism and other services, the island's primary source of revenue.  Agriculture in Martinique's History  The original inhabitants of Martinique, the Arawaks and Caribs, did some cultivating on the island though substantial agricultural development did not occur until the French colonized the island in 1635. Following the French's settlement on the island, sugarcane became a widely harvested resource which made the island one of France's prime overseas territories. The island became even more lucrative after the introduction of coffea (coffee) in 1723, and the productivity of the island interested other foreign powers. The Dutch attacked the island in 1674, but were repulsed. The British attacked and 1693 and 1759 only to be repelled as well. However, the British did successfully conquer the island in 1762 but returned it to the French after the Treaty of Paris of 1763. The British would occupy the island twice more between 1794–1802, and 1809-1814 before again returning the island to France under the treaties of Amiens and Vienna respectively. Most agricultural labor on the island was driven by slaves from Africa. Numerous slave uprisings occurred during the early 19th century and ultimately led to the abolition of the practice in 1848. Following this plantation owners imported workers from India and China to lower their labor costs. Martinique became economically depressed in the later 1950s. During this period bananas became a larger and more important agricultural product for the island. The 1979 and 1980 Atlantic hurricane seasons caused major agricultural and economic disruption to the island which continued the island's economic slump.  Products  Sugarcane (right) and Banana (left) plants on Martinique. Martinique produces many agricultural products including but not limited too: sugarcane, bananas, coffea, pineapple, avocados, eggplants, citrus fruit, yams, cassava, sweet potatoes and exotic flowers. Sugarcane, once the driving force of the island's economy, though still exported is now used more commonly for the production of rum, which is also exported. Approximately 3,140 ha of the arable land on Martinique is used to grow sugarcane. Between 1989 and 2000 harvests of sugarcane increased by 7%.

Career  Cochrane received his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1986, after having obtained a B.S. in Physics from MIT in 1979 and having served as a junior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers (1982–1983). He was hired by the University of Chicago economics department in 1986 and moved to the business school in 1993. Prior to joining the Hoover Institution, he was the AQR Capital Management Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Cochrane has served as head of the National Bureau of Economic Research asset pricing group, and was the editor of the Journal of Political Economy from 1998 to 2003. He was elected Fellow of the Econometric Society in 2001, served as vice-president of the American Finance Association in 2008, and was elected president of this learned society for the 2010 term.  Main contributions  The central idea of Cochrane's research is that macroeconomics and finance should be linked, and a comprehensive theory needs to explain both of the following: * how, given the observed prices and financial returns, households and firms decide on consumption, investment, and financing. * how, in equilibrium, prices and financial returns are determined by households and firms decisions. That is a standard general equilibrium logic, but many financial economists do not view it as a priority and prefer to explain prices without an ultimate reference to choices of households and firms. Similarly, many macroeconomists choose not to worry about asset prices. In this vein, Cochrane's work has been to document some empirical patterns and offer some potential explanations. His 1999 Journal of Political Economy, with John Y. Campbell, develops a representative agent model with nonlinear habits that matches the high and volatile risk premium on stocks, the predictability of stock returns, etc.Campbell, John Y. and Cochrane, John H. \\"By Force of Habit: A Consumption-Based Explanation of Aggregate Stock Market Behavior\\" Journal of Political Economy, 107, 205–251 (April 1999). In several articles (1991 The Journal of Finance, 1996 Journal of Political Economy), he develops and tests a \\"production-based asset pricing model\\" based on the q-theory of investment.Cochrane, John H. \\"Production-Based Asset Pricing and the Link Between Stock Returns and Economic Fluctuations.\\" Journal of Finance 46 (1) (March 1991) 209–237.Cochrane, John H. \\"A Cross- Sectional Test of an Investment-Based Asset Pricing Model\\" Journal of Political Economy, 104 (June 1996). In two 1992 articles, Cochrane emphasized some features of asset prices which are difficult to account for, such as the predictability of equity returns, and the longterm equity premium.Cochrane, John H. and Lars Peter Hansen, \\"Asset Pricing Explorations for Macroeconomics\\",1992 NBER Macroeconomics Annual 115–165.Cochrane, John H. \\"Explaining the Variance of Price-Dividend Ratios\\" Review of Financial Studies (1992) 5:2, 243–280 His more recent work, with Monika Piazzesi, studies bond markets. In particular, in a number of papers, Cochrane and Piazzesi study the predictability of bond returns.  Other contributions  Cochrane has also worked on the fiscal theory of the price level,Cochrane, John H., \\"Long term debt and optimal policy in the fiscal theory of the price level\\" Econometrica 69, 69–116 (2001). on the debate between permanent and temporary shocks in macroeconomic fluctuations,Cochrane, John H., \\"Permanent and Transitory Components of GNP and Stock Prices\\", Quarterly Journal of Economics 109(1) (February 1994) 241–266. and the cost of near-rational behavior.Cochrane, John H. \\"The Sensitivity of Tests of the Intertemporal Allocation of Consumption to Near-Rational Alternatives\\" American Economic Review 79 (June 1989) 319–337.  Asset Pricing  Cochrane is the author of Asset Pricing,Cochrane, John H., Asset Pricing, Princeton University Press, 2001. a widely used textbook in graduate courses on asset pricing. According to his own words, the organizing principle of the book is that everything can be traced back to specializations of a single equation: the basic pricing equation.Cochrane, John H., Asset Pricing, Princeton University Press, 2001, p. xvii Cochrane received the TIAA- CREF Institute Paul A. Samuelson Award for this book.  Media appearances  Since 2008, Cochrane has appeared more extensively in the media as he contributed to the debate on the financial crisis. Paul Krugman criticized repeatedly his viewpoint on his blog Krugman, Paul, \\"A Dark Age of macroeconomics (wonkish)\\", January 27, 2009.Krugman, Paul, \\"Brad DeLong’s Foolishness\\", February 23, 2010. and in a New York Times Magazine article,Krugman, Paul, \\"How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?\\", New York Times Magazine, September 2, 2009. leading John Cochrane to write a response on his website, which was subsequently published in The Wall Street Journal.Cochrane, John H., \\"How did Paul Krugman get it so Wrong?\\", September 16, 2009.

It sees twelve celebrities attempt to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days without using air transport, recreating the journey of Phileas Fogg and Michael Palin. Like Fogg and Palin, the journey begins and ends at the Reform Club in London. It was first shown on BBC One and BBC HD in October and November 2009. Production The challenge for the celebrities was to travel around the globe in eighty days, starting and ending at the Reform Club in London, re- enacting the challenge made to Phileas Fogg in the 1873 Jules Verne novel, Around the World in Eighty Days, and Around the World in 80 Days with Michael Palin. In each episode, a pair of celebrities travels a single leg of the round-the-world journey, trying to meet the next pair at a handover point in sufficient time, in relay race fashion. The journey could be completed by any means except by flight. At the handover, they pass to the succeeding team a carpet bag containing, amongst other items, a journal and a phone. Each of the celebrity pairs contributed to the journal as their leg of the journey progressed, and ahead of the trip Palin wrote an entry containing advice for the travellers. Throughout the journey, the celebrities collected various items on their leg of the journey. These were then auctioned to raise money for Children in Need, as was the journal completed by the travellers at the end of the trip.

First published on 12 December 2014 The term was in use since the time of ancient China. Generally speaking, a Mobile Barracks of High Command would have the operational authority over the affairs of military, civilians, and Nationalist Party within its area of responsibility, if it was military-related. For example, Ying-chin Ho (:zh:何應欽), a four-star army general of ROC, was once the director of Mobile Barracks of High Command at Chungking. His official title was, in fact, \\"Director of Mobile Barracks of the Chairman of the National Government Office at Chungking.\\" Simply put: Ho spoke for the Chairman of the National Government of Republic of China in the great area of Chungking. He was, de facto and de juro, the military governor over several provinces west of Sichuan (included). Hence, the director of Mobile Barracks of High Command functioned as a provincial governor in the Qing Dynasty. In wartime, due to military considerations, the Director of Mobile Barracks would take over the administrative power of civil affairs and therefore also known as military general governor. Similarly, there were other Mobile Barracks of High Command at northeast China, Sifeng (:zh:息烽), Xichang (:zh:西昌), and Canton, and so on. Equivalently, another kind of regional special office, \\"Forward Command Camp of the Chief of the National Military Council\\" (:zh:行營) would be in charge of the operational planning and command functions in its administrative district.

The Coast and Geodetic Survey acquired her from her owners on 1 July 1915 and placed her in service as a survey ship that year. She operated along the United States East Coast, used by Ernest Lester Jones—Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1915 to 1929—to ferry dignitaries about in addition to her hydrographic survey work. On more than once occasion, Isis assisted mariners in distress. On 28 April 1916, she assisted the launch North Star, which was swamping because of being overloaded in a light choppy sea, in Charleston Harbor off Charleston, South Carolina. On 18 February 1917, she aided to the yacht Soncy at Savannah, Georgia, during a fire on the waterfront. On 28 April 1917, her officers and crew helped to put out a fire on the steam schooner Rosalie Mahoney in the St. Johns River in Florida. United States Navy career, 1917–1919 On 24 September 1917, Isis was transferred to the United States Navy for World War I service as the patrol vessel USS Isis She was commissioned on 4 October 1917 with Lt. Gilbert T. Rude in command. After a minor overhaul, Isis commenced duty as the flagship for the Commander of Squadron 2 Cruiser Force, on 13 November 1917, at Staten Island, New York. She served in that capacity until 14 June 1918, and remained in the New York area until December when she arrived at Naval Station Norfolk. Following operations at Norfolk, she was decommissioned on 30 April 1919 and was returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

It is a mountainous region in the easternmost side of the Bernese Alps, containing the northern wall of Jungfrau and Eiger, and the largest glaciated area in western Eurasia, comprising the Aletsch Glacier. The Jungfrau-Aletsch protected area is the first World Natural Heritage site in the Alps; it was inscribed in 2001.Approval of site extension and management plan for Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn World Natural Heritage, DETEC . Retrieved on 2009-10-18  Geography and climate  The Jungfrau-Aletsch protected area is located in the Swiss Alps between the Bernese Oberland and north-eastern Valais, about 25 km south of Interlaken and 20 km north of Brig. The site covers the whole Aar massif from the Oeschinensee in the west to the Grimselsee (not comprised) in the east, including the basins of the Aletsch, Fiescher, Aar and Grindelwald glaciers. The valley of the Unteraar Glacier The culminating point is the Finsteraarhorn which, with its 4,270 metres, is also the highest mountain in the Bernese Alps. 8 other summits above 4,000 metres are located in the area: Aletschhorn, Jungfrau, Mönch, Schreckhorn, Gross Fiescherhorn, Hinter Fiescherhorn, Grünhorn and Lauteraarhorn. The summit ridge separating the cantons of Valais and Berne is the main watershed of Europe. The principal valleys on the north side run due north below the precipitous 20 kilometer north wall of the Jungfrau, Mönch and Eiger, thence to the Aar, a tributary of the Rhine which runs into the North Sea. The southern valleys drain into the southwest running valley of the Rhone which flows into the Mediterranean sea. The climate of the region is strongly influenced by the height of the mountains. They form a barrier between the wet sub-oceanic climate of the north and the drier climate of the south-facing Valais slopes. On the north side the rainfall exceeds 2,200 mm, most falling in summer, but on the south side it is only 1,000 mm, with more falling in winter. The Valais experiences a subcontinental climate at low and medium altitudes and is markedly semi-arid. Mean annual temperatures range from -8.5 °C at Jungfraujoch (3,500 m) to 9.1 °C at Brig (700 m).  Physical features  Aletsch Glacier The Jungfrau-Aletsch site is almost untouched, except for trails and mountain huts. It is deeply glaciated. About half of the area is higher than 2,600 metres, a few hundred metres lower than the limit between the glaciers accumulation and ablation zones. The total area covered by glacier is 35,000 ha, it constitutes the largest continuous area of ice in the Alps. The largest and longest glacier in the Alps, the Aletsch Glacier is 23 km long and has a maximum thickness of 900 metres at Konkordiaplatz.  Area  The protected site covers an area of 82,388 ha, comprising the 53,888 ha existing World Heritage Site plus extensions at both ends totaling 28,500 ha. 56% is within the Canton of Valais, 44% within the Canton of Berne.  Flora and fauna  Pro Natura nature centre). Glaciers and barren rock constitute 80% of the area; 6% is forested, 5.2% is alpine meadow, and 8% is scrub. Altitude is the strongest factor influencing the distribution and diversity of the vegetation. Within the nominated area there are 1,800 species of vascular plants and 700 mosses. The growing period decreases with altitude, but there are 529 species of phanerogams and pteridophytes above the tree line. Broadleaf montane forest extends from 900 m to 1,300 m on north- facing slopes. On south-facing slopes the same zone is approximately 200 m higher. The subalpine zone lies between 1,300 m to 2,000 m, between the broadleaf and alpine zone. Characteristic species are the Swiss Pine (Pinus Cembra) and the Norway Spruce (Picea abies) on the north and south side respectively. An example of Pinus cembra forest is the Aletsch Forest above the Aletsch Glacier and near the tree line. It developed on the moraine of the glacier after its maximum extension in 1850. The zone directly above the tree line forms a girdle of moorland vegetation and Alpine grassland. Alpine ibex (Lötschental valley). 1,250 fauna species have been recorded on the site, including 271 vertebrates: 42 mammals, 99 birds, eight reptiles, four amphibians and seven fish, and numerous invertebrates including 97 molluscs and 979 insects. As for the rest of the Alps, common species are the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), alpine ibex (Capra ibex), red deer (Cervus elaphus). Smaller mammals include the mountain hare (Lepus timidus), fox (Vulpes vulpes), ermine (Mustela erminea), marmot (Marmota marmota) and the reintroduced lynx (Felis lynx).  Tourism  Jungfraujoch The regions of the Bernese Oberland and Valais have been popular tourist destinations since the 19th century. The Jungfrau was first climbed in 1811 and the Finsteraarhorn in 1812. The first tourists came mostly in summer, but in the 1930s winter sports became also popular. On the north side visitors are only able to visit the site via the Jungfrau railway which leads to the Jungfraujoch. The railway has turned the site from an inaccessible mountain face to a very accessible site visited by large nearby populations. The Jungfrau railway was built between 1870 and 1912, taking visitors from Kleine Scheidegg (2,061 m) to Jungfraujoch (3,454 m), the saddle between the Mönch and Jungfrau. On the south side the area of Riederalp- Bettmeralp hosts most of the visitors. Other inhabited regions on the margin are Kandersteg and the Lötschental. The network of foot-paths is well developed around the site but nonexistent through it, the centre being inaccessible to walkers. The site can only be accessed by experienced mountaineers and there is a series of 37 shelters and five mountain refuges with a total of 1,582 beds, managed by the Swiss Alpine Club. The Aletsch ecological centre in Riederalp is run by Pro Natura functions as a visitor center.

Background Born at Ballymil in County Waterford, he was the son of Pierce Barron and his wife Anna, only daughter of Henry Winston. His younger brother was the bishop Edward Barron. Barron was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. Career He entered the British House of Commons for Waterford City in 1832, however he lost his seat in the general election of 1841. In October of the same year, he was created a baronet, of Bellevue, in the County of Kilkenny. A year later, both representatives for the constituency were unseated and Barron was returned to parliament until 1847. He was re-elected in 1848, sitting for the next four years. Barron was again successful in the general election of 1865 and represented Waterford City until 1868. Although he won the constituency's by-election in the following year, the result was declared void because of bribery in 1870. Barron served as High Sheriff of County Waterford for 1858 and also as a justice of the peace and a deputy lieutenant of the county. Family On 1 May 1822, he married Anna Leigh Grey, the only daughter of Sir Gregory Page- Turner, Fourth Baronet and had by her a daughter and a son.

It was founded in 1828 by Félix Lacoste with the help of Joseph Bonaparte (Napoleon's older brother), who was living in New Jersey.Stroud, Patricia T., The Man Who Had Been King: The American Exile of Napoleon's Brother Joseph, 2005. The Courrier was the most famous French newspaper across North America, South America and the Caribbean. In 1850, it had more than 11,000 registered readersErnst, Robert, Immigrant Life in New York City 1825-1863, 1994. and was distributed from Quebec to Río de la Plata, and from New York to San Francisco. It also had readers in France. Bonapartist period (1828-1836) Founded by Félix Lacoste, a close friend of Joseph Bonaparte, the Courrier took a bonapartist line. Its readers were often bonapartists or republicans in exile, including Général Lallemand, Lakanal. After the Three Glorious Days in France (27, 28, 29 of July 1830), the Courrier attacked the new monarchy and the new king Louis-Philippe. It accused the monarchy of stealing the revolution's principles and forgetting what the French people had fought for. The newspaper argued that the Bonaparte family would be the best defender of the nation's will. Orleanist period (1836-1848) After 1836, the Courrier became the property of French librarian Charles de Behr. He was a supporter of Louis-Philippe and shifted the newspaper's line accordingly. In 1839, Frédéric Gaillardet (1808–1882) bought the Courrier. He stated that he wanted the Courrier to become the \\"organe des populations franco-américaines\\" (newspaper for the Franco-American population). Republican period (1848-1853) When news of the French Revolution of 1848 reached New York, Gaillardet returned to France to participate in the construction of the new republic and defend his conservative ideas. He sold the Courrier to Paul Arpin, a French translator for the Louisiana newspaper L'Abeille de la Nouvelle-Orléans. Arpin turned it into a republican newspaper, attacking the royalists of the Parti de l'Ordre and Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. After the Republican period After the Republican period, the history of the Courrier des Etats-Unis became obscure. From 1854 to 1861, Régis de Trobriand was a joint editor. During the American Civil War it supported the South.

Fyodor Dubasov was born into a noble family in Tver guberniya. His family had long been associated with the Imperial Russian Navy. One of his ancestors, Avtonom Dubasov had participated in the capture of a Swedish galley in 1709. Naval Service In 1870 Dubasov graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps in Petersburg; the equivalent of the modern Russian Naval Academy named after Nikolai Gerasimovich Kuznetsov. Fyodor Dubasov participated in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 as a minelayer commander with the Danube Military Flotilla. After the war, he commanded various vessels, including the cruiser Afrika from 1883 to 1885. He commanded the cruiser Vladimir Monomakh in 1889. Dubasov accompanied the future Tsar Nicholas II on his Asian Voyage. In 1891 he commanded the battleship Petr Velikyy. Dubasov was promoted to Rear-Admiral in 1893 and Vice-Admiral in 1889 In 1897–1899, Fyodor Dubasov was placed in charge of the Pacific Ocean Squadron. Under his leadership, the squadron took control over Port Arthur and Dalniy, after the Triple Intervention. In 1901–1905, Dubasov was appointed chairman of the Naval Technical Committee of the Russian Admiralty. In June 1905 he was elected a permanent member of the State Defense Council. In 1905 he was the Russian representative on the international committee investigating the Dogger Bank incident Dubasov's role in the Moscow Uprising of 1905 In 1905 Admiral Dubasov was put in charge of punitive expeditions charged with crushing peasant rebellions in Chernigov, Poltava, and Kursk guberniyas. Upon becoming the governor general of Moscow, Dubasov openly characterized himself as the \\"barnburner\\". Aspiring to set up rigid administrative control at all levels, Fyodor Dubasov submitted memos to the tsar with suggestions to broaden the powers of governor general and to bring the Moscow garrison directly under his control (was refused). On 6 December 1905 Dubasov placed the garrison troops, the police, and gendarmerie on instant alert. On 7 December the Moscow Soviet called a general strike. Dubasov sanctioned the declaration of a state of emergency in the city and authorized mass arrests. On 8 December Fyodor Dubasov ordered the dispersion of a rally in the Aquarium Garden. On 9 December he sanctioned active involvement of the police by troops of the Moscow garrison whom he had concentrated in the center of City. A major part of the military force available was divided into two units (positioned respectively at the Theatre Square and the Manege Square). The reserve echelon was located in the Kremlin barracks. The government troops occupied the railway stations, State Bank, telegraph, post office, telephone exchange, and water supply. Dubasov called upon the city fire brigades and armed night watchmen to assist the army. On 11 December Fyodor the Admiral issued a decree, which made homeowners personally liable for \\"letting\\" the insurgents shoot at the government troops from roofs and windows of their houses. With the increase of numbers of arrested, Dubasov ordered the transferral of some of the prisoners to Petersburg. On 12–13 December he organized large-scale punitive actions against the rioters. As a result, the government troops got the upper hand on 14 December. The authorities introduced the curfew from 21:00 to 7:00 and published a decree forbidding all meetings. Concern at the reliability of the infantry conscripts who made up the bulk of the permanent garrison of Moscow, had initially placed constraints on Dubasov's repression of the rising. Upon the arrival of the Leib Guards of the Semyonovsky Regiment to Moscow on 15 December Fyodor Dubasov ordered his troops to take control over all the railway stations in the capital (except for the Kursky Rail Terminal). He sanctioned the use of artillery for the suppression of the unrest in the Presnya district. Dubasov turned to the citizens of Moscow with an appeal to seize armed resistance, assist the police, and hand over the rebels. Those involved in the revolt \\"by deceit or by force\\" were offered to disarm the militants and take the side of the government troops. On 19 December the insurgency was crushed. On 20 December the Cabinet of Ministers issued funds in the amount of 100,000 rubles for Dubasov to distribute among the suffering population. On 21 December Fyodor Dubasov ordered the elimination of the remaining hotbeds of tension. Subsequently, Dubasov introduced a plan for the reorganization of military and civil administration of Moscow and the Moscow guberniya. On 23 April 1906 a member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party Boris Vnorovsky-Mishchenko made an attempt on the life of Fyodor Dubasov by throwing a bomb under his carriage. The explosion killed Dubasov's adjutant and the terrorist himself and wounded the governor general and his coachman. In July 1906, following the assassination attempt, Fyodor Dubasov was formally replaced as Governor General of Moscow . He was appointed as a member of the State Council. Later life Dubasov retired to Saint Petersburg in poor health as a result of his injuries. He was involved in building the Church of the Saviour on the Waters in St Petersburg in memory of the Russian sailors killed in the Russo-Japanese War. He died in 1912 and was buried in Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

An acrobatic flip is a sequence of body movements in which a person leaps into the air and then rotates one or more times while airborne. Acrobatic flips are performed in acro dance, free running, gymnastics, cheerleading, goal celebrations and various other activities. This is in contrast to freestyle BMX flips, in which a person revolves in the air about a bicycle. Acrobatic flips can be started from a stationary, standing position and they are also commonly executed immediately following another rotational move, such as a roundoff or handspring, so as to take advantage of the angular momentum developed in the preceding move. In general, the hands do not touch the floor during execution of a flip and performers typically strive to land on the feet in an upright position, but it is not required to be considered a flip. Classification Many variations of flips exist, with usage depending on the particular type of activity. In gymnastics, for example, flips conform to a small number of specific, rigorously defined forms and movements. In activities such as free running and tricking, however, there are seemingly endless variations of flips, though many of these are variations of the fundamental gymnastics flips. As a result, gymnastics nomenclature is often applied to flips found in other disciplines. In many cases, flips are generally categorized according to the direction of body rotation. For example, the body rotates in the forward direction (i.e., face first) in a front flip and in the opposite direction in a back flip. Gymnastics Gymnastics flips are performed in both men's and women's gymnastics, on various apparatus including the balance beam, vault, and floor. In all cases, gymnastics flips require the hips to pass over the head. Four body forms are commonly employed in gymnastics flips: * Aerial – Unbent knees, with legs in a forward or side split and aligned on the rotational plane, resulting in a front aerial or side aerial, respectively. * Tuck – Legs together, with knees fully bent and drawn to the chest and hands clutching the knees or otherwise held close to the body. By \\"tucking\\" together tightly in this manner, the body is able to reach maximum angular velocity and thus minimize the time required for the body to complete its revolution. When initiated from a stationary, standing position, a tuck is classified as a \\"standing\\" tuck. * Layout – Body fully extended with legs together, unbent hips and knees, and arms held against the sides. Compared to the back tuck, this flip requires both higher angular momentum and greater height above the floor in order to ensure sufficient time to complete the rotation before landing. A layout may also include axial body rotation in addition to the fundamental rotation about the waist; such a layout is called a twist. Twists are further categorized by the number of axial rotations completed while airborne. For example, a layout with 180 degree twist is a half twist, 360 degrees for a full twist, and multiples of 360 degrees for double full and triple full twists, and so on. * Pike – Bent hips, with knees straight and legs together. Many gymnastics flips are descriptively named, based on the direction of rotation and the body position that is assumed during execution. For example, a front flip performed with a tucked body form is called a front tuck. When initiated from a stationary, standing position, a front tuck is called a standing front tuck. Variations Acro dancers perform a pitch tuck. Peggy Bacon is airborne while executing a variation of a back pike, with legs apart. Bondi Beach, 1937 Common modifications These modifications are applicable to many types of flips: * Gainer. A back flip that ends with the performer forward of the starting point due to forward momentum. * Loser. A front flip that ends with the performer behind the starting position due to backward momentum. * Switch. A flip that is launched from and lands on the same leg. Tucks * Pitch tuck. An assisted back tuck that is executed by partners. One partner forms a \\"saddle\\" with his hands. The second partner steps onto the saddle and then the first partner thrusts the saddle upward. The second partner, who is propelled upward with back rotation, executes a back tuck. * Cowboy tuck. A tuck with knees and feet separated. Layouts * X-in or X-out, in which legs and arms are split normal to the rotational plane so as to form an \\"X\\". * Layout or Straight, where the performer's legs are kept together and relatively straight and whipped over the head Tricking and b-boying A virtually unlimited number of flip variants has been spawned within various activities, many having proprietary nomenclature.

All this passage explains about the lavers themselves is their size, and that they were made from bronze. The mediaeval Masoretic Text claims that they were four cubits in diameter, and that they had a cubic capacity of forty baths, but the earlier writer Flavius Josephus claims that four cubits was the size of the radius, making the capacity even larger.Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, 8:3:6 Even with the masoretic text's measurements, these lavers would be so large that if one was to be filled with water, the water alone would weigh 14 long tons. The 'bases'  Much greater detail is elaborated for the description of the supporting bases (Hebrew: Mekonoth) for the lavers. In the masoretic text, these are claimed to be four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high, but the older Septuagint, and Josephus, both claim instead give the size as five cubits long, five cubits wide, and six cubits high.1 Kings 7:27, LXX These bases are described as being made from two components; in the Masoretic Text, these are described by the Hebrew terms misgeroth and shelabbim; the Septuagint uses the Greek terms sygkleiston and hexechomena to describe them.1 Kings 7:28, LXX The meaning of these words is unfortunately somewhat uncertain, although it is suspected that the shelabbim/hexechomena were the main part, onto which the misgeroth/sygkleiston were affixedI. Benzinger, Hebrew Archaeology (1894), 252+ (hence some English translations render these words into side panels and uprights, or borders and frames). The bible describes the misgeroth/sygkleiston as being decorated by lions, oxen, and cherubim. Each base is described as resting on a solid brass wheels, each 1.5 cubits in diameter. The axles for these wheels are described as being held to the base by hands (Hebrew: yadoth), which were extensions of the base itself. According to a later passage from the books of kings, King Ahaz dismantled these bases, and removed the misgeroth/sygleiston; it doesn't mention whether he did anything to the lavers themselves, but if they remained they would presumably have been situated significantly lower than they were before. However, an even later passage states that Nebuchadnezzar's army dismantled the bases.  Purpose  The ten lavers are described by the bible as being placed around the Temple building itself, five on the north side and the other five on the south. They were used for washing the hands and feet of the priests before doing ritual service (Exodus 30:18-21). Josephus, says that these lavers were for cleansing the entrails of the sacrificed animals, and their feet. On the probable mythological significance of the lavers, see the Encyclopaedia Biblica article SEA, BRAZEN.

At its narrowest point, just before it joins the mainland, a wall was built from Ston to Mali Ston. Throughout the era of the Republic, the walls were maintained and renovated once they meant to protect the precious salt pans that contributed to Dubrovnik's wealth, which are still being worked today. Demolition work began on the walls following the fall of the Republic. Later the Austrian authorities took materials away from the wall to build schools and community buildings, and also for a triumphal arch on the occasion of the visit by the Austrian Emperor in 1884. The wall around Mali Ston was demolished with the excuse that it was damaging the health of the people. The demolition was halted after World War II. Layout The wall, today 5.5 kilometres long, links Ston to Mali Ston, and is in the shape of an irregular pentangle. It was completed in the 15th century, along with its 40 towers (20 of which have survived) and 5 fortresses. Within, three streets were laid from north to south and three others from east to west. Thus, fifteen equal blocks were formed with 10 houses in each. Residential buildings around the edges. The Gothic Republic Chancellery and the Bishop's Palace are outstanding among the public buildings. The main streets are 6 m wide (except the southern street which is 8 m wide) and the side streets are two m wide. The town was entered by two city gates: the Field Gate (Poljska vrata) has a Latin inscription and dates from 1506. The centres of the system are the fortress Veliki kaštio in Ston, Koruna in Mali Ston and the fortress on Podzvizd hill (224 m). Noted artist who work on the walls project are Michelozzo, Bernardino Gatti of Parma and Giorgio da Sebenico (Juraj Dalmatinac).Croatia: Aspects of Art, Architecture and Cultural Heritage By John Julius Norwich (p146) The city plan of Dubrovnik was used as a model for Ston, but since Ston was built on prepared terrain, that model was more closely followed than Dubrovnik itself.

The first was established in Jerusalem during the Ottoman era, two were journals of the Irgun, whilst the fourth was owned by the Herut political party founded by former Irgun members. Jerusalem newspaper In 1909 a weekly newspaper by the name of Ha-Herut was established in 1909 by Avraham Elmalih, later a member of the Knesset for the Sephardim and Oriental Communities party. Initially edited by Haim Ben-Atar, it was considered to be the mouthpiece of the city's Sephardi community.The Israeli Press Jewish Virtual Library It became a daily newspaper in 1912, and was edited by Elmalih between 1914 and 1919,Avraham Elmalich Knesset website being the only Hebrew newspaper to appear regularly during World War I. Irgun newspaper Herut was established as the journal of the Irgun in 1942, with its first edition published on 10 March that year. It was published at least once a month on four pages, and was sent by mail to private addresses, as well as being pasted on walls in public areas. The paper took a Revisionist slant on problems in the yishuv, but also included coded messages to members of the Irgun underground. For that reason, the British authorities followed the newspaper closely, with a full English translation sent to the Foreign Secretary in November 1943. The ninety-ninth and last edition of the paper was published on 10 June 1948, though publication of a separate Herut journal continued in Jerusalem during June and July that year, with the city cut off from the rest of the country by the siege and the local Irgun not having been absorbed into the IDF. Herut daily In 1948 a new daily newspaper associated with the Herut party (with which it shared its name) was launched by former journalists of HaMashkif, the Hatzohar-affiliated newspaper, including Izik Ramba, who was its editor from 1957 onwards. Its journalists included Yoel Marcus, Dan Margalit, Eitan Haber, Shlomo Nakdimon, Ze'ev Galili, Amos Keinan, Uzi Benziman, Eliyahu Matza, Dan Levin, Aryeh Naor and Moshe Katsav.

She has come to Montréal to serve as a nanny to Russell (Bill Mitchell), the son of a widowed business woman (Monique Leyrac). Martha joins a church choir and becomes attracted to Father Michael Ferrier (Donald Sutherland), an Augustinian monk who has selected her to sing solo in an interfaith concert. Russell accidentally dies. Martha suffers a crisis in faith and to Ferrier declares her love for him. Ferrier reciprocates and leaves the order so they can live together with Martha singing to support them. She is tormented by guilt for betraying her profound religious principles she immolates herself on a hill (Mount Royal) overlooking Montréal.

It saw heavy fighting during World War I when it was defended for several months by its Russian garrison against German attacks. The fortress was built in the years 1882–1892 as one of the defensive works to protect the western borders of Russia against Germany, and continuously modernised afterwards to cope with advances in heavy siege artillery. In 1889–1893, military engineer Nestor Buinitsky took an important part in the creation of the fortress. It was located on the river Biebrza about 50 km from the border with the German province of East Prussia, in the one place where the marshlands of the river could be crossed, hence controlling a vital chokepoint. The extensive marshlands and bogs that surrounded it made attacks upon it difficult. The strategic Belostok–Lyck–Königsberg rail line also ran through the fortress and crossed the Biebrza river there. The fortress saw heavy fighting during the beginning of World War I in the eastern front from September 1914 until the Russian Army abandoned it in August 1915. In the interwar years the fortress was used by the Polish Army. During the German invasion of Poland in 1939 it was bypassed and did not see much fighting. Today, some parts of the fortress are accessible to tourists, especially the parts within the boundaries of Biebrza National Park. The visitor information center of the park is located in Osowiec-Twierdza,Lonely Planet guidebook Poland a small settlement located within the boundaries of the fortress. Other parts of the fortress still belong to the Polish Army and access is restricted. First World War First German Assault (September 1914) In September 1914, Russian field defenses surrounding the fortress were attacked by 40 infantry battalions of the German 8th Army; the attackers enjoyed significant numerical superiority. By 21st of September, the German advance brought the fortress proper within range of German artillery; further reinforced with 60 additional guns of calibers up to 203mm, but these could only be brought into action on 26 September. Two days later, a German frontal assault was repelled by Russian artillery. The day afterwards, two Russian flanking counter-attacks forced German artillery to relocate, taking the fortress outside of German artillery range. Second Battle (February-March 1915) On 3 February 1915, the numerically superior Germans launched another assault. The first line of Russian field defenses consisted of shallow trenches and held for five days. On 9 February the Russians withdrew to the second line with deep trenches and established machine gun emplacements, and gave no ground for another two days. The second line remained unbroken. The retreat from the first line allowed German artillery to start firing on the forts on February 13. The caliber of German heavy siege artillery varied from 100 mm up to 420 mm, firing in salvos of 360 guns every four minutes. Throughout the week-long artillery barrage, 250,000 shots were fired from the heavy guns and about one million rounds were fired from the light artillery pieces. Russian Central Command expected the fortress to fall; it requested the defenders to hold for at least 48 hours to allow for evacuation of civilians. The fortress would hold until August. The Russians suffered heavy losses from the artillery barrage, which was strongest from 14 to 16 February and from 25 February to 5 March 1915. Multiple hits inside the fortress and the collapse of many buildings made movement between different parts of the fortress almost impossible. Subsequently, the sector relapsed to positional warfare. It is sometimes incorrectly claimed that Russian counter-battery fire destroyed two German heavy mortars; these guns were withdrawn for operations elsewhere.Kauffman & Kauffman, 2016, pp. 112–113 Third Battle (July-August 1915) Lieutenant Vladimir Karpovich Kotlinsky, commandant of the Osowiec fortress during the attack The Germans launched a full frontal offensive on the fortress at the beginning of July; the attack included 14 battalions of infantry, one battalion of sappers, 24–30 heavy siege guns, and 30 batteries of artillery equipped with poison gases led by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg. Russian defenses were manned by 500 soldiers of the 226th Infantry Regiment Zemlyansky, and 400 militia. The Germans knew the Russians did not have any gas masks so they chose to use chlorine gas. The Germans waited until 4 a.m. on 6 August for favorable wind conditions, when the attack opened with regular artillery bombardment combined with chlorine gas.Regarding the gas attack of the 6 August 1915, historians' accounts conflict in some details. Chlorine gas was used according to some authors (Kauffman & Kauffman, 2016 ; Buttar, 2017), whereas a mixture of chlorine and bromine was used according to other authors (Cherkasov et al., 2011 ; Khmelkov, 1939). The gas was contained in artillery shells according to one source (Kauffman & Kauffman, 2016), whereas the gas was contained in cylinders according to other sources (Buttar, 2017; Cherkasov et al., 2011; Khmelkov, 1939). The ensuing battle was known as the Attack of the Dead Men. The Russians put on wet rags on their faces to filter some of the gas. Most died but some survived the gas attack. Even while suffering severe chemical burns the Russians were able repel the attack due to German forces panicking at the sight of the Russian men, covered in blisters and coughing up their own respiratory organs, the Germans subsequently retreating. The Russian garrison suffered heavy losses, but some soldiers survived even after the final charge, and Chlorine gas barrage. The Russians did not hold Osowiec for much longer. The Germans threatened to encircle the fortress with the capture of Kovno and Novogeorgiesk. The Russians demolished much of Osowiec and withdrew on 18 August.Kauffman & Kauffman, 2016, p. 225 Second World War After the First World War, the Second Polish Republic refurbished parts of Osowiec and used it to house Polish army units, including the Central School of Non-Commissioned Officers of the Border Protection Corps. The 135th Reserve Infantry Regiment was formed from the school after Germany invaded Poland at the beginning of the Second World War. The Poles abandoned the fortress on 13 September. The Germans captured it and passed it to the Soviet 20th Motor Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade on 25 September. Osowiec was subsequently garrisoned by the Soviet 10th Army. The Germans recaptured Osowiec on 27 June 1941 during Operation Barbarossa; one use of the fortress was as an ammunition dump there. On 14 August 1944, the Soviet 49th and 50th Armies captured three of the forts during the Osovets Offensive of Operation Bagration. Fort II remained in German hands until January 1945, when it was abandoned during the Vistula–Oder Offensive. Post-War In 1953, the fortress was regarrisoned by a Polish Air Force ammunition depot, which was absorbed into the 11th Regional Materiel Base in 1998. In 2011, the Osowiec garrison became part of the 2nd Regional Logistics Base. In 2019, Swedish power metal band Sabaton released a song, part of their \\"The Great War\\" album, called \\"The Attack Of The Dead Men\\" about the event that took place at the fortress during WW1 Russian metal band Aria released a song about the event, titled Атака Мертвецов (Attack of the Dead), on their 2014 album Через все времена (Through All Times).''

He was also principal cello of chamber orchestras such as the Goldsbrough Orchestra (later known as the English Chamber Orchestra, or ECO), and was an outstanding continuo cellist. Together with clarinettist Gervase de Peyer and violist Cecil Aronowitz, he helped found the Melos Ensemble in 1950.[ Biography] Chadbourne He was its principal cellist for decades, and Aronowitz its principal violist. Bassoonist William Waterhouse wrote in 1995: \\"It was the remarkable rapport between this pair of lower strings, which remained constant throughout a succession of distinguished leaders, that gave a special distinction to this outstanding ensemble.\\" His close association with Benjamin Britten began in 1946, when he played in the premiere of his opera The Rape of Lucretia in the first postwar season of the Glyndebourne Festival. He took part in each of the early Aldeburgh Festivals, including in the premieres of Britten's operas Albert Herring and Noye's Fludde. The composer conducted the Melos Ensemble in the first performance of his War Requiem in Coventry in 1962, and also in the first recording of it in 1963. Weil premiered the Suite for viola and cello by Arthur Butterworth with Cecil Aronowitz in 1951.Works by Butterworth In the 1960s, he was cellist of the Cremona Quartet under leader Hugh Maguire, with Iona Brown as second violinist and Aronowitz as violist.Obituary Iona Brown The Guardian, Anne Inglis, 10 June 2004 In the Pro Arte Piano Quartet he played with Kenneth Sillito (violin), Aronowitz and Lamar Crowson (piano). In 1974, he became the first Professor of Chamber Music at the newly opened Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Among the student groups he coached was the Brodsky Quartet. The institute regularly awards a Terence Weil prize to the best chamber music ensemble.Terence Weil Memorial Competitions He retired to Cadaqués in 1985.  Recordings  His long discography includes many notable recordings with the Melos Ensemble, including the Trout Quintet and octets of Schubert, the Clarinet Quintet of Mozart and the Clarinet Quintet of Brahms. Their recordings of chamber music for both woodwinds and strings were reissued in 2011, including the works for larger ensembles which were the reason to found the ensemble, such as Beethoven's Septet and Octet, Schubert's Octet and Ravel's Introduction and Allegro, played with Osian Ellis (harp), Richard Adeney (flute), Gervase de Pexer (clarinet), Emanuel Hurwitz and Ivor McMahon (violin) and Cecil Aronowitz (viola).Melos Ensemble – Music among Friends EMI He also recorded trios and quartets by Schumann and Fauré with the Pro Arte Piano Quartet and string quartets with the Cremona Quartet. He was the cellist in a recording of Dido and Aeneas by Henry Purcell with the English Chamber Orchestra and Janet Baker.Purcell A 1964 performance of Mozart's Piano Quartet K.478 was filmed in London, with Benjamin Britten (piano), Emanuel Hurwitz and Cecil Aronowitz.Legendary British Performers Many reviews of his recordings are available in the Gramophone Archive.

It contains the single species Prenanthella exigua, which is known by the common name brightwhite.USDA Plants Profile It is native to the southwestern United States from California to Texas and it is known as far north as Idaho. Its habitat includes desert and woodlands. This annual herb produces a slender, branching stem reaching a maximum height near 40 centimeters. It has a sparse coating of glandular hairs and contains a milky juice. Most of the leaves are located near the base of the stem. They are widely lance-shaped and sometimes divided into segments. Smaller leaves occur higher on the stem; these may be reduced to scale-like structures, leaving the stem mostly bare. The inflorescence is a wide open panicle of several flower heads. Each small head is cylindrical and narrow, its base wrapped in lance-shaped phyllaries. At the tip of the head bloom 3 or 4 flowers, which are ray florets; there are no disc florets. Each floret has is white to pale pink and has a toothed tip. The fruit is a white achene with a pappus of white bristles.

He was charged of suspicion of committing war crimes during the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, becoming the first and to date only former top- official in Hungary who has been prosecuted because of political role in the communist era. Early life Béla Biszku was born in Márok, Bereg County (today Márokpapi, Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County) on 13 September 1921 as the son of György Biszku and Etelka Debreczeni, who were farm workers. After finishing six years of elementary studies and four years of state civil school, he came afterwards to the locksmith's apprenticeship for the Wertheim Elevator & Machine Manufacture in 1937. Already in 1938 Biszku was active in the youth organisation of the metalworkers in the workers' area of Angyalföld in Budapest. From 1941 to 1942, he worked at Marx & Mérei Scientific Instruments Plant, and from 1942 to 1945, he was employed by Hungarian Philips Works.Bölöny József: Magyarország kormányai. 1848–1992. 4. bőv. és jav. kiad., Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1992. 269. p. In 1943, Biszku joined Vasas Szakszervezet, the metalworker's trade union and participated energetically in organizing work. Biszku joined the Hungarian Communist Party (MKP) in 1944 and participated in the Angyalföld resistance movement that fought against the Nazi German occupation force and against the collaborationist pro-fascist Arrow Cross Party government during the end of World War II. After the war, he played a role in the organization of the Budapest Police, then he established the Angyalföld branch of the communist party. He had worked for the MKP's Budapest Party Committee since 1946. Political career For six weeks, he functioned as deputy head of the Cadre Department of the Central Leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP) in May 1949. By the 1949 parliamentary election, the MDP had established a single party state and Soviet-type totalitarian dictatorship. Biszku worked for the Cadre Department of the Budapest Party Committee until 1951, when he was replaced. Following that, he became the secretary of the Party Committee of the Kőbánya branch. He had attended the party's Political College (PF) since September 1953. He was appointed First Secretary of the Angyalföld branch's Party Committee in the Spring of 1955. Communist politicians in 1960, including Biszku (right) and Kádár (middle) During the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, he recruited local pro- communist armed groups among party members and workers against the freedom fighters in the first days of the popular uprising. As a result, he was awarded with Medal for Worker-Peasant Power in April 1958, after the suppression of the revolution. Following long years of work in party organizations, Biszku sprang into prominence after the events of 1956. Between 1957 and 1961 he served as Minister of the Interior in the government of János Kádár. In this capacity, he became known for the severity he showed in suppressing and punishing after the 1956 revolution, which was one of the largest revolt against the communist government in the Eastern Bloc and its Soviet-imposed policies, was defeated. Between 1961-1962 Biszku became the deputy prime minister, alongside Antal Apró, Jenő Fock and Gyula Kállai. He was replaced by Lajos Fehér on 27 November 1962.Bölöny József: Magyarország kormányai. 1848–1992. 4. bőv. és jav. kiad., Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1992. 211. p. Biszku was also elected Member of Parliament during the 1958 parliamentary election, representing Constituency I in Szabolcs-Szatmár County. He was MP until April 1971, when did not stand for re-election in the 1971 parliamentary election.Történelmi Tár From 1962 until 1978, he was the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP).Szabó Miklós, M.: Adalékok a Magyar Néphadsereg 1961–1962. évi történetéhez. 1. rész.

Kádár and Biszku in 1985 Biszku, as a hard-line communist, strongly opposed the New Economic Mechanism (ÚGM) which was imposed by the Kádár regime in 1968 and contained \\"capitalist elements\\". In 1972, together with Zoltán Komócsin, and other fellow communists, he became involved in a plot to force János Kádár to resign from virtually all of his public functions in an effort to return Hungary to a more orthodox Soviet-style line. To achieve his goals, Biszku tried to convince Yuri Andropov of the rightness of his cause, who immediately alerted Kádár.Komócsin Zoltán - Nemzeti Emlékezet Bizottsága Afterwards Kádár slowly removed Biszku from power. Biszku was again MP between 1975 and 1985, representing Constituency II in Szabolcs-Szatmár County. He was forced into retirement in 1978, when Károly Németh replaced him as Secretary of the Central Committee. From 1980 to 1989, he served as Chairman of the Audit Committee of the National Council of Trade Unions (SZOT). The MSZMP's leadership adopted a new electoral system for the 1985 parliamentary election which imposed a multiple candidacy system in each constituency. Biszku was defeated by another MSZMP member and lost his parliamentary seat. Retirement From 1989, the end of communism and transition to democracy until 2011, he successfully evaded any kind of prosecution for human rights abuses committed under the Kádár regime while living in relative obscurity, and sought to portray the regime in a favorable light. In the summer of 2008, Hungarian blogger and documentary filmmaker Fruzsina Skrabski published a post with the title \\"Kommunisták, reszkessetek!\\", where she announced a search for still living former Communist politicians.Kommunisták, reszkessetek! Skrabski and Tamás Novák presented themselves as members of a non-existent local organization to Biszku, claiming that they intended to make a movie about him, \\"Márokpapi's famous son\\". They disclosed their true intention only during their last meeting, after organizing a fake celebration with background performers in the village. At first, Biszku did not reject his contribution and answered sensitive political questions also. There, Biszku called the 1956 revolution a \\"counter-revolution\\" and added he had not felt any regret or remorse for the death penalties and retaliatory measures. He also said that Imre Nagy, prime minister of the revolution, had \\"deserved his fate\\".Biszku: Nagy Imre megérdemelte Biszku first consented to the premiere but after major media coverage, withdrew his permission. His family also protested against screening in a cinema in Budapest.Biszku Béla letiltotta a róla készült film bemutatóját, Heti Válasz, 2010-06-10. The documentary movie entitled \\"Crime Without Punishment\\" was screened in June 2010. Later, Biszku's daughters, after seeing the movie contributed to the projection.Levetítették a Biszku Béláról szóló dokut Múlt-kor, 2010-06-16.„Senkitől nem kérek bocsánatot!” - levetítették a Biszku Béláról szóló dokumentumfilmet, Origo, 2010-06-16. The parliamentary Committee on Culture and Media also supported the screening and the national assembly later adopted a law that historical documentaries in general should not be banned from public showing on grounds of rights to privacy.Biszku-film: monstre vita a Parlamentben – Heti Világgazdaság, 2010-06-30 Criminal investigation and trial The National Assembly adopted a so-called \\"lex Biszku\\" bill, which aims to prosecute former leading communist politicians and law enforcement officials who are seen as responsible for the deterring of the 1956 uprising.T/4714: Az emberiesség elleni bűncselekmények elévülhetetlenségérőlHír24: Gulyás Gergelyt küldte a Fidesz Biszku Bélára Gergely Gulyás told a press conference in October 2011 that the bill is constitutional and consistent with international law.Fidesz plans legislation aimed at individuals involved in post-1956 reprisals , Politics.hu, 19 October 2011; accessed 21 January 2012 A criminal investigation against Biszku was opened in 2011. He is being charged with \\"denial of communist crimes\\" that may result in a three-year jail sentence. On 10 September 2012, Biszku was placed under house arrest on charge of suspicion of committing war crimes. He is the first politician of the 1956 Communist leadership to face a criminal inquiry. He is accused of failing to protect civilians in wartime. In addition, he needs to hold responsibility for ordering the security forces to open fire on crowds. In case, he is found guilty of the charges brought up against him, which he himself has denied, he could face a life imprisonment. His trial was scheduled to begin on 18 March 2014. On May 13, 2014, he has been found guilty of war crimes during the suppression of the 1956 uprising. He was convicted of ordering security forces to open fire on civilians, killing 49 people, and was sentenced to five years and six months in prison. Biszku was also found guilty of other charges, including \\"denial of communist crimes\\". However, the Metropolitan Court of Appeals set aside the first degree sentence and ordered a new trial on 1 June 2015. The Court of Appeals argued that there were \\"essential and substantive differences between establishing historical responsibility and criminal responsibility.\\" During the repeat procedure, the Metropolitan Court of Budapest sentenced Biszku to two years in prison, suspended for three years for complicity in war crimes on 17 December 2015. The court also ruled, however, that there was insufficient evidence that Biszku as Minister of the Interior and member of the MSZMP's so-called Provisional Executive Committee had issued the order to fire on 49 protesters in Salgótarján in December 1956 or beat up academics in March 1957. Biszku died in Budapest on 31 March 2016 at the age of 94, before the potential sentence of the repeat procedure's second degree.

Sitting atop State Street Hill (Capitol Hill) it replaced the earlier decaying Fort Orange along the Hudson River. The fort was named for Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, son of King George II. The fort was referred to as Fort Albany in the 1936 novel Drums Along the Mohawk. Several historical markers have been placed west of the location of the fort. History Fort Frederick in 1695 After the English takeover of New Netherland, including Beverwyck which became Albany, the Duke of York and of Albany (later James II & VII) required a permanent garrison to keep the peace in Albany; therefore Fort Frederick was built atop State Street Hill in 1676 to replace Fort Orange and guard the approaches to Albany from the west. Whereas Fort Orange was constructed more as a trading post along the Hudson River this new fort was designed to protect Albany from the Native Americans to the west and by overlooking the riverside community from atop a steep hill it was a constant reminder of English rule over the dominant Dutch population. The fort was located at the intersection of Lodge and State streets, construction began in March and concluded in June. Originally a wooden stockade it consisted of two small buildings surrounded by a stockade, Ensign Silvester Salisbury was the first commander of the fort. The fort became property of the English Crown when the Duke of York and of Albany became King James II & VII. As the frontier pushed west and north away from Albany the fortifications at Albany became less important as a defense against attack. It was rebuilt as a masonry fortification 1702–35, as part of a general province-wide upgrade to forts, with 21-guns and a stockade that surrounded the entire village. During the Seven Years' War (often referred to as the French and Indian Wars in the United States) the fort saw its largest contingent of British soldiers, with additional barracks, magazines, storehouses, and a hospital being built. After the war the fort fell into disrepair and during the 1760s the residents of Albany began to salvage stone, wood, and other construction material from the fort for their own uses. In 1765 the barracks, hospital, and fort were purchased by the city from the provincial government which had already by that time abandoned it. During the American Revolution what remained of the fortifications was used as a jail to house those loyal to the British. After the war the fort became an obstacle to the development of the city to the west up the hillside. The fort was dismantled in 1789 and the land deeded to St. Peter's Episcopal Church. Eventually the current St. Peter's Church bell tower would be built on the site of the northeastern bastion of the fort. Historical markers Historic marker on State Street Map of Albany in 1758. North to right. This same map appears on a commemorative marker on State Street. As part of the Albany city bi-centennial celebrations a commemorative plaque was placed on the west side of the intersection of State and Eagle streets between the curb stones and the sidewalk in front of the New York State Capitol building. In 1940 the New York State Education Department placed a state historical marker commemorating the fort as the \\"Goal of Burgoyne's Drive to Split the Colonies – 1777\\". This marker is also in front of the Capitol building. Another marker for Fort Frederick sits across the street from the other two. This marker is in a median in the middle of State Street at the base of a pole mounted clock. This marker shows the portrait of Fort Frederick by James Eights and a map of the stockaded Albany community.

Plot At Iolani Palace, Princess Kaiulani and the rest of the royal family prepare for a ceremony that night to light Honolulu with only electricity. That night however the ceremony is interrupted when a large group of armed white men enter the palace grounds. Led by Lorrin Thurston, the men demand that Ka'iulani's uncle, King Kalakaua, sign a new constitution to restrict the power of the monarchy as well as to grant huge governmental powers to citizens of European ancestry. The situation soon devolves into a tense standoff between Thurston's men and the Royal Guards. Amidst the chaos of the moment Ka'iulani is taken away for her own safety by her Scottish father, Archie Cleghorn, and sent to England for both protection and education. Now in England, Ka'iulani struggles to fit in as her Polynesian heritage makes her a target of racism and offensive stereotypes from the Europeans whom she meets. She does make some friends, including the handsome young Clive Davies. They develop a relationship and the two become engaged. But one day her father returns from Hawaii after several years and, to her shock, informs her that her uncle, King Kalakaua, had died shortly after being forced to sign the new constitution by Thurston and Sanford B. Dole. He then informs her that a failed native rebellion against the new constitution gave Thurston a reason to arrest and depose Queen Liliuokalani, overthrowing the monarchy and declaring Hawai'i a republic. After discovering that the Davies family knew of her family's overthrow but hid the news from her Ka'iulani decides to call off her engagement and leave England. She travels to the United States where she gathers media attention and denounces the overthrow as well as the U.S.'s involvement. Her cultured, regal appearance overcomes the racist views against her, and many note that she is not the \\"Barbarian Princess\\" she was depicted as at all. Her campaign against the overthrow climaxes with her meeting U.S. President Grover Cleveland. At a lunch with the President, Ka'iulani charms him and convinces him to actively oppose the overthrow, which he does by refusing to annex Hawaii as an American territory. Unfortunately for Ka'ilulani, this act is done during the waning days of the Cleveland administration, and a few weeks later President William McKinley is inaugurated. When Ka'iulani returns to Hawaii, she learns the new president has not only failed to oppose the overthrow but has also accepted Thurston's annexation proposal, annexing Hawaii as a territory of the United States. She attends a small private funeral for the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, hosted by her aunt, Queen Liliuokalani. Shortly after her return, she is visited by Sanford B. Dole, who explains that three U.S. legal commissioners are arriving, and that he and Thurston would like the Princess to host a small dinner for them. Though she is appalled at the impertinent request, he convinces her that it might be to her advantage too. At the dinner, Ka'iulani charms her visitors before surprising Thurston by publicly petitioning for an amendment to the annexation treaty to guarantee universal suffrage and voting rights to all Native Hawaiians. She is disregarded by an appalled Thurston, who points out she is not a recognized diplomat before Dole stands up for the princess and declares he will petition the amendment for her. As the amendment gathers support amongst the dinner guests, Thurston leaves, embarrassed and angry. After the dinner, Ka'iulani is surprised to learn that her former fiancee Clive has come to Hawaii, as he had promised he would, and she goes to see him. He tells her that his father has died and he is now in charge of his assets, including those in Hawaii. The two make up, and Clive asks Ka'iulani to return to England and marry him. She refuses, stating that her future is in Hawaii. When he equally refuses to move to Hawaii, the two share a last farewell kiss before Clive leaves for England. The film ends with Ka'iulani returning her treasured seashells, which she had kept throughout her travels to remind her of Hawaii, back to the ocean as she wades in the waves, with a voiceover saying that the bright flame of Ka'iulani is kept alive by the love of her people. A post-credits card shows that Ka'iulani died less than one year after the annexation, some say of a broken heart for the loss of her kingdom. Another card mentions that in 1993 President Clinton signed the Apology Resolution, apologizing to Hawaii for the role the United States government played in the overthrow.

In response, the title was briefly changed to The Last Princess, changed to Princess Kaiulani later in 2008, then shown as Barbarian Princess for the 2009 festival. The producers stated that the title was meant to be ironic and is meant to draw audiences who may not be familiar with the history of Hawaii. The film was finally released for wider distribution as Princess Kaiulani. Many native Hawaiians were disappointed that the film used a non-Hawaiian for the title role. Critical reception , the film holds a 18% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 38 reviews with an average rating of 4.53/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"A middling biopic about an important figure in Hawaiian history, Princes Kaiulani looks and feels like a TV movie of the week and offers about as much insight.\\" Roger Ebert called it an \\"interesting but creaky biopic.\\" Hailed by the Hollywood Reporter and panned by the New York press, Princess Kaiulani was either praised or left audiences cold. The film won the Audience Award for \\"Best Feature\\" at the 2009 Honolulu International Film Festival in a tie with Precious: Based on the Novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire.

Origins The origins of the Quda'a are obscure, with the claims of medieval Arab genealogists being contradictory.Kister, p. 315. Some claimed that Quda'a, the tribe's progenitor, was a son of Ma'add, thus making the tribe northern Arabians, or a descendant of Himyar (south Arabians), basing their claims on traditions and quotes attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Among these alleged utterances of Muhammad were that Ma'add's kunya was Abū Quḍāʿa (\\"Father of Quda'a\\") or that he explicitly stated Quda'a was a descendant of Himyar. Some medieval traditions harmonized these seemingly contradictory claims by holding that Quda'a's mother was the wife of Malik ibn 'Amr ibn Murra ibn Malik ibn Himyar, and that she later wed Ma'add, bringing Quda'a with her; thus Quda'a became known as a son of Ma'add, albeit not a biological one. This tradition is espoused by Ibn Abd Rabbih, who further notes that \\"Quda'a\\" was an epithet meaning \\"leopard\\" and the progenitor's actual name was 'Amr.Ibn Abd Rabbih, p. 275. Other traditions hold that at the dawn of the Umayyad era, the tribes of Quda'an embraced their descent from Ma'add, but under political pressure and bribes from the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiyah, switched their traditional line of descent to Himyar; by doing so, they embraced a Southern Arabian identity in the historical division of Arab tribes along southern and northern lines. Sub-tribes The major sub-tribes of the Quda'a were the Juhaynah, Banu Kalb, Bali, Bahra', Khushayn, Jarm, Udhrah, Banu al-Qayn and Salih. The tribes of Tanukh, Khawlan and Mahra are sometimes recorded as part of Quda'a, but some genealogists dispute their association with the tribe. Over time, some tribes of Quda'a joined other confederations, took on a different pedigree and changed their tribal identity.

Derailment All 14 coaches of the 09:27 London Liverpool Street to Cromer express derailed whilst travelling through the station at speed. Ten passengers and a luggage porter were killed when several of the carriages somersaulted on to the platforms causing considerable damage to the rolling stock and the station. Seventy-one passengers were seriously injured.http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/eventsummary.php?eventID=72 This remains to this day the worst single loss of life in a railway accident in Essex. Enquiry The subsequent enquiry found that the derailment occurred at a trailing crossover which was being worked on by three platelayers. The three maintained they had just been clearing and repacking the ballast which would not have impaired the stability of the track; and the only contributing cause was the high speed of the train. Witness However six weeks later a further witness was found, a shunter who was waiting for the express to pass before reporting to the signal box, who stated he saw that 'key was out of the rail' and saw the rail jump up as the locomotives passed the crossover and the leading coach plough into the ballast. When the enquiry was reopened the three platelayers stuck to their original story. But when the driver and fireman of the express were recalled they recounted that as their train approached Witham the three men were working furiously on the track ahead; so furiously that the driver feared they would not move out of the way in time; and that all three had their eyes riveted to a certain point of the track. Final conclusions The reconvened enquiry therefore found that the platelayers had rashly loosened the rail fastening and had been unable to make good their mistake in time.

London Journal of Botany 6: 120-121 in Latin There is only one known species Pterygopappus lawrencii (Sage cushion plant) which is endemic to alpine Tasmania. It forms thick, light blue/green mats with densely packed leaves. It is most common in the mountains of the northeastern part of the island. It is a slow grower and prefers cool, moist environments.Flann, C (ed) 2009+ Global Compositae Checklist  Description  P. lawrencei has a noticeably tufted habit and is easily identified by its sage-green leaves which are no more than 5mm long.These leaves are tightly congested and can be said to resemble a small cabbage or rose. They are covered in very fine, small and white hairs. Beneath the tightly grouped sets of leaves, stems elongate at a rate which is equal to the rate at which new leaves are produced. It is therefore difficult to identify which leaves are connected to which stem. This is the main method for how this species spreads across the alpine landscape. From the centre of the small ‘rosette’ emerges a white, small daisy like flower between December- March. The fruit of this species is an achene.  Habitat and distribution  P. lawrencei is found in montane heathlands, alpine vegetation areas and wet screes. It is distributed mostly across the east of Tasmania especially in the Central Plateau areas of Mount Field National Park and Cradle Mountain National Park. The habitat of the species displays the hardiness of the plant. It is ideally found in areas with a thin and peaty soil, the product of heavily eroded dolerite and silaceous bedrock, where most of the soil has been removed by glacial processes. It is also constantly exposed to high winds, snow and low temperatures It is unusual to find an area of P. lawrencei growing as a monoculture as they most often occur within a mosaic of other cushion plant species such as Donatia novae-zelandiae, Dracophyllum minimum, Abrotanella forsteroides and Schizacme archeri. This ability to grow extremely close and integrate with other cushion plant species is part of the reason for their success in these trying conditions. The tightly packed leaves enable a reasonably constant temperature to be maintained at the core of the plant, and their low and spreading nature enables them to miss the worst of the wind sweep.  Ecological importance  The species can be described as an engineering or foundation species, due to its ability to create tarns and small rivers in alpine areas. Collectively, cushion plants promote species richness. They have been found to attract a greater diversity of species in alpine areas compared to non-cushion plants, provide both refuge for arthropods as well as a pollination resource for insects.  Threats  One of the major threats to alpine vegetation is fire, although this is a species which is able to recover from fire reasonably well. However, foot traffic from bushwalkers greatly damages these plants, especially in very wet or waterlogged areas. Damaged plants may take up to 10 years to fully recover, in which time erosion is increased due to lack of soil stability created by these plants. Insects and arthropods which depend upon these species for food and refuge may also decrease in these areas.

He was admitted at Corpus Christi College, Oxford on 27 October 1737, at the age of thirteen, and was elected scholar in 1737 and fellow in 1747. He graduated B.A. 1741, M.A. 1744, B.D. 1753, and D.D. 1758. In 1759 he was one of the preachers at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, and on 23 April in that year he was instituted, on the nomination of John Green, bishop of Lincoln, to the rectory of Middleton Stoney, Oxfordshire, which he resigned in 1792 in favour of his son, the Rev. Egerton Robert Neve (1766–1818). In 1762 he was appointed by his college to the rectory of Letcomb-Bassett, Berkshire, but he vacated it two years later, on his preferment to the rectory of Godington, Oxfordshire, which he kept for the rest of his life. From 1783 to his death in 1798 Neve held the Lady Margaret professorship of divinity at Oxford and the sixth prebendal stall in Worcester Cathedral. He was also chaplain of Merton College, Oxford, and the second Bampton lecturer. He was partly paralysed for several years before his death, which took place at Oxford on 1 January 1798. He left a wife, three sons, and two daughters. Works Neve's chief works were: *Animadversions upon Mr. Phillips's History of the Life of Cardinal Pole, 1766, against Thomas Phillips; some of the criticisms of Neve were expressed in very strong terms, and Phillips replied in the third edition (pp. 248 et seq.) of his Study of Sacred Literature, to which is added an Answer to the Principal Objections to the History of the Life of Cardinal Pole. *Eight Sermons [ 250 ] preached before University of Oxford in 1781 as Bampton Lecturer, 1781. *Seventeen Sermons on Various Subjects, 1798. A posthumous work, published for the benefit of his family. Six letters addressed to him by Maurice Johnson on antiquarian topics were printed in the Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica, iii. 417-35.

It was converted for minor league baseball in 1954, replacing Mooers Field. Richmond Virginians Parker Field was the home field of the Richmond Virginians (1954–64) of the Class AAA International League. The team was moved south from Baltimore, which gained a major league team in 1954 when the St. Louis Browns moved east. Unaffiliated for the first two seasons, the Virginians became a farm club of the New York Yankees in 1956. Following the 1964 season, the team relocated northwest to Toledo, Ohio, to become the Mud Hens. Richmond Braves After an idle year in 1965, the International League returned with the Richmond Braves, who occupied the stadium for its final 19 seasons (1966–84). The team was previously the Atlanta Crackers, the AAA affiliate of the Milwaukee Braves. When the major league team moved south to Atlanta in 1966, the farm team moved north to become the Richmond Braves.

He was Laurence Professor of Classical Archaeology at Cambridge University in the 1940s, and in the early 1950s in Accra he founded what later became the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board as well as the National Museum of Ghana. He was the youngest brother of T. E. Lawrence (\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\") and his literary executor. Early life Thomas (left), Frank, Arnold (centre), Bob and Will Arnold Lawrence was born at 2 Polstead Road, Oxford, on 2 May 1900, the youngest of five sons born to Thomas Chapman (who became, in 1914, Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet), an Anglo-Irish nobleman from County Westmeath, and Sarah Junner (1861–1959). The couple were unmarried but took the names \\"Thomas Robert Lawrence\\" and \\"Sarah Lawrence\\". Their second son was T. E. Lawrence who later found fame as \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". He and Arnold Lawrence were close. The Lawrence children were brought up in Oxford by their mother who was very religious. But Arnold Lawrence expressed outspoken anti-religious views; he once stated \\"All religion is vermin\\". He attended the City of Oxford High School for Boys before joining New College, Oxford, obtaining a diploma in Classical Archaeology in 1920 and graduating with a third in Literae Humaniores in 1921.R. M. Cook, 'Lawrence, Arnold Walter (1900–1991)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, May 2009 accessed 17 October 2009 Classical archaeology was his second choice; the young A. W. Lawrence had wanted to specialise in South- American archaeology, but no British university offered a course. Arnold Lawrence was a student at the British School at Rome in 1921 and then at the British School at Athens until 1926. In 1923, Lawrence worked on the excavation of Ur which was directed by Leonard Woolley under whom T. E. Lawrence had excavated at Carchemish before the First World War. In 1925 Lawrence married Barbara Inness Thompson (1902–1986), with whom he had one child, Jane Helen Thera Lawrence (1926–1978). A. W. Lawrence was the model for \\"Youth\\" (1922/3) by Kathleen Scott Lawrence modelled for the sculptor Kathleen Scott in December 1922. The statue of \\"Youth\\" was later erected at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge. After T. E. Lawrence's death in 1935, A. W. Lawrence promoted his older brother's memory, collecting material connected to him, and attempting to correct misrepresentations of his character in the media. In 1936, A. W. Lawrence gave Clouds Hill to the National Trust; it is now a museum. T. E.'s enduring fame was a burden for A. W.; from his early twenties until the day he died, many people saw A. W. Lawrence primarily as the brother of someone else. Academic career He wrote widely on the subject of Greek architecture and sculpture as well as on fortifications in west Africa. In 1930 he was elected to the Laurence readership in Classical Archaeology at the University of Cambridge. In 1944 he succeeded A. J. B. Wace as Laurence Professor of Classical Archaeology at Cambridge and was elected to a Fellowship at Jesus College, Cambridge. In 1951 he obtained a Leverhulme research fellowship for the study of ancient fortifications, a subject inherited from T. E. Lawrence. In 1951 he resigned from his post at Cambridge to become the Professor of Archaeology at the University College of the Gold Coast where he established the National Museum and was the Secretary and Conservator of the Monuments and Relics Committee. He resigned from these posts in 1957 after Ghana became independent and soon after settled at Pateley Bridge in Yorkshire, later moving to Bouthwaite. In the summer of 1985 Lawrence was interviewed by Julia Cave for a BBC Omnibus programme about T. E. Lawrence. In September 1985, when he and his wife could no longer drive, they moved to Langford, near Biggleswade, close to where their two grandchildren were living. Following his wife's death in November 1986, Lawrence moved to the house of a friend and fellow archaeologist, Peggy Guido (1912–1994) in Devizes, Wiltshire. There he worked on preparing a new edition of his 1935 Annotated Herodotus which was never completed. He died at 44 Long Street, Devizes, on 31 March 1991 aged 90. The unfinished Herodotus material was handed over to the Bodleian Library, along with the rest of the Lawrence papers. Lawrence was a Fellow of the British Academy. Books *Lawrence, A. W.

It is located west- northwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Overview Pittsburgh IAP ARS is the home station of the Air Force Reserve Command's (AFRC) 911th Airlift Wing (911 AW). The 911 AW is part of the 4th Air Force, and its 758th Airlift Squadron flies eight C-17A Globemaster III strategic airlift aircraft. It includes approximately 1,220 Air Force Reserve members. The unit employs approximately 320 civilians, including more than 180 Air Reserve Technicians (ART) holding dual civilian and military positions. If mobilization occurs, 911 AW units deploy as part of the Air Mobility Command. The 911 AW hosts an average of 20 military flight operations per day in its role as host to the region's defense center. The 171st Air Refueling Wing (171 ARW) of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard on the airport's southwestern side is also an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained organization and operates sixteen KC-135T Stratotanker air refueling aircraft, providing air refueling and air mobility/strategic airlift services worldwide. The 171 ARW is one of three flying wings in the Pennsylvania Air National Guard and has over 400 full-time staff, consisting of Active Guard and Reserve (AGR), dual civilian-military status Air Reserve Technicians (ART) and other USAF civilians, as well as over 1,000 \\"traditional\\" part-time Air National Guard personnel. Civil Air Patrol One of the first Civil Air Patrol (CAP) Aviation Cadet Programs in the United States was established at the then-Pittsburgh Army Air Base in 1943. Since then, the CAP has had a continuous presence on the Air Reserve Station and is considered a Flagship Unit. As a key partner with the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units on Base, the CAP Squadron was a founding member of the Wings Over Pittsburgh Air Show and hosts an annual family picnic for Air Force and military families in the Metro Pittsburgh area. Wings over Pittsburgh Pittsburgh's military heritage is also rekindled each summer as the complex hosts one of the largest air shows on the east coast, Wings over Pittsburgh. The first show was held on June 4 and 5, 2000. Roughly 200,000 spectators attended the two-day show in 2005. The military end of the airport complex has also been mentioned as the best relocation site for the region's Base Exchange (BX), operated by the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES). The 2008 scheduled closing of the nearby Charles E. Kelley Support Facility and its Post Exchange (PX) brought PIT the opportunity to host the new BX facility on its military side. History Founded as a military airfield for the United States Army Air Forces to answer the region's defense needs during World War II, the airfield was a key training facility for Army Air Force Air Transport Command Aircrews. The 6th Ferrying Service Detachment was activated at the airfield on 15 July 1943, providing repair facilities for aircraft in transit between manufacturing facilities on the West Coast and Midwest to East Coast aerial ports for delivery to overseas units. Also, the 60th College Training Detachment (Army Air Forces Training Command) provided military training at the airfield. After the war, Pittsburgh Municipal Airport became a part of the Air Force Reserve, with the 444th Army Air Force (Later Air Force) Reserve Training Detachment being established at the civil airport. In January 1951 the USAF Air Defense Command (ADC) established the active-duty 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at the airport, to provide for the air defense of the Greater Pittsburgh area. During this time the Squadron was led by the legendary Robin Olds. The unit was equipped with F-86A Sabre interceptors and was under the command of the 1st Fighter-Interceptor Wing at George AFB, California, being detached to the Eastern Air Defense Force, Stewart AFB, New York. In February 1953, ADC activated the 500th Air Defense Group at PIT, along with several support squadrons to support the interceptors, which were upgraded to the F-86D model in March. In 1955 the 71st FIS was re-designated as the 42d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, the 500th ADG being re designated as the 54th Fighter Group (Air Defense), to honor notable World War II units.A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946 - 1980, by Lloyd H. Cornett and Mildred W. Johnson, Office of History, Aerospace Defense Center, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado In 1947, the PA ANG 112th Fighter Group was formed at Pittsburgh Airport, its origins being the World War II 350th Fighter Group. A component of Air Defense Command, the 146th Fighter Squadron operated various types of interceptors until 1975, when it was re-equipped with A-7D Corsair IIs and became part of Tactical Air Command. In 1991, the 112th was re-designated as an Air Refueling Group and became part of Strategic Air Command (SAC). In June 1992 it was reassigned to Air Mobility Command upon the inactivation of SAC. The 112th ARG was inactivated on 1 October 1993, with the 146th ARS transferring to the 171st Air Refueling Wing.

He supported the Parliamentarian cause in the English Civil War. Origins Northcote was the eldest surviving son of John Northcote (1570-1632) of Hayne, Newton St Cyres, near Crediton, Devon, (whose splendid monument he erected in Newton St Cyres Church) by his second wife Susanna Pollard, daughter of Sir Hugh II Pollard of King's Nympton.

On 16 July 1641, he was created a baronet.History of Parliament Online - Northcote, Sir John Having Presbyterian sympathies, on the outbreak of the Civil War, he declared for Parliament, and used his considerable wealth and influence to aid the cause. In 1642 he provided £450 to finance military action in Ireland, and in June promised more money and troops for the war in England. His actions were sufficiently notable for him to be excluded by name from the general pardon issued in November 1642 by King Charles I. In 1643 Sir John was leading a regiment of 1,200 men in Devon, and was taken prisoner by royal forces after the surrender of Exeter in September 1643. Northcote was kept captive until the autumn of 1644, when he was exchanged, and resumed his Parliamentary seat in May 1645. He subscribed to the Covenant, and was excluded from Parliament in Pride's Purge in December 1648, but returned to the House of Commons once more as Member for Devon in all three Parliaments of the Protectorate. In the last of these, during Richard Cromwell's rule, he was a frequent speaker, and after the restoration of the Rump Parliament he took a leading role in organising a petition from Devon to the Speaker that the vacant seats should be filled. In the Convention Parliament of 1660 he was elected both for Devon and for Helston, though his return for the latter was ruled void. He subsequently sat also for Barnstaple from 1667 until his death. A manuscript purporting to be the Notebook of Sir John Northcote, containing Memoranda of Proceedings during the first session of the Long Parliament, 1640 was published in 1887. However, its authenticity was challenged on the grounds that it covered a period before Sir John had a seat in the House.

A complex interactive 3D reconstruction (a 3D visualization based on 420 paraffin histological sections) of the body of an individual of this species has been available since 2009.  Taxonomy  Pseudunela cornuta is the type species of the genus Pseudunela. Challis, who described the species in 1970, claimed to have deposited the holotype of Pseudunela cornuta, 20 paratypes and a slide with the radula of a further paratype in the Natural History Museum, London; furthermore, he claimed that 10 paratypes and a slide with another radula were deposited in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington; he said that the remaining paratypes and the sectioned material were stored in his private collection. However, Neusser et al. (2009) found no evidence that the material ever arrived at these destinations. It seemed clear that no type material of Pseudunela cornuta was ever actually deposited in a public institution. Thus Neusser et al. (2009) designed the section series ZSM N° 20071911 (from a newly found specimen from the same collecting site as some of the material that was used for the original description) as a neotype, because of the apparent non-existence of the original type material. The sections of the neotype are deposited in the Zoologische Staatssammlung München, Mollusca Section.  Distribution  Pseudunela cornuta is known from the Solomon Islands. The type locality (for the neotype) is the beach of Komimbo Bay, near Tambea Village, (coordinates: 09°15.843'S, 159°40.097'E). 3D reconstruction of the general anatomy of Pseudunela cornuta.  Description  Pseudunela cornuta shows an anterior head-foot complex and a posterior elongated visceral hump in which the animal can partly retract when disturbed. The paired labial tentacles are broad at the base, tapering to the end and usually held at 45°-90° to the longitudinal axis of the specimen. The paired rhinophores are tapered and usually point forward like horns in crawling animals. Eyes are present, but not visible externally. The densely ciliated foot is as broad as the anterior head-foot complex and extends about one third of the visceral hump in the crawling animal. The free end of the foot is pointed. The size of the worm-like body in living specimens is about 3 mm. The body colour is whitish and translucent. In the anterior part of the visceral hump, the heart bulb is visible externally on the right side of the body. A few elongate, subepidermal spicules of up to 40 μm in length can be found in the posterior part of the visceral hump. Organ complexity as seen in Pseudunela cornuta (regarding excretory and reproductive features, at least) represents innovations that evolved in small, mesopsammic marine acochlidians. nervous system of Pseudunela cornuta shows ganglia and their interconnections with nerves. 3D reconstruction of the right view of the central nervous system of Pseudunela cornuta.  Central nervous system  The central nervous system of Pseudunela cornuta is euthyneurous and composed of the paired cerebral, rhinophoral, optic, pedal, pleural, buccal and gastro-oesophageal ganglia as well as three distinct ganglia on the visceral nerve cord, plus a presumed osphradial ganglion. All ganglia excluding the buccal and gastro-oesophageal ganglia are situated pre- pharyngeally. The central nervous system is epiathroid; the pleural ganglion is located closer to the cerebral ganglion than to the pedal one. All ganglia consist of an outer cortex containing the nuclei and an inner medulla. The large cerebral ganglia are linked by a robust commissure and lie dorsal to the pedal ganglia. Anteroventrally, the robust labiotentacular nerve emerges innervating the labial tentacle. A rhinophoral ganglion is situated anterodorsally to each cerebral ganglion connected by a short, single cerebro- rhinophoral connective. The rhinophoral nerve arises from the rhinophoral ganglion extending to the rhinophore. A small, unpigmented eye is connected by the thin optic nerve to the rhinophoral nerve, slightly anterior to the rhinophoral ganglion. An optic ganglion is attached laterally to each cerebral ganglion and connected to the latter by a thin nerve. The optic ganglion is surrounded by an additional layer of connective tissue shared with the cerebral ganglion. Precerebral anterior accessory ganglia, as described for microhedylacean acochlidians and Tantulum elegans, are absent. A Hancock's organ could not be detected. The paired pedal ganglia lie posteroventrally to the cerebral ganglia, and are connected by a commissure which is slightly longer than the cerebral commissure. A statocyst with a single otolith is attached dorsally to each pedal ganglion. The static nerve could not be detected. Two pedal nerves emerge from each pedal ganglion, one in the anterior and another in the posterior part, both innervating the foot. The pleural ganglion is located posterior to the cerebral ganglion and connected to the latter and the pedal ganglion by short connectives forming the pre- pharyngeal nerve ring. The pleural ganglia are connected by very short connectives to the visceral nerve cord, so that the latter is located at the very beginning of the pharynx. There are three distinct ganglia on the short visceral nerve cord: the left parietal ganglion, the fused subintestinal/visceral ganglion and the fused right parietal/supraintestinal ganglion. While the left pleuro-parietal, the parietal-subintestinal/visceral and the right pleuro-parietal/supraintestinal connectives are very short, the subintestinal/visceral-parietal/supraintestinal connective is long. An additional presumed osphradial ganglion is linked to the fused parietal/supraintestinal ganglion. Anteriorly, a nerve emerges and innervates the right body wall; no histologically differentiated osphradium could be detected. The buccal ganglia are positioned posterior to the pharynx and are linked to each other by a short buccal commissure ventral to the oesophagus. The thin cerebro-buccal connective emerges anteriorly from each buccal ganglion and was not traceable along the entire length. A smaller gastro- oesophageal ganglion lies dorsally to each buccal ganglion and is connected to the latter by a short connective.  Digestive system  3D reconstruction of the digestive system of Pseudunela cornuta shows for example: mouth (mo), pharynx (ph), salivary glands (sgd, sgr, sgl) and digestive gland (dg, hepatopancreas). Digestive system: The mouth opening lies ventrally between the labial tentacles. The paired anterior pedal glands discharge ventral to the mouth opening to the exterior. The oral tube is long and not ciliated. Paired oral tube glands are flanking the oral tube and discharge in its anterior part. The muscular pharynx is bulbous and narrows to the posterior; it contains the hook-shaped radula. The upper ramus is longer than the lower one. The radula formula could not be examined. Jaws are absent. The long, ciliated oesophagus emerges posterodorsally from the pharynx and is flanked by longitudinal muscles. One pair of large salivary glands discharges into the oesophagus via narrow salivary gland ducts directly behind the pharynx. The large, sac-like digestive gland is placed at the left side of the visceral hump flanking the ovotestis and extends almost up to the end of the visceral hump. The intestine is densely ciliated and short. The anus opens slightly anterior, but separate to the nephropore and ventrolaterally on the right side of the visceral hump.  Excretory and circulatory systems  The excretory and circulatory systems are located at the right side of the body just at the beginning of the visceral hump. The circulatory system shows a large two- chambered heart consisting of an anterior ventricle and a smaller, posterior atrium. The thin-walled pericardium surrounding the heart could not be detected because of the very compressed tissue. The aorta arises anteriorly from the ventricle and leads to the head, where the aorta bifurcates approximately at the level of the eyes ending in blood sinuses. The renopericardioduct is a well-developed and heavily ciliated funnel. The kidney is a sinuously bent sac and extends over almost the half of the visceral hump. Internally it is divided into a narrow lumen bordered by tissue with small vacuoles, and a wide lumen limited by highly vacuolated tissue. Both lumina join in the posterior part of the kidney. The renopericardial duct is connected to the narrow lumen in the anterior part of the kidney. The connection between the kidney and the nephroduct is narrow and ciliated. The nephroduct is long and looped with a dorsal branch extending backward and a ventral branch forward. The ventral branch is looped dorsally in its distal part. The nephropore opens just posterior, but separate to the anus and ventrolaterally on the right side of the visceral hump.  Reproductive system  The reproductive system of Pseudunela cornuta is simultaneous hermaphroditic. The anterior genitalia show a special androdiaulic condition: the vas deferens does not branch off in a proximal position as usual in androdiaulic nudibranch or acteonoidean species, but more distally, i.e. autosperm must pass through the nidamental glands. Nevertheless, this reproductive system is not strictly monaulic, because the internal vas deferens (for autosperm) is separated from the distal portion of the oviduct. The sac-like ovotestis extends over the half of the right side of the visceral hump and is not separated into follicles; oocytes are located more in the exterior part of the gonad and the spermatocytes are positioned more in the centre. Sperm heads are short. Approximately 10 yolky oocytes were noted in the examined specimen. Anterior to the ovotestis there is a small receptaculum seminis containing sperm cells oriented with their heads to the wall, as well as a sac-like ampulla filled with unoriented autosperm. Three nidamental glands can be distinguished: the albumen, membrane and mucous gland from proximal to distal, respectively. The tube-like albumen gland is characterized by cells containing dark blue stained vesicles and long cilia. The membrane gland is tube-like with long cilia as well. In the proximal part, vesicles are stained purple, in the distal part, lilac. The mucous gland is sac-like with short cilia. It shows the same histological staining properties as the distal membrane gland. The distal part of the mucous gland extends to the right side of the body wall where the hermaphroditic duct divides into the vas deferens and the oviduct. The oviduct widens to a cavity. At the distal end of the cavity a long, narrowly coiled bursa stalk branches off leading to the large bursa copulatrix. No spermatocytes can be detected inside the bursa, but an indeterminable mucous mass that might contain degenerated sperm. The distal oviduct extends to the female gonopore opening ventrolaterally on the right side of the visceral hump to the exterior. The female gonopore is situated considerably anterior to the anus and the nephropore. The internal, subepidermal vas deferens extends along the right body side to the right rhinophore connecting to the anterior male copulatory organs. The short posterior-leading vas deferens joins the large, tubular prostate gland. Anteriorly, the long and highly coiled, muscular ejaculatory duct arises from the prostate. The ejaculatory duct enters the muscular penis at its base and discharges at the top of the penis through a long hollow stylet. The penial stylet is about 600 μm long and corkscrew-like coiled with one and a half spirals. This stylet can be partly retracted into the penial muscle that is able to evert to a certain extent. The blind ending glandular paraprostate is longer and thinner than the prostate, and in contrast to the latter, highly coiled. It is connected by the paraprostatic duct to the muscular basal finger, which is united to the penial muscle mass at its base. The paraprostatic duct enters the basal finger approximately in the middle of the muscle and opens terminally via a hollow curved stylet of about 110 μm length. The penis, the basal finger and parts of the ejaculatory and paraprostatic ducts are surrounded by a thin-walled penial sheath. The latter, together with the copulatory organs, probably can be protruded through the male gonopore just at the base of the right rhinophore during the sperm transfer. However, sperm transfer has never been observed in living specimens.  Ecology  Pseudunela cornuta is a minute species that lives in the spaces between sand grains in saltwater habitats, and it is thus considered to be a mesopsammic (), marine interstitial animal that is part of the meiofauna of marine sands.

Twelve were produced, selling mostly to Clubs; one aircraft survives. Design and development First flown in May 1930, the Robinson Redwing appeared at the peak of the boom in light aircraft enthusiasm in the UK. It was a single bay biplane with simple, parallel pairs of interplane struts. With only slight stagger, the wings were easy to fold. They had equal span and chord and were unswept, with straight and parallel edges apart from rounded tips and a wide cut-out at the centre of the trailing edge for pilot visibility. The fuselage was rectangular in cross section, tapering rearwards and with a rounded decking. It was plywood covered and carried a conventional tail with a broad chord fin and balanced rudder. The tailplane was fixed to the top of the fuselage and the elevators were divided to allow rudder movement. Pilot and passenger sat side by side under the upper wing. Ahead of them the fuselage tapered to the engine mounting. The wide track undercarriage was of split axle type, with main legs sloping forward from the wheels to the upper fuselage longerons and with a pair of bracing struts rearwards to the keel. The undercarriage was completed with a tailskid. The first prototype, later known as the Redwing I flew under the power of a 75 hp (56 kW) A.B.C. Hornet flat four air-cooled engine, but trials during the summer of 1930 suggested a different powerplant. As a result, the second Redwing flew with an 80 hp (60 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Genet IIA five cylinder radial, becoming known as the Redwing II. The next eight aircraft were also built as Redwing IIs, but the last two produced began as Redwing IIIs. These had wings of smaller span – in compared with ) – and much reduced wing area ( compared with ) and wheel fairings, both modifications aimed at improved cross-country performance. The first of these was delivered in May 1933 but failed to get a Certificate of Airworthiness until refitted with full area wings in 1934; the second was returned to Redwing II standard before its sale. Operational history Most of the twelve Redwings built, including the two prototypes, went to aeroclubs. Six, for example went to the Eastern Counties Aeroplane Club. One of these, G-ABMJ was previously owned by, amongst others the comedian Will Hay. Eventually this machine was sold in Ireland and another in New Zealand. One of the principal problems encountered in club use was a tendency for the main undercarriage leg to break at the junction with the upper longeron. Spares became scarce, cannibalism broke out and the last club machine crashed in the autumn of 1935. The Redwing that travelled furthest was the ex-Mk III, G-ABRL which left Croydon, flown by Mrs Keith Miller, set for Cape Town. She crossed the Sahara after 21 days, reaching Gao in Mali on 24 January 1935. A few days later the aircraft had to make a forced landing and was wrecked on hitting a tree near Kotonu in Benin. The last surviving Redwing is G-ABNX. From sometime around the start of World War II it was mostly in store, with only a brief outing in 1951; it was flying in the 1980s and was used in the children's Serial 'Brendon Chase' Episode 3. This TV series was never sold in VHS or DVD format but it can be found on YouTube. The aircraft had a permit to fly which expired in May 2003.CAA registration of G-ABNX In 2006 it was at Redhill Aerodrome in non-flying condition. After being owned by a consortium of owners during the 2000s it was recently purchased by the grandson of the original NZ importer, who is currently having it restored at Durley, near Southampton. Airport bases In 1930 the Robinson Redwing aircraft were built at the Robinson Aircraft company based in Croydon. In 1931, the company was reconstituted & became known as the Redwing Aircraft Co Ltd. In 1932, the designer & founder of the company John Kenworthy was appointed to the board and Redwing Aircraft Co moved the whole fleet of 12 aircraft to Gatwick. The aerodrome was also purchased & used as a new flying base. However, in 1934 Redwing Aircraft Co. moved back to Croydon aerodrome.

Within its community the parish is normally referred to as simply The Church of the Epiphany. Location The church building and parish hall are located at 1839 Arroyo Avenue, San Carlos, California, at the corner of Cedar Street and Arroyo Avenue. This is a residential area, across from a large city park, Burton Park. On some Sundays, such as Palm Sunday, the 10 am service may start in the park and proceed into the church. Outreach and service The Church of the Epiphany has active outreach and service activities within its own parish, within the San Francisco Bay Area, the United States, and internationally. There are too many such activities, and they change too frequently, to be listed here: a complete list is found at the church web site. But an example of each of these include: Local parish work: Lay Eucharist ministers bring communion to homebound or hospitalized parishioners. Bay area work: The Interfaith Hospitality Network (IHN) at program brings shelter, meals and support services to families without homes. Churches of several different faiths participate in this program. The families in the program are housed at Epiphany for a one to two week stay, in rotation with other churches. National Outreach: Each year the Church of the Epiphany sends its youth on a mission trip to grow spiritually and engage in service. Before 2006 these trips went to Mexico, but since then missions have involved been coordinated with the Group Workcamps Foundation, and have involved home-repair projects such as roofing and painting, for low- income people living in U.S. International service: Epiphany supports human rights by signing and mailing letters supporting prisoners of conscience and victims of torture. Information for the letters is obtained through human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Education The Church of the Epiphany has served the education of young people with nursery, church school and multiple youth activities since it was founded in 1947. The staff includes a full-time youth minister and many volunteers. Music The Church of the Epiphany has a professional Director of Music, an organist, and frequently adds other professional musicians to augment its services. The Chapel Choir, made up of parish volunteers, performs each Sunday at the 10 am sung service, and youth choir also performs on special occasions. Musical facilities include a Praeludium III Galanti digital organ and an historic, 1927 Stretch A3 Steinway grand piano. Facilities The church building, parish hall, classrooms, business offices, and play yard occupy approximately two-thirds of an acre and are surrounded by mature trees and landscaped grounds. The Gothic-style church has a nave and sanctuary arranged in a miniature cathedral fashion. The nave seats 325. Forty-two stained glass windows located on all four walls of the sanctuary depict the four Gospel Evangelists and various Biblical themes. The chapel, which opens off the nave, is used for special services and for post-communion healing prayer. It seats approximately 25. Eight brightly colored tapestries, woven by a parishioner, hang on the rear wall of the church and behind the altars in the sanctuary and the chapel. The parish hall, Eastburn Hall, seats approximately 175 for meetings. The building also houses classrooms, a library, a nursery, a nursery school, and staff offices. Several community groups, such as the Interfaith Hospitality Network, Alcoholics Anonymous, and the Girl Scouts, use Eastburn Hall on a regular basis. The Church of the Epiphany has a long-term relationship with Sequoia Parents' Nursery School , a pre-school program for children ages 3 through 5 and their parents sponsored by the Sequoia Union High School District. Clergy The Church of the Epiphany installed the Rev. Melanie Donahoe as its eighth rector in 2009. The Rt. Rev. Marc Handley Andrus was elected and installed as eighth bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of California in 2006. The Most Rev. Dr. Katharine Jefferts Schori elected as the twenty-sixth Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA) in 2006. A complete historical listing of all of Epiphany's rectors is available at the church web site. Epiphany's web site The church's first site was www.quercus.org/~epiphany in 1996. Around 1999 it briefly took the name www.blessthelord.org, but that did not prove to be very popular, so after a few months it moved to www.churchoftheepiphany.org where it has been ever since. Since August 2001, each Sunday's sermon has been recorded. Sermons were first just posted on the site, but in 2007 this was complemented with a podcast. All are welcome The philosophy and policy of the Church of the Epiphany is \\"all are welcome.\\" No person is denied entrance to church services, Holy Communion, or membership in the parish. Brief history of the Beginning of the Church of the Epiphany (This section is adapted from The First Fifty Years, a history of the Church of the Epiphany, by Sandra Burnett, with the permission of the author. The complete text of this book is available on line at the church web site.) In the fall of 1946, Bishop Block and the Rev. Egbert B. Clark, rector of St. Peter's, Redwood City, California, agreed to call a new associate rector who would live in San Carlos and begin preparations to establish a mission church there. Subsequently, St. Peter's invited the Rev. Fordyce E. Eastburn, then on the staff of a cathedral in Texas, to come to California for an exploratory visit. The exploratory visit must have gone well, because Bishop Block immediately hired Eastburn as associate rector at St. Peter's. On June 18, the Bishop and Eastburn started shopping for a church site and recommended that the Diocesan Council buy property in the 1800 block of Arroyo Avenue. On Sunday, Oct. 5, 1947, Rev. Eastburn celebrated Holy Communion in the Community Church with forty people attending. This is considered the beginning of the Church of the Epiphany. That week, the new mission congregation moved to Laurel Hall, at the time the only public meeting hall in San Carlos. It was located over a bar across from the firehouse on Laurel Street between Holly Street and San Carlos Avenue. The Bishop approved the selection of \\"Epiphany\\" as the new mission's name, and the name was subsequently endorsed by the Bishop's Committee. Several reasons have been suggested for the name. One is that Epiphany Sunday is the day the Eastburns arrived on the Peninsula. A second reason, provided by Lelia Eastburn, is that it was the date her husband was ordained a deacon. Or it may have been that there wasn't another Epiphany in the diocese at the time. The Bishop's Committee (vestry) held their first official meeting Oct. 28, 1947, after the beginning of the Women's Auxiliary, which had held their first celebration on Oct. 19. The Altar Guild held its first meeting Oct. 30. During this time, Rev. Eastburn resigned as associate at St. Peter's and was appointed vicar to Epiphany by the Bishop. The first building on the site was a combination Parish Hall and chapel, which served both as a place of worship and gathering. Volunteer work on the building site started June 24, 1948 under the leadership of Arnold M. Teza, a professional building contractor and a member of the congregation. By March 7, 1949, the average number of workers was listed as thirteen on Saturdays and four on Sundays, but sometimes as many as 24 men were on the job. Work proceeded slowly, but by Sunday, May 20, 1951, fifteen people were confirmed by Bishop Block in a windowless Parish Hall in the face of a chilly breeze. In 1951, the church gave up its mission status to become a parish. A parish is generally a self-supporting entity which also supports the Diocese through an annual assessment. A mission generally receives support from the Diocese, but otherwise operates the same although some of the titles are different. A mission has a \\"vicar\\" who serves \\"vicariously\\" for the Bishop, the official rector of the mission, and forms a Bishop's Committee instead of a vestry. As the congregation grew during the 1950s, it was decided to build a separate building to serve as the chapel, and leave the parish hall to serve only non- worship functions. Construction on the chapel started in July, 1958. Stained glass window designs based on the cycle of the church year in the 1928 Book of Common Prayer were developed in both modern and traditional styles, but the traditional design was selected. The chapel was dedicated in March, 1959, by Bishop James A. Pike. Ever since then facilities work has continued with various projects and improvements. For example, in 2007, a large bricked courtyard and entrance area was added in front of the parish hall. In 1974, the parish hall was named Fordyce Eastburn Hall in honor of the first rector. Even though Rev. Eastburn left Epiphany officially in 1957, he continued his personal relationships with many of the parishioners and the parish until his death on Aug. 24, 1980.

Whether it's Celtic music, classical, blues, or jazz, Graham has no problem tackling a variety of styles and demonstrating that he really is the complete guitarist.\\"  Track listing  All songs by Davey Graham unless otherwise noted. # \\"Lord Mayo/Lord Inchiquin\\" (Traditional) – 4:30 # \\"Lashtal's Room\\" (Davey Graham) – 1:59 # \\"Ein feste Burg – 1:29 # \\"The Rod to Lisdoonvana\\" (Traditional) – 1:58 # \\"Renaissance Piece\\" (Traditional) – 1:50 # \\"Hardman the Fiddler\\" (Traditional) – 1:39 # \\"Sarah\\" – 3:55 # \\"Frieze Britches\\" (Traditional) – 3:00 # \\"Blues for Gino\\" (Davy Graham) – 2:56 # \\"The Hunter's Purse\\" (Traditional) – 1:25 # \\"Prelude from the Suite in D Minor\\" (Robert de Visée) – 1:02 # \\"Fairies' Hornpipe\\" (Traditional) – 1:30 # \\"Forty Ton Parachute\\" (Davy Graham) – 1:28 # \\"The Gold Ring\\" (Traditional) – 2:20 # \\"Down Ampney\\" (Vaughan Williams) – 0:49 # \\"Banish Misfortune\\" (Traditional) – 1:52 #: 1999 reissue bonus tracks: # \\"Dance for Two People\\" (Stanley Albert Watson) – 2:12 # \\"Bloody Fields of Flanders\\" (Alex Stuart) – 1:36 # \\"Happy Meeting in Glory\\" (Traditional) – 2:00 # \\"Farewell to the Creeks\\" (James Robertson) – 1:27 # \\"Mná na hÉireann (Women of Ireland)\\" (Traditional) – 3:29 # \\"Panic Room Blue\\" (Robertson) – 2:39 # \\"How Come You Do Me Like You Do?\\" (Willie Dixon, Memphis Slim) – 2:39 # \\"When I Been Drinking\\" (Big Bill Broonzy)– 2:00  Personnel  * Davey Graham – vocals, guitar Production notes: * Stefan Grossman – producer * John Renbourn – producer * Nic Kinsey – engineer * Joe Tarantino – remastering * Deb Sibony – design * Jamie Putnam – art direction * Duck Baker – liner notes  References  Category:Davey Graham albums Category:1978 compilation albums Category:Kicking Mule Records albums ","title":"The Complete Guitarist"},{"id":"24727196","text":"De Hoop (English: 'The Hope') is a smock mill in Sleen, Drenthe, the Netherlands, which has been restored to working order. The mill was built in 1914 and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 33787. History A mill was built here in 1850. It was a smock mill without a stage and stood until it was burnt down in 1914. To replace it, the mill known as De Gunst, also known as the Molen van Nefkens, was moved from Amersfoort, Utrecht by millwright L Reinds of Beilen. The mill was built for miller H Berends. The mill was restored between 1953 and 1956 by millwright Huberts of Coevorden. On 24 July 1956 the mill was put back to work. In 1976, millwright J D Medendorp of Zuidlaren restored the mill again. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) In 2010 the local authority Gemeente Coevorden became owner of the mill. Society \\"Sleener Molen Stichting ‘De Hoop’\\" was founded in 2012 to work the mill. Description De Hoop is what the Dutch describe as an achtkante stellingmolen. It is a three-storey smock mill with a stage on a three-storey brick base. The stage is at second-floor level, above the ground. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common Sails have a span of and are carried in a cast-iron windshaft cast by Enthuizen in 1861. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel, which has 62 cogs. This drives the wallower (30 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel, which has 113 cogs, drives the -diameter French Burr stones via a lantern pinion stone nut with 34 staves.

Early life Cardiel was born in San Jose, California, and grew up in Half Moon Bay and Grass Valley. When asked by prominent skateboard photographer Tobin Yelland in a 1998 Transworld Skateboarding interview, \\"When you were younger and skating with all your friends, did you ever think you'd get sponsored?\\", Cardiel replied: > \\"No, not at all. It wasn't about getting sponsored, it was about skating. If > you constantly think about getting sponsored, the only reason you're skating > is to get on a team. It just worked out for me. I think the majority of > skaters who are sponsored weren't really thinking about it all the time. > They just wanted to get away from home and skate.\\" Professional skateboarding Sponsors As of August 2012, Cardiel's sponsors are Vans, AntiHero, Spitfire, Independent Truck Company, Freshjive, and Chrome Industries. AntiHero AntiHero is a board company that was founded by professional skateboarder, Julien Stranger, in 1995, following a proposition from Jim Thiebaud (co-founder and owner of Deluxe Distribution), who is reported—by Jake Phelps, editor-in-chief of Thrasher magazine—to have offered Stranger the opportunity during a period of time when both Stranger and Phelps perceived skateboarding as \\"stale\\". Stranger has explained the original concept that underpinned AntiHero in the following manner: \\"Oh, there's was no concept ... well, maybe there was, I don't know. Just kind of balance out the rest, or something, with what was going on with us.\\" Phelps has stated further to Stranger's vague explanation: > \\"I think if you pay attention to life and the way things are, that you, you > come out pretty jaded by, you know, life. Or things aren't the way they > should be. I think AntiHero is a reflection of that. I think Julian's own > twisted take on things has been, like I said, there's no expectation—we just > skate, we fuck off, we have a good time. We go to trips sometimes and > nothing happened. Or sometime we go on a trip and everything happens at > once; you never know. And I think that that translates very much into John's > way of life—whether it's hunting, fishing, or whatever, John's [Cardiel] an > outdoorsman, and I think that, that hearty spirit of America translated very > well with Julian's gritty grime of, like, the city slime, into making a > really solid, 'This is what it is to us.'\\" Cardiel and Stranger first met at an amateur skateboarder contest that was held at the Powell skateboards warehouse—the contest was held around 1990/1991. In the fall 2012 catalogue release of AntiHero, Cardiel's signature skateboard decks are included in the same series as the currently active riders. Skateboarding influences Cardiel listed his top skateboarding influences of all time in an interview with the Transworld Skateboarding magazine: Mark Gonzales (\\"... just his way of looking at skateboarding, and just approaching it, is just like, forever, the gnarliest thing\\"), Christian Hosoi (\\"... for just his raw blasting airs; his smooth style; his happy-go- lucky attitude; he was always, like, \\"What's up?!\\", just, like, love ...\\"), Sacramento skateboarders (\\"... you know, Rick Windsor, straight up.\\"), and Tony Hawk (\\"... the insane 540s with no hands, and, just like, all his tricks; he had the ramps, all his ramps, all the ramps he had—I thought that was insane. Tony Hawk's the best.\\"). Cardiel identified Gonzales as his top all- time influence, stating: \\"... just everything—vert, street, like, whatever. Running, you know? Like, he's a great jumper, on feet, like, pffft. Just a human being, like, so, I'll give it up to Mark.\\" In an interview, published in January 2013, Cardiel explained his influences more generally: > \\"Basically, just like the kids around town—you know what I mean? The gnarly > rippers around town, there was this dude, his name was 'Eric Benthen'. So, > that was, basically, what inspired me in the beginning. Just, Raven Tershay, > basically, like, Emmanuel Guzman, like, ah, I see, just a lot of, a lot of > good skating right now. You know, like, I mean, Paul Rodriguez, like, these > dudes are so, on their stuff, and, like, it's just, it's just, almost > insane. It's like, ah, kung fu, like, I wanna say, like, uh, kind of like > Bruce Lee, martial arts type of thing. And they've excelled to a level where > they're just, like, masters, you know? It's like, it's just like, it's, > it's, it's impressive.\\" Influence Writing for Transworld Skateboarding in 1993, Simon Woodstock explained his perspective on Cardiel's influence on skateboarding at the time: \\"The mark John is making on the skate scene is like a terminal illness. He can never be cured and he just won't go away. John is just 100 percent balls out all the time, and he is destined to win and become a legend in his own time. If cojones were measured by the size of eggs, John Cardiel's would be those of an ostrich.\\" In December 2011, Transworld Skateboarding magazine listed Cardiel as number eleven in its \\"30 Most Influential Skaters of All Time\\" article. During the introduction of Cardiel's Sight Unseen video part, Mark Gonzales describes his view of Cardiel's skateboarding to the video's audience: > \\"Yo, so I just wanted to say a few things about John Cardiel. First off, > he's an original; his style—there's not too many people who skate like him. > The way he skates is amazing, 'cause he'll skate so fast, but it seems like > the faster he goes, the more control he has ... which is, you know, > unexplainable. But he's unbelievable. I'm not trying to kiss too much butt, > but he's a ripper, an original ripper ... He's an original Coors.\\" Accident In 2004, at the end of a four-week Australian road trip from Brisbane to Melbourne (the touring skateboarders were filming for the skateboard movie, Tent City), Cardiel was running alongside a van when he was hit by the trailer the van was pulling and then run over by the trailer. Cardiel consequently sustained a spinal cord injury and Cardiel and his mother were informed by the treating medical staff that he would not be able to walk again; however, following five months of hospital-based rehabilitation and six to twelve months in a wheelchair, Cardiel regained the use of his legs. After a hiatus, Cardiel was featured in the 2008 street fixed gear cycling film Macaframa, directed by Colin Arlen and Colby Elrick. Cardiel attributes his recovery to cycling and continues to be an advocate of street fixed gear cycling. In 2015, he was featured in the Vans Propeller video with some of his first skateboarding footage since the accident. Video game appearances Cardiel is a playable character in the Electronic Arts video games Skate 2 and Skate 3. Tributes In the final section of his part in Almost: Round Three, professional skateboarder, Daewon Song, dedicates the trick to Cardiel and another person. \\"All Hail Cardiel\\" is a tribute song in honor of Cardiel that was written and performed by Bad Shit, a band featuring Jake Phelps (editor of Thrasher magazine), Tony Trujillo (professional skateboarder), and Trixie (Trujillo's wife). In September 2012, longtime Transworld staff member and videographer, Jon Holland, selected Cardiel's Sight Unseen contribution as his favorite Transworld Skateboarding (TWS) video part. Perspectives In regard to the concept of skateboard sponsorship, Cardiel provided a detailed explanation of his perspective in 1998: > It [skateboarding] has nothing to do with being sponsored. Skating is the > more you skate, the more you're into it, and the better you get ... > Eventually you'll get sponsored or whatever. I hope kids aren't just out > there skating to get sponsored ... It seems like if you already had that in > you, to go skate as much as possible, if that happens [if you get > sponsored], you still won't lose touch with what you're really doing it > for—to have fun ... Why have the goal of getting sponsored and going pro? > Who cares? There's no goal, it's like skating. And that's what's cool, > there's so many people out there skating who aren't pro and aren't like > that. And those are the people you're hanging out with. Awards *Thrasher Magazine Skater of the Year – 1992 *Skateboarding Hall of Fame - 2015 Personal life As of 2012, Cardiel resides in Sacramento, California, and stated in July 2012 that even though he has developed a strong interest fixed-gear cycling (\\"I've been into bikes since before skating. It was the first way to get far away from the house and a taste of some freedom\\"), he \\"can't imagine\\" his life without skateboarding and that he was still \\"skaterniverous\\" (\\"I eat it!\\"). In a 2011 interview with Australian skateboarding magazine SLAM Cardiel explained that, since recovering from the Australian accident, he has purchased a set of turntables and a mixer for playing music and will perform at events—Cardiel has also supported fellow professional skateboarder/musician Ray Barbee during the latter's musical performances. Cardiel further stated, \\"At one point I'd like to open a skate shop and bike shop, but I don't have the time right now.\\" As of February 2013, Cardiel owns and operates a business named \\"Break Free Customs\\" that primarily sells custom bikes—built by Cardiel himself—in addition to skateboard decks, stickers, and shirts.

With over 200 shops, 25 restaurants and cafes, an entertainment center, a 14 cinema complex, periodic street markets and an upcoming department store, it is Beirut's largest and most diverse shopping and leisure area. Beirut Souks also features piazzas and public space. The souks have historically been at the commercial heart of Beirut. They sustained severe damage during the Lebanese Civil War and were rebuilt by Solidere according to the ancient Greek street grid, maintaining the historic landmarks and pre-war street names. History Souk Tawileh Souk al-Tawileh and Souk al-Jamil were a favorite shopping destination before the civil war and were frequented by Lebanese and Europeans alike since they housed fashionable boutiques and haute-couture houses, while Souk al-Franj functioned as Lebanon’s biggest fruit, vegetable and flower market. Destruction During the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was the scene of fierce battles between warring factions; after a few months of fighting, the brief ceasefire in September 1975 allowed the business owners of Beirut's central district to evacuate their shops' assets before fighting resumed turning downtown Beirut, including its souks into a sniper patrolled no man's land. In October 1975, fighting extended to the souks, gunmen blew up shops and set others on fire. The destruction of the souks affected Christian and Muslim merchants alike. The battle of the souks lasted for 2 and half months until December 1975 before extending to the residential area of Ras Beirut During the spring of 1983, the Antoun Bey Khan, a historic caravanserai and a landmark of the souks was demolished to clear the view towards the sea. Reconstruction Souk Ayyas Entrance to Beirut Souks from Fakhry Bey Street Souk's entrance from Rue Weygand Reconstruction of Beirut's central district began as soon as the guns fell silent in 1991. Dar Al-Handasah was commissioned by the Lebanese Council for Development and Reconstruction to prepare a master-plan for the rebuilding of the dilapidated central district. Henri Eddeh, a senior architect planner at Dar al-Handasah proposed a complete demolition of the historical city center which was to be replaced by modern buildings and infrastructure. Imam Ouzai Square The notion of bulldozing the entire cityscape stirred a heated polemic within the intellectual circles and widespread opposition to the master-plan led to the adoption of an alternate strategy aiming at preserving and renovating what could be salvaged of Beirut's historic buildings. The new master-plan drawn by Lebanese architect Jad Tabet was approved by the Lebanese parliament and its implementation started in September 1994; a private share-holding company (Solidere) was created by the Lebanese government to manage the entire process of reconstruction and rehabilitation of Beirut's central district . Except for specific landmarks that were later salvaged and restored, a large part of the souks' medieval buildings were too damaged to be saved. The void left by the destruction of the Souks left a gap in Beirut's identity, Solidere sought to bring back the souks historic commercial function at the heart of Beirut and appeal to the mercantile community that had fled to the periphery during the 16 year civil war. Solidere launched an international design competition to rebuild the souks while in keeping with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterized the old souks and the area's historical landmarks. The contest was won by José Rafael Moneo Vallés who designed the southern souk and British architect Kevin Dash who designed the Gold souks. The construction of the souks were entrusted to Lebanese firm Hourie. The master plan for the Beirut Souks was approved by ministerial decrees which preceded the launch of the reconstruction project. Costs of reconstruction were estimated at about 100 million dollars and work duration between 18 months and 2 years. The souks was set to open in 2000 but inauguration was postponed due to licensing delays related to political issues; meanwhile the construction of the underground parking was underway. In 2004 Solidere received the license and work on the souks began to be withheld in the aftermath of summer of 2006 war and the subsequent political instability. Opening Beirut Souks were opened to the public on October 2, 2009 after a 10-year delay due to political instability. The Gold Souk's opening was also delayed due to financial disagreements between the syndicate of Expert Goldsmiths and Jewelers in Lebanon and Solidere. Visitors on the opening day wandered through the few opened shops while construction works were still underway. Location Beirut Souks are located in Beirut Central District, they are delimited by Mir Majid Arslan Avenue to the North, Rue Weygand street to the south, Patriarch Howayek to the west and Allenby street to the east. Architecture and description Map of the South Souks showing the Hellenistic street grid Fakhry Bey Street The new Souks are a low rise complex of two components: the South Souks and the North Souks. The Souks were designed in five different commissions by international and Lebanese architects. They offer of floor space and of pedestrian areas that follow the ancient Greek street grid. South souks The South Souks were designed by Rafael Moneo in collaboration with Samir Khairallah while the Gold Souk was designed by Kevin Dash and his Lebanese counterpart Rafic Khoury. The Souks were designed as interconnected open spaces with many access points; there are 200 shops located along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades with 49 of these shops located in the Gold Souk. The new Souks have retained their Hellenistic street grid layout as well as their historical names; these are: Souk al Tawila (the long souk), Souk Arwam, Souk Jamil, Souk Ayyass, Souk Sayyour, Souk Bustros and Souk Arwad. Conservation Solidere's plan preserved the heritage left by the different civilizations marking the Beirut Souks' historic location from the Phoenician era until the French mandate. The archaeological findings recovered in the Souks, which have been restored, include the ancient Phoenician commercial quarter, the Medieval moat, the Mameluk Koranic madrassa of Ibn Iraq Al Dimashqi and the Byzantine mosaics excavated on site.

Gilchrist's was considered one of the big three stores (along with Filene's and Jordan Marsh) that dominated Boston's shopping district for so long. Gilchrist's opened in 1842, one year after Jordan Marsh in downtown Boston. Gilchrist's was not considered as high-end as its neighbors, but did just as well. In the 1940s Gilchrist's started to branch out into older suburban communities. By 1964 Gilchrist's had eight locations across the state of Massachusetts: Quincy, Brockton, Framingham, Medford, Waltham, Stoneham, Cambridge, and Dorchester. The company's store in Cambridge was located in the basement of the Star Market grocery store at the Porter Square shopping center. The emergence of shopping malls led to the decline of the downtown stores. Gilchrist's took a back seat to the anchor stores until closing in 1977. Its flagship Downtown Crossing store was replaced with a shopping mall called The Corner in Gilchrist's original building.

The organisations responsible for rating video games in the UK are the British Board of Film Classification and PEGI, the latter of which was elected to rate British games in 2009 and subsequently began doing so in July 2012. The United Kingdom's video game industry is estimated to employ 20,000 people. One of the United Kingdom's greatest contributions to the worldwide gaming industry was the 1982 release of the ZX Spectrum home computer. The Video Games Tax Relief (VGTR) was established in 2014 to help support creativity in the UK games industry. According to TIGA,http://www.tiga.org/repository/documents/editorfiles/reports/june_2014___guide_to_video_games_tax_relief.pdf prior to this, the UK Games industry was lagging behind other countries where game developers benefitted from substantial tax breaks and government grants: “Between 2008 and 2011, employment in the [games industry] fell by over 10 per cent and investment fell by £48 million”. Thus the UK VGTR aims to ensure the UK games industry's competitiveness on the global stage, promotes investment and job creation and encourage the production of culturally British video games. The key benefit of the tax relief is that qualifying companies can claim up to 20% of their “core expenditure” back, provided that expenditure has been made in the European Economic Area.http://insights.pollen.vc/funding/why-havent-you-applied-for-the-uk- video-games-tax-relief In recent years, Northern Ireland has made increasing contributions to the United Kingdom's video game industry. In March 2012, Parliament instated certain tax reliefs for UK game developers.  History   Early history (1950s)  Christopher Strachey's Draughts is the first verifiable video game to run on a general purpose computer, developed at the British National Physical Laboratory.  Microcomputer popularity (1981–1984)  The popularity of the ZX Spectrum was instrumental in driving the start of the UK video game industry. Whereas the North American and Japanese video game industry boomed with console games, the UK market for video games was grown out of home computers, specifically the BBC Micro by Acorn Computer in 1981, and the ZX Spectrum from Sinclair Research (alongside Sinclair's earlier ZX80 and ZX81 systems) and the Commodore 64 by Commodore International in 1982. While some of the first generation of video game consoles like dedicated Pong consoles, had made their way to the UK, they did not gain much traction. Additionally, there had been home computers available to the UK earlier than this, including the Commodore PET and Apple II (both released in 1977), but these were comparatively expensive. Computer literacy had been seen as a key skill that Britain's children should possess to help improve the technology savvy of the nation in the future, and the BBC worked with Acorn to create the low-cost BBC Micro home computer alongside a set of broadcast programming to help teach fundamentals of computers for school-aged children. This was used in up to 80% of the schools in the UK at the time, and led to creation of the Spectrum and Commodore 64 to help meet growing demand for the systems. Additionally, youth of the United Kingdom at that time were tinkerers, taking apart and repairing devices including electronics, and the nature of computer programming felt within this same scope. The United Kingdom had already had a history with board games prior to this revolution, as well as laying claim to starting the fantasy literary genre through J.R.R. Tolkien's works, a major point of inspiration for the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop role-playing game. Thus, with the ability to program their own games through these early home computers, UK developed an initial home computer game market, with games typically made by only one person with no formal experience in computer programming, known as \\"bedroom coders\\". As there were few game stores in the UK at that time, most of these coders turned to mail order, sending out copies of their games on cassette tape for use in the computer's tape drives. A market developed for companies to help such programmer sell and distribute their games. This industry took off after the release of the ZX Spectrum in 1983: by the end of that year, there were more than 450 companies selling video games on cassette compared to 95 the year before. An estimated 10,000 to 50,000 youth, mostly male, were making games out of their homes at this time based on advertisements for games in popular magazines. The growth of video games in the UK during this period was comparable to the punk subculture, fueled by young people making money from their games. One of the earliest such successful titles was Manic Miner, developed and released by Matthew Smith in 1983, sold by Bug-Byte, one of the first publishers in this market. While a loose clone of the United States-developed Miner 2049er, Manic Miner incorporated elements of British humour and other oddities. Manic Miner is considered the quintessential \\"British game\\" for this reason, and since then, inspired similar games with the same type of British wit and humour through the present. Another key title from this period was Elite, developed by David Braben and Ian Bell and released in 1984. A non-linear space exploration, trading and combat game, Elite established many of the principles of the open world gameplay concept that are used in most space simulation games today as well as influencing the Grand Theft Auto series, itself a pinnacle of open world design. Because video game consoles did not take hold in the UK during these formulative years, the video game crash of 1983 which struck the North America market has little impact on the video game industry in the UK. However, the video game industry in the UK during this period still had notable failures. The company Imagine Software, formed by former members of Bug-Byte, had become successful prior to 1982, and drew the attention of the BBC as part of a documentary series Commercial Breaks that had been examining successful businesses in new industries. During 1983 and 1984, Imagine had tried to expand its capabilities beyond game programming as well as push the idea of \\"megagames\\" that stretched a computer's hardware limits and would be sold at a higher cost, but these efforts backfired, costing Imagine staff and money. By the time the BBC began filming for this episode of Commercial Breaks, Imagine was in a downward spiral, which was notoriously documented by the BBC. Advances with the Amiga (1985–1995) The Amiga 500 created another revolution in the UK video game industry with its improved graphics capabilities. This computer game revolution was subsequently boosted by the release of the Commodore Amiga in 1985. The Amiga had more powerful graphics capabilities compared to previous home computers and enabled game developers to experiment more. Besides video games, the Amiga also helped to expand the demoscene in the UK, which in turn brought in more developers to stretch the capabilities of the computer. However, the Amiga and other similar platforms at the time were mode advanced than the ZV Spectrum and BBC Micro, and typically required a full team of developers to build games for; the bedroom coders of the previous years faded away as development companies formed to build games on these new systems. Out of this period rose a number of influential British companies on the global video game industry today: * Psygnosis was formed in 1984 after the closure of Imagine Software, and sought to bring the brightest programmers of the day to produce games that they would then publish, along with other in-house developed titles. Psygnosis' catalog has a number of highly praised titles such as Shadow of the Beast and Obliterator. The publisher was eventually acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment to develop the Wipeout series among other titles, and while the studio was shuttered in 2012, most of its activities had been adsorbed into the Sony structure. * DMA Design, which among their first titles was the best- selling Lemmings in 1991 and established the recognition of the firm. DMA Design, after several more titles, would go on to produce Grand Theft Auto in 1997, and would lead them to ultimately be acquired by Take Two Interactive and rebranded as Rockstar Games, with the original studio renamed as Rockstar North. * Bullfrog Productions was founded by Peter Molyneux and Les Edgar, with one of their first titles being Populous, the title that established the god game genre. Bullfrog developed several other influential titles, including the Dungeon Keeper series, the Syndicate series, and Theme-related titles including Theme Park and Theme Hospital. Though Bullfrog was ultimately acquired and shuttered by Electronic Arts, the Bullfrog team went on to establish other influential UK studios, including Molyneux's Lionhead Studios, Media Molecule, Hello Games, and Two Point Studios. * Team17 was initially born out of the demoscene, but produced a number of success Amiga games, finding success in the Worms series in 1995. Today, Team17 also now serves as a video game publishers for many independent studios. During this period, video game consoles from the fourth generation, such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, began to gain interest in the UK. Such interest lead to more corporate structure around video game development to support the costs and hardware needed to develop games on these platforms, and caused a decline of the popularity of the bedroom coder by 1995. However, the bedroom coders had seeded the necessary elements as to gain interest from United States companies looking for talent around this time, leading to various acquisitions and partnerships between US and UK game companies around this time. The combined era of 1980s microcomputer and early 90s Amiga game development in Britain is known as \\"Britsoft\\". Console systems (1995–2009) The Amiga's legacy helped to transition video games from the 8-bit second generation to the 32-bit fifth generation, with systems like the Sony's PlayStation, and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Nintendo 64. With these consoles having caught up to the power and surpassed that the home computers had, UK developers began to target these platforms. As noted above, some of those that were instrumental in Britian's contribution to consoles included Psygnosis (developing Wipeout for the PlayStation) and DMA Design (Grand Theft Auto for the PlayStation). Others included Rare, which brought many titles to Nintendo's consoles, Argonaut Games which helped to bring 3D graphics to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System via Star Fox, and Core Design which brought the Tomb Raider series to the PlayStation console. Other software houses, like Ocean Software, Codemasters, and U.S. Gold expanded into console games as well. Indie gaming (2010–2013) While large British studios continued to develop high-profile games for consoles and computers, a new hobbyist interest arose around 2010 in independent game development. The indie game model of development started to become popular in the late 2000s, with games like World of Goo, Super Meat Boy, and Fez showing the success of the small indie team model and the means to distribute these via digital channels rather than retail. This in turn rekindled the hobbyist programmer mindset in the United Kingdom, starting a new wave of individual and small team British developers.

Video game conventions in the United Kingdom  * EGX (expo) * UK Games Expo  Game ratings and government oversight  Prior to 2012, video games in the UK would be rated through the Video Standards Council (VSC), which had been established in 1989 under the government's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The VSC worked initially with the UK video game trade group known as the Entertainment Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA) at the time but later renamed to the UK Interactive Entertainment Association (UKIE). The VSC and ELPSA developed a set of ratings in 1993, and used a combination of voluntary suggestions from publishers and their own reviews to establish a game's rating. With the introduction of the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) system in 2003, the VSC standardized its ratings on PEGI's classification system. The VSC system was voluntary at this point, though most UK retailers would respect the ratings marked on boxes to avoid selling mature games to children. The only facet of the UK ratings system for video games set in law were for titles deemed to have excessive violent or pornographic content; such titles were required to be reviewed by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), a non-government body designed in law to review film and television content, if such a designation was determined by the VSC. Legal penalties existed for publishers and retailers that attempted to sell such games without the BBFC's review. The BBFC had the authority to outright ban sale of a video game if deemed so, though such bans could be challenged. Up to 2012, only two such games had been temporarily banned by the BBFC due to rating: Manhunt 2 and Carmageddon, both which were later cleared after changed had been made by their publishers. The Byron Review, released in March 2008 under a 2007 order from Prime Minister Gordon Brown to the Department for Children, Schools and Families, made numerous suggestions for how the government could take steps to protect children in the digital environment like the Internet. Among the suggestions were related to video game ratings, which the report found that parents often mistook as difficulty ratings, and instead urged that the BBFC become involved. By May 2008, the BBFC had proposed a new voluntary ratings system for digital video games, paralleling their existing rating systems for film and television. The VSC and other groups felt the BBFC's system for video games was too forgiving and was based on a system designed around linean content rather that non-linear content such as video games, and urged the government to adopt a system based on an enhanced PEGI categorization system they were working on. Reports had found that the PEGI system tended to rate games more conservatively - issuing the game a stricter age rating - compared to what the BBFC would issue for the same title; the VSC stated that 50% of the games they had rated \\"18+\\" on the PEGI since 2003 had received a more lenient rating from the BBFC. The DCMS issued a following report in June 2009 to address several points of the Byron Review, among which included the intent to standardized video game ratings on the PEGI system. The Video Recordings (Labelling) Regulations act was passed in May 2012 and came into force on 30 July 2012. With it, it eliminated the BBFC's oversight of video games with limited exceptions on excessively pornographic titles, as well as for games with limited interactivity (such as interactive DVD games) and for any direct video content on the game disc. Instead, all published video games in retail marketplaces were required to be rated under the PEGI system by the special Games Ratings Authority (GRA) within the VSC. Retailers were bound to prevent sales of mature games (PEGI ratings of 12, 16, or 18) to younger children under this law, with both fines and prison time should they be found guilty of such sales. The VSC also became the only body that could ban sale of a game in the UK. UKIE continues to work alongside the VSC to help UK developers and publishers prepare for the VSC process and prepare educational and advocacy material to make the UK public aware of the ratings system. The VSC ratings only apply to retail titles; digitally distributed titles are not regulated under UK law, through the VSC urges developers, publishers, and storefronts as a best-practice to use the low-cost self-ratings services of the International Age Rating Coalition to assign their game an appropriate PEGI rating for the digital service. Legacy The Royal Mail issued a limited postal stamp series in 2020 featuring several games that formed the basis of the United Kingdom's early video game industry. The series featured Elite (1984), the Dizzy series (1987–1992), WipeOut (1995), the Worms series (1995–present), Lemmings (1991), Micro Machines (1991), Populus (1989), and the Tomb Raider series (1996–present).

Biography Early years Emma Ejwertz is a Swedish singer/songwriter who grew up in southwest Sweden. In recent years she has been living in Los Angeles. Emma has been writing songs since she started listening to Fleetwood Mac, Janis Joplin and Nirvana in her early teens. She studied music at a performance arts high school in Sweden before coming to Los Angeles as an exchange student in her senior year of high school. After graduating high school, Emma was briefly married and shortly divorced retaining dual citizenship. Emma Ejwertz MySpace Site L.A. Life (1998–Present) While pursuing her music career in Los Angeles, Emma met Scott Weiland and Douglas Grean. She performed for them at their recording studio in Burbank and they recorded a demo with her after being impressed with her voice and guitar playing. Scott sang backup on a number of songs, including a cover of \\"Heart Shaped Box\\". When Emma's vision for her demo differed and Scott became unavailable, she began to look around for a new producer. Emma was introduced to Steve Gryphon in 2004 through an A&R; representative. They completed work on a new demo with a more pop direction in December 2004, but Emma returned to Sweden when a Swedish version of one of her demo tracks allowed her to be awarded the Ted Gärdestad scholarship in Sweden. That offered Emma the chance to appear on television in Sweden and perform her song, \\"Tilda\\", in front of audiences there. Emma returned to the US in 2005 and started a new band, Nerviosa. The band parted ways in 2007 and Emma focused once more on her solo career. She reunited with producer Steve Gryphon to record her first independent release, \\"Dizzy Arms\\". The album included one song she had originally written for Nerviosa, \\"Pavement\\", and showcased Emma's guitar playing and unique sound, as well as her haunting vocals. In 2008, Emma was chosen to sing the main title for season 2 of the FX network Dirt TV series.Dirt IMDB listing Many songs from her album were used in the show, which starred Courteney Cox, and \\"We're Not Beautiful\\" gathered public interest when it was used to score a steamy scene between Cox and her co-star, Josh Stewart heardontv.com listing for Emma Ejwertz. \\"It Makes Sense\\" was used in The Starter Wife (TV series) from USA Network and scores the conclusion of that series.

Using an innovative technology platform, SIRUM saves lives, time, and money by allowing health facilities, manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies to easily donate unused medicine rather than destroy it. Opportunity An estimated $5 billion worth of usable medicine goes to waste each year in the United States—yet 50 million Americans report not being able to afford taking their medications as prescribed. Americans’ medication non-adherence results in an estimated 125,000 annual deaths and costs up to $289 billion annually. The act of wasting that $5 billion of usable medicine each year also has consequences for Americans, polluting air and water supplies, and resulting in the duplicative purchasing and manufacturing of drugs to meet patient needs—which could otherwise be met by drawing on that $5 billion medication surplus. Much of the surplus unused medicine wasted each year resides with healthcare companies and organizations, such as with long-term care facilities, pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies. Because these surplus medications remain in institutional settings throughout their life cycles, their integrity is carefully maintained by trained healthcare professionals. Patients who cannot afford to purchase the prescriptions they need could greatly benefit from having access to these safe, unexpired, and unopened medications that otherwise go to waste. Forty states around the country have recently recognized this opportunity and passed so-called “Good Samaritan” laws providing legal protection and regulatory guidelines for the creation of medicine redistribution programs. Method of operation SIRUM leverages technology to connect surpluses of unused medicine with safety-net clinics whose low-income patients cannot afford their medicine. Through SIRUM’s first- of-its-kind online platform, donor organizations can upload inventories of their unused medications while safety-net clinics upload their patients’ medication needs. SIRUM’s system then creates automatic matches between donating and recipient parties, and facilitates the speedy and direct shipment of medicine from facility to clinic. SIRUM’s online platform handles record- keeping, shipping, and other logistics. Throughout each step of the process SIRUM aims to make medicine donation an easier, more enticing option than medicine destruction. Results As of mid-2014, SIRUM has medicine redistribution networks running in California and Colorado, with over 200 partners participating in total. The organization has facilitated the redistribution of 1 million pills, which amounts to about $3 million worth of drugs saved and 20,000 patients helped. That also represents about two tons of medicine diverted away from our waste streams—and thousands of tons more waste avoided by forgoing the production of the 1 million pills these safety-net clinics would have otherwise had to purchase anew. Legislation SIRUM is possible because of two recent legal advancements. One is the enactment of Good Samaritan laws that have passed in 40 states. These laws make it easier for certain types of donors to redistribute unused medicine without liability. The second legal advancement is a Food and Drug Administration mandate that requires all manufactured medicine to be labeled with the National Drug Code, a consistent coding system that identifies medicine by type, strength, and amount. SIRUM uses these standardized codes to match clinic requests with donor excess. The online system allows for medicine to be entered and requested using the trade name, active ingredient, NDC labeler code, NDC product code, or manufacturer. With all information contained within its database, SIRUM is able to match the needs of its member clinics. History Adam Kircher first had the idea for SIRUM in 2005. His experience with relief efforts in post-tsunami Batam, Indonesia alerted him to difficulties in redistributing supplies, including medicine. Adam was inspired to use the internet to create a trusted community for redistributing medicine, and he assembled a group of Stanford students to help achieve his aims. In 2009, SIRUM became incorporated and launched its pilot program in the San Francisco Bay Area. Since then, SIRUM has made its online platform increasingly robust and built out its donation network to include 200 partners across California and Colorado. Its early funders included the California HealthCare Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation.

This poem has been described as one of Słowacki's most famous works. History The exact date Słowacki's created this poem is not known. The work was written around 1839-1840 in Paris. Kamela dates the work to \\"likely the end of 1839\\". At this time Słowacki's was a target of a number of Polish literary critics, hostile to his works and ideology, and this poem was one of his replies to them. Meaning and significance This poem is an example of the poetical testament (testament poetycki) genre. In this type of work, somewhat similar to a brief autobiography in verse, and inspired by \\"Non omnis moriar\\" (Latin for \\"Not all of me will die\\") of Horace, the poet usually conveys his or her ideologies and beliefs, as well as wishes and hopes. Testament... describes Słowacki's faith that despite the grim reality of the present his works will endure and gain renown after his death. Słowacki expresses his sadness at being alone and not understood, as well as pride from his achievements. He also conveys his beliefs that the mission of a poet must be continued, no matter the costs and sacrifices. The poem is also characteristic of the Polish romanticism for idealizing self-sacrifice. This poem served as an inspiration for the title of the 1943 book Kamienie na szaniec (lit. Stones for the Rampart) by Aleksander Kamiński, where it is used as a reference to the sacrificial and insurrectionist traditions of Polish romanticism. It was also an inspiration for the 1942 poem by a Polish Jewish poet, Zuzanna Ginczanka. The poem, in a sung version, is also a hymn of several high schools of whose Słowacki is a patron of.

He became a scholar of Winchester College in 1760, and went to New College, Oxford, matriculating on 3 March 1767. He won the chancellor's prize for Latin verse, the subject being 'Ars Pingendi,' in 1769, the year of it institution. He proceeded B.A. in 1770, was elected fellow of his college, and graduated M.A. in 1774, B.D. in 1787, and D.D. in 1789. He was presented to the college rectory of Stanton St. John, Oxfordshire. His first publication was a sermon preached before the university of Oxford, entitled The Resurrection of the Body deduced from the Resurrection of Christ, 1777 (2nd edit. 1779). In 1778 he published an imitation of Thomas Gray, called Alfred, an Ode. With six Sonnets. In 1782 he was chosen Bampton lecturer, and during the same year published his eight lectures On the Prophecies and Testimony of John the Baptist, and the parallel Prophecies of Jesus Christ. He succeeded John Randolph as Oxford Professor of Poetry in 1783, and composed An Ode for the Encoenia held at Oxford July 1703. In 1788 he issued 'Four Tracts: on the Principles of Religion as a Test of Divine Authority; on the Principles of Redemption; on the Angelical Message to the Virgin Mary; on the Resurrection of the Body; with a Discourse on Humility.' In 1788 Holmes commenced his collation of the manuscripts of the Septuagint, and published in Latin an account of the method which he thought should be followed. The task, on which he gave annual bulletins, was not finished by the time of his death, but an edition was finally published in five volumes to 1827 by his collaborator James Parsons.

Development William Bushnell Stout was a prolific designer of road vehicles and aircraft, including the Ford Trimotor series. He was founder of the Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company and in 1931 designed the Skycar which was specified for easy handling and provided with automobile-style comfort. Single examples of four variations on the basic design were produced between 1931 and 1944. The Skycar I was first displayed at the spring 1931 Detroit Show. The aircraft was a two-seat high-wing monoplane, accommodating the occupants in tandem layout. It had an all-metal steel-tube frame covered with corrugated metal skin. Centre-line nose and tail-wheels plus a standard landing gear were fitted. The rear fuselage was constructed from an open framework carrying a single fin and rudder, inside which was located the rear pusher engine. The Sky Car was displayed with a Moorhouse engine (Alfred Moorhouse of Detroit, assignor to Packard Motor Car Company). Fuel was carried in two tanks in the leading portion of the central section of the engine housing, from where it was fed by gravity to the engine.Flight At a later date the aircraft was fitted with twin booms carrying the single fin and rudder (see photo of preserved aircraft). The aircraft featured balanced pivoting outboard wingtips rather than ailerons. Stout attempted to design a simple aircraft that would have controls similar to early model Fords including the ignition switch and the starter button. Stout planned to build the Sky Car (i.e. its original name was \\"Sky Car\\" but various newspaper and magazine articles spelled it \\"Skycar\\") \\"Air Flivver Built Like Auto Lands on Tennis Court\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1931 and sell it at the price of a moderately priced car (approximately $2000) if mass-produced in numbers.\\"Air Flivver Ready To Fly Weighs Only 1,000 Pounds\\", June 1931, Popular Science article on Skycar I The Skycar II of 1941 was a higher-powered version utilising stainless steel construction and twin tail booms. The four- wheel landing gear was intended to facilitate a later rebuild to roadability which never occurred. It was built with support from Fred Fisher of General Motors. The Skycar III of 1943 had a higher-powered Lycoming engine to enable operation at higher gross weight, but was otherwise similar to the Skycar II. The Skycar IV of 1944 was also known as the Spratt-Stout Model 8 and the Convair 103. It was similar to the Skycar III with twin tail-booms, but fitted with twin fins and rudders. Operational history The Skycar I, sometimes referred to as the Model 11-W. It was flown as a personal aircraft by Stout for several years and was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution. It is on display in the National Air and Space Museum at Dulles Airport Virginia.Ogden, 2007, p. 534 The Skycar II was evaluated by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) as the XC-65 light transport.

In hydrocarbon exploration this is used to provide a 'tie' between changes in rock properties in a borehole and seismic reflection data at the same location. It can also be used either to test possible interpretation models for 2D and 3D seismic data or to model the response of the predicted geology as an aid to planning a seismic reflection survey. In the processing of wide-angle reflection and refraction (WARR) data, synthetic seismograms are used to further constrain the results of seismic tomography.Makris, J., Egloff, F. & Rihm, R. 1999. WARRP (Wide Aperture Reflection and Refraction Profiling): The principle of successful data acquisition where conventional seismic fails, SEG 1999 Expanded Abstracts In earthquake seismology, synthetic seismograms are used either to match the predicted effects of a particular earthquake source fault model with observed seismometer records or to help constrain the Earth's velocity structure. Synthetic seismograms are generated using specialized geophysical software. 1D synthetics Seismic reflection data are initially only available in the time domain. In order that the geology encountered in a borehole can be tied to the seismic data, a 1D synthetic seismogram is generated. This is important in identifying the origin of seismic reflections seen on the seismic data. Density and velocity data are routinely measured down the borehole using wireline logging tools. These logs provide data with a sampling interval much smaller than the vertical resolution of the seismic data. The logs are therefore often averaged over intervals to produce what is known as a 'blocked-log'.Goldberg, D., Wilkens, R.H. & Moos, D. 1987. Seismic modeling of diagenetic effects in Cenozoic marine sediments at Deep Sea Drilling Project sites 612 and 613, DSDP Initial report on Leg 95, 23 This information is then used to calculate the variation in acoustic impedance down the well bore using the Zoeppritz equations.OBartels, T., Krastel, S., and Spiess, V., 2007. Correlation of high-resolution seismic data with ODP Leg 208 borehole measurements. In Kroon, D., Zachos, J.C., and Richter, C. (Eds.), Proc. ODP, Sci. Results, 208: College Station, TX (Ocean Drilling Program), 1–27 This acoustic impedance log is combined with the velocity data to generate a reflection coefficient series in time. This series is convolved with a seismic wavelet to produce the synthetic seismogram. The input seismic wavelet is chosen to match as closely as possible to that produced during the original seismic acquisition, paying particular attention to phase and frequency content. 1.5D seismic modelling The convolutional 1D modelling produces seismograms containing approximations of primary reflections only. For more accurate modelling involving multiple reflections, head waves, guided waves and surface waves, as well as transmission effects and geometrical spreading, full waveform modelling is required. For 1D elastic models the most accurate approach to full waveform modelling is known as the reflectivity method.Fuchs, K., and G. Muller, 1971, Computation of synthetic seismograms with the reflectivity method and comparison with observations, Geophys. J. R. Astron. Soc, 23, 417. This method is based on the integral transform approach, whereby the wave field (cylindrical or spherical wave) is represented by a sum (integral) of time-harmonic plane waves.Aki, K. and Richards, R.G., Quantitative Seismology, Theory and Methods, Vol. I, W. H. Freeman, 1980. The reflection and transmission coefficients for individual plane waves propagating in a stack of layers can be computed analytically using a variety of methods, such as matrix propagator,Thomson, W.T., 1950, Transmission of elastic waves through a stratified solid material, Journal of Applied Physics, 21, 89–93.Haskell, N. A., The dispersion of surface waves in multilayered media, , Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 43, 17–34,1953.Dunkin, I.W., 1965, Computation of model solutions in layered elastic media at high frequencies, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 55, 335–358.Thrower, E.N., The computation of the dispersion of elastic waves in layered media, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 2, 210–226.Molotkov L.A., 1984, Matrix method in the theory of wave propagation in layered elastic and fluid media, Nauka (in Russian). global matrixSchmidt, H and Tango., 1986, Efficient global matrix approach to the computation of synthetic seismograms, Geophysical Journal of the Royal Astronomic Society, 84, pp 331–359. or invariant embedding.Kennett, B. L. N., 1985, Seismic wave propagation in stratified media, Cambridge University Press. This group of methods is called 1.5D because the earth is represented by a 1D model (flat layers), while wave propagation is considered either in 2D (cylindrical waves) or 3D (spherical waves). 2D synthetic seismic modeling A similar approach can be used to examine the seismic response of a 2D geological cross-section. This can be used to look at such things as the resolution of thin beds or the different responses of various fluids, e.g. oil, gas or brine in a potential reservoir sand.Hodgetts, D. & Howell, J.A. 2000. Synthetic seismic modelling of a large-scale geological cross-section from the Book Cliffs, Utah, USA, Petroleum Geoscience, 6, 221–229. It may also be used to test out different geometries of structures such as salt diapirs, to see which gives the best match to the original seismic data. A cross-section is built with density and seismic velocities assigned to each of the individual layers. These can be either constant within a layer or varying in a systematic fashion across the model both horizontally and vertically. The software program then runs a synthetic acquisition across the model to produce a set of 'shot gathers' that can be processed as if they were real seismic data to produce a synthetic 2D seismic section. The synthetic record is generated using either a ray-tracing algorithm or some form of full waveform modelling, depending on the purpose of the modelling. Ray-tracing is quick and sufficient for testing the illumination of the structure,Graham, S., Lawton, D. & Spratt, D. 2005. Sub- thrust imaging:modelling example from the Cusiana oilfield, Llanos Basin, Colombia, CSEG National Convention, Abstract. but full waveform modelling will be necessary to accurately model the amplitude response.Li, Y., Downton, J. & Xu, Y. 2004. AVO Modeling in Seismic Processingand Interpretation II. Methodologies, CSEG Recorder, January, 38–44. 3D synthetic seismic modelling The approach can be further expanded to model the response of a 3D geological model. This is used to reduce the uncertainty in interpretation by modelling the response of the 3D model to a synthetic seismic acquisition that matches as closely as possible to that actually used in acquiring the data that has been interpreted.Gawith, D.E. & Gutteridge, P.A. 1996. Seismic validation of reservoir simulation using a shared earth model, Petroleum Geoscience, 2, 97–103. The synthetic seismic data is then processed using the same sequence as that used for the original data. This method can be used to model both 2D and 3D seismic data that has been acquired over the area of the geological model. During the planning of a seismic survey, 3D modelling can be used to test the effect of variation in seismic acquisition parameters, such as the shooting direction or the maximum offset between source and receiver, on the imaging of a particular geological structure.Gjøystdal, H., Iversen, E., Lecomte, I., Kaschwich, T., Drottning, Å. and Mispel, J. 2007.

Importance of ray-trace modeling in the discovery of Thunder Horse North Field, Gulf of Mexico, The Leading Edge, 23, 68–70. WARR data modelling Wide Aperture Reflection and Refraction (WARR) models' initial processing is normally carried out using a tomographic approach in which the time of observed first arrivals is matched by varying the velocity structure of the subsurface. The model can be further refined using forward modelling to generate synthetic seismograms for individual shot gathers. Earthquake modelling Source modelling In areas that have a well understood velocity structure it is possible to use synthetic seismograms to test out the estimated source parameters of an earthquake. Parameters such as the fault plane, slip vector and rupture velocity can be varied to produce synthetic seismic responses at individual seismometers for comparison with the observed seismograms.Cotton, F. & Campillo, M. 1994. Application of seismogram synthesis to the study of earthquake source from strong motion records, Annali di Geofisica, 37, 1539–1564. Velocity modelling For seismic events of known type and location, it is possible to obtain detailed information about the Earth's structure, at various scales, by modelling the teleseismic response of the event.Helmberger, D.V. 1974, Understanding Seismograms by Constructing Numerical Models, Engineering and Science, 38, 26–29.

Life She spent her early childhood with her mother in Turku Castle in the Duchy of Finland. In 1562, she and her brother Julius (1559–1583), though not their younger sister, were removed from their mother's custody and kept in their father's household when he married Catherine Jagiellon.

Like pearls on a string, these acres are spread out as individual units along the Missouri River between Kansas City and St. Louis. These pearls of habitat benefit floodplain-dependent fish and wildlife species. The Big Muddy Refuge is planning to grow to by buying land from willing sellers who want to see their properties set aside for the benefit of wildlife and the enjoyment of all. The pre-development Missouri River as documented by Lewis and Clark was considerably different from today's river. The historic Missouri was a broad, slow-moving, shallow river with braided channels. These past river conditions created a haven for wildlife, which included vast floodplain forests of giant trees, marshes, and even wet prairies. Today's river is channelized. It is deeper and faster, and controlled by levees, dikes, and other containment structures. These controls make the river more navigable and the surrounding floodplain ideal for agriculture. The Big Muddy Refuge is allowing the Missouri River to be a river again, to enter its floodplain. This occurs during minor flood events. Management has created side channels, cut down levees, and allowed the floodplain vegetation to return. Currently, in many places the refuge is an impenetrable thicket of young trees and vegetation, but, as the trees grow and the refuge matures, its appearance will change. The process may take decades or even centuries.

The system was in operation from 1979 to 2009. The PRT was notable for having cars propelled by a linear induction motor and suspended on a bed of compressed air similar to a hovercraft. Uniquely, the cars could move sideways, as well as backwards and forwards. The proclaimed \\"horizontal elevator\\" system was designed by Otis Elevator Company during the 1970s, installed beginning in 1977 and opened on December 8, 1979. The PRT had three driverless Otis Hovair vehicles which had a hinged-window at each end for emergency exit. The concrete guideway was built as double track, connecting the three stations at Duke South, Duke North and Parking Garage II via a tunnel under Erwin Road. Decommissioning The 0.25-mile (<400 m) section between Duke South and Duke North was closed permanently on October 15, 2008 to allow for expansion of the hospital buildings. The remaining section connecting Duke Parking Garage II with Duke North Hospital was closed between late 2008 and early 2009. The doorway for the station at Parking Garage II was permanently boarded up and turned into a wall. The leftover tracks and infrastructure have since been largely removed to make way for new construction. Technology The Hovair technology has been installed around the world. Later variants have used the same air-cushion technology, but propelled the vehicles by wire cable, such as at the Getty Center in Los Angeles.

I'm not sure I get to lead the most extravagant lifestyle, or how my earnings compare to people working in the mainstream games industry.\\" Marshall later said of the game \\"I didn’t think people would really pay money for it ...

Peterkin is also known under the recording name of 'Freddie Lee' for the critical acclaim of his album Beyond Comprehension. The Sounds of the Four Tops is a unique Four Tops Tribute as the signature visual production and choreography does not imitate the original artists The Four Tops although the shows pays homage to the original artist's music with vocal presentations of The Four Tops hits. This show is one of three current touring productions which include Sounds of the Drifters and Sounds of the Temptations. The choreography in his Four Tops tribute show are completely Peterkin's original dramatic works. His signature visual production consists of original choreographed works created by him between 1991 - 2009. His first known touring production Aces toured Europe in 1991 - 1998. The show Aces was part of the Pete Tobit British theatre show \\"Reach Out\\" from 1999-2001. Peterkin retained some of his earlier works in his 2004 Sounds of the Four Tops show. The Sounds of the Four Tops show has been subject of national newspaper reviews and interviews particularly in the British entertainment publication The Stage newspaper. Peterkin's style of show has since inspired many similar British Four Tops Tribute Shows. Peterkin's dynamic stage production and dramatic works for Sounds of the Four Tops are inspired by the traditional Black Greek Fraternity \\"Step Shows\\" at Freddie Lee Peterkin's Alma Mater, Florida Memorial University which have a significant historic tradition. Peterkin choreographed routines for competition as part of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Delta Psi chapter. Controversy has been sparked as Freddie Lee Peterkin took action in 2009 against two British national touring theatre shows for misappropriating his original choreographed works. Peterkin is being represented by Leonard Lowy former inhouse solicitor for Island Records at Leonard Lowy & Co Solicitors. He also discussed the infringement case in a Sky TV interview in June 2009. His tribute production is the only known tribute production to have tributes. Rather than imitating the routines of the original artists, the two national Motown style theatre shows plagiarized Freddie Lee Peterkin's works without a license agreement or seeking Peterkin's consent. Both shows featured one former member of his Aces show and 3 former employees that worked for him from 1999-2003. In 2009 Peterkin discovered that the colleague who had stolen from him and the other group members had taken his original stage production and misappropriated the works as his own and contracted Peterkin's original dramatic works to \\"The Magic of Motown Theatre Show\\". Three former employees falsely claimed in the Herald newspaper that they had choreographed Peterkin's stage production in \\"How Sweet It Is\\" another British theatre show. His former employees were aged between 12-14 years old when Peterkin then aged 23 - 27 years old first created and performed the works to the public between 1989-1994. Peterkin has since taken legal action against both the show producer of \\"The Magic of Motown\\", his former colleague from his group 'Aces' and his former employees in \\"How Sweet It Is\\" via Leonard Lowy and Co Solicitors, former in house solicitor for Island Records. Both shows gave notice that they would desist from using Peterkin's works but did not do so until 2010. Peterkin stated in interviews that he intends to still take the matter to the High Court to be acknowledged for his works and to seek compensation for the illegal use of his works.

The term may be pejorative, or it may be affectionately embraced.  Usage and association  Women who have cats have long been associated with the concept of spinsterhood. In more recent decades, the concept of a cat lady has been associated with \\"romance-challenged (often career-oriented) women\\". Specifically, it has also been embraced by lesbians. A cat lady may also be an animal hoarder who keeps large numbers of cats without having the ability to properly house or care for them. They may be ignorant about their situation, or generally unaware of their situation. People who are aware of it are not normally considered cat ladies. Depending on context, the ordinarily pejorative word \\"crazy\\" may be prepended to \\"cat lady\\" to indicate either a pejorative or a humorous and affectionate label. Some writers, celebrities, and artists have challenged the gender-based \\"Crazy Cat Lady\\" stereotype, and embraced the term to mean an animal lover or rescuer who cares for one or multiple cats, and who is psychologically healthy.Williams, David, Meet The Men Proud to Be Crazy Cat Ladies, ABC News, Retrieved November 12, 2015 A 2019 study found no differences between cat- owners and non-cat owners for anxiety, depression or experiences in relationships: \\"We suggest that our findings are, therefore, not consistent with a description of cat-owners as depressed, anxious or as having difficulty with human relationships.\\"  Documentary  The documentary Cat Ladies (2009) tells the stories of four women whose lives became dedicated to their cats. The film was directed by Christie Callan-Jones and produced by Chocolate Box Entertainment, originally for TVOntario. It was an official selection at the 2009 Hot Docs Festival, Silverdocs Festival, and San Francisco's DocFest. Naftali Berrill, Ph.D., Director of the New York Center for Neuropsychology and Forensic Behavioral Science told AOL Health, \\"These may be people who have a very hard time expressing themselves to other people. They may find the human need for affection is met most easily through a relationship with a pet.\\" This devotion can sometimes signal mental or emotional issues such as depression.  Toxoplasma gondii  Some studies indicate a link between the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which sexually reproduces exclusively in cats, and numerous psychiatric conditions, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia, whereas other studies have showed that T. gondii is not a causative factor in later psychoses. The compulsive hoarding of cats, a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), has long been associated with \\"crazy cat ladies\\". Mass media has drawn on this stereotype to coin the term crazy cat lady syndrome to refer to the association between T. gondii and psychiatric conditions.  Notable examples  * Florence Nightingale had many cats named after famous public figures such as Gladstone and Bismarck. * Edith Ewing Bouvier and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale had many cats living with them in their decrepit home Grey Gardens.

Three separate units are located in the floodplain, on both the Illinois and Missouri sides of the river. In 1998, the Great River Refuge was designated as a globally Important Bird Area, due to its value to shorebirds, songbirds, and waterfowl. The refuge's proximity to St. Louis provides excellent educational opportunities to a large population. The Clarence Cannon National Wildlife Refuge is also under the administration of the Great River Refuge. Great River Refuge, in turn, was formerly part of the Mark Twain National Wildlife Refuge Complex, which also included: Port Louisa, Two Rivers, and Middle Mississippi River National Wildlife Refuges. History Long Island Division, near Quincy, Illinois, was part of the original Mark Twain Refuge when it was established in 1958 under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. The division is General Plan Land owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under a cooperative agreement signed in 1963. In 1986, another cooperative agreement was signed with the Corps of Engineers adding the Bear Creek Unit to the division. Funds from the sale of migratory waterfowl stamps were used to acquire fee title land in 1965 and 1976 for the Delair Division. The division lies completely within the -long Sny Agricultural Levee District and is separated from the river by the main- line Sny levee. Fox Island Division is the most recent addition to Great River Refuge. Once again, fee title land was purchased with funds from the sale of migratory waterfowl stamps in 1989, 1996 and 1997. Purchases made in the 1990s were in response to the record flood in 1993, which created an opportunity to purchase many hard-hit floodplain areas at lower prices from willing sellers. Great River Refuge also administers two fee title tracts that were formerly Farmer's Home Administration easements. These lands include the Winters tract in Lewis County and the Owens tract in Clark County in Missouri.

Her surviving works are varied; she produced translations of classical themes, religious and philosophical poetry and poems arguing for women's involvement in education and intellectual pursuits such as natural philosophy. Unusually, for a woman of her time, her poetry also includes Newtonian imagery and ideas. Some of her poetry imitates the Latin verse of Horace, Ovid, and Virgil. In some of her poems, Tollet paraphrases the Psalms. She was the daughter of George Tollet who, observing her intelligence, gave her a thorough education in languages, history, poetry and mathematics. Tollet was fluent in Latin, Italian, and French and she achieved a proficiency in Latin that was unconventional for women of her time. The Tollets' social circle included Isaac Newton, who also encouraged her to pursue her education. Tollet grew up in the Tower of London where her father lived as a commissioner of the British Navy. She refers to the Tower in several of her poems and expresses her confinement and frustration with it. Tollet remained unmarried her whole life. Her mother most likely died and Tollet, being the eldest daughter, would've been expected to stay home and care for her siblings. In 1724 she published Poems on Several Occasions, which included her Hypatia, now seen as a feminist protest poem. On Newton's death in 1727 Tollet produced an elegy, On the Death of Sir Isaac Newton. She died in 1754 in the village of Westham, Essex (now known as West Ham) and is buried at All Saints church there.

Life He was born on an estate called the Snabb, in the township of Bickley and parish of Malpas, Cheshire, on 8 December 1754, being the younger of two sons of Thomas Churton and Sarah Clemson. He was educated in the grammar school of Malpas, and after the loss of both parents, who died while he was very young, he found a friend and benefactor in Dr. Thomas Townson, rector of Malpas, who recommended that he should be entered at Brasenose College, Oxford (1772), and who paid half of his expenses at the university.

It is located near the confluence of the Grand and Missouri Rivers. Following the purchase of the land, the Civilian Conservation Corps began work on the refuge creating wetlands, constructing roads and buildings, and initiating the refuge farming program. The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide nesting, resting, and feeding areas for waterfowl, primarily ducks. Two- hundred and forty-one avian species have been observed residing on or passing through the refuge; another fourteen birds, listed under accidentals on the bird list, have been reported but are not normally expected to be present. An important secondary purpose was to preserve a remnant flock of prairie chickens. However, adequate grassland habitat to maintain a viable population of these birds was not available. Since establishment of the refuge, the primary emphasis on waterfowl species has been expanded to include the Eastern Prairie Population of Canada geese. Canada geese were first observed using the refuge in the early 1940s, and numbers increased gradually to peak populations over 200,000 birds annually. Although these populations have steadily declined, Swan Lake is still considered a primary wintering area for Canada geese.

Subsequent to the massive volume of pollen and nectar produced by trees and hedges in the spring, there is a reduction in the amount of nectar available to the bees due to long grasses and dandelions suppressing many wildflowers. Before the herbaceous \\"summer rush\\" of July-through- September which reinstates the high level of nectar, the high hive populations brought around by trees in the spring struggle to produce honey and may lay fewer eggs. Beekeepers need to pay special attention to the levels of honey in the hive as well as the level of water the bees use during this gap. Annual weather patterns can cause this event to occur later or earlier. Some plants which can help provide nectar in this gap are Cotoneaster, the closely related Pyracantha, common garden [herbs], and perennial garden plants.

Mott Frank Kanning Mott (January 21, 1866 – 1958) was the 35th mayor of Oakland, California. Mott was born in San Francisco on January 21, 1866, but his family moved to nearby Oakland when he was two years old. His father, who worked for the Central Pacific Railroad (later Southern Pacific Railroad), died when he was 11. To support the family, Mott quit school and worked as a messenger boy for Western Union and then as a telephone operator, the first ever in Oakland, according to his obituary in the Tribune. He entered the hardware business as a clerk at the age of 16, eventually becoming the sole proprietor of Frank K. Mott Co. He entered politics in 1894 when then-Mayor George Pardee appointed him to the city council to fill H.P. Dalton's vacant seat. He went on to serve two more terms before being elected mayor in 1905. Mott, known as \\"The Mayor Who Built Oakland\\", presided over the greatest disaster relief operation in Oakland when an estimated 150,000 people sought refuge in the city after the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco. He was re-elected in 1907 by a six-to-one margin, defeating Socialist O.H. Phillbrick, 7,317 to 1,226, and re-elected to the third term in 1909, defeating Citizens' Party candidate F.F. Jackson 8,352 to 6,045. Following the adoption of a new city charter establishing a city commission government in 1910, Mott won the 1911 election by defeating Socialist opponent Thomas Booth, 11,722 to 9,837. In a fascinating but little-known chapter of Oakland history, Mott survived the city's first recall election, initiated by the radical Industrial Workers of the World, on August 5, 1912, with 17,139 voting in favor of keeping Mott in office, and 10,846 against. He achieved, in 1909, final resolution of the waterfront issue which had preoccupied the leaders of Oakland since the city's founding, with a negotiated agreement with Southern Pacific. The railroad gave up its rights to the waterfront in exchange for a fifty-year franchise on the property it then held. In 1909, Mayor Mott welcomed President William H. Taft to Oakland. The Mayor laid the cornerstone for the present City Hall. The massive harbor improvements which immediately followed were part of an unprecedented era of public works projects, including the dredging of Lake Merritt, the building of the current City Hall and the Civic Auditorium (now known as the Kaiser Convention Center), establishment of the pioneering Oakland Public Museum in the Josiah Stanford (now Camron- Stanford) House, and vast expansion and improvements to sewers, streets, lighting, electricity, fire and police protection. Mayor Mott retired in 1915. On January 10, 1911, Mott married Mrs. Gertrude Bennett in San Francisco. His family lived at three different addresses while he was mayor—1066 Jackson (1905–08), 1509 Webster (1909–1911), and 276 Lee Street in Adams Point (1912–1939)—all since demolished. He served as the city's right-of-way agent from 1927 until his death on December 16, 1958, at the age of 92, at the Athens Athletic Club. An Episcopalian, Mott was cremated following his funeral at the Chapel of the Oaks under the auspices of Masonic Lodge 61.

It ended with a decisive victory for the Safavid dynasty. The result was that the Safavids regained control of the Khorasan region (north-eastern and east of present Iran, southern parts of present-day Turkmenistan, and western and northern Afghanistan). Background After the Shaybani Uzbeks began to rise to power in Transoxiana around 1495, Muhammad Shaybani Khan was waiting for a chance to annex the territory of the Timurids in Herat, which eventually occurred when the forces of the Uzbek Khan occupied the city and its environs in 1507. Shah Ismail started his campaign in Azerbaijan in 1502, and had re-unified all of Iran by 1509. Badi al-zaman, Husayn Bayqarah's son and heir, sought asylum at Ismail's court and induced him to launch a campaign in the east. Battle Shah Ismail reached Khorasan with great speed; Shaybani Khan retreated to Merv castle to await reinforcement from Uzbek tribes. The Safavid army then pretended to retreat, encouraging the Uzbeks to leave the castle in pursuit, only to be ambushed and destroyed by the Qizilbash (\\"Red Heads\\") troops of Shah Ismail once they were too far from the castle to regain its safety. The Safavid forces were reportedly heavily outnumbered by the army of Shaybani Khan, who was caught and killed trying to escape the battle. Shah Ismail had his body parts sent to various areas of the empire for display, while famously having his skull coated in gold and made into a jeweled drinking goblet. The primary outcome of the battle renewed Safavid control of Khorasan, the historic region which lies mostly in parts of modern-day Iran, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan.

He married Joane Harrington daughter of John Harrington of Bagworth, Leicestershire circa 1544. In 1545–1547 he represented Leicester in Parliament. He was High Sheriff of Leicestershire and High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1550 and MP for Leicestershire from 1547 to 1553. He fought with his brother against the French which were between Boulogne and Calais. When Mary I came to the throne in July 1553, he used the fact that he had a commission from his relative, the Duke of Northumberland, to raise 4000 infantrymen from Buckinghamshire for the service of Lady Jane Grey to go over in support of Mary. He was rewarded with the Office of Receiver of the honour of Leicester, a parcel of land in the Duchy of Lancaster and being made soon afterwards a Privy Councillor and Master of the Horse. He was MP for Middlesex from 1553 to 1555. He was so well thought of by King Philip of Spain that he was given a pension of 500 crowns of English money. He went with Lord Paget as an envoy to the Emperor for the purpose of inviting Cardinal Pole to England and in 1555 was elected one of the Knights Companions of the Order of the Garter.

He was imprisoned for hearing mass in 1561 but released on taking the Oath of Supremacy. He founded the hospital of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire in April 1564. He lived at the Manor House in the centre of Loughborough and died in March 1572 at Stoke Poges. In his will, he mentions his natural son Edward, who was to be given the Manor of Michelcreche, Somerset when he came of age. He gave his manor of Bosworth to his nephew Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon. He does not mention his wife in his will, leading to speculation that they may have been estranged.

Keating. It is the twenty- fourth novel in the Inspector Ghote series. Plot introduction Inspector Ghote has been assigned to investigate a string of cat-burglaries. The burglar, nicknamed Yeshwant after a Hindu lizard god by the newspapers, demonstrates remarkable climbing skills. However, the case Ghote really wants to investigate is the murder of Anil Ajmani. Ghote is unexpectedly rejoined by his old friend Axel Svensson, formally of UNESCO, who aids and hampers Ghote's investigation. Only when Ghote's investigation reaches its climax does he realise that perhaps he has been on the right case all along. Plot summary Ghote reflects on his misfortune in being assigned to a case of burglary instead of the murder of Anil Ajmani. By chance he encounters Axel Svensson, once an analyst for UNESCO who worked with Ghote in The Perfect Murder. Ghote immediately feels sorry for Axel, who is visiting India after the death of his wife. Ghote agrees, against his better judgement, to let Axel assist in his investigation. The next day Ghote rejoins Axel to learn the big Swedish man has been frightened by the urban legend of \\"The Kidney Heist\\". Together they visit and interview a victim of the cat burglar \\"Yeshwant\\". Axel is surprised by the deferential treatment Ghote gives to the victim and comments afterward that a witness would be handled differently in Sweden. The two argue. Later they meet Pinkie, the journalist who gave the cat burglar the nickname \\"Yeshwant\\", who is keen to get new information from Ghote. With Pinkie's assistance they interview a witness who is reluctant to let them look for clues in her bedroom. When they leave, Ghote wonders whether all the stolen jewellery came from \\"Pappubhai Chimanlal and Company\\". Ghote interviews the brother of the last victim, who owns a shop called Video Valley. Ghote concludes the man, while in financial trouble, is not in league with the cat burglar. Next Ghote interviews Mrs Masbahn, who had a diamond ring stolen. Mrs Masbahn says she bought the ring from Karamdas and Sons, at the urging of her lover, a drunken poet named Bottlewalla. Bottlewalla, however, remembers things differently. The couple quarrelled over where to buy the ring, with her favouring Karamdas and Sons and he Pappubhai Chimanlal and Company. Bottlewalla insists the ring was bought from Pappubhai Chimanlal. Mr Pappubhai Chimanlal is polite but does not allow Ghote to interview his employees, referring to his extensive staff vetting procedures and staff moral. Axel is furious with this lack of assistance. Mr Chimanlal tells them his secretary, Miss Cooper, is the only member of staff beside himself who knows the details of every transaction to take place in the store. Ghote presses to interview Miss Cooper but, in Axel's absence, Mr Chimanlal confides that Miss Cooper is a lonely, loveless woman, and to ensure her complete loyalty he seduced once her many years ago. Undeterred, Ghote and Axel seek out Miss Cooper. She denies providing information to the cat burglar. Ghote presses her but she continues to protest her innocence and eventually, Ghote relents and accepts her innocence. Outside, Axel deduces the only other person out who might know all the transactions carried out at the jewellers is Mr Pappubhai Chimanlal's wife. At interview Mrs Chimanlal tells them the Indian folk story of the sparrow and crow. The sparrow builds a nest of wax and the crow builds a nest of dung. The rains come and wash away the crow's nest. The crow begs the sparrow for shelter. When the crow insists on being let in, the sparrow admits the crow to her home, and invites the crow to dry herself on the stove. The crow does so and is burnt to death. This is Mrs Chimanlal's way of warning the detectives that her husband has influence and she can make life difficult for them. Ghote realises that she is wearing a necklace very like one described in the list of stolen items. He persuades Mrs Chimanlal to swing back on the swing seat she is sitting on and Axel takes a photo. As she does Ghote sees the necklace clearly and realises it is indeed stolen property. Ghote accuses her of being Yeshwant. Mrs Chimanlal admits she is Yeshwant, saying it was such fun to commit the crimes. Bartering for her freedom, she tells what she knows of Anil Ajmani's residence, which she surveyed for a robbery that never took place. Mrs Chimanlal promises that she will never again climb as Yeshwant and will return all the stolen items. Ghote is forced to content himself with this, as Mrs Chimanlal's money and political influence means Ghote cannot convict her. Ghote also instructs Yeshwant to anonymously call Pinkie Dinkarrao the journalist and provide a tip that the Yeshwant is out of business. Investigating the murder of Anil Ajmani without orders, Ghote requests Pinkie's assistance in trailing Mr Masters, the chief of security. Later Ghote realises that Ajmani's daughter is Mrs Patel, one of the victims of Veshwant. The next day Ghote finds Axel distraught after being tricked into parting with a large amount of money when a local lured him to the funeral of a local child. Together they go to interview Mr Masters, only to find that Pinkie has arrived first and accidentally alerted him, who has taken all his property and vacated his secret hideaway. Pinkie is unharmed, though shaken, and Ghote and Axel put her in a taxi and bid her goodbye. At a nearby restaurant Ghote extracts information from the owner, who says Masters claimed he was going to Andari. Ghote and Axel visit Ivy Cooper, whose father they hope may have information about a club they believe Masters belongs to. They find her embroiled in an argument with a neighbour over a clogged drain. Ghote is forced to repair the drain to restore calm before he can ask his questions. Miss Cooper's father returns and Ghote questions him to see what he knows about Mr Victor Masters. The old man identifies Victor Masters as Victor Hinks, who was sacked from the railway and denied membership to the retired rail workers club. Miss Cooper knows that Victor Hinks left his wife and children, who live near the railway station. The nearby school gives Ghote the family's address after some resistance. By interviewing Mrs Hinks Ghote learns that Victor's brother, Vincent Hinks, had a romantic attachment to Anil Ajmani's daughter. Anil Ajmani ordered Vincent's murder because of this. Ghote deduces that (unknown to Mrs Hinks) Victor Hinks took the alias of Victor Masters and became Ajmani's head of security so he could murder Ajmani in revenge for Vincent's death. Ghote presents his findings to the Deputy Commissioner, who is at first incredulous. Ghote suggests that they arrest Victor when he collects his last pay cheque from his job as Security Chief. The Deputy Commissioner leaves to make the arrest, promising Ghote a more important case as a reward.

She was the recognized illegitimate daughter of King Erik XIV of Sweden and his official royal mistress Agda Persdotter. Life Virginia was born at Kalmar Castle during her father's tenure as governor of Kalmar. In 1560, her father became King. She and her sister Constantia Eriksdotter (1560–1649) were removed from their mother's custody when she married in 1561. This was illegal, as according to the law the mother had sole custody until the children reached the age of three. They were placed under the responsibility of Princess Cecilia of Sweden and (after her marriage in 1564) Princess Elizabeth of Sweden or, more precisely, the head-lady-in-waiting Anna Hogenskild. The following year, Karin Månsdotter was included in their staff, and two years later, she became their stepmother. In 1566, her father suggested that she marry Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich of Russia. This was at a point when her father forged an alliance between Sweden and Russia against Poland: otherconsiderations mentioned were the handover of Queen Dowager Catherine, Princess Sophia of Sweden and Princess Elizabeth of Sweden as hostages to Russia. Virginia was reportedly displeased when she was informed of the plans of her future marriage and refused. Concerning her age, a marriage would in any event not have been realized for years, and her father was deposed but two years after. Despite her age, she as well as Karin Månsdotter were the object of the appeals from Martha Leijonhufvud, who asked them to appeal to the King for the mercy of Martha's spouse and sons prior to the Sture Murders, as Martha herself had been placed in house arrest. Martha suggested to Karin that she use \\"Miss Virginia\\" as messenger, if that would be the most effective method of success, but she did also appeal to Virginia personally.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Vasadrottningen: en biografi över Katarina Stenbock 1535-1621 [The Vasa Queen: A biography of Catherine Stenbock, 1535-1621], Historiska media, Lund, 2015 In 1568, her father was deposed by her uncle, John III of Sweden. On 7 May 1585, she was granted estates in Västergötland by her uncle King John III of Sweden, and the following year she herself chose to marry the noble Håkan Knutsson Hand, governor of Kronoberg Castle. In 1589, she was granted further estates by the future King Charles IX of Sweden in his Duchy of Södermanland. She had seven children during her marriage.

He and his family relocated to Brittany during the English Commonwealth, when it was impossible to pursue a career as an organ builder in England. In 1660, following the restoration of the monarchy, Robert Dallam and other members of the family returned to England.

Military career Derek Lang was born in Guildford, Surrey, England, on 7 October 1913, the son of Derek Lang. He was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. From there he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders on 31 August 1933.Obituary: Lieutenant General Sir Derek Lang The Independent, 13 April 2001 He served initially with the regiment's 1st Battalion before, promoted on 31 August 1936 to lieutenant, he served with the 2nd Battalion, Cameron Highlanders in Palestine during the Arab revolt. In February 1938 he was sent to Scotland where he became adjutant to the regiment's 4th Battalion, a Territorial Army unit serving as part of the 51st (Highland) Division, then commanded by Major General Victor Fortune. Still adjutant upon the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Lang was sent to France, along with the rest of the 51st Division, in January 1940, where it formed part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). However, Lang became a prisoner of war in June after the German Army invaded France. The 51st Division had been separated from the rest of the BEF earlier in the year, and, after hard fighting, retreated to Saint-Valery-en-Caux, where most of the division surrendered on 12 June 1940, Lang being among 10,000 to surrender that day. After escaping and making his way to Palestine (for which he was awarded the Military Cross), he served with the 2nd Battalion, Cameron Highlanders, and served with the battalion until August 1941. He returned to the United Kingdom and, eventually, went on to be Commanding officer (CO) of the 5th Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders from July 1944. The battalion was a TA unit formed in 1939 as a second line duplicate of the 4th Battalion and now formed part of the 152nd Brigade, commanded by Brigadier James Cassels, of Major General Tom Rennie's 51st (Highland) Division. Both the original brigade and division had been captured, as had Lang himself, in France in June 1940 but had been reformed that August by redesignating the 9th (Highland) Infantry Division and, after having served in North Africa and Sicily, were now fighting in Normandy in the aftermath of the D-Day landings. Lang was to command the 5th Cameron Highlanders throughout the rest of the campaign in Northwest Europe until Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) in May 1945. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership of the battalion in 1944. In 1958 he became commanding officer of the 153rd Highland Brigade.Obituary: Lieutenant General Sir Derek Lang The Daily Telegraph, 13 April 2001 He was made Chief of Staff at Scottish Command in 1960, then General Officer Commanding 51st (Highland) Division in March 1962 before moving on to a posting as Director of Army Training in 1964. He was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief at Scottish Command and Governor of Edinburgh Castle in 1966 and retired from the British Army in 1969. After retiring from the Army he was Secretary of Stirling University from 1970 to 1973. Family In 1942 he married Massy Dawson and together they went on to have one son and two daughters before she died in 1953; in 1953 he married A.L.S.

Their territory was roughly equivalent to the Vivarais, in the modern French department of Ardèche. Alba Helviorum was their capital, possibly the Alba Augusta mentioned by Ptolemy,Alba was a common town-name in Latin antiquity. and usually identified with modern-day Alba-la-Romaine (earlier Aps). In the 5th century the capital seems to have been moved to Viviers.A.L.F. Rivet, Gallia Narbonensis (London 1988), p. 183. From the mid-2nd to mid-1st century BC, Helvian territory was on the northern border of the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina (later the Narbonensis). As a border people, the Helvii played a crucial if limited role in the Gallic Wars under the leadership of Gaius Valerius Caburus, who had held Roman citizenship since 83 BC, and his sons Troucillus and Domnotaurus.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 1.19, 1.47, 1.53, 7.8, 7.65. Julius Caesar calls the Helvii a civitas,Bellum Gallicum 7.65.2. a polity with at least small-scale urban centers (oppida),John Koch notes that the Gallo-Brittonic word corresponding to Caesar's usage of civitas is most likely *touta (Old Irish túath): \\"'tribe' would not be a perfect translation, but is less misleading than 'state,' 'city,' or 'nation'\\" (Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-Clio, 2000), p. 450 online. John Drinkwater, however, argues in Roman Gaul: The Three Provinces, 58 BC–AD 260 (Cornell University Press, 1983), for \\"'nation' in the American Indian sense, made up of a number of tribes — Caesar's pagi\\" (p. 30, note 2; concept of civitas discussed in depth pp. 103–111). See also A.N. Sherwin-White on civitas, populus, municipium and oppidum in The Roman Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 1973) passim; if *touta is correctly translated as \\"a people,\\" the sense of civitas Helviorum might be analogous to that of the Roman People (populus) as a political entity. In his edition of Tacitus' Germania (Oxford University Press, 1999), J.B. Rives, drawing on Cicero's definition of civitas as \\"an assembly and gathering of men associated under law\\" (Republic 6.13), says that it is the usual word for a \\"community viewed under its political aspect,\\" equivalent to the Greek polis (p. 153). Further discussion by Olivier Büchsenschütz, \\"The Significance of Major Settlements in European Iron Age Society,\\" in Celtic Chiefdom, Celtic State (Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp. 53–64; consideration of the term \\"proto-state\\" by Patrice Brun, \\"From Chiefdom to State Organization,\\" in Celtic Chiefdom, Celtic State p. 7; see also Greg Woolf, \\"Urbanizing the Gauls,\\" in Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 106–141. In Gods, Temples, and Ritual Practices: The Transformation of Religious Ideas and Values in Roman Gaul (Amsterdam University Press, 1998), Ton Derks views the civitates of the Augustan era as \\"city-states\\": \\"a civitas was a community, whose constitution was shaped after the Roman example and whose social and political life was centred on a single town\\" (p. 39 online). and not a pagus (\\"sub-tribe\\").  Name  They are mentioned as Helviorum (var. iluiorum) by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC),Caesar. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 1:35:4 and as E̓louoì (Ἐλουοὶ) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD).Strabo. Geōgraphiká, 4:2:2 Geography The Ardèche near Aubenas, within the ancient territory of the Helvii The source of the Loire river (Latin Liger) was located in Helvian territory, near their northern border along the crest of the Cévennes, where their lands were contiguous with those of the Gabali and the Vellavi; to the east, the Rhône offers a natural boundary, despite some indications that their holdings extended across the river. The ridge between the rivers Ardèche and Cèze was likely their southern border, delimiting their territory from that of the Volcae Arecomici, though it is also possible that the Ardèche itself served this purpose. To the northeast, they were neighbors to the Segovellauni, separated perhaps by a ridge between the Eyrieux and the Ouvèze rivers.Rivet, Gallia Narbonensis p. 184. Roman politics In the 70s BC, following the civil war between the aristocratic faction of Sulla and the remnants of the supporters of Marius and Cinna, the Roman popularist Quintus Sertorius refused to yield Spain to the Sullan dictatorship. His secession sparked the Sertorian War, during which Celtic polities in Mediterranean Gaul were subjected to troop levies and forced requisitions to support the military efforts of Metellus Pius, Pompeius Magnus (\\"Pompey the Great\\"), and other Roman commanders against the rebels. Some Celts, including perhaps the Helvii and Volcae Arecomici, supported Sertorius. After the renegade Roman was assassinated, Metellus and Pompeius were able to declare a victory, and the Helvii and Volcae were forced to cede a portion of their lands to the Greek city-state Massilia (present-day Marseilles), a loyal independent ally of Rome for centuries, located strategically at the mouth of the river Rhône and the staunch supporter of Pompeius.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 1.35. During Caesar's Gallic Wars, none of the Gallic civitates within the Narbonese province joined the pan-Gallic rebellion of 52 BC, nor engaged in any reported acts of hostility against Roman forces. The Helvian Valerii, in fact, play a key role in securing Caesar's rear militarily against Vercingetorix, who sent forces to invade Helvian territory.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 7 In his 1861 history of the Vivarais,L'Abbé Rouchier, \\"L'Helvie à l'époque gauloise et sous la domination romaine,\\" in Histoire religieuse, civile et politique du Vivarais (Paris, 1861), vol. 1, pp. 3–65. Abbé Rouchier conjectured that Caesar, seeing the strategic utility of Helvian territory on the border of the Roman province along a main route into central Gaul, cultivated the Valerii by redressing the punitive measures taken against them by Pompeius. Caesar mentions the land forfeiture in his Bellum Civile, while discreetly omitting any actions taken by his loyal Helvian friends against Rome in the 70s. During the Roman civil wars of the 40s, Massilia chose to maintain its longstanding relationship with Pompeius even in isolation, as the Gallic polities of the Narbonensis continued to support Caesar.Stéphane Mauné, \\"La centuriation de Béziers B et l'occupation du sol de la vallée de l'Hérault au Ie av. J.-C.,\\" in Histoire, espaces et marges de l'Antiquité: Hommages à Monique Clavel Lévêque (Presses Universitaires Franc-Comtoises, 2003), vol. 2, p. 73 online. The Massiliots were besieged and defeated by Caesar, and as a result lost their independence, as well as the land, Caesar implies, that they had taken from the Helvii.Rouchier, pp. 48–49. During his dictatorship, Caesar was criticized by political rivals for what were perceived as overly generous grants of citizenship to the Gauls and for admitting even \\"trouser-wearing Gauls\\"It is sometimes assumed that this \\"accusation\\" was exaggerated for effect. Suetonius, Divus Iulius 80.2, records the invective chant at Caesar's triumph: \\"Caesar led the Gauls in triumph and likewise into the senate house; the Gauls took off their trousers and put on the wide stripe\\" (Gallos Caesar in triumphum ducit, idem in curiam / Galli bracas deposuerunt, latum clavum sumpserunt). to the Roman senate. These new Gallic senators were most likely from Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), which had become so Romanized that after 42 BC it was no longer assigned as a province and was administered by the same forms of municipal government as the rest of the Italian peninsulaWerner Eck, \\"Provincial Administration and Finance,\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 345 online. (see Annexing Cisalpine Gaul). Ronald Syme, however, pointed out that a few Narbonese Gauls are known to have been highly educated, second-generation Roman citizens who were eminently qualified for senatorial rank. Among those named by Syme were the Helvian Gaius Valerius Troucillus.Ronald Syme, The Roman Revolution (Oxford University Press, 1939, reprinted 2002), p. 79; \\"The Origins of Cornelius Gallus,\\" p. 43.

Hessling appeared in 15, mostly silent, films before retiring from the acting profession and withdrawing from public life in the mid-1930s.  Biography  Hessling, born in Champagne-Ardennes, had sought refuge in Nice during World War I. Her paternal ancestors came from Alsace but moved to Champagne-Ardennes when Alsace transferred to Germany. In 1917, her beauty came to the attention of Henri Matisse, who sent her to fellow artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir as he thought she looked like a suitable Renoir subject. Hessling modelled, clothed and nude, for Renoir until his death in December 1919. Renoir's second son, Jean, fell in love with Hessling, and the couple married on 24 January 1920. Hessling gave birth to a son, Alain Renoir, on 31 October 1921. Jean Renoir had been planning a career in ceramic art but decided instead to try his hand in the medium of film in the attempt, he would later claim, to make Hessling a star. While both were aficionados of American films, and Hessling copied fashions and behaviour she saw on the screen, she had in fact never had any thought or ambition to become an actress herself.Pérez, G: The Material Ghost: Films and Their Medium, p.193. Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000. Renoir produced his first script, Catherine, in 1924. Albert Dieudonné would direct the film. Renoir devised for Hessling a very stark, exaggerated look, with the mouth and eyes a penetrating black against white facial make-up, which was again used in his first full-length film The Whirlpool of Fate, and the lavish and costly adaptation of Émile Zola's Nana (1926), in which Hessling's performance has been described as characteristically stylised and unsubtle, yet appropriate for this role. Hessling appeared in three more Renoir films before the couple separated in 1931. It was rumoured that she had expected to play the role of Lulu in Renoir's sound film La Chienne and felt betrayed when the film's producers insisted on, and Renoir agreed to, another actress (Janie Marèse) in the role. Following the couple's separation (the divorce was not finalised until 1943), Hessling appeared in minor roles in three sound films and had a brief career as a dancer before abandoning show business completely. She lived the rest of her life out of the public eye. Hessling died in suburban Paris on 28 September 1979, aged 79. Jean Renoir had died in California earlier the same year.

Monroe also founded Youth Argosy, an organization intended to \\"provide travel opportunities for worthy young people of slender means\\" and resigned his directorship of American Youth Hostels in 1949 to devote time to Youth Argosy. After a promising start, Youth Argosy went bankrupt in 1951, largely due to a new Civil Aeronautics Board regulation aimed at small charter groups. Monroe attended the Mount Hermon School for boys in 1919. After graduation, he became a Massachusetts school teacher and boy scout leader. During a scout trip to Europe, Monroe and Isabel met Richard Schirrmann and learned about his German Hostelling Organization. They later attended the second International Hosteling Meeting in 1933 and brought the idea of hosteling back to the United States, where the American Hostelling International movement was born. Monroe was born on January 22, 1901 in Sunderland, Massachusetts and died on December 8, 1972 in Delray Beach, Florida. Isabel was born on December 12, 1898 in Hartford, Connecticut and died on May 3, 1985 in Boulder, Colorado. They had three children, Elizabeth, Steve, and Jonathan.

Château Rauzan-Ségla is also the name of the red wine produced by this property. The wine produced here was classified as one of fifteen Deuxièmes Crus (Second Growths) in the original Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. The alternate name \\"Rausan- Ségla\\" was also frequently used until 1994 when the original \\"Rauzan-Ségla\\" again became the official name. History Château Rauzan-Ségla Rauzan-Ségla was once part of the vast Rausan estate owned by Pierre de Mesures de Rauzan in the mid-17th century. Over time, this estate was divided, and by the time of the 1855 Classification, had been separated into the estates of Château Rauzan-Gassies, Château Rauzan-Ségla, Château Desmirail, and Château Marquis de Terme. After a long ownership by the Durand-Dasier family, the estate was acquired by Frédéric Cruse of the Cruse family in 1903 who held ownership until 1957, and until 1989 it belonged to Liverpool shipping magnate John Holt.Kissack, Chris, thewinedoctor.com Chateau Rauzan-Ségla By 1982 the estate had hired the consultant services of Émile Peynaud, and in 1989 the property was purchased by Brent Walker. Whatever plans he had, however, were not to bear fruit; in 1994 he sold the estate on to the Wertheimer family of Chanel, who installed a winemaking team led by David Orr and John Kolasa (both from Chateau Latour). Chanel remain the current owners, and they are credited with continuing to push the quality ever higher. In 2014, Nicolas Audebert, the former winemaker at Cheval des Andes, the LVMH property in Mendoza Argentina, was hired to succeed John Kolasa following his retirement. Production The Rauzan-Ségla vineyard extends with the grape variety distribution of 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot and 2% each of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. The grand vin is Château Rauzan-Ségla, with an annual production of 8000 cases, and the surplus wine is destined for the second wine named Ségla.

The reason is that the Harz is one of the regions with the heaviest rainfall in Germany and so its water power was utilised very early on. The first dam (on the Upper Harz Ponds) was built in order to drive water-powered pumps and stamp mills used in the mines. At the present time the Harz reservoirs provide hydro-electricity, drinking water and flood protection, particularly when the snows melt in spring.

Life and work Burgess was born in Chelsea, in London, and was the son of Henry William Burgess, landscape painter to William IV, and part of a family of several generations of distinguished artists (see \\"Family\\" below). He was educated at \\"Brompton Grammar School\\" and, after the death of his father when he was 10 years old, received art training from William Charles Ross, the miniature painter - who had been friend of his father. In 1848 he went to James Mathews Leigh's art school in Soho. In 1850 he exhibited a picture at the Royal Academy and in 1849 entered the Academy schools, winning the first-class medal for life drawing. Each year from 1852 until his death, Burgess was an annual contributor to the Academy's exhibitions. Burgess started his career by painting portraits and genre works, before travelling to Spain in 1858, accompanied by his friend and fellow artist Edwin Long - who would become his travelling companion on future painting trips to the country. For the next some thirty years, Burgess was an annual visitor to Spain, often spending days with Spanish peasants, living their life and sharing their food. He also went to Morocco at least once. In 1860, he married Sophia, daughter of Robert Turner of Grantham, Lincolnshire. Burgess's first great success was his \\"Bravo Toro\\" in 1865. Some of his other important works are \\"Stolen by Gypsies\\" (1868), \\"Kissing Relics in Spain\\" (1869), \\"The Barber's Prodigy\\" (1875), and \\"Licensing Beggars in Spain\\" (1877). In June 1877, Burgess was elected an associate of the Royal Academy. Other paintings are \\"The Letter-Writer\\" (1882), \\"The Scramble at the Wedding\\" (1884), \\"The Cigarette Makers\\" (1887), and \\"Freedom of the Press\\" (1890),The freedom of the press (RA collections). which was Burgess's diploma work upon being elected a full member of the Royal Academy in 1889.

Overview The album was conceived by white South African expatriates Trevor Herman and Jumbo Vanrenen and released in 1985 on the British-based Earthworks label. The following year it was released in the USA by the Shanachie Records label. It features twelve tracks by artists from South Africa. The sleeve notes state that all songs are in the mbaqanga style, a guitar-based style popular at the time in the townships of Johannesburg and Durban, but the tracks actually cover four different styles, mbaqanga, mqashiyo, maskanda, and isicathamiya. The former two are the least traditional-sounding of the styles, while the latter two styles incorporate elements of urban and more rural music. Released prior to the more commercially successful Graceland by Paul Simon, it was one of the first albums of contemporary South African music to be widely available outside the country. The album has been re-released several times and also spawned a succession of later volumes in the Indestructible Beat series, released by the Earthworks label. Critical reception The album was placed in the top 10 in the annual Pazz & Jop poll in the magazine The Village Voice. AllMusic calls it \\"an essential sampler of modern African styling, a revelation and a joy.\\" Leading critic Robert Christgau gave it an A+ rating, and called it the most important record of the 1980s.

The 191st overall episode of the series, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 21, 2009. In the episode, the South Park boys form their own backyard wrestling league, drawing droves of fans more interested in the acting and scripted dramatic storylines than athletic elements. \\"W.T.F.\\" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode parodied several aspects of professional wrestling, highlighting the sport's emphasis on such theatrical elements as costumes, back stories and scripted storylines. The episode demonstrated how amateur wrestling is often afforded less respect because of pro wrestling, and it presents pro wrestling fans as deluded rednecks while also likening them to middle-class theatregoers. \\"W.T.F.\\" specifically parodies World Wrestling Entertainment and its chairman, Vince McMahon. The episode received generally mixed reviews, with several commentators calling professional wrestling too easy a target for South Park satire. According to Nielsen ratings, \\"W.T.F.\\" was seen by 1.37 million households among viewers aged between 18 and 49. Plot After watching a live WWE match between WWE superstars Edge and John Cena at the Pepsi Center and being totally enthralled, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, Kenny, Butters, Jimmy and Token decide to join the school's wrestling team, unaware how different the sport is from professional wrestling. They all feel that the wrestling coach Mr. Connors's teaching of \\"real wrestling\\", or \\"wrassling\\", is too homoerotic and immediately quit the class to form their own backyard wrestling league called \\"the Wrestling Takedown Federation\\" (W.T.F.), much to the frustration of Mr. Connors. The boys' federation relies heavily on theatrical elements and scripted storylines, with such characters as a Russian who belittles Americans, a veteran of the Vietnam War and a girl who has had fourteen abortions. Their audience grows quickly, and consists mostly of rednecks who believe the action is real and the dialogue reflects actual events. As its popularity increases, the federation add an auditorium, complete with proscenium staging and theater-style lighting, to the back of Cartman's house. Soon, the events see the performers reciting dramatic monologues more often than engaging in wrestling and stunt work. Mr. Connors is fired by the school board due to the violence associated with wrestling, after the board fails to make a distinction between what he teaches and professional wrestling (as do the town bar regulars). They also find videos of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling on his iPhone and mistake them for gay pornography. The boys are excited to learn WWE Chairman Vince McMahon has heard of their federation and will be scouting one of their shows. Mr. Connors sits in his apartment surrounded by awards for wrestling and in tears over his termination and what wrestling has become. Vengeful, he plans to sabotage the event in a personal vow to restore the integrity of the wrestling sport. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny secretly decide to relegate Butters, Jimmy and Token to smaller roles, thinking that it will give themselves a better opportunity to impress McMahon. They hold tryouts in the manner of a theater audition in order to find new talent for their show, which is now more reminiscent of musical theatre than wrestling. Mr. Connors sneaks into the event and unsuccessfully attempts to destroy the wrestling ring with a rocket launcher, killing Kenny instead. He runs into the ring and chastises the crowd with an impassioned monologue about how professional wrestling has ruined real wrestling, and the downward spiral his life has taken since it cost him his job (as well as everything else). The crowd begins to sympathize with him, angrily chanting, \\"They took his job!\\" McMahon is impressed with the speech and decides to sign Mr. Connors to the WWE—much to his delight. The boys are frustrated at losing their latest shot at stardom and began brawling amongst themselves, blaming each other for the lost opportunity. They then start wrestling each other to the ground. Unimpressed by the genuine wrestling and real conflicted drama, the crowd deems it \\"fake\\" and begins to leave. Theme alt=Two shirtless men with their arms held up in defensive positions stand crouched facing each other inside a wrestling ring with three red ropes running parallel to each other. A crowd of spectators watch from all side of the ring as a man wearing a referee shirt stands with his hands on his knees watching the two men. \\"W.T.F.\\" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It first aired on October 21, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. \\"W.T.F.\\" parodies several aspects of professional wrestling, a form of theatre involving mock combat and catch wrestling, in which matches, along with pre- and post-match commentary and action, are choreographed and scripted. The South Park episode highlights the theatrical elements of professional wrestling, such as the costumes, back stories and scripted dramatic storylines. The fans are portrayed as far more interested in these theatrical elements than any actual athletic feats. The theatrical aspect of professional wrestling are often over-exaggerated in \\"W.T.F.\\" to add comedic emphasis and satire. For example, a try-out involves no actual wrestling at all, but rather dramatic monologues, and resembles the audition scene from the Broadway musical \\"A Chorus Line\\". Similarly, Vince McMahon watches one of the matches from a balcony wearing opera glasses, similar to that of a theatre rather than a traditional wrestling venue. The episode also demonstrates how amateur wrestling, an actual non-choreographed sport with such styles as Greco-Roman and freestyle, is often afforded less respect due to professional wrestling. The boys initially mistake this form of wrestling for the scripted professional wrestling they are used to, and then are uninterested in it when they learn about the actual sport. The moves and holds their teacher tries to teach them are interpreted by the boys as homoerotic and treated with disrespect. The gym teacher, Mr. Connors, is portrayed as showing despair for what professional wrestling has done to harm \\"real wrestling\\", culminating in a final scene in which he makes a tearful rant to the crowd at one of the boys' wrestling matches. \\"W.T.F.\\" also mocks fans of professional wrestling, who are portrayed largely as stereotypical rednecks who believe the scripted storylines are real. The wrestling matches in \\"W.T.F.\\" are purposely fake-looking to emphasize the scripted nature of professional wrestling, and utilize elements typically featured in real matches, like the use of metal folding chairs as weapons. The professional wrestling characters created by the South Park boys, such as Cartman's \\"the Rad Russian\\", are similar to the gimmick-based types of characters created by actual professional wrestling leagues, like The Iron Sheik. These characters, too, are portrayed in an over-the-top way to emphasize the comedic satire of professional wrestling. This is particularly illustrated with the use of one of Cartman's characters, a female diva who claims to have had so many abortions, she has become addicted to them. Cultural references alt=A man with short gray hair wearing a black suit jackets and black pants speaks into a microphone while standing in the middle of a wrestling ring, gesturing with his left hand. Behind him, a crowd of men wearing army camouflage uniform watches. Vince McMahon, the chairman of World Wrestling Entertainment and occasional professional wrestler himself, is featured prominently in \\"W.T.F.\\" Various aspects of the World Wrestling Entertainment company are featured in \\"W.T.F.\\" John Cena and Edge, professional wrestlers who have both worked for the WWE, appear in a match against each other. Both are portrayed by voice actors, not the actual wrestlers themselves. The South Park boys host a \\"W.T.F. Smackdown\\" event, a reference to the WWE SmackDown television program. Also noted, Token's W.T.F attire is resembled to the attire of WWE wrestler R-Truth. A wrestling try-out held by the boys resembles scenes from the Broadway musical A Chorus Line, which involves Broadway dancers auditioning for spots on a chorus line. One of the people trying out sings a musical number about why he wants to be a wrestler, which parodies the song \\"Nothing\\" from A Chorus Line. The episode also includes references to the musical Fame, the film Waiting for Guffman and the reality television series American Idol. When Cartman and Kenny order a meeting with Stan and Kyle to discuss the wrestling league, they meet at a Sizzler, a steak- and seafood-restaurant chain. Reception In its original American broadcast on October 21, 2009, \\"W.T.F\\" was watched by 1.37 million overall households among viewers aged between 18 and 34, according to Nielsen ratings. Among that age group, it ranked behind the FX drama series Sons of Anarchy, which drew 1.43 million household viewers, as well as game five of the 2009 National League Championship Series on TBS (1.56 million households) and a National Football League game between the Denver Broncos and San Diego Chargers on ESPN (3.57 million households). \\"W.T.F.\\" received generally mixed reviews. Ramsey Isler of IGN said the professional wrestling parody was \\"pretty spot on\\", but that the target was too easy, and the episode \\"lacks a lot of the punchy kind of comedy that the show is usually known for\\". Nevertheless, Isler said the writing was clever and had funny moments, like Kenny's \\"El Pollo Loco\\" character, and the scene where the gym teacher tries to take down a security guard with a traditional wrestling move. Josh Modell of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+ grade and called it \\"one of those too- common SP episodes that could've been cut in half\\". Modell said the true-to- life way the boys formed their wrestling company was \\"great\\" and that the parody of professional wrestling was on target, but also said they \\"have been told a million times before. They're not really jokes at this point.\\" Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine gave the episode a C+ grade, saying professional wrestling seems like a topic South Park should have mocked long ago. Delgado said the best scenes were the first moments of the boys' wrestling league, but that the \\"novelty of the idea starts to fade\\" and the developments become too outrageous. Macleans writer Jamie Weinman criticized the episode and said professional wrestling was \\"not exactly a timely target\\". Not all reviews were negative. Salon.com writer Mary Elizabeth Williams called the show \\"perennially offensive [and] still shockingly funny\\", and particularly praised Cartman's wrestling character \\"Bad Irene\\", who professes a love of and addiction to abortions. Williams called it, \\"a reminder that the heated debate over choice frequently serves as America's prime-time entertainment\\". Home release \\"W.T.F.\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's thirteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 16, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios, which discussed the process behind animating the show with Inside Xbox host Major Nelson.

It is native to a very small area of western Nepal and northern India in the Himalayas. It has approximately spoon-shaped, leathery leaves with distanced rounded teeth alternately set along straight, shyly branching stems, and carries many flower heads of about 1 cm, with a few creamy white florets, sometimes with a hint of violet, in corymbs at the end of the branches. Flowers and fruits can be found between March and May. Its vernacular name in Hindi is विषपत्री (vishpatri) or विश्पत्र (vishpatra).  Description  Catamixis baccharoides is a shrub of ¾–1¾ m (2½–5¾ ft) high, with straight, shyly branching stems, which are circular in cross-section, initially covered in silky hairs pressed to the surface, but later becoming hairless, carrying alternately set leaves close together, which leave distinct marks after being shed. The leaves are leathery and hairless, 3½—8 cm (1.4–3.2 in) long and 1½—3½ cm (0.6–1.4 in) wide, spoon-shaped, the base tapering into the stalk, while the margin is somewhat wavy, with distanced rounded teeth particularly in the upper half. The flower heads are set in corymbs at the end of the branches or in the leaf axils. Each flower head consists of an involucre, high, with several whorls of lanceolate bracts narrowing into the tip, with papery edges, and contains mostly five, sometimes four or six, hermaphrodite creamy white ligulate florets of 3¾ cm (1½ in), ending in five shallow, but irregular lobes. Each of the five individual anthers per floret has two spurs at its base, giving them an arrow-shaped foot. Like in all Asteraceae, the pinkish anthers are fused into a tube through which the style grows, while picking up the pollen that is released at the inside of the tube. The shaft of the style only has few hairs at its base. When ripe, the style opens into two branches of about ½ mm (0.04 in) with short stigmatic papillae at the dorsal side. There are no bracts on the common base of the florets. The indehiscent one-seeded fruits (called cypselas) are long, covered in velvety hairs, and are adorned by ten longitudinal ribs. The sepals which are changed to barbed long hairs called pappus are white in color. The pollen is tricolpate and has some small spines of less than high.  Common characters with other less related Asteraceae  The flower heads of Catamixis contain florets with ligulate corollas only, a trait shared with the Lactuceae, but also with Fitchia, Hyaloseris, Dinoseris and Glossarion.  Taxonomy  Catamixis baccharoides was described by Thomas Thomson jr. in 1867, who thought it was most closely related to Leucomeris, a genus that is now assigned to the subfamily Wunderlichioideae, tribe Hyalideae. There are no synonyms. It has been difficult to establish the relationships of Catamixis with other asterids, since no substantial analysis of its genetic material has been published sofar. Because it shares the combination of ligulate florets, spurred anthers, and involucres that consist of several whorls of overlapping bracts, the species was initially assigned to the tribe Mutisieae sensu lato, but genetic analysis has since shown that this grouping constitutes a basal evolutionary grade, which has been consequently divided into nine subfamilies. and cited in However, further characters of Catamixis are shared with different of these subfamilies or the subdivisions they include, but always elements of the unique character combinations of these subfamilies are lacking in Catamixis. More recently, Catamixis was assumed to be associated with the tribe Pertyeae. Catamixis lacks a deletion of 17 base pairs close to one of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase genes, that is a common character for members of the subfamilies Gymnarrhenoideae, Cichorioideae, Corymbioideae and Asteroideae. Catamixis, Pertya, Myripnois and two of the Ainsliaea-species share a deletion of 145 base pairs not found in any lineage except Pertyoideae. A point mutation in the maturase K gene is shared with the genera Ainsliaea and Pertya, which belong to the Pertyoideae. This makes it very likely that Catamixis should be included in the Pertyoideae, but does not fully resolve the position within that subfamily.  Etymology  The name Catamixis is a contraction of the Greek words κατά (kata) and μιξη (mixi), meaning “mixed affinity”, which refers to its combination of characters, that makes it difficult to assign it based on morphology within the Asteraceae.  Distribution and habitat  A narrow range endemic monotypic genus distributed in lower Shiwalik belt of Western Himalaya from an altitude range of . The species is reported from few localities in India from Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and one from West Nepal. The species is habitat specific and grows on exposed, dry, sandstone or calcareous rocky cliffs of lower Shiwalik belt.  Conservation  Since the genus is threatened, a number of efforts were carried out for the conservation of this species under ex-situ conservation. This habitat-specific species is also propagated and cultivated in the botanical garden of Botanical Survey of India, Dehradun in an artificially created rocky mound and is also planted in the experimental garden of Forest Research Institute, Dehradun.

Cavea tanguensis is currently the only species assigned to this genus. It has a basal rosette of entire, slightly leathery leaves, and stems of 5–25 cm high, topped by bowl-shaped flower heads with many slender florets with long pappus and purplish corollas. The vernacular name in Chinese is 葶菊 (ting ju). It grows high in the mountains of China (Sichuan), Tibet, India (Sikkim), and Bhutan, and flowers in July and August.  Description  Cavea is a perennial herb with stout, woody and mostly branched rootstocks of 10–30 cm long, which carry a basal leaf rosette and unbranching stems that carry some smaller leaves, bracts and flower heads.  Stems and leaves  The erect unbranching stems are stout and 5–25 cm high. The leaves in the basal rosette are somewhat leathery or even fleshy, the underside with many or few brownish glandular hairs, elongated spoon-shaped, –6 or exceptionally 12 cm long and {{frac|1|2}–1 cm wide, at the base gradually narrowing to the main vein, the edge with some teeth far apart, and a blunt tip or almost pointy. The leaves on the stem have brownish glandular hairs, with some saw-like teeth and a blunt tip. The lower leaves on the stem are 3–6 cm long and cm, almost vertically oriented and enveloping the base of the flower heads.  Inflorescence  Flower heads mostly contain relatively few male florets at the centre, encircled by many more female florets. However solely female flower heads also occur, and individual plants may even produce only female flower heads. The flower heads are individually set at the end of the branches, bowl-shaped and mostly 3– cm across. The involucre is –2 cm high, nearly reaching the mouth of the florets, with four to five whorls of leaf- like bracts, the outermost bracts largest, which are long to very long ovate in shape linear-oblong or obovate-lanceolate, their margin with some glandular hairs, and a stump to pointy tip. The common base of the floret is flat or somewhat convex, and is without bracts subtending individual florets. Each flower head contains a hundred to two hundred very slender disk florets. There are usually, twenty to thirty male florets at the centre of a flower head, which are tube- to bell-shaped, with five lobes, the tube being about mm long, and the free part of the lobes about 4 mm long. In the male florets, the stigma does not split into lobes. The sterile cyselas are about 11 mm long, hairless except for one whorl of pappus hairs of about 5 mm at the tip. The female florets are purplish in color, tube-shaped, densely covered in hard white hairs, with a tube of about 7 mm long and lobes of less than ¼ mm. In the female florets, the stigmas have two lobes, the lobes being exserted inside the corolla tube. The cyselas in the female florets are slender, angular cylindrical, 5–6 mm, set with dense bristles and two whorls of about fifty rough, purple pappus hairs of about mm. Flowers are present in July and August, while ripe fruits can be found in September and October.  Pollen  The pollen grains are about 35 μm in diameter, slightly flattened at the poles, with three longitudinal slits that suddenly stop near the poles. The surface is densely covered in conical spines of 2– μm high and – μm wide at the base, slightly perforated at base, and with pointy tips.  Taxonomy  The species was initially described in 1910 as Saussurea tanguensis by James Ramsay Drummond, a British civil servant and amateur botanist living in India. However, William Wright Smith and John Kunkel Small in 1917 considered it too different from other Saussurea species and erected the new genus Cavea for it. The placement of Cavea within the daisy family has been difficult. In older literature it was placed with the Inuleae, however in 1977 it was removed from that tribe because the morphology of the pollen was too different. Arne Anderberg considered the species might be a relative of Saussurea, which he placed in the Cardueae. C. Jeffrey in 2007 had reservations, but preliminary placed it in the Cardueae. Recent genetic analysis suggests it could be best assigned to the Gymnarrhenoideae. Few morphological features would support this assignment, other than both having two types of flower heads and sharing a tendency towards dioecism. Both also have basal leaf rosettes, stretched leaves, with few spaced teeth on the margin, and both lack spines and latex.  Modern classification  Gymnarrhena micrantha is now considered the sister taxon of Cavea tanguensis, who together constitute the tribe Gymnarrheneae and the subfamily Gymnarrhenoideae.  Phylogeny  Based on recent genetic analysis, it is now generally accepted that the Pertyoideae subfamily is sister to a clade that has as its basal member the Gymnarrhenoideae, and further consists of the Asteroideae, Corymbioideae and Cichorioideae. These three subfamilies share a deletion of nine base-pairs in the ndhF gene which is not present in Gymnarrhena micrantha. Current insights in the relationships of Cavea and Gymnarrhena to the closest Asterid subfamilies is represented by the following tree.  Etymology  Cavea is named after George Cave, who was the curator of the Lloyd's Botanical Garden in Darjeeling, and who collected many new plants from all over Sikkim.  Distribution  This plant can be found in southwestern Sichuan, Tibet, Bhutan, and Sikkim.  Habitat  Cavea grows on gravelly substrate near glaciers and streams at altitudes between 4000 and 5100 m.  Use  Leaves are used on wounds, and to suppress fever. In traditional Tibetan medicin, the species is known as ming-chen-nag-po.

Smithsonian Contributions to Botany 92. pg. 21. Its local common names include romero del piche and romero pichi. This species is a member of the Chiliotrichum Group in the tribe Astereae of the aster family. This group includes many related \\"shrubby daisies\\" native to South America. Chiliophyllum densifolium is the type species of its genus, described from Mendoza Province in 1862. Two more species were added to the genus, but in 2009 C. fuegianum was transferred to Chiliotrichum and C. andinum was moved to a genus of its own, Cabreraea, leaving C. densifolium the sole member of Chiliophyllum. This plant is a spreading, somewhat rounded shrub growing up to 1.7 meters tall. Its herbage is gland-dotted and sometimes has woolly hairs. The branches are covered densely in leaves; the genus name Chiliophyllum is from the Greek ' (\\"thousand\\") and ' (\\"leaf\\"), a reference to the abundant leaves, and the species name densifolium also refers to the dense foliage. The leathery, glandular leaf blades are 5 to 6 millimeters long and teardrop- shaped. Flower heads occur singly at the tips of the branches. They are cylindrical with layers of glandular phyllaries that have membranous edges. The heads contain 4 to 8 yellow ray florets tipped with three lobes and up to 12 tubular yellow disc florets tipped with five curled lobes. The fruit is a ribbed achene up to a centimeter long including its pappus of many narrow scales. This species only occurs in the Andes of central Argentina, where it grows in rocky mountainous habitat at elevations between 2000 and 2600 meters. Associated flora includes Nassauvia axillaris, Berberis buxifolia, and species of Ephedra and Adesmia. The plant is used medicinally as a diuretic mixed with yerba mate in mate.

The Royal College of Music devised its own BMus course which (uniquely among conservatories) it was entitled by Royal Charter to award. The other mainline British music colleges followed a similar model: Trinity College of Music awarded the GTCL graduate diploma and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama the GGSM diploma. Like the GRSM, they have been replaced. The Licentiate of the Royal Academy of Music diploma, open to all students of the Royal Academy of Music, in either instrumental teaching or performing was usually taken by examination in the second year of the GRSM course.

His art photography focuses on landscapes marked by signs of human folly, but he has also worked as a war reporter and stills photographer for the motion picture industry. Early life and education Olley was born in London. After being ejected from the Chelsea School of Art, he attended the post-graduate course at the University of Wales Newport School of Documentary Photography. Early career In 1989, he began work as a freelance press photographer. In 1990, he won the Nikon Press Award for a photo essay in The Independent newspaper. Between 1991 and 1993, he covered stories on the collapse of the Berlin wall and the 'Velvet Revolution' in Czechoslovakia for the UK press. At the end of 1993 he relocated from London to New York. In 1992, he joined London-based Network Photographers and continued to work freelance, beginning a project in New Mexico and Nevada, USA, on the Atomic Bomb. The Siege of Sarajevo In 1994, Olley travelled to Bosnia to live under siege in Sarajevo, taking news photographs for the Boston Globe, Paris Match, L'Express and The Guardian newspaper. On 5 February 1994, he was caught up in what became known as the market massacre in Sarajevo where 68 people were killed and 200 wounded. Olley's images of the market massacre were exhibited at Visa pour l'Image in Perpignan, France in 1994, and his photo essay on Sarajevo won him the Observer Hodge Award as Young Photojournalist of the Year in 1995. Photo essays and personal projects Upon receiving a bursary to complete his Atom Bomb project, Olley travelled to Japan to complete the project in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The A-bomb exhibition opened at The Photographers' Gallery, London. In 1996, he began another personal project on the Newbury Bypass road protests in the forests of Berkshire for inclusion in a group work for the Millennium. In the 1997 World Press Photo Awards he won two first prizes. Awarded 'first prize stories: Nature & Environment’, for the essay on the Newbury Bypass road protest and ‘first prize stories: Arts’, for his essay on the Burning Man festival in Nevada. In the same year, he undertook a project for an exhibition to celebrate 50 years of the National Health Service (NHS). This work was widely published in Britain and Europe and exhibited in over 50 NHS hospitals in the UK. At this point, Olley began work on a 5x4 landscape project on barracks and police stations in Northern Ireland. Modern Castles of Northern Ireland Completed in 1989, Olley's 'Modern Castles of Northern Ireland' captures the architecture of The Troubles of Northern Ireland; fortified police stations, watchtowers and army barracks.http://www.coldtype.net/castles/Castles.HR.pdf Originally published in Source Magazine, this work became widely published around the world and was first exhibited at Festival International Du Reportage, Perpignan, France. It would later be shown at the ICA (London, UK), the Letterkenny Arts Centre, (Co.Donegal, Rep.Ireland) and the Noorderlicht Photofestival (Groningen, Netherlands). In 2003 it was collected for the nation by the Public Record Office and the Imperial War Museum. It was shown at Tate Modern in London in 2010 as part of Exposed: Voyeurism, Surveillance and the Camera. It was published as a book by Factotum in 2007. Kosovo In 1999, Olley travelled to Macedonia during the refugee crisis and continued work in Kosovo after the liberation. The resultant book, Kosovo was published by Network Photographers and the 'Partners'. The book was sold to make money for The International Red Cross and featured the work of Sebastião Salgado, Olley and Joachim Ladeofoged. In 2000 the book won the D&AD; (Design & Art Directors) Award for Olley's photography. Later work During the 2000s Olley worked on a variety of projects. These included the colour large format landscape project 'Between Home & Heaven' on the uninhabited volcanic Island of Surtsey, Iceland, 'Fairy Stones', an examination of myth and superstition and its effects upon modern Icelandic society and 'Engineering Nature', about humankind's desire to create an 'Edenic' landscape, taking into account land use management, reclamation, leisure use of the landscape and car culture. In 2004, he travelled to Iraq, to continue a project seeking to create visual art that conceptualises the relationships between the human and natural worlds. Now based in London, he teaches part-time on the Documentary Photography course at the University of Wales, Newport, but remains a freelance photographer, undertaking various assignments around the world. The Forbidden Forest ‘The Forbidden Forest' looks at the peripheral effects of warfare on the landscape. The images focus on the battle for Verdun, in Northeast France known as the 'Zone Rouge', which covers approximately , with no public access since the armistice of 1918.

It is based at Danbury Municipal Airport in Danbury, Connecticut. History The club was originally incorporated on June 22, 1940 by 20 members who each put up $20 toward the purchase of a Piper J-2 Cub. Since then, the club has owned several aircraft throughout its history from both Cessna and Piper, and currently owns two Piper Archers and one Piper Dakota. The number of members has ranged from the original 20 up to approximately 50. On September 12, 2007, the club lost one of its planes due to a fire that destroyed the old Reliant Air hangar. Notable for being a part of history, the hangar was witness to the start of Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight. The club has since replaced the destroyed aircraft with a 2000 Piper Archer III. Special Events On June 22, 2015, the club celebrated its 75th anniversary of continuous operation. Operations Members are able to schedule any of the three current planes from an online reservation system with as little or as much advance as they desire. Prospective members may be given a demonstration flight by one of the current members at a reduced rate. All new members are voted on by the club members at the monthly meetings and must be given a checkout flight by one of the club- approved flight instructors. This ensures that everyone in the club is competent and proficient to fly, and helps maintain a trust among the club members. All club aircraft are meticulously maintained, and during the summer months (generally May through September) a \\"Wash 'n Wax\\" event is held just prior to that month's meeting. This provides a social aspect to the club and allows members to meet each other while keeping the aircraft clean. In addition, many club members arrange \\"Fly-out\\" events with other members as a way to share their passion (and flight cost) with others. In addition to daily reservations, each member is entitled to reserve a plane for an extended period of time. Specifically, one reservation per month for an entire weekend, one reservation per year during the summer months for up to 10 consecutive days and one reservation per year during non-summer months for up to 14 consecutive days. As a result of popular discussion by the club members, a \\"Pinch Hitter\\" program was established to teach the members' significant others and flying partners how to fly, navigate, and land the aircraft should the pilot become incapacitated. The program includes both basic ground and flight instruction to the participants.

Geography The Central Mexican matorral covers an area of on the southern portion of the Mexican Plateau. The Mexican Plateau is bounded on the east by the Sierra Madre Oriental, on the south by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and on the west by the Sierra Madre Occidental. The Central Mexican matorral covers much of the southern portion of the plateau, extending from the Valley of Mexico in the southeast to the Bolaños River in the northwest. The Central Mexican matorral is bounded by the Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests to the east and northeast, the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests to the southeast, and the Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests on the northwest. An isolated enclave of the Central Mexican matorral occupies the Valley of Toluca. The higher mountain ranges of the plateau are home to sky islands of pine-oak forest, isolated by matorral at lower elevations. To the southwest, the Central Mexican matorral is bounded by tropical dry forests; the Bajío dry forests in the Lerma River basin, and the Sinaloan dry forests in the lower reaches of the Río Grande de Santiago and its tributaries. To the northwest, the Central Mexican matorral transitions to the Meseta Central matorral, which covers the middle portion of the Mexican Plateau. The eastern portion of the Central Mexican matorral is drained by the Pánuco River and its tributaries, the central portion by the Lerma River and its tributaries, and the eastern portion by the northern tributaries of the Río Grande de Santiago, including the Rio Verde and Bolaños. The Valley of Mexico is an endorheic basin, which drains into central lakes. The ecoregion is home to Mexico City, the largest metropolis in North America. Other cities in the ecoregion include Toluca, San Luis Potosí, Aguascalientes, Zacatecas, San Miguel de Allende, Dolores Hidalgo, San Juan del Rio, Pachuca, and Actopan. Climate The climate is subtropical and semi-arid, with warm summers and occasional summer rains. Winters are cool, particularly at higher elevations.Wiken, Ed, Francisco Jiménez Nava, and Glenn Griffith (2011). North American Terrestrial Ecoregions—Level III. Commission for Environmental Cooperation, Montreal, Canada. Flora The characteristic vegetation is dry shrubland, called matorral. Cactus and rosette plants are prominent. Cactus include species of prickly pear cactus (Opuntia – Opuntia robusta, Opuntia streptacantha, and Opuntia leucotricha, Ferocactus latispinus, Mammillaria magnimamma, Cylindropuntia imbricata. Rosette plants include agaves like Agave lechuguilla, yuccas, including Yucca filifera and Yucca decipiens, Hechtia podantha, and species of Dasylirion. Other shrubs and low trees include Schinus molle, Acacia farnesiana, and Mimosa biuncifera. Ground cover plants include grasses and herbs. In the Valley of Mexico, the dominant matorral plants are Opuntia streptacantha, Zaluzania augusta, Yucca filifera, Schinus molle, and Mimosa biuncifera. Halopytic grasslands and low shrubs occur on the valley's saline soils, including the shrub romerito (Suadea mexicana). Fauna Native mammals include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), southern spotted skunk (Spilogale angustifrons), Mexican cottontail (Sylvilagus cunicularius), desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), and rock squirrel (Otospermophilus variegatus).

Historically in Lancashire, it lies around four and a half miles to the north east of Manchester city centre and is contiguous with other parts of Moston and with the towns of Failsworth and Chadderton. Local services include New Moston Primary School (founded in 1901),http://www.newmoston.manchester.sch.uk/index.php?category_id=31 St Margaret Mary's Primary school, New Moston Library and Broadway Leisure Centre which was opened in 1932. Nuthurst Park was opened in 1915 following a campaign for a public park in the area by the 'New Moston Improvement Association'.P10 New Moston - More Memories, New Moston Historical Society History The district was historically part of the Manor of Nuthurst, lying within the historic township of Moston and was distinguished by its two manor houses, Great Nuthurst and Little Nuthurst Halls. The halls have long since been demolished but the place-name Nuthurst still survives in the area in the guise of Nuthurst Road and Nuthurst Park. The archaic district of Theale Moor, lying partly in Chadderton, was also in this area. During the Middle Ages Theale Moor was the location of a violent land dispute that was only resolved when boundary stakes were set up on the common moorland. The name 'New Moston' originates from 1850 when 'The Manchester Bridgewater Freehold Land Society' was formed by Elijah Dixon and his colleagues, with the aim of allowing ordinary workers a chance to acquire land, for housing or allotments, away from the smoke and pollution of overcrowded industrial Manchester. In March 1851, six holdings covering 57 acres at the “top end of Moston”, farmed by tenants of the Hilton family, of the medieval Great Nuthurst Hall, were purchased for £2,900 by the society, the aim being to divide the land into 230 plots. A further £5,000 was invested by the society in laying out new streets to serve the plots. An access road was formed from Hale Lane in Failsworth to replace a footpath, known as Morris Lane, across the Moston Brook, which forms the boundary with Failsworth. Morris Lane ran into Moston Lane (now ‘East’). The new road, connecting with Oldham Road, gave an easier route to Manchester, Oldham or beyond. The brook was culverted and the hollow filled in to permit a road wide, level and firm enough to take carts and carriages into the estate at ‘New Moston’. The name chosen reflected Robert Owen's model housing schemes such as New Lanark and New Harmony. The access road was opened in 1853 and was soon followed by the laying-out of five streets: Dixon, Ricketts, Potts, Jones and Frost Streets. These were later renamed Belgrave, Parkfield, Northfield, Eastwood and – combined with the existing Scholes Lane, past Pitt's Farm – Hawthorn Roads respectively. By 1854, houses had begun to be built, some of the earliest surviving ones being Rose and Moss Cottages, Ivy Cottage and by 1863, a pair of cottages on Dixon Street, one of which was used as a beerhouse. By 1871 this was already named the New Moston Inn; in the twentieth century the two cottages were rebuilt and merged as one. There was little change after Elijah's death, until Moston and New Moston became part of Manchester in 1890. Many little-used plots began to be sold to developers, and the next twenty years or so saw a massive expansion of housing, both within the original area, with the addition of side-streets and avenues, and beyond, as neighbouring farms were gradually sold off. Schools were built on what had been Brown's Farm, Slater Fold Farm gave way to Nuthurst Road, the park and the avenues around Hazeldene Road, and Crimbles Farm, the last to go, enabled further expansion along Moston Lane, extending right up to the Chadderton boundary. From 1925 onwards, the building of Broadway spurred further expansion, such as the estates around West Avenue and Chatwood Road: New Moston is now much bigger than the original “top end of Moston”.

The current church building opened in 1957. This growing parish was formed in 1935, partly from St. Dunstan's, Failsworth, and Hollinwood parishes. It began with the celebration of Mass at the Broadway Baths until a hall was built and first occupied in June 1936. Part of the district served by the parish was given up in 1940 to help in the formation of the new parish of St. John Bosco.http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Moston/StMargaretMary.shtml St Chad (Church of England) on Hazeldene Road was founded in 1931.http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Moston/StChad.shtml Eastwood Road Primitive Methodist was founded before 1881, closing its doors in the early to mid 1970s.

Failsworth Golf Club Failsworth Golf Club, Nuthurst Road, New Moston was founded in 1895. It was an eighteen-hole course prior to and just after World War 1. In about 1927 the course was reduced to nine-holes when the LMS Railway (who owned the land) decided to sell a portion to Manchester City Council for housing around Chatwood Road, between Nuthurst Road and Hollinwood Avenue, which date from 1928 onward. The eighteen-hole course originally ran from Williams Road at the south end all the way to Hollinwood Avenue at the north. On 27 January 1914 the Manchester Courier ran an interesting piece on the Failsworth club, it gives an insight to the club and a general course description at the time. “On leaving Victoria on a stopping train one reaches Moston station in eleven minutes, and the clubhouse is only a niblick shot distant from the platform. Surely if one reckons by the time required to reach it, this must be the nearest golf to Manchester. The second impression is that the name of the club is apt to mislead strangers unfamiliar with the geography of the outlying parts of the city. Although this is the Failsworth club, the clubhouse alone is situated in that district, and, after crossing the road to the first tee, the whole of the course is in Moston.\\" Despite opposition from the local Member of parliament a decision was made to sell the course in 1972. House building on what is now \\"The Fairway\\" commenced in 1973/4. The original club house (known locally as the 'Tin Hut') on Hollinwood Avenue still exists and is now New Moston Conservative Club, but all that remains of the northern end of the course is a path beside the railway leading to Nuthurst Road. The later clubhouse was on the south side of Nuthurst Road and lay next to the historic Little Nuthurst Hall.http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php/england/north- west/cheshire/496-manc-failsworth-golf-club-nuthurst-road-new-moston |Golfs Missing LinksRetrieved 20 July 2018 Transport First Greater Manchester operate the following bus services in the New Moston area: 24, providing links to Manchester City Centre via Newton Heath and to Rochdale via Chadderton and Royton. 181/182 to Manchester City Centre via Newton Heath and to Rochdale via Chadderton, Shaw and Milnrow. 81 to Manchester City Centre via Moston and Harpurhey and to Oldham with some evening and weekend services provided by Stagecoach Manchester extending to Derker. 149 to Cheetham Hill via Higher Blackley and to Oldham via Hollinwood.
