A major innovator during his heyday, Enoken's stage shows, radio appearances, and film roles were a major influence within Tokyo theatre before World War II, and was a catalyst for the revival of comedy in the postwar period. Born in Aoyama, Tokyo, the son of rice cracker shop owners, Enomoto fell under the spell of such stars of the Asakusa Opera as Taya Rikizo and Fujiwara Yoshie, and in 1922 he made his stage debut at age 18 as a chorus member of the Asakusa Kinryukan Theatre. The Great Kant≈ç earthquake of the following year dealt a great blow to the opera world in Tokyo, at which time Enomoto shifted to comic theatre. Playing small roles in various comedy productions, he returned to the Asakusa stage in 1929 as part of the troupe Casino Folies. The following year saw him launch his own troupe, Enoken Gekidan, which would firmly establish him as a leading figure in Tokyo theatrical circles. In 1934, he starred in the movie Enoken no Seishun Suikoden (Enoken's Tale of Youth's Folly), and gained national popularity. His subsequent film career saw him parody a whole parade of Japanese historical personages, including Kond≈ç Isami and Sakamoto Ry≈çma, in a series of \\"jidai- geki\\" (historical dramas) and \\"chanbara\\" (samurai drama) films, including some directed by Kajir≈ç Yamamoto, Nobuo Nakagawa and Akira Kurosawa. Enomoto became afflicted with necrosis of the right leg in the 1950s, which required amputation, curtailing his film and stage career. He did, however, make a legendary comeback at the Shinjuku Koma Theater 1963 wearing a prosthetic leg. He died in 1970, and is entombed in Hase Temple in Nishi-Azabu, Minato, Tokyo, on whose tombstone is inscribed \\"The King of Comedy\\".

It is located in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile on Cerro Paranal at altitude, south of Antofagasta. By total light- collecting area, it is the largest optical-infrared observatory in the Southern Hemisphere; worldwide, it is second to the Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii. The Very Large Telescope (VLT), the largest telescope on Paranal, is composed of four separate telescopes. In addition, the four main telescopes can be used simultaneously for extra light gathering capacity, and for interferometry. Four auxiliary telescopes of each are also part of the VLTI to make it available when the main telescopes are being used for other projects. The site also houses two survey telescopes with wide fields of view, the VISTA and the VLT Survey Telescope for surveying large areas of the sky; and two arrays of small telescopes called NGTS and SPECULOOS which are dedicated to searching for exoplanets. Two major new facilities are under construction nearby: the southern part of the Cherenkov Telescope Array gamma-ray telescope (not owned by ESO) will be sited in the grounds 10 km south-east of Paranal; while ESO's future E-ELT will be on the nearby peak of Cerro Armazones 20 km east of Paranal, and will share some of the base facilities.  Telescopes  =Aerial view = From an aerial view of the Paranal Observatory, the four large units of the VLT with their four small, dome-shaped auxiliary telescopes can be clearly seen. The Survey Telescope, VST, is immediately adjacent to the VLT and seen in between two of its units, while VISTA is located on a secondary peak, some 1,500 m away in the background (see image). = Very Large Telescope = The Very Large Telescope (VLT) consists of four 8.2-metre telescopes operating in the visible and infrared. These telescopes, along with four smaller auxiliary telescopes, are also combined to operate as an optical interferometer on certain nights of the year. All of the 8.2-metre telescopes have adaptive optics and a full suite of instruments. = VISTA Survey Telescope = VISTA is the Visible & Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy, a 4.0-metre telescope with a wide field of view, focusing on infrared surveys of the sky. It was built close to ESO's VLT by a consortium of 18 universities from the United Kingdom, led by Queen Mary University of London. VISTA was handed over to the European Southern Observatory in December 2009. = VLT Survey Telescope (VST) = The VLT Survey Telescope or VST is a 2.6-metre telescope with a wide field imager intended to aid the four Very Large Telescope (VLTs) in their scientific aims. = Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) = The Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) is an exoplanet-survey facility located a few kilometers from the main peak. It consists of an array of twelve 0.2-meter robotic telescopes with a very large field of view of 96 square degrees or several hundred times the area of the full moon. The survey aims to discover numerous super-Earths and Neptune-sized planets around nearby stars, using transit photometry to detect them. NGTS is managed by a partnership of seven academic institutions from Chile, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom and its design is based on the SuperWASP project. Science operations began in early 2015. = SPECULOOS Southern Observatory (SSO) = The SPECULOOS Southern Observatory (SSO) consists out of four telescopes, called Europa, Io, Callisto, and Ganymede. ESO hosts the 1-meter telescopes and the project is led by the University of Li√®ge. The project aims to find exoplanets around ultracool dwarf stars and brown dwarfs. The project builds on the success of the TRAPPIST telescope. The telescopes are located next to the NGTS.  Other buildings  As well as the telescopes, control buildings and maintenance facilities, Paranal has a Residencia which provides accommodation for staff and visitors. This is located 200 m lower and 3 km from the telescopes. It is built half into the mountain with the concrete coloured to blend into the landscape. It has gym facilities, a swimming pool, a restaurant and two gardens. The construction was decorated by the Chilean architect Paula Guti√©rrez Erlandsen, Marchioness of la Pica.

The observatory's facilities were used to stage the Pacific Alliance's fourth summit in June 2012, formally launching the organization. On 14 March 2013, Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, accompanied by his wife, Princess Mary, visited ESO's Paranal Observatory, as part of an official visit to Chile.

The name nesC is an abbreviation of \\"network embedded systems C\\". Components and interfaces nesC programs are built out of components, which are assembled (\\"wired\\") to form whole programs. Components have internal concurrency in the form of tasks. Threads of control may pass into a component through its interfaces. These threads are rooted either in a task or a hardware interrupt. Interfaces may be provided or used by components. The provided interfaces are intended to represent the functionality that the component provides to its user, the used interfaces represent the functionality the component needs to perform its job. In nesC, interfaces are bidirectional: They specify a set of functions to be implemented by the interface's provider (commands) and a set to be implemented by the interface's user (events). This allows a single interface to represent a complex interaction between components (e.g., registration of interest in some event, followed by a callback when that event happens). This is critical because all lengthy commands in TinyOS (e.g. send packet) are non-blocking; their completion is signaled through an event (send done). By specifying interfaces, a component cannot call the send command unless it provides an implementation of the sendDone event. Typically commands call downwards, i.e., from application components to those closer to the hardware, while events call upwards. Certain primitive events are bound to hardware interrupts. Components are statically linked to each other via their interfaces. This increases runtime efficiency, encourages robust design, and allows for better static analysis of programs.

Native English speakers of the region actually speak a number of varieties, including: the variety most recently brought in and spreading since the 20th century among white communities of the South in general (Southern U.S. English); the variety primarily spoken by black residents (African American Vernacular English); the variety spoken by Cajuns in southern Louisiana (Cajun English); the variety traditionally spoken by affluent white residents of the city's Uptown and Garden District; and the variety traditionally spoken by lower middle- and working-class white residents of Eastern New Orleans, particularly the Ninth Ward (sometimes known, since at least the 1980s, as Yat). However, only the last two varieties are unique to New Orleans and are typically those referred to in the academic research as \\"New Orleans English\\". These two varieties specific to New Orleans likely developed around the turn of the nineteenth century and most noticeably combine speech features commonly associated with both New York City English and, to a lesser extent, Southern U.S. English. The noticeably New York-like characteristics include the NYC-like short-a split (so that mad and map, for example, do not have the same vowel), non-rhoticity, th-stopping (so that, for example, \\"those\\" may sound like \\"doze\\"), and the recently disappearing coil‚Äìcurl merger. Noticeably Southern characteristics include the fronting of and possible monophthongization of (just these features, plus non-rhoticity, often characterize the Uptown accent). Often, the term \\"Yat\\" refers particularly to the New Orleans accents that are \\"strongest\\" or most especially reminiscent of a working-class New York City accent, though others use the term as a regional marker, to define the speech heard in certain parts of the city and its inner suburbs. Used in these narrower senses, Yat is simply one of many sub-dialects of New Orleans. The word comes from the common use of the local greeting, \\"Where y'at?\\" or \\"Where are you at (i.e. in life)?\\", which is a way of asking, \\"How are you?\\" History A unique New Orleans accent, or \\"Yat\\" accent, is considered an identity marker of white metropolitan people who have been raised in the greater New Orleans area. English professor Allan A. Metcalf discusses that \\"Yats\\" mostly live near the Irish Channel in blue-collar neighborhoods. The dialect's connotation with the working-class white population therefore encodes the speaker's identities.Metcalf, Allan A., How We Talk: American Regional English Today (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2000). Print. Plausible origins of the accent are described in A. J. Liebling's book The Earl of Louisiana, in a passage that was used as a foreword to A Confederacy of Dunces, John Kennedy Toole's well- known posthumously published novel about New Orleans:Toole, John Kennedy (1980). A Confederacy of Dunces. Baton Rouge: LSU. In the decades following the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, when New Orleans changed from being a French colonial possession to an American city, Irish, German, and eventually Italian (largely Sicilian) immigrants indeed began populating the city. However, rather than believing the New York and New Orleans dialects evolved similarly merely due to a similar mixture of European immigrant populations, modern linguists believe that the dialect histories of New Orleans and New York City actually have a direct relationship: significant commercial and demographic interactions between the two cities.Carmichael, Katie; Becker, Kara (2014). \\"That Hoboken near the Gulf of Mexico: What (r) can tell us about English in New York City and New Orleans\\". Paper to be presented at New Ways of Analyzing Variation (NWAV) 43, Chicago IL. Although exact linguistic theories vary, the broad consensus is that key New York accent features probably diffused to New Orleans by the late 19th century.Carmichael, Katie; Becker, Kara (2018). \\"The New York City‚ÄìNew Orleans connection: Evidence from constraint ranking comparison.\\" Language Variation and Change 30.3: 287-314. pp. 19, 22. Large- scale movements (permanent or seasonal) of working-class, lower middle-class, and merchant-class Northeastern Americans of European immigrant families to New Orleans may have brought along their native Northeastern (namely, New York City) accent features. Even during the antebellum era, Northerners made up over a quarter of all free, white, non-immigrant residents of New Orleans.Carmichael & Becker, 2018, p. 5 Linguist William Labov specifically argues that Jewish American bankers and cotton merchants strongly affiliated with New York City were the biggest influence on upper-class accents (and presumably, the eventual accents of all classes) in New Orleans. He cites examples of Sephardic and German Jewish connections to influential merchantile firms in 19th-century New Orleans.Labov, William. \\"Transmission and Diffusion\\". Language. Volume 83, Number 2, June 2007, 344‚Äì387. Linguistic Society of America. pp. 33-34. Local variance The Yat accent is the most pronounced version of the New Orleans accent. Natives often speak with varying degrees of the \\"Brooklyn\\"-like accent, ranging from a slight intonation to what is considered full Yat. As with all dialects, there is variance by local speakers due to geographic and social factors. This results in many different levels of Yat throughout the area, marking distinct differences between higher-income people and lower-income people. Yat tends to differ in strength and intonation from neighborhood to neighborhood. The type, strength, and lexicon of the accent vary from section to section of the New Orleans Metropolitan Area. Longtime residents can often tell what area the other residents are from by their accent. Speakers of this dialect originated in the Ninth Ward, as well as the Irish Channel and Mid-City. Slighter intonations of the dialect can be heard in some parts of the city, such as Lakeview, the Marigny, the Garden District, and some parts of Gentilly, but mainly in the suburbs. The dialect is present to some degree in all seven parishes that make up the New Orleans metropolitan area, from St. Tammany to Plaquemines. As with many sociolinguistic artifacts, the dialect is usually more distinct among older members of the population. The New Orleans suburban area of Chalmette is known for the strongest Yat accent of the Greater New Orleans area. Linguistic features =Pronunciation in the Yat dialect= Though there are many New Orleans accents, they all vary strongly in pronunciation. On the subject of the 'Yat' accent, numerous phonological differences occur between words pronounced in the dialect and their standard equivalents, most often in the form a stress-shift toward the front of a word (i.e., 'insurance', 'ambulance' as , ), or in the form of a change in vowel quality. A southern tendency that shifts vowel sounds known as monophthongization has distinctly separated Yat from other port city dialects. Some of the most distinct features are: *the rounding and lowering in some cases of and to (i.e., 'God,' 'on,' 'talk', become , , ) *the loss of rhoticity on syllables ending in (i.e. 'heart,' fire' become , ) *the full rhoticization of a syllable-internal (i.e. 'toilet,' becomes ). This feature is more typical in men than in women. *the loss of frication in the interdental fricatives and (i.e. 'the,' 'there,' 'strength' become , , ) *the substitution of or (spelled -in, -en) for (spelled -ing) *the split of the historic short-a class into tense and lax versions *the coil‚Äìcurl merger of the phonemes and , creating the diphthong , before a consonant, in words such as boil, oil, and spoil, although this feature has mostly receded, except St. Bernard Parish There are some words with phonemic incidence, yet according to no particular pattern, including 'sink' , 'room' , 'mayonnaise' , 'museum' , 'ask' . New Orleans is pronounced , or with the still intact. The N'awlins' of the tourist industry and the common are not to be heard among natives. Louisiana can be pronounced as the standard or a slightly reduced in the 'Yat' dialect. In popular culture The characters \\"Vic & Nat'ly\\" by local cartoonist Bunny Matthews are what some might call Yats. The distinct New Orleans dialect has been depicted in many ways throughout the city and the U.S. The main character of the cartoon strip Krazy Kat spoke in a slightly exaggerated phonetically-rendered version of early-20th century Yat; friends of the New Orleans-born cartoonist George Herriman recalled that he spoke with many of the same distinctive pronunciations. Actual New Orleans accents were seldom heard nationally. New Orleanians who attained national prominence in the media often made an effort to tone down or eliminate the most distinctive local pronunciations. Dan Baum's Nine Lives shares the feelings of Ronald Lewis, a native of the Ninth Ward who is embarrassed by his local dialect when speaking in front of a group of white northerners. After the displacement of Greater New Orleans area residents because of Hurricane Katrina, the United States was introduced to some of the New Orleans Yat accents by constant news coverage. Steven Seagal's show Lawman exposed some Yat accents and dialects to the nation. Ronnie Virgets, a New Orleans writer, commentator, and journalist, employs New Orleans dialects and accents in his written and spoken works, including the locally produced public radio program, Crescent City. WWNO, the local public radio station, broadcasts the program and provides access to past Crescent City programs on its website. Seymore D. Fair; his name is a Yat derivative.The name of the official mascot for the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition, held in New Orleans, was derived from the truncated pronunciation of \\"See More of the Fair,\\" which results in the pseudo yat speak \\"Seymore D. Fair.\\" A Midwest Cajun restaurant chain based in Indianapolis, Indiana carries the name Yats. Cellphone company Boost Mobile used the phrase \\"Where Y'At?\\" in early advertising campaigns. Who Dat? is a chant commonly tied to the Yat dialect and used in support of the New Orleans Saints football team. The entire chant is \\"Who dat? Who dat? Who dat say dey gonna beat dem Saints?\\" Saints fans are collectively called \\"Who Dat Nation.\\" The Yat dialect is seldom heard when New Orleans is depicted in movies and television shows. Traditionally, characters portrayed from New Orleans are heard using a southern or Cajun accent. An example of this is 1986's The Big Easy, in which Dennis Quaid speaks an exaggerated Cajun/southern derivation. This trend has been challenged, though, in light of post-Katrina New Orleans representation, like HBO's Treme and Werner Herzog's Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, both of which feature actual New Orleans locals either speaking in Yat or one of its variations. Other local dialects and misconceptions Historically, the city of New Orleans has been home to people of French, Spanish, and African heritage, which led to the creation of the Louisiana Creole language, before this city came under U.S. rule in the Louisiana Purchase. Over the course of the 19th century, the city transitioned from speaking French to becoming a non-rhotic English-speaking society. Similarly, much of the South has historically spoken non-rhotic English. A misconception in other parts of the U.S. is that the local dialect of New Orleans is the same as Cajun English (spoken in several other areas of South Louisiana), but the city's cultural and linguistic traditions are distinct from that of the predominantly rural Acadiana, an area spanning across South Louisiana. While there has been an influx of Cajuns into the city since the oil boom of the later 20th century and while there are some similarities due to shared roots, Cajun culture has had relatively little influence upon Creole culture and thus Yat culture. The confusion of Cajun culture with the Creole culture is largely due to the confusion of these French cultures by the tourism and entertainment industries; sometimes this was done deliberately, as \\"Cajun\\" was often discovered to be a potentially lucrative marketing term. Speakers with a New Orleans accent are typically proud of their accent as it organically stems from the historical mixing of language and culture. This distinctive accent has been dying out generationally in the city due to white flight of the city, but remains very strong in the suburbs. However, the Yat dialect does survive in the city in several areas, notably Mid-city, Lakeview, parts of Gentilly and Uptown.

The phrase exists due to the observation that traditional Lionel and American Flyer toy train track sits much higher than finescale track. The compromises that were traditionally made in manufacturing these trains have led to three approaches to model railroading in these two scales. The traditional toy train layout makes little, if any, effort at realism and often makes use of unpainted plastic buildings, particularly the Plasticville brand, and other toys, making little or no effort to disguise their origin. In some cases, the buildings, vehicles, and figures on the layout may not even be the same scale as the train, or each other. Roads, grass, and roadbed may be painted onto the table surface, or may be represented with low-pile carpet. Scale modeling also occurs in O and S scales, just like in HO or N scales, where the modeler tries to create a miniature world that is as realistic as possible. Scale modelers in O and S scales will often avoid, or at least make limited use of, traditional American Flyer and Lionel locomotives and rolling stock since it sometimes was not very true to scale, was lacking in detail, and used oversized knuckle couplers. Scale modelers use O gauge track, but with two rails rather than the three rails used by Lionel, and the trains run on direct current. Numerous standards for track that is more true to scale exist for both O and S scales. High rail is an in-between approach. High-railers live with the out-of-scale track and will make use of off-the-shelf diecast vehicles that may be slightly out of scale, especially in O scale because true 1:48 scale vehicles are scarce, whereas 1:43 and 1:50 scale diecast vehicles are very common. Some use vintage Lionel and American Flyer trains, while others opt to use modern equivalents built to greater detail. High railers often will repaint and weather their trains, vehicles, and buildings, just as a scale model railroader would. Sometimes they will go to great lengths to try to conceal the middle rail on Lionel track, and will replace the oversized couplers that came with their trains from the factory with scale versions. High railers are less likely to engage in scratch building than their scale modeling counterparts, but many engage in kitbashing and super-detailing their buildings and structures. Some manufacturers, particularly in S scale, will offer rolling stock with either scale or high-rail trucks and couplers, in order to cater to all potential markets.

The slide started on Fishhawk Mountain (also called Big Fish Hawk Mountain), where it continued into the creek. The slide and the water dammed up behind a bridge, then broke through, making the creek about or meters wide instead of the normal two or three.

Traditional genkan in the early 20th century are traditional Japanese entryway areas for a house, apartment, or building‚Äîsomething of a combination of a porch and a doormat. It is usually located inside the building directly in front of the door. The primary function of genkan is for the removal of shoes before entering the main part of the house or building. A secondary function is a place for brief visits without being invited across the genkan step into the house proper. For example, where a pizza delivery driver in an English-speaking country would normally stand on the porch and conduct business through the open front door, in Japan a food delivery would typically take place across the genkan step. Genkan are normally recessed into the floor, to contain any dirt that is tracked in from the outside (as in a mud room). The height of the step varies from very low (5-10 cm) to shin-level or knee-level. Genkan in apartments are usually much smaller than those in houses, and may have no difference in elevation with the rest of the floor; it may simply have a different type of flooring material than the rest of the floor to distinguish it as the genkan. After removing shoes, one must avoid stepping on the tiled or concrete in socks or with bare feet, to avoid bringing dirt into the house. Once inside, generally one will change into : slippers or shoes intended for indoor wear. Schools and have large with compartments for each person's outdoor shoes. In private residences, getabako may be absent, and shoes are usually turned to face the door so they can be slipped on easily when leaving. Genkan are also occasionally found in other buildings in Japan, especially in old-fashioned businesses.  History  The custom of removing one's shoes before entering the house is believed to go back over one thousand years to the pre-historical era of elevated-floor structures.

Background After the harvest had failed at his village, Stedelen was accused of using black magic to destroy the crops by allegedly sacrificing a black rooster on the Sabbath at a crossroad and placing a lizard under the doorway of a local church. Peter von Greyerz, the judge of Simmental between 1398‚Äì1406, was a firm believer in witchcraft, which he believed had been introduced in Simmental by a noble man called Scavius in 1375, who claimed he could transform himself to a mouse (as recorded in Johannes Nider's seminal work Formicarius). Scavius was slaughtered by his enemies, but he had a student, Hoppo, who, according to Greyerz, had been the tutor of Stedelen. There are no records about Hoppo, but Stedelen from Boltigen had allegedly been made an expert on magic by Hoppo, and supposedly learned to steal manure, hay and such from others' fields to his own by magic, create hail and thunderstorms, make people and animals sterile, make horses crazy when he touched their hooves, fly, and scare those who captured him. Greyerz also accused Stedelen of having taken the milk from the cows of a married couple in order to make the wife miscarry.  Trial  After torture, Stedelen admitted to the charge of having buried a lizard under the house of the couple. His trial took place in a secular court, where he confessed under torture to summoning forth demons as part of a pact with the Devil. Stedelen was burned at the stake. Greyerz believed there existed a satanic cult, whose members swore themselves to the Devil and ate children at the churches at night. He continued his persecutions and once tortured a woman to confirm this.

This deep and lasting love of music is expressed through the performance and enjoyment of all types and genres of music. While popular music from many genres has experienced almost two decades of explosive growth and success in Nova Scotia, the province remains best known for its folk and traditional based music. Nova Scotia's folk music is characteristically Scottish in character, and traditions from Scotland are kept very traditional in form, in some cases more so than in Scotland. This is especially true of the island of Cape Breton, one of the major international centres for Celtic music. Founding cultures Nova Scotia is one of three Canadian Maritime Provinces, or simply, The Maritimes. When combined with Newfoundland and Labrador the region is known as the Atlantic Provinces, or Atlantic Canada. Despite the small population of the province, Nova Scotia's music and culture is influenced by several well established cultural groups, that are sometimes referred to as the \\"Founding Cultures.\\" Originally populated by the Mi'kmaq First Nation, the first European settlers were the French, who founded Acadia in 1604. Nova Scotia was briefly colonized by Scottish settlers in 1620, though by 1624 the Scottish settlers had been removed by treaty and the area was turned over to the French until the mid-18th century. After the defeat of the French and prior expulsion of the Acadians, settlers of English, Irish, Scottish and African descent began arriving on the shores of Nova Scotia. Settlement was greatly accelerated by the resettlement of Loyalists (called in Canada United Empire Loyalists) in Nova Scotia during the period following the end of the American Revolutionary War. It was during this time that a large African Nova Scotian community took root, populated by freed slaves and Black Loyalists and their families, who had fought for the Crown in exchange for land. This community later grew when the Royal Navy began intercepting slave ships destined for the United States, and deposited these free slaves on the shores of Nova Scotia. Later, in the 19th century the Irish Great Hunger and Scottish Highland Clearances resulted in large influxes of migrants with Celtic cultural roots, which helped to define the dominantly Celtic character of Cape Breton and the north mainland of the province. This Celtic, or Gaelic culture was so pervasive that at the outset of World War I reporters from London, England were horrified when some of the first regiments to arrive in England from Canada piped themselves ashore, styled themselves as \\"Highland Regiments\\" and spoke Scottish Gaelic as their primary language. Traditional music in the modern era Scottish traditional music has remained vibrant on Cape Breton into the 21st century, and has produced several performers of international renown. The first major musician from the island was Rita MacNeil, a mainstream singer whose music did not draw deeply on Celtic traditions. She was followed by Stan Rogers, who was born in Ontario to a Nova Scotian family, and sang ballads of seagoing Maritimers, though again little reflecting the area's Scottish traditions. The province is the heart of a vibrant and popular style of Celtic music and dance derived from the influence of its Highland Scottish settlement, concentrated especially on Cape Breton Island. The basic duo of fiddle and piano provide a strongly-accented dance music in small-town church and community halls. Sometimes a guitar is augmented, and Highland bagpipe music is also popular. In many ways the music and dance over two centuries of relative physical isolation provides a snapshot of Scottish music and dance as it was before its European base took other, more \\"refined\\" routes, and today Cape Breton fiddle music has taken a place as a major attraction at Celtic cultural festivals. The first popular musician who showed Nova Scotia's Celtic heritage to the mainstream world was John Allan Cameron, a singer and guitarist, and son of legendary fiddler Katie Ann Cameron, who was herself the sister of the music collector Dan Rory MacDonald. More recent performers with a Celtic sound in their music include the pop crooning of Sarah McLachlan from Halifax, Mary Jane Lamond and flautist Chris Norman. Cape Breton has a well-known bagpipe tradition, and has produced some well-known pipers, including Angus MacDonald, Barry Shears and Jamie MacInnes. It is, however, the fiddling tradition which Nova Scotia and Cape Breton is best known for, and the biggest name in this tradition is Winston \\"Scotty\\" Fitzgerald from Cape Breton. Also of his generation were a litany of names now known in the international scene, though renown came late for most; these include Joe MacLean, Bill Lamey, Buddy MacMaster, Alex Francis MacKay, Dan Joe MacInnes, Angus Chisholm, Dan Hughie MacEachern, Donald Angus Beaton, Theresa MacLellan, Joe Cormier and Paddy LeBlanc. Many of these were first given distribution outside of the area by American folk label Rounder Records, which began a Cape Breton unit in the early 1970s. The Rankin Family did more than any group to bring Cape Breton folk music to mainstream audiences in Canada and abroad. They had performed as a family since childhood, playing traditional music that gradually became more modern as their fame grew. Perhaps the most well-known modern Cape Breton fiddler is Natalie MacMaster, who comes from a line of musicians that includes Buddy MacMaster, Wendy MacIsaac and Ashley MacIsaac. Her cousin, Ashley MacIsaac, is notable for having achieved success playing both traditional music and radical musical fusions, exemplified by his Hi‚Ñ¢ How Are You Today? (1995), a landmark recording. To the south of Cape Breton, on the north mainland, due to the many Irish settlements, Irish influenced traditional music is often heard in the rural villages of Guysborough County and Antigonish County. Although fiddle and singing are popular, it is not uncommon to hear an accordion (often locally referred to as a squeezebox). Spoons, guitars and sometimes a bodhran are also used for rhythmic drive. Popular music of Nova Scotia Despite the dominance of traditional based music, both as a form of cultural expression, and as a means to brand the tourism experience for visitors to Nova Scotia, the province also has a long history of producing successful popular music acts. Many notable, internationally known artists are from Nova Scotia, in a wide variety of genres. =The early years= As early as the 1930s the music of Nova Scotia was entertaining the world. Hank Snow, born and raised in Brooklyn, Queen's County, Nova Scotia, was signed to RCA Records in 1936, but became famous in 1950 when he was invited to appear at the Grand Ole Opry. That was also the year he released \\"I'm Movin' On,\\" his first massive hit single. Portia White of Truro, Nova Scotia, one of the greatest contralto voices in the history of Canadian classical music, made her stage debut in 1941. White went on to become an internationally known and respected performer. An early introduction of the music often referred to as the fifties revolution came from Halifax musician and entertainer Eddy (M) Melanson. Eddy made his debut in 1953 performing for the Halifax Coloured Citizens Improvement League at the Odeon Theatre with a revised upbeat country sound. That sound was later classified by music historian Steve Fruitman as a reincarnation of the Country Jump Blues.Eddy formed his own band in the mid fifties and named it the ROCKABILLYS placing him at the beginning of that genre of music, introducing it in Nova Scotia. When Bill Haley and the Comets toured in the Maritimes in 1958 Eddy and his Rockabillys was selected as the Canadian group to open and close for them. He's inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame (#381) as an original Canadian Rockabilly. In 1966 The Men of the Deeps, the coal miners of Cape Breton began, and tour all over North America to this day =The 1970s and 1980s= The pop and country sounds of the 1970s were exemplified by Springhill, Nova Scotia native Anne Murray and her Haligonian producer Brian Ahern. She had a series of top 10 hits worldwide starting with \\"Snowbird\\" in 1970, and continues to be a major concert performer. Anne Murray had a #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit with the country pop \\"You Needed Me\\" in 1978. Possibly the most famous rock band from the 1970s was progressive rockers April Wine, but other bands such as Pepper Tree, Dutch Mason, Matt Minglewood and Stan Crawford Band which became the JETZ enjoyed a great degree of national and international success. As the music scene in Nova Scotia started to coalesce around Halifax and its emerging underground scene, new sounds and new styles of music started to be heard. Both the punk and new wave movements found fertile ground in Halifax, the latter producing a band whose lead singer, Sarah McLachlan, would be snapped up in the 1980s and moved to Vancouver, to later become a huge international star. Sarah McLachlan had 2 #2 albums on the Billboard 200 like the adult contemporary Surfacing in 1997. It was toward the end of the 1980s that the music scene in Nova Scotia seemed to truly become an industry, with Nova Scotians leading the creation of the East Coast Music Awards as well as establishing the Music Industry Association of Nova Scotia. Performers as diverse as rock band Blackpool, hip hop artists MC G and Cool J, and Celtic pop darlings the Rankin Family all achieved national radio & video play, major label record deals, and national media recognition. =1990s and beyond= This was followed by the Halifax music explosion of the 1990s, which saw bands such as Sloan, Eric's Trip, Jale, Thrush Hermit and Newfoundland √©migr√©s The Hardship Post obtain international recognition and recording deals with labels such as DGC and Sub Pop. It was during this time that the internationally known Halifax Pop Explosion music festival was founded (in 1993). Though the initial excitement generated during this time has abated, Nova Scotia remains at the forefront of the internationally successful Canadian music wave, with artists who came out of that era, such as Joel Plaskett, and hip hop hero Buck 65 continuing to gain worldwide respect and attention. Other acts such as The Trews, The Stanfields, Matt Mays, and Jimmy Swift Band have all experienced considerable success nationally. In the past decade, a number of independent record labels, have emerged to support the growth of the indie rock. Dependent Music publishes music by popular acts such as Wintersleep, Brian Borcherdt, Jill Barber, and Holy Fuck. BelowMeMusic promotes the Jimmy Swift Band, Slowcoaster, and Grand Theft Bus. =Emergence of hip hop= While historically isolated from the Toronto-centric Canadian hip hop scene, Nova Scotia has an increasing number of nationally known acts. In the 1980s, bands such as Down By Law, MC G and Cool J, and Hip Club Groove experienced degrees of national success. In the 1990s and early 21st century, many artists have achieved national success. Buck 65, from Mount Uniacke, has released several well received records internationally. Sixtoo is signed to and released several records on Montreal label Ninjatune. Universal Soul have seen considerable national exposure since being nominated for two MuchMusic Video Awards in 2003. Classified is an MC and producer nominated for a 2004 CUMA. The Goods, with members Kunga 219 and Gordski, have successfully toured across North America. Kaleb Simmonds achieved a national reputation after a showing in the Top Ten on the first season of Canadian Idol. Scratch Bastid came in second in the 2004 Canadian DMC finals in Winnipeg and won the 2004 Scribble Jam in Cincinnati. DJ IV, DJ Lap One and Y Rush are some of the city's current hip hop djs who mix using old school, contemporary, and underground hip hop.

Such a radio automatically detects available channels in wireless spectrum, then accordingly changes its transmission or reception parameters to allow more concurrent wireless communications in a given spectrum band at one location. This process is a form of dynamic spectrum management. Description In response to the operator's commands, the cognitive engine is capable of configuring radio-system parameters. These parameters include \\"waveform, protocol, operating frequency, and networking\\". This functions as an autonomous unit in the communications environment, exchanging information about the environment with the networks it accesses and other cognitive radios (CRs). A CR \\"monitors its own performance continuously\\", in addition to \\"reading the radio's outputs\\"; it then uses this information to \\"determine the RF environment, channel conditions, link performance, etc.\\", and adjusts the \\"radio's settings to deliver the required quality of service subject to an appropriate combination of user requirements, operational limitations, and regulatory constraints\\". Some \\"smart radio\\" proposals combine wireless mesh network‚Äîdynamically changing the path messages take between two given nodes using cooperative diversity; cognitive radio‚Äîdynamically changing the frequency band used by messages between two consecutive nodes on the path; and software-defined radio‚Äîdynamically changing the protocol used by message between two consecutive nodes. J. H. Snider, Lawrence Lessig, David Weinberger, and others say that low power \\"smart\\" radio is inherently superior to standard broadcast radio. History The concept of cognitive radio was first proposed by Joseph Mitola III in a seminar at KTH (the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm) in 1998 and published in an article by Mitola and Gerald Q. Maguire, Jr. in 1999. It was a novel approach in wireless communications, which Mitola later described as: > The point in which wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs) and the > related networks are sufficiently computationally intelligent about radio > resources and related computer-to-computer communications to detect user > communications needs as a function of use context, and to provide radio > resources and wireless services most appropriate to those needs. Cognitive radio is considered as a goal towards which a software-defined radio platform should evolve: a fully reconfigurable wireless transceiver which automatically adapts its communication parameters to network and user demands. Traditional regulatory structures have been built for an analog model and are not optimized for cognitive radio. Regulatory bodies in the world (including the Federal Communications Commission in the United States and Ofcom in the United Kingdom) as well as different independent measurement campaigns found that most radio frequency spectrum was inefficiently utilized.V. Valenta et al., \\"Survey on spectrum utilization in Europe: Measurements, analyses and observations\\", Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks & Communications (CROWNCOM), 2010 Cellular network bands are overloaded in most parts of the world, but other frequency bands (such as military, amateur radio and paging frequencies) are insufficiently utilized. Independent studies performed in some countries confirmed that observation, and concluded that spectrum utilization depends on time and place. Moreover, fixed spectrum allocation prevents rarely used frequencies (those assigned to specific services) from being used, even when any unlicensed users would not cause noticeable interference to the assigned service. Regulatory bodies in the world have been considering whether to allow unlicensed users in licensed bands if they would not cause any interference to licensed users. These initiatives have focused cognitive-radio research on dynamic spectrum access. The first cognitive radio wireless regional area network standard, IEEE 802.22, was developed by IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standard Committee (LMSC) and published in 2011. This standard uses geolocation and spectrum sensing for spectral awareness. Geolocation combines with a database of licensed transmitters in the area to identify available channels for use by the cognitive radio network. Spectrum sensing observes the spectrum and identifies occupied channels. IEEE 802.22 was designed to utilize the unused frequencies or fragments of time in a location. This white space is unused television channels in the geolocated areas. However, cognitive radio cannot occupy the same unused space all the time. As spectrum availability changes, the network adapts to prevent interference with licensed transmissions. Terminology Depending on transmission and reception parameters, there are two main types of cognitive radio: * Full Cognitive Radio (Mitola radio), in which every possible parameter observable by a wireless node (or network) is considered.J. Mitola III and G. Q. Maguire, Jr., \\"Cognitive radio: making software radios more personal,\\" IEEE Personal Communications Magazine, vol. 6, nr. 4, pp. 13‚Äì18, Aug. 1999 * Spectrum-Sensing Cognitive Radio, in which only the radio-frequency spectrum is considered. Other types are dependent on parts of the spectrum available for cognitive radio: * Licensed-Band Cognitive Radio, capable of using bands assigned to licensed users (except for unlicensed bands, such as the U-NII band or the ISM band). The IEEE 802.22 working group is developing a standard for wireless regional area network (WRAN), which will operate on unused television channels, also known as TV white spaces.IEEE 802.22 * Unlicensed-Band Cognitive Radio, which can only utilize unlicensed parts of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum. One such system is described in the IEEE 802.15 Task Group 2 specifications,IEEE 802.15.2 which focus on the coexistence of IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth. * Spectrum mobility: Process by which a cognitive-radio user changes its frequency of operation. Cognitive-radio networks aim to use the spectrum in a dynamic manner by allowing radio terminals to operate in the best available frequency band, maintaining seamless communication requirements during transitions to better spectrum. * Spectrum sharingS. Haykin, \\"Cognitive Radio: Brain- empowered Wireless Communications\\", IEEE Journal on Selected Areas of Communications, vol. 23, nr. 2, pp. 201‚Äì220, Feb. 2005: Spectrum sharing cognitive radio networks allow cognitive radio users to share the spectrum bands of the licensed-band users. However, the cognitive radio users have to restrict their transmit power so that the interference caused to the licensed- band users is kept below a certain threshold. * Sensing-based Spectrum sharing:X. Kang et. al \`\`Sensing-Based Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, vol. 58, no. 8, pp. 4649-4654, Oct 2009. In sensing-based spectrum sharing cognitive radio networks, cognitive radio users first listen to the spectrum allocated to the licensed users to detect the state of the licensed users. Based on the detection results, cognitive radio users decide their transmission strategies. If the licensed users are not using the bands, cognitive radio users will transmit over those bands. If the licensed users are using the bands, cognitive radio users share the spectrum bands with the licensed users by restricting their transmit power. * Database-enabled Spectrum Sharing,,: In this modality of spectrum sharing, cognitive radio users are required to access a white space database prior to be allowed, or denied, access to the shared spectrum. The white space database contain algorithms, mathematical models and local regulations to predict the spectrum utilization in a geographical area and to infer on the risk of interference posed to incumbent services by a cognitive radio user accessing the shared spectrum. If the white space database judges that destructive interference to incumbents will happen, the cognitive radio user is denied access to the shared spectrum. Technology Although cognitive radio was initially thought of as a software-defined radio extension (full cognitive radio), most research work focuses on spectrum-sensing cognitive radio (particularly in the TV bands). The chief problem in spectrum-sensing cognitive radio is designing high- quality spectrum-sensing devices and algorithms for exchanging spectrum- sensing data between nodes. It has been shown that a simple energy detector cannot guarantee the accurate detection of signal presence, calling for more sophisticated spectrum sensing techniques and requiring information about spectrum sensing to be regularly exchanged between nodes. Increasing the number of cooperating sensing nodes decreases the probability of false detection. Filling free RF bands adaptively, using OFDMA, is a possible approach. Timo A. Weiss and Friedrich K. Jondral of the University of Karlsruhe proposed a spectrum pooling system, in which free bands (sensed by nodes) were immediately filled by OFDMA subbands. Applications of spectrum- sensing cognitive radio include emergency-network and WLAN higher throughput and transmission-distance extensions. The evolution of cognitive radio toward cognitive networks is underway; the concept of cognitive networks is to intelligently organize a network of cognitive radios. =Functions= The main functions of cognitive radios are:Ian F. Akyildiz, W.-Y. Lee, M. C. Vuran, and S. Mohanty, \\"NeXt Generation/Dynamic Spectrum Access/Cognitive Radio Wireless Networks: A Survey,\\" Computer Networks (Elsevier) Journal, September 2006. * Power Control: Power controlX. Kang et. al \\"Optimal power allocation for fading channels in cognitive radio networks: Ergodic capacity and outage capacity\\", IEEE Trans. on Wireless Commun., vol. 8, no. 2, pp. 940‚Äì950, Feb 2009. is usually used for spectrum sharing CR systems to maximize the capacity of secondary users with interference power constraints to protect the primary users. * Spectrum sensing: Detecting unused spectrum and sharing it, without harmful interference to other users; an important requirement of the cognitive-radio network is to sense empty spectrum. Detecting primary users is the most efficient way to detect empty spectrum. Spectrum-sensing techniques may be grouped into three categories: **Transmitter detection: Cognitive radios must have the capability to determine if a signal from a primary transmitter is locally present in a certain spectrum. There are several proposed approaches to transmitter detection: ***Matched filter detection *** Energy detection: Energy detection is a spectrum sensing method that detects the presence/absence of a signal just by measuring the received signal power. This signal detection approach is quite easy and convenient for practical implementation. To implement energy detector, however, noise variance information is required. It has been shown that an imperfect knowledge of the noise power (noise uncertainty) may lead to the phenomenon of the SNR wall, which is a SNR level below which the energy detector can not reliably detect any transmitted signal even increasing the observation time. ItA. Mariani, A. Giorgetti, and M. Chiani, \\"Effects of Noise Power Estimation on Energy Detection for Cognitive Radio Applications\\", IEEE Trans. Commun., vol. 50, no. 12, Dec., 2011. has also been shown that the SNR wall is not caused by the presence of a noise uncertainty itself, but by an insufficient refinement of the noise power estimation while the observation time increases. *** Cyclostationary-feature detection: These type of spectrum sensing algorithms are motivated because most man-made communication signals, such as BPSK, QPSK, AM, OFDM, etc. exhibit cyclostationary behavior. However, noise signals (typically white noise) do not exhibit cyclostationary behavior. These detectors are robust against noise variance uncertainty. The aim of such detectors is to exploit the cyclostationary nature of man-made communication signals buried in noise. Their main decision parameter is comparing the non zero values obtained by CSD of the primary signal. Cyclostationary detectors can be either single cycle or multicycle cyclostatonary. * Wideband spectrum sensing: refers to spectrum sensing over large spectral bandwidth, typically hundreds of MHz or even several GHz. Since current ADC technology cannot afford the high sampling rate with high resolution, it requires revolutional techniques, e.g., compressive sensing and sub-Nyquist sampling.H. Sun, A. Nallanathan, C.-X. Wang, and Y.-F. Chen, \\"Wideband spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks: a survey\\", IEEE Wireless Communications, vol. 20, no. 2, pp. 74‚Äì81, April 2013. ** Cooperative detection: Refers to spectrum- sensing methods where information from multiple cognitive-radio users is incorporated for primary-user detectionZ. Li, F.R. Yu, and M. Huang, \\"A Distributed Consensus-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios\\", IEEE Trans. Vehicular Technology, vol. 59, no. 1, pp. 383-393, Jan. 2010. ** Interference-based detection *Null-space based CR: With the aid of multiple antennas, CR detects the null-space of the primary-user and then transmits within the null-space, such that its subsequent transmission causes less interference to the primary-user * Spectrum management: Capturing the best available spectrum to meet user communication requirements, while not creating undue interference to other (primary) users. Cognitive radios should decide on the best spectrum band (of all bands available) to meet quality of service requirements; therefore, spectrum-management functions are required for cognitive radios. Spectrum-management functions are classified as: ** Spectrum analysis ** Spectrum decisionK. Kotobi, P. B. Mainwaring, and S. G. Bilen, \\"Puzzle-based auction mechanism for spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks\\", Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob), 2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on, October 2016.The word \\"cyclistationary\\" is an error from the source passage, and the correct one is cyclostationary. The practical implementation of spectrum-management functions is a complex and multifaceted issue, since it must address a variety of technical and legal requirements. An example of the former is choosing an appropriate sensing threshold to detect other users, while the latter is exemplified by the need to meet the rules and regulations set out for radio spectrum access in international (ITU radio regulations) and national (telecommunications law) legislation. =Intelligent antenna (IA)= An intelligent antenna (or smart antenna) is an antenna technology that uses spatial beam-formation and spatial coding to cancel interference; however, applications are emerging for extension to intelligent multiple or cooperative-antenna arrays for application to complex communication environments. Cognitive radio, by comparison, allows user terminals to sense whether a portion of the spectrum is being used in order to share spectrum with neighbor users. The following table compares the two: {class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" |- bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" ! Point !! Cognitive radio (CR) !! Intelligent antenna (IA) |- !

Kouassi, I. Ghauri, L. Deneire, \\"Reciprocity-based cognitive transmissions using a MU massive MIMO approach\\". IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), 2013 Cooperative MIMO (CO-MIMO) combines both techniques. Applications Cognitive Radio (CR) can sense its environment and, without the intervention of the user, can adapt to the user's communications needs while conforming to FCC rules in the United States. In theory, the amount of spectrum is infinite; practically, for propagation and other reasons it is finite because of the desirability of certain spectrum portions. Assigned spectrum is far from being fully utilized, and efficient spectrum use is a growing concern; CR offers a solution to this problem. A CR can intelligently detect whether any portion of the spectrum is in use, and can temporarily use it without interfering with the transmissions of other users.K. Kotobi, P. B. Mainwaring, C. S. Tucker, and S. G. Bil√©n., \\"Data- Throughput Enhancement Using Data Mining-Informed Cognitive Radio.\\" Electronics 4, no. 2 (2015): 221-238. According to Bruce Fette, \\"Some of the radio's other cognitive abilities include determining its location, sensing spectrum use by neighboring devices, changing frequency, adjusting output power or even altering transmission parameters and characteristics. All of these capabilities, and others yet to be realized, will provide wireless spectrum users with the ability to adapt to real-time spectrum conditions, offering regulators, licenses and the general public flexible, efficient and comprehensive use of the spectrum\\". Examples of applications include: * The application of CR networks to emergency and public safety communications by utilizing white space * The potential of CR networks for executing dynamic spectrum access (DSA) * Application of CR networks to military action such as chemical biological radiological and nuclear attack detection and investigation, command control, obtaining information of battle damage evaluations, battlefield surveillance, intelligence assistance, and targeting. *They are also proven to be helpful in establishing Medical Body Area Networks which can be utilized in omnipresent patient monitoring that aids in immediately notifying the doctors regarding vital information of patients such as sugar level, blood pressure, blood oxygen and electrocardiogram (ECG), etc. This gives the additional advantage of reducing the risk of infections and also increases the patient's mobility. * Cognitive radio is practical also to wireless sensor networks, where packet relaying can take place using primary and secondary queues to forward packets without delays and with minimum power consumption.

Simulation of CR networks At present, modeling & simulation is the only paradigm which allows the simulation of complex behavior in a given environment's cognitive radio networks. Network simulators like OPNET, NetSim, MATLAB and ns2 can be used to simulate a cognitive radio network.

Future plans The success of the unlicensed band in accommodating a range of wireless devices and services has led the FCC to consider opening further bands for unlicensed use. In contrast, the licensed bands are underutilized due to static frequency allocation. Realizing that CR technology has the potential to exploit the inefficiently utilized licensed bands without causing interference to incumbent users, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making which would allow unlicensed radios to operate in the TV-broadcast bands. The IEEE 802.22 working group, formed in November 2004, is tasked with defining the air- interface standard for wireless regional area networks (based on CR sensing) for the operation of unlicensed devices in the spectrum allocated to TV service.Carlos Cordeiro, Kiran Challapali, and Dagnachew Birru.

Active since 1995, he has recorded a total of seven studio albums, including several independent works, three for Republic Records and two for BNA. Fifteen of his singles have charted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, of which the highest-peaking is the No. 3 \\"Wave on Wave\\" from his gold-certified album of the same name. Music career Pat Green performing in June 2008 Green started his music career as an 18-year-old at Texas Tech playing small gigs at bars and clubs around Lubbock. In 1995, Green independently recorded and released a series of albums produced by Lloyd Maines using money borrowed from his parents. Green did not commit fully to his music career until 1997 when his stepfather fired him from his job as a fuel wholesaler. Green had been counting his money from a weekend of singing and his stepfather knew he would need motivation to fully pursue music as a career. After committing to music, Green drew the attention of Willie Nelson and joined a tour featuring Nelson and several other famous country musicians. Green's appearance at the 1998 Willie Nelson July 4 Picnic was his first step towards nationwide recognition, and he was soon playing sold out shows in Texas. Green was sponsored by Miller Lite and sold more than 250,000 albums, even without signing a major label recording contract. Green's first major- label recorded album, Three Days, repackaged his best pre-major songs and new tracks with modern sound engineering. The album was released to acclaim in 2001. The adventurous, Beatles-influenced \\"Wave on Wave\\", was released in 2003, with the title track reaching number 3 on the charts by the end of the year. The album featured pop flourishes and sound engineering that was incrementally more compressed than that of \\"Three Days\\" but dramatically more so than that of his independent releases. The Christian-tinged title track remains Green's top career hit. Green's mid-2000s period aimed to capitalize on his Wave on Wave commercial achievement. He achieved some critical and popular success but was unable to match his prior success and earned a \\"sellout\\" label.http://www.cmt.com/news/1540196/20-questions-with-pat-green/ In late 2004, \\"Lucky Ones\\" was Green's 3rd and final CD release on the Universal/Republic label. Despite weak label support, the album peaked at number 6 on the U.S. Country charts. Green joined popular country music artists including Keith Urban, Gretchen Wilson, Dave Matthews Band, and Kenny Chesney on major tours. Green released his album Cannonball in 2006. CMT questioned the album as reaching for the \\"uninspired pop sound of today‚Äôs Nashville,\\" with songs \\"starting to sound too much alike\\" and \\"crossing the line into Nashville pop\\" and perhaps not \\"honest and natural.\\" Green acknowledged that he needed hits to sustain the career that he wanted. In 2008, Green released \\"Let Me\\", as the first single from what would become his final label-released album, What I'm For. The single reached 12 on the country charts, giving Green his first Top 20 single since \\"Feels Just Like It Should\\" reached No. 13 in 2006. Initially, \\"Country Star\\" was released as the second single, but it was withdrawn shortly after the title track (\\"What I'm For\\") began receiving airplay. \\"Country Star\\" peaked at 32, and \\"What I'm For\\" peaked at 28 on the country charts in July 2009. Green parted ways with BNA shortly afterward. Washing out of the industry in 2011, Green announced his return to Texas and independent music. On September 2, 2014, Taste of Country premiered the official lyric video for a new song, \\"Girls from Texas\\", featuring Lyle Lovett. On September 16, 2014, \\"Girls from Texas\\" was made available on iTunes. On May 18, 2015, Green released a new single, \\"While I Was Away.\\" The video, a tribute to long-distance parents, premiered on People.com on May 22. \\"While I Was Away\\" was inducted into Taste of Country's Showdown Hall of Fame after winning five consecutive fan-voted rounds against artists including Blake Shelton, Dierks Bentley, Cassadee Pope, and David Nail. Green's self-released Home debuted on digital media on August 14, 2015, and entered on the Top Country Albums chart at No. 5. The album includes appearances from Lyle Lovett, Sheryl Crow, and more. The twelfth single from the album, \\"Day One\\" was released to Texas radio on May 2, 2016. Green self- released the single \\"Drinkin' Days\\" on May 26, 2017. On Green's 46th birthday, April 5, 2018, Dancehall Dreamin': A Tribute to Pat Green was released. The album features covers of ten Pat Green hits along with commentary about each song. On July 20, 2018, he released the single \\"Friday's Comin'\\" worldwide. Personal life Green was born in San Antonio to Craven Earl Green and Patricia Burgess. He was raised in Waco, Texas, where he attended Vanguard College Preparatory School for grades 7‚Äì12. Green's father was a former Air Force officer and stage actor who influenced his son's love of music. His parents divorced when he was seven. His mother later remarried. After high school, Green attended Texas Tech University where he was a member of FarmHouse fraternity. Green is an ardent fan of Major League Baseball's Texas Rangers. \\"I Like Texas,\\" a song from his 1995 self-released album, Dancehall Dreamer, has been adopted as the Rangers' victory song.

A police chase in southern Sweden in August 2020. A car chase is the vehicular hot pursuit of suspects by law enforcers. The rise of the automotive industry in the 20th century increased car ownership, leading to a growing number of criminals attempting to evade police in their own vehicle or a stolen car. Car chases are often captured on news broadcast due to the video footage recorded by police cars and police and media helicopters participating in the chase. Car chases are also a popular subject with media and audiences due to their intensity, drama and the innate danger of high-speed driving.  In reality  Car chases occur when a suspect attempts to use a vehicle to escape from law enforcement attempting to detain or arrest him or her. The assumed offence committed may range from misdemeanours such as traffic infractions to felonies as serious as murder. When suspects realize they have been spotted by law enforcement, they attempt to lose their pursuer by driving away, usually at high speed. Generally, suspects whom police spot committing crimes for which long prison terms are likely upon conviction are much more likely to start car chases. In 2002, 700 pursuits were reported in the city of Los Angeles. Los Angeles television station KCAL reported a quadrupling of ratings when police pursuits aired. Police officials have asked news media to reduce coverage of chases, claiming that they encourage suspects to flee and inciting gawkers to possibly get in the way of the pursuit, while the media responds that coverage of chases provides a public service and provide a deterrent to police brutality. Police use a number of techniques to end chases, from pleading with the driver, waiting for the driver's vehicle to run out of fuel, or hoping the driver's vehicle becomes somehow disabled to more forceful methods such as boxing in the vehicle with police cruisers, ramming the vehicle, the PIT maneuver, shooting out the tires, or the use of spike strips, though all efforts, many of which pose risk to all involved as well as bystanders, will be aimed at avoiding danger to civilians. When available, a helicopter may be employed, which in some cases, may follow the vehicle from above while ground units may or may not be involved. The StarChase system as of summer 2009 was in use by the Arizona Department of Public Safety. The February 2005 Macquarie Fields riots occurred in Sydney, Australia after a local driver crashed a stolen vehicle into a tree, killing his two passengers following a high-speed police pursuit. The death of university student Clea Rose following a police chase in Canberra sparked major recriminations over police pursuit policies. Ole Christian Bach was found shot and killed in Sweden in a presumed suicide after he had been followed in a car chase by Swedish undercover police. Reality television has combined with the car chase genre in a number of television shows and specials featuring real footage, mostly taken from police cruisers and law enforcement or media helicopters of suspects fleeing police. One notable, recorded police chase occurred when an M60 Patton tank was stolen by Shawn Nelson from an Army National Guard armory, on May 17, 1995. Nelson went on a rampage through San Diego, California, with the massive tank crushing multiple civilian vehicles before becoming stuck on a road divider. Police were able to get aboard the tank and open the hatch, killing the suspect when he would not surrender. On June 4, 2004, welder Marvin Heemeyer went on a rampage in a heavily modified bulldozer in Granby, Colorado, wrecking 13 buildings including the town hall, the public library, a bank, a concrete batch plant, and a house owned by the town's former mayor, resulting in over $7 million in damage. The police were initially powerless, as none of their weapons could penetrate the suspect's vehicle. However, the bulldozer's engine failed and the machine became stuck, so Heemeyer committed suicide by gunshot. On July 27, 2007, at exactly 12:46:20 p.m. MST in Phoenix, Arizona, two helicopters crashed in mid air. Both were AS-350 AStar helicopters from KNXV-TV (the area's ABC affiliate) and KTVK (an independent, but was the ABC affiliate until losing it to KNXV in 1995) news stations collided in mid-air above Steele Indian School Park in Phoenix, Arizona while covering a police pursuit.Accident Report 0902 Midair Collision of Electronic News Gathering Helicopters KTVK-TV, Eurocopter AS350B2, N613TV, and U.S. Helicopters, Inc., Eurocopter AS350B2, N215TV Aircraft National Transportation Safety Board. Accessed 2009-03-09. Archived 2009-05-18. Four people were killed: KTVK pilot Scott Bowerbank and photographer Jim Cox; and pilot Craig Smith and photographer Rick Krolak of KNXV. No one on the ground was injured. On September 28, 2012, Fox News aired a live police chase in Arizona which ended in the suspect exiting the vehicle and shooting himself after a short foot chase. Fox News was airing it in a five-second delay instead of a normal ten-second delay, which resulted in the shooting being aired on a live broadcast of the Fox Report. Fox anchorman Shepard Smith soon apologized for the broadcast and vowed to never let it happen again. =Risks and legal considerations= High-speed car chases are recognized as a road safety problem, as vehicles not involved in the pursuit or pedestrians or street furniture may be hit by the elusive driver, who will often violate a number of traffic laws, often repeatedly, in their attempt to escape, or by the pursuing police cars. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40 people a year are killed in road traffic incidents involving police, most as a result of a police pursuit. In the United States, chase-related deaths range between 300 and 400 people per year. Kristie's Law was a proposed California law that would restrict immunity for damage (including injuries or deaths) caused by high-speed pursuits, where law enforcement agencies have established, but not followed, written pursuit policies. In 2007, the United States Supreme Court held in Scott v. Harris (550 U.S. 372) that a \\"police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\\" In most common law jurisdictions, the fireman's rule prevents police officers injured in such pursuits from filing civil lawsuits for monetary damages against the fleeing suspects, because such injuries are supposed to be an inherent risk of the job. Public outrage at such immunity has resulted in statutory exceptions. One example is California Civil Code Section 1714.9 (enacted 1982), which reinstates liability where the suspect knew or should have known that the police were present. Policy on what circumstances justify a high-speed pursuit differ by jurisdiction. Some safety advocates want to restrict risky chases to violent felonies. Another option is to use technology to end or avoid the need for such chases. For example, vehicles can be tracked by aircraft or GPS tagging device like StarChase, allowing police agencies to reliably intercept suspects using stationary blockades, lower-speed vehicles, or when the vehicle is parked. =Inter-jurisdictional pursuits and policy issues= One particular hazard that is attendant to police pursuits is the problem of multiple law enforcement agencies becoming involved in a car chase that crosses municipal and jurisdictional boundaries. This is often complicated by radio communication incompatibility and policy differences in the various departments involved in a pursuit. The city of Dallas, Texas was the first major city in the United States to adopt an \\"Inter-Jurisdictional Pursuit Policy\\" to address the problems inherent in car chases that involved more than one law enforcement agency. In August 1984, the Dallas Police Department's Planning and Research Division, under the command of Captain Rick Stone, began crafting a policy that more than twenty (20) local law enforcement agencies could agree to abide by when car chases crossed their borders. The result was a model policy that became the standard for use by police departments around the United States.\\"Dallas-area police departments establish policy on pursuits\\", Dallas Morning News, September 8, 1985. In Europe, as many national borders no longer have border stations, car chases may sometimes cross national boundaries. States often have agreements in place where the police of one state can continue the chase across the national boundary.  In film and television  In film and television, the term \\"car chase\\" refers to a scene involving one or more automobiles pursuing one another; the chase may or may not involve a police car. Car chases are a staple of the action movie genre, and feature-length films have been built entirely around car chases, often featuring high-powered, exotic vehicles. They are popular because they are fast moving scenes that generate a great deal of excitement and action, due to the speed of the vehicles involved, and the potential collisions and the debris resulting from the wreckage, while not being hugely expensive to stage. Staging car chase sequences often requires numerous takes and destruction of several vehicles (whether intentional or mishap), giving an incentive for filmmakers to find ways to reduce costs. Hence it is common to use older vehicles that are 1‚Äì2 generations behind the current models on the market, since these can be second-hand acquisitions at low cost due to depreciation. There are some exceptions, if a high-profile vehicle (maybe but not necessarily a halo car) is used and/or if the vehicle manufacturer pays for product placement in a film production (serving as a technical adviser, donating vehicles to be used in filming); examples include the James Bond and Transporter franchises who use current and even concept vehicles. Although car chases on film were staged as early as the motor vehicle itself ‚Äî one of the earliest examples being \\"Runaway Match\\" directed by Alf Collins in 1903 ‚Äî the consensus among historians and film critics is that the first modern car chase movie was 1968's Bullitt.John Alfred Heitmann, The Automobile And American Life (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, 2009), 182‚Äì183.Jesse Crosse, The Greatest Movie Car Chases of All Time (St. Paul: MBI Publishing, 2006), 16.Todd Gitlin, Media Unlimited: How The Torrent of Images and Sounds Overwhelms Our Lives (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2002), 90.William Krause, Hollywood TV and Movie Cars (St. Paul: MBI Publishing, 2001), 39. The revolutionary 10-minute-long chase scene in Bullitt was far longer and far faster than what had gone before, and placed cameras so that the audience felt as though they were inside the cars. Even during the most calamitous scenes, the star ‚Äì Steve McQueen ‚Äì could be clearly seen at the wheel of the vehicle. Previously, car chase scenes were often staged using the rear projection effect. The French Connection further increased the realism. While previous chases had obviously been filmed on closed roads, isolated highways, or Sunday mornings (including Bullitt), The French Connection placed the chase in the midst of busy New York traffic and pedestrians. The producer of both Bullitt and The French Connection, Philip D'Antoni, went on to direct The Seven-Ups with yet another trademark chase sequence through New York featuring Roy Scheider from The French Connection as well as Bill Hickman, one of the drivers who had previously appeared in Bullitt. As time went on, so did the expectations of the movie car chase. Since Bullitt, car chases featured in movies have become more advanced and arguably more entertaining. Car crashes have also formed an increasingly important role, with the destruction of any vehicle often coming as a delight to the viewer. An early example of a staged but startling accident in a movie chase can be found in the 1974 movie McQ, which featured an incredible rollover, the first cannon rollover in fact, across a beach. The spectacle came at a cost, however, for stunt driver Hal Needham, who sustained multiple injuries after setting the explosives too high. Eventually this resulted in movies which are not much more than a series of linked car chases, such as the 1974 film Gone in 60 Seconds, which culminated in a 40-minute car chase scene with multiple crashes (some of them unplanned, real accidents) and a 30-foot-high, 128-feet-long airborne jump over crashed cars that block a road. Arguably the most typical car chase is one in which a car is being pursued by police cars. In part because car chases are so common many movie makers try to introduce a new twists to them. One of the most famous variations is from The French Connection and involves a car chasing an elevated train. Chases involving buses, trucks, snowmobiles, trains, tanks, and virtually every other type of vehicle (with or without wheels) have appeared at some point. Car chases can also be played for laughs. Films such as The Blues Brothers, The Keystone Kops, W.C. Fields comedies, The Three Stooges, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, The Shaggy Dog, No Deposit, No Return, Freaky Friday, The Gnome Mobile, The Million Dollar Duck, What's Up, Doc?, and many others have car chases that are used for comedy. Probably the most complex type of car chase involves going the wrong way at high speed against moderately congested freeway traffic, most notably in To Live and Die in L.A. and Ronin which, by no small coincidence, were directed by William Friedkin (The French Connection) and John Frankenheimer (French Connection II), respectively. Several films that feature complex large-scale chases involving a lot of vehicles in the pursuit include The Blues Brothers, The Transporter, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Road Warrior, and The Fast and the Furious series. Another method of escalating a car chase scene is to have a character move from one vehicle to another and to fight in or on top of a moving vehicle as the Wachowskis employed very effectively in The Matrix Reloaded. A number of television shows have been built around the popularity of car chases, such as CHiPs, The Dukes of Hazzard, Knight Rider, Airwolf, and most recently, Chase. In more modern times, the use of computer-generated imagery is becoming increasingly popular, and, although costly, eliminates any danger level. While impressive at times, it is often argued that it eliminates the realism of the chase scene, which can then in turn damage the established thrill factor. Recent examples of this computer-generated imagery can be found in the Michael Bay films Bad Boys II and The Island. Driven was particularly panned for its CGI car chase sequences. Such criticism has affected recent Hollywood productions; for example, films like Ronin, The Bourne Supremacy, The Kingdom, and The Dark Knight all had actual live-action chases with minimal use of CGI, if at all. In the action comedy film Hot Fuzz, the scene in which Sergeant Angel chases the speeding car has been declared the shortest car chase in film history. The brevity of the scene, as acknowledged in interviews, was itself the joke. In video games Many video games, often within the open world and racing genres, tend to contain, if not focus on, car chases of some sort, usually involving police. Many of these chases are often heavily stylized, with police often ramming or even shooting suspect vehicles. Notable examples of such games include: *Early examples included Bally Midway's Spy Hunter (1983), featuring a James Bond-style weaponized vehicle; and Atari Games' APB (1987), where the player controlled a police car. *Chase H.Q. (1988) and its sequels have the player assume the role of a police officer who, along with his partner, must stop fleeing criminals in high-speed pursuits. *The Need for Speed series is notable for its depiction of police pursuits, usually involving high-performance cars driven by both criminals and police. *Some games in the Burnout series contain modes which depict pursuits. However, police pursuits are generally not depicted in Burnout. *The Grand Theft Auto series is especially famous for its depiction of car chases in both missions and its open world, with reckless pursuits by both criminals and police being possible in almost every game in the series. *L.A. Noire (2011) features police pursuits in several of its cases and missions, though unlike Grand Theft Auto, players control the pursuing police in L.A. Noire. *The Driver series, with the exception of Parallel Lines, have featured a \\"Film Director\\" mode which allows players to create their own car chases by setting up cameras and the like in a post-production style movie suite. Police pursuits are also possible in most games in the Driver series. *The Sim City 4: Rush Hour (2003) expansion pack contains police pursuit missions in its U-Drive-It feature.

The action took place in the Barents Sea north of North Cape, Norway. The German raiders' failure to inflict significant losses on the convoy infuriated Hitler, who ordered that German naval strategy would henceforth concentrate on the U-boat fleet rather than surface ships. Background =JW 51B= Convoy JW 51B comprised fourteen merchant ships carrying war materials to the USSR ‚Äî some 202 tanks, 2,046 vehicles, 87 fighters, 33 bombers, of fuel, of aviation fuel and just over of other supplies. They were protected by the destroyers , , , , and ; the s and ; the minesweeper ; and trawlers and . The escort commander was Captain Robert Sherbrooke RN (flag in Onslow). The convoy sailed in the dead of winter to preclude attacks by German aircraft, like those that devastated Convoy PQ 17. Force R (Rear-Admiral Robert L. Burnett), with the cruisers and and two destroyers, were independently stationed in the Barents Sea to provide distant cover. =Operation Regenbogen= On 31 December, a German force, based at Altafjord in northern Norway, under the command of Vice-Admiral Oskar Kummetz, on Admiral Hipper set sail in (Operation Rainbow). After Convoy PQ 18, the force had waited to attack the next Arctic convoy but their temporary suspension by the British during Operation Torch in the Mediterranean and Operation FB, the routing of single ships to Russia, had provided no opportunity to begin the operation. The force comprised the heavy cruisers , L√ºtzow (the renamed Deutschland), and destroyers Friedrich Eckoldt, Richard Beitzen, Theodor Riedel, , and . Prelude JW 51B sailed from Loch Ewe on 22 December 1942 and met its escort off Iceland on 25 December. From there the ships sailed north-east, meeting heavy gales on 28‚Äì29 December that caused the ships of the convoy to lose station. When the weather moderated, five merchantmen and the escorts Oribi and Vizalma were missing and Bramble was detached to search for them. Three of the straggling merchantmen rejoined the following day; the other ships proceeded independently towards Kola Inlet. On 24 December the convoy was sighted by German reconnaissance aircraft and from 30 December was shadowed by (Kptlt. Karl-Heinz Herbschleb). When the report was received by the German Naval Staff, Kummetz was ordered to sail immediately to intercept the convoy. Kummetz split his force into two divisions, led by Admiral Hipper and L√ºtzow, respectively. Battle Battle of the Barents Sea At 08:00 on 31 December, the main body of JW 51B, twelve ships and eight warships, were some north of the coast of Finnmark heading east. Detached from the convoy were the destroyer Oribi and one ship, which took no part in the action; astern (north-east) of the convoy Bramble was searching for them. North of the convoy, at distance, was Vizalma and another ship, while Burnett's cruisers were southeast of them, and from the convoy. To the east, away, the home-bound convoy RA 51 was heading west. To the north of the convoy, Admiral Hipper and three destroyers were closing, while away L√ºtzow and her three destroyers were closing from the south. At 08:00 the destroyer Friedrich Eckholdt sighted the convoy and reported it to Admiral Hipper. At 08:20 on 31 December, Obdurate, stationed south of the convoy, spotted three German destroyers to the rear (west) of the convoy. Then, Onslow spotted Admiral Hipper, also to the rear of the convoy, and steered to intercept with Orwell, Obedient and Obdurate, while Achates was ordered to stay with the convoy and make smoke. After some firing, the British ships turned, apparently to make a torpedo attack. Heavily outgunned, Sherbrooke knew that his torpedoes were his most formidable weapons; the attack was feigned as once the torpedoes had been launched their threat would be gone. The ruse worked: Admiral Hipper temporarily retired, since Kummetz had been ordered not to risk his ships. Admiral Hipper returned to make a second attack, hitting Onslow causing heavy damage and many casualties including 17 killed. Although Onslow ultimately survived the action, Sherbrooke had been badly injured by a large steel splinter and command passed to Obedient. Admiral Hipper then pulled north of the convoy, stumbled across Bramble, a , and there was an exchange of fire; Admiral Hipper returning fire with her much heavier guns causing a large explosion on Bramble. The destroyer Friedrich Eckholdt was ordered to finish off Bramble, which sank with all hands, while Admiral Hipper shifted aim to Obedient and Achates to the south. Achates was badly damaged but continued to make smoke until eventually she sank; the trawler Northern Gem rescued many of the crew. The Germans reported sinking a destroyer but this was owing to the misidentification of the minesweeper Bramble; they had not realised Achates had been hit. The shellfire attracted the attention of Force R, which was still further north. Sheffield and Jamaica approached unseen and opened fire on Admiral Hipper at 11:35, hitting her with enough six-inch shells to damage (and cause minor flooding to) two of her boiler rooms, reducing her speed to . Kummetz initially thought that the attack of the two cruisers was coming from another destroyer but upon realising his mistake, he ordered his ships to retreat to the west. In another case of mistaken identity, Friedrich Eckholdt and Richard Beitzen mistook Sheffield for Admiral Hipper; after attempting to form up with the British ships, they were engaged by Sheffield with Friedrich Eckholdt breaking in two and sinking with all hands. L√ºtzow approached from the east and fired ineffectively at the convoy, still hidden by smoke from the crippled Achates. Heading north-west to join Admiral Hipper, L√ºtzow also encountered Sheffield and Jamaica, which opened fire. Coincidentally, both sides decided to break off the action at the same time, each side fearing imminent torpedo attacks upon their heavy ships from the other's remaining destroyers. This was shortly after noon. Burnett with Force R continued to shadow the German ships at a distance until it was evident that they were retiring to their base, while the ships of the convoy re-formed and continued towards Kola Inlet. Aftermath =Analysis= The encounter took place in the middle of the months-long polar night and both the German and British forces were scattered and unsure of the positions of the rest of their own forces, much less their opponent. The battle became a rather confused affair and sometimes it was not clear who was firing on whom or how many ships were engaged. Despite this German attack on convoy JW 51B, all 14 of its merchant ships reached their destinations in the USSR undamaged. Hitler was infuriated at what he regarded as the uselessness of the surface raiders, seeing that two heavy cruisers were driven off by mere destroyers. There were serious consequences: this failure nearly made Hitler enforce a decision to scrap the surface fleet and order the German Navy to concentrate on U-boat warfare. Admiral Erich Raeder, supreme commander of the Kriegsmarine, offered his resignation‚Äîwhich Hitler accepted. Raeder was replaced by Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, the commander of the U-boat fleet. D√∂nitz saved the German surface fleet from scrapping; though Admiral Hipper and two ( and ) of the light cruisers were laid up until late 1944, while repairs and rebuilding of the battleship were abandoned. Although German E-boats continued to operate off the coast of France, only one more big surface operation was executed after the battle. This was the attempted raid on Convoy JW 55B by the battleship . The battleship was sunk by an escorting British task force in what later became known as the Battle of the North Cape. Victoria Cross Captain Robert Sherbrooke was awarded the Victoria Cross. He acknowledged that it had really been awarded in honour of the whole crew of Onslow. In the action he had been badly wounded and he lost the sight in his left eye. He returned to active duty and retired from the navy in the 1950s with the rank of rear-admiral. Commemoration At the memorial for Bramble, Captain Harvey Crombie said of the crew The battle was the subject of the book 73 North by Dudley Pope and the poem JW51B: A Convoy by Alan Ross, who served on Onslow.

Founded in 1963 by Glynn Ross, who served as the company's first general director through 1983, Seattle Opera's season runs from August to late May, with five or six operas offered and with eight to ten performances each, often with double casts in major roles to allow for successive evening presentations. The second general director of Seattle Opera was Speight Jenkins, who retired in 2014. He was followed by Aidan Lang, who was General Director from 2014 to 2019. Christina Scheppelmann became Seattle Opera's fourth general director in August 2019. Since August 2003, the company has presented operas in the Marion Oliver McCaw Hall (capacity: 2,967), built on the site of the old Seattle Opera House at Seattle Center. The company does not have a full-time music director. In October 2007, Seattle Opera announced the appointment of Asher Fisch as the company's principal guest conductor. The Ross years From the outset, Ross saw opera as something that had to be sold using similar techniques to those used to sell popular entertainment. \\"To sell opera‚Ä¶you have to get their attention with a little razzle-dazzle. You've got to be simpatico. You have to be able to communicate, and you have to deliver your message with the best possible product you can manage.\\"Quoted in . In 1970, H. C. Schonberg of the New York Times contrasted Seattle Opera's approach to marketing to the then still staid marketing of New York's Metropolitan Opera: \\"Out there, you see campaign buttons with the legend Opera Lives. It is in Seattle where you can look at the sky and find an airplane skywriting the virtues of Seattle Opera. There are even auto bumper stickers about opera.\\" Further, Schonberg remarked favorably on the \\"air of freshness and experimentation that contrasts vividly with the dull, tried and true, tired professionalism in other opera houses one could mention.\\" Richard Wagner at Seattle Opera The company is noted for its performances of the works of Richard Wagner, including the Ring cycle. In 1975, it was the first American company to perform the cycle in its entirety over the space of a week since the Metropolitan Opera did it in 1939. =\\"Ring 1,\\" 1975 to 1984= Beginning with a production of Die Walk√ºre one year, and following successively each year with Siegfried and, finally, G√∂tterd√§mmerung, Ross announced in 1975 that Das Rheingold would precede the others to make up the first consecutive Ring Cycle over six days in July. In spite of the modernization of the opera productions which Ross found at the Bayreuth Festival, Seattle's were to be traditional productions and appeal to the lovers of the traditional. Two back-to-back cycles of the Ring, one each in German and English, were presented annually between 1975 and 1983. Andrew Porter's English adaptation which was prepared for the English National Opera and which was priced below the German language cycle, introduced many new listeners to Wagner. Originally directed by George London with designer John Naccarato, later presentations were directed by Lincoln Clark between 1976 and 1983, and by the tenor, Ragnar Ulfung in 1984. Henry Holt conducted all the cycles. The performances were well attended and received good press. By 1982, the cycle was drawing opera lovers from all over the United States, as well as many other countries of the world, and Seattle appeared to be a serious rival to Bayreuth. =\\"Ring 2,\\" 1985-1995= Speight Jenkins was appointed General Director in 1983, and immediately set about creating a new Ring production. Die Walk√ºre appeared first, in 1985, followed by complete cycles in 1986, 1987, 1991, and 1995. (Jenkins determined that the company could achieve higher quality performances by presenting the Ring every four years.) The new production was directed by Francois Rochaix, with sets and costumes designed by Robert Israel, lighting designed by Joan Sullivan, and supertitles (the first ever created for the Ring) by Sonya Friedman. The production set the action in a world of nineteenth-century theatricality. Initially controversial, it sold out in 1995. Conductors included Armin Jordan (Die Walk√ºre in 1985), Manuel Rosenthal (1986), and Hermann Michael (1987, 1991, and 1995). =\\"Ring 3,\\" 2000-2013= Jenkins engaged a new creative team to conceive Seattle Opera's third Ring production, which was unveiled in 2000 (Das Rheingold and Die Walk√ºre) and 2001 (full cycle) and returned in 2005, 2009, and 2013. Director Stephen Wadsworth, Set Designer Thomas Lynch, Costume Designer Martin Pakledinaz, Lighting Designer Peter Kaczorowski created a production which became known as the \\"Green\\" Ring, inspired in part by the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. Armin Jordan returned to conduct in 2000, Franz Vote in 2001, and Robert Spano in 2005 and 2009. The 2013 production, conducted by Asher Fisch, was released as a commercial recording on compact disc and on iTunes. The productions starred singers such as Greer Grimsley, Stephanie Blythe, Ewa Podles, Jane Eaglen, Richard Paul Fink, Margaret Jane Wray, and Stephen Milling. =Speight Jenkins and Wagner= Upon taking leadership of Seattle Opera in 1983 Speight Jenkins stated a goal of producing all ten of the major Wagner works in Seattle. Beginning with Tannh√§user in 1984 (the first Seattle Opera production with supertitles), Jenkins finally achieved his goal with the August 2003 production of Parsifal that opened McCaw Hall.

Colonel Jehiel Brooks married into the land when he married Ann Margaret Queen, daughter of Nicholas Queen, and they received a 150-acre estate. For most of the 19th century the area was farmland owned by the prominent Middleton and Queen families. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad later connected this portion of Washington County to downtown. Bellair, the 1840 brick Greek Revival mansion built by Colonel Jehiel Brooks, still stands. It is referred to as Brooks Mansion. It is the site of offices and production facilities for the Public Access Corporation of the District of Columbia, the city's Government-access television (GAVT) channel known as DCTV. Change came rapidly during and after the American Civil War. First, Fort Slemmer and Fort Bunker Hill were constructed as defenses against the Confederate Army, and later the Old soldiers' home was constructed to the northwest.

The university itself does not lie within Brookland's borders, but since the Catholic Church purchased the Middletown estate, adjacent to Brookland, in 1887, many Catholic groups have established themselves there and in the neighboring communities of Edgewood and Michigan Park. Ordered by year of establishment, major Catholic organizations that are physically located in Brookland include: * Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in America (1905) and St. Francis Hall (1931) * Holy Name College (1931‚Äì1984) * Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration Convent (1954‚Äì2017), Sisters of Life Convent (2017‚Äìpresent) * Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA (1986) From 1984 until 2015, the Franciscans‚Äô Holy Name College had served as the Howard University School of Divinity‚Äôs East Campus. As a divinity school, the institution did not solely focus on Christianity. Rather, it sought to educate students in scripture and theology generally, and to prepare them to be academics or to be ordained to serve as clergy. In 2016, the Urban Land Institute studied the site and engaged community stakeholders to determine potential development that might take place at the location. As of 2017, the site is scheduled to be redeveloped into a living-learning campus with current historic structures and open space preserved.  Community diversity  With its residents mostly of European descent at its founding, and with restrictive covenants against Jews and African-Americans in some developments , Brookland eventually integrated in the 20th century, especially after white flight took place following World War II and the US Supreme Court ruled in 1948 that restrictive covenants were unenforceable . Although there was some hostility directed at early black integration of the neighborhood, by the 1970's Brookland had developed into a neighborhood fairly integrated among economic classes and races. During the mid-twentieth century, Brookland could boast of such prominent residents as Ralph Bunche, Sterling Allen Brown, Edward Brooke, Ellis O. Knox, Rayford W. Logan, Pearl Bailey, John P. Davis, Marvin Gaye, Paul Tsongas, Lucy Diggs Slowe, Lois Mailou Jones, and Robert C. Weaver. It remains a relatively diverse and stable area of Washington. African American architect Romulus C. Archer designed homes, buildings, and churches in the area. Brookland was also home to the playwright Jean Kerr and her playwright/critic husband Walter Kerr, who taught at nearby CUA. The writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings spent her childhood in Brookland. Justine Ward, the music educator and author, lived in Brookland and built the large residence now occupied by the Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of Matara in the 1300 block of Quincy Street. CUA's School of Music is named in Ward's honor. Also on Quincy Street is the Quincy House, a long-time residence of Catholic graduate students who regularly host coffee houses and other community events. Businesses Brookland Hardware anchored 12th Street NE for many years until it closed in November 2015; for hardware, locals either go to Annie's Ace Hardware about five blocks to the west, in Edgewood on the other side of the Red Line, or to Home Depot just south of Rhode Island Avenue. However, many full-service restaurants still make the thoroughfare a bustling corridor. These include: Brookland's Finest, Menomale, San Antonio Grill, Masala Story , Primrose (aka Larry's Chicken and Cheeseburgers) and Murray and Paul's, which is only open for breakfast. New additions in 2016 included Pho12 and Salumeria Italiana, an Italian deli from the owners of Menomale. Additionally, there are also a few carry-out restaurants including Today's Pizza, Pizza Boli's, and Sammy Carry-Out. Other businesses found along 12th street include Yes! Organic Market, Good Food Market , Openbox9 Graphic Design Studio, along with realtors, auto-mechanics, a 7-11, nail and hair salons, florists, dry cleaners, and liquor stores. District Veterinary Hospital is located on 10th Street. Right Proper Brewery's Production House & Tasting Room is also located in the neighborhood. Tastemakers, a commercial kitchen for small, local food businesses and a food hall open to the public is also located in the Brookland neighborhood. In November 2011, D.C. based real estate developer Abdo broke ground on a large mixed-use development spread over a previously underutilized 8.9 acre plot. The project, known as Monroe Street Market, was fully completed in 2014. Despite the word \\"BROOKLAND\\" prominently painted on the main building, the entire complex lies within neighboring Edgewood.https://goo.gl/maps/HfNB5TmHQsv Edgewood Maphttp://www.popville.com/2016/07/edgewood-getting-into-the-branding-game/ Popville (07/08/16) This area includes 27 artists' studios on an \\"Arts Walk,\\" a Barnes & Noble (CUA's bookstore), a Potbelly Sandwich Works, a Chipotle Mexican Grill, a Starbucks, and local chain Busboys and Poets. While there are new projects slated for 2017/2018, at least part of the community believes the area is being overly developed, which has led to a few court battles with developers. A nearly-full-block parcel on Monroe Street between 9th and 10th Streets, formerly the site of Colonel Brooks' Tavern, remains vacant at this time because of conflicts between neighbors and developers over the height of the planned mixed-use complex.

He is best known for his unique style of animation, as the creator and director of √Üon Flux and Reign: The Conqueror (Alexander Senki). Early life and career Peter Chung was born on April 19, 1961. Since his father was in the foreign service of the Republic of Korea, he has lived in Seoul, London, Nairobi, Washington, D.C., New York and Tunis. His parents then immigrated to the United States; he lived in McLean, Virginia. Chung studied animation at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) from 1979 to 1981, one year at the Character Animation program, and another year in the program in Experimental Animation. Chung started his animation career at a small animation studio in Maryland at age 18, working for animator and illustrator Salvador Bru. From there at age 19 he was designing characters for Hanna-Barbera. About this time he also started working on the layout and animation on Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice before being hired by Disney for feature development.http://mubi.com/films/the-chronicles-of-riddick-dark-fury# =Directing credits= In addition to √Üon Flux (3 seasons: 1991, 1992, 1995), Chung's directing credits include the Matriculated segment from The Animatrix, and The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury. Chung served as lead character designer for the animated series, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987), C.O.P.S. (1988) Phantom 2040 (1994‚Äì1996) and Reign: The Conqueror (1999). The designs feature lean angular characters inspired by the art of Egon Schiele, a look which has become Chung's trademark character design. He also, along with Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo, co-designed the characters in the Nickelodeon series Rugrats, and co-directed its pilot, \\"Tommy Pickles and The Great White Thing\\" and the opening sequence. In addition, in 2007 he directed the opening three-part episode for GameTaps' Revisioned: Tomb Raider, entitled \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\". He has also directed some television advertisements ‚Äì available at Peter Chung at Acme Filmworks ‚Äì including a Diet Pepsi advertisement featuring Cindy Crawford and Malcolm McDowell. , among other unannounced projects, he was working on a full-length animated feature entitled Luvula. He is also director of the television adaption of Firebreather for Cartoon Network. Mr. Chung has also expressed interest in creating a new direct-to- video animated feature of √Üon Flux. =Animation style and influences= Chung names Japanese animation, German expressionism and European comics as his influence, in particular the illustrative quality of the art that depends on expressive drawings instead of many surface details. He names in his influences expressionist Egon Schiele and comic artist Moebius. As narrative influence he names Kazuo Umezu, Sanpei Shirato, Osamu Tezuka, Jack Kirby, Moebius, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Schuiten and Peeters, Silvio Cadelo, Tatsuya Egawa, Geof Darrow and Frank Miller. He also names as influences, in no special order: David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Alain Resnais, Jean Cocteau, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Seijun Suzuki, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Yoshinori Kanada, Horst Janssen, and Frank Lloyd Wright. Chung's animation, particularly √Üon Flux and Matriculated, tends toward the artistically and thematically experimental. In the animation field, he admires Yoshinori Kanada, Koji Morimoto, and Igor Kovalyov. Ralph Bakshi, one of the first to hire Chung, has stated that one of Chung's favorite artists is Toulouse- Lautrec.http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1517 Chung was one of the artists working on the Underground roleplaying game (1993) from Mayfair Games; Aeon Flux was also an influence on the game. In an April 2019 interview with Diego Molano, creator of Victor & Valentino, he said that he was fascinated with Chung's Aeon Flux and how he uses movement to tell a story even without dialogue. He even paused the show and put tracing paper over Chung's drawings, and then sold them at school, showing how Chung's style influenced him. Later, Chung would become the animation director on Victor & Valentino, which Molano was \\"greatly thankful for.\\" =Personal life= Chung has also been a participant in online forums, where users have asked him about his work and creative process. Two of the more prominent forums are ILX and Monican Spies. Chung currently teaches a Master Class at the Division of Animation and Digital Arts at the USC School of Cinematic Arts since Spring 2013.

His influential book A Plan of Civil and Historical Architecture (1721) was one of the first and most popular comparative studies of world architecture. His major works include Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, Karlskirche, and the Austrian National Library in Vienna, and Schloss Klessheim, Holy Trinity Church, and the Kollegienkirche in Salzburg. Early life Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach was born in Graz and baptized in the parish church of Heiligen Blut on 20 July 1656. His parents came from notable Graz families: his father was a provincial sculptor and artisan, his grandfather was a bookseller, and his mother was the daughter of a joiner and married to a sculptor prior to her second marriage. Raised in the tradition of Styrian craftsmanship in a city of significant architectural achievements, Johann received his early training as a sculptor in the workshop of his father, Johann Baptist Fischer, who contributed to the interior sculptural decorations of the Landhaus and Eggenberg Palace in Graz. During the seventeenth century, the Princes of Eggenberg had emerged as important patrons of the arts in Styria; through their patronage of Johann Baptist, they arranged for his talented son to travel to Italy and work in the flourishing artistic environment of the late Italian Baroque. In 1671, at the age of sixteen, Johann moved to Rome and joined the workshop of his fellow Austrian Johann Paul Schor and of the great Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who gave him ample opportunities to study both ancient and modern sculpture and architecture. By 1685, he had followed Schor to Naples, where he was reported to have amassed a considerable fortune serving the Spanish viceroy. Back in Austria in 1687, Fischer von Erlach was installed as a fashionable and sought-after architect. Commissions were plentiful, as royalty and highest echelons of aristocracy sought to repair damage inflicted on their country residences by the Ottoman Turks in the course of their 1683 campaign. Fischer's understanding of an urbane Baroque idiom appeared superior to that prevalent in Central Europe, and in 1687 he secured the key position of court architect, which he would retain in the service of three emperors. Service under Emperor Joseph I During the 1690s, which have been described as the most fruitful period of Fischer's career, he adapted the Italian Baroque to local needs and traditions. In 1690, he won great acclaim for two temporary triumphal arches constructed in Vienna to celebrate Joseph I's coronation. He later personally instructed Joseph in architectural arts, so successfully that in 1696 the monarch elevated Johann Fischer to the nobility, as Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. In his 17th-century designs and commissions, Fischer von Erlach embraced Berniniesque powerful curving lines, seeking to convey a sense of movement. His other inspirations included Mansart's country residences and the Palladian classical villas, which he would study during his journeys to Prussia, the Netherlands, England in 1704 and Venice in 1707. Thus Fischer presided over the genesis and early evolution of a distinctive brand of Baroque architecture, which would shape architectural tastes of the Austrian aristocracy for decades to come. His emblematic design from the 1690s was the Winter Palace of Prince Eugene of Savoy, commenced in 1695 in Vienna. As Hans Aurenhammer put it, this edifice represented \\"a new type of town palace characterized by impressive form, structural clarity, and the dynamic tension of its decoration\\". Salzburg and late works Fischer's expertise in town planning made itself felt in designs he executed for the Archbishop of Salzburg. Particularly accomplished are two churches, the Holy Trinity Church (Dreifaltigkeitskirche) (1694‚Äì1702) and the Kollegienkirche (Collegiate Church) (1696‚Äì1707), whose highly pitched domes and towers, convex facades, and dynamic forms irrevocably changed the outline of Salzburg. They say that masses of stone were designed by Fischer so as to give the appearance of billows of cloud and smoke. The archbishop's country seat, Schloss Klessheim (1700‚Äì09), was also designed by him. Fischer's visit to Dalmatia brought back to Western Europe the influence of the classical Diocletian's Palace and provided Europe with one of the first professional architectural glimpses of this notable Roman monument. After Joseph I's death in 1711, Fischer von Erlach was rarely entrusted with new commissions, as the more pleasing and less demanding designs of his rival Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt proved more popular with the young monarch Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and his court. He found an opportunity to draw some of the finest architectural reconstructions of the buildings of Antiquity, which were published in his groundbreaking Plan of Civil and Historical Architecture in 1721. He was also made responsible for various administrative tasks, which would take a large portion of his energy and time. Clam-Gallas Palace in Prague, commenced in 1713, was one of his last designs for a stately town residence. The structure, much imitated by later architects, highlights Fischer's enthusiasm for Palladian facades, which became ever more pronounced during the last period of his work. But it is Karlskirche in Vienna, started in 1715, that most fully illustrates his late synthetic style. In this structure, completed by his son Joseph Emanuel, Fischer's ambition was to harmonize the principal elements and ideas that underlie the most significant churches in the history of Western architecture: the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the Pantheon and Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome, the Dome des Invalides in Paris and Saint Paul's Cathedral in London.

In recent years, Oxford Street has garnered a reputation as Sydney's primary nightclub strip, and has subsequently seen a large increase in the number of crimes committed in the area. The western section, which runs through the suburb of Darlinghurst, is widely recognised as Sydney's main gay district and Oxford Street is closed to traffic once a year in early March for the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Specifically, the area of Oxford Street between Hyde Park and Paddington Town Hall became known from the early 1980s as 'The Golden Mile' because of the growing density of popular venues for the gay community. The section to the east of Taylor Square, running through the suburb of Paddington forms an upmarket shopping strip and represents the home of the new medical faculty of the University of Notre Dame Australia as well as the University of New South Wales' College of Fine Arts, Victoria Barracks, Paddington Bazaar and St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney amongst other locations. History In May 1909 the Sydney Council resolved to widen Oxford Street from to by resuming the entire north side of the street between Liverpool and Bourke Streets. The project was carried out in five stages between 1910 and 1914. The result was a new boulevard and the creation of a Federation streetscape which remains today largely intact. Trams to Bondi and Bronte beaches travelled down Oxford Street until the line was closed in 1960, replaced by the current bus service. =Paddington Reservoir= Paddington Reservoir Located on the corner of Oatley Road and Oxford Street is the Paddington Reservoir, a water reservoir which provided water to the Botany Swamps pumping station for the provision of water to parts of Sydney between 1866 and 1899. In 2006 work began to restore and reuse the space of the then derelict Paddington Reservoir. The facility reopened in 2008 as a sunken garden known as the Paddington Reservoir Gardens or Walter Read Reserve, with a rooftop reserve located above the preserved eastern chamber. The facility integrates the remains of the original brick, timber and iron structure with modern elements of sculptural, structural and functional significance which provide access to the sunken garden via stairs and an elevator as well as ramped access to the rooftop reserve. =Victoria Barracks= Victoria Barracks, located in Oxford Street, houses the Headquarters Forces Command (Australia), as well as the Army Museum of NSW which is housed in the original District Military Prison, constructed in 1800. The barracks was constructed of Hawkesbury sandstone by way of convict labour between 1841 and 1846. Paddington Hall The Barracks were originally occupied by regiments of the British Army who vacated the site in 1870. The Barracks was the premier military training site in Australia until 1901. For a brief period during the 1930s Victoria Barracks was home to the Royal Military College, Duntroon when the College was forced to close its buildings in Canberra and relocate to Sydney due to the economic downturn caused by the Great Depression.Odgers 1988, p. 108.

The systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than and exist for no more than a couple of days. They are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and gas and oil platforms. Polar lows have been referred to by many other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, Arctic hurricane, Arctic low, and cold air depression. Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near- surface winds of at least 17 m/s (38 mph).. History Polar lows were first identified on the meteorological satellite imagery that became available in the 1960s, which revealed many small-scale cloud vortices at high latitudes. The most active polar lows are found over certain ice-free maritime areas in or near the Arctic during the winter, such as the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Labrador Sea and Gulf of Alaska; however, polar lows also have been found in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. Polar lows dissipate rapidly when they make landfall. Antarctic systems tend to be weaker than their northern counterparts since the air-sea temperature differences around the continent are generally smaller. Still, vigorous polar lows can be found over the Southern Ocean. Structure Evolution of the eye-like feature on a polar low Polar lows can have a wide range of cloud signatures in satellite imagery, but two broad categories of cloud forms have been identified. The first is the \\"spiraliform\\" signature consisting of a number of cloud bands wrapped around the centre of the low. Some polar lows have the appearance in satellite imagery of tropical cyclones, with deep thunderstorm clouds surrounding a cloud-free ‚Äòeye‚Äô, which has given rise to the use of the term \\"Arctic hurricane\\" to describe some of the more active lows. These systems are more common deep within the polar air. The second is a \\"comma-shaped\\" signature that is found more frequently with systems closer to the polar front. Formation Polar lows form for a number of different reasons, and a spectrum of systems is observed on satellite imagery. A number of lows develop on horizontal temperature gradients through baroclinic instability, and these can have the appearance of small frontal depressions. At the other extreme are the polar lows with extensive cumulonimbus clouds, which are often associated with cold pools in the mid- to upper-troposphere. During winter, when cold- core lows with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach move over open waters, deep convection forms which allows polar low development to become possible. Frequency and impact A polar low over the Barents Sea in February 1987 Although cyclonic activity is most prevalent in the Eurasian Arctic with approximately 15 lows per winter, polar lows also occur in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic. Polar lows can occur at any time during the year, with summer lows tending to be weaker than winter lows.Halld√≥r Bj√∂rnsson. Global circulation. Ve√∞urstofa √çslands. Retrieved on 2008-06-15. They are not well studied and seldom destructive as they typically take place in sparsely populated areas. The only infrastructure damage that occurs as a direct result of a polar low is to oil and gas rigs present throughout the Antarctic ocean (sometimes known as the Southern ocean). Some cargo and shipping vessels are also affected, although there are minimal or no reports of losses in recent years as the result of a polar low. Despite the more equatorward location, numerous polar lows can form over the Sea of Japan every year, thanks to the Japan-Sea Polar-Airmass Convergence Zone (JPCZ) contributed by the cold-core low aloft and the warm Tsushima Current. They would bring severe impacts to Japan owing to the proximity to populous regions, with strong winds and heavy snowfall. On December 28, 1986, seven passenger cars of a railway train were blown from the Amarube Viaduct due to a polar low, causing six deaths. Forecasting Polar lows are very difficult to forecast and a nowcasting approach is often used, with the systems being advected with the mid-tropospheric flow. Numerical weather prediction models are only just getting the horizontal and vertical resolution to represent these systems.

Beginning as a travelogue in the vein of the author's two previous efforts, the adventure story gives way to a romance story, which in its turn gives way to a philosophical quest. Overview Mardi is Melville's first pure fiction work (while featuring fictional narrators; his previous novels were heavily autobiographical). It details (much like Typee and Omoo) the travelings of an American sailor who abandons his whaling vessel to explore the South Pacific. Unlike the first two, however, Mardi is highly philosophical and said to be the first work to show Melville's true potential. The tale begins as a simple narrative, but quickly focuses upon discourse between the main characters and their interactions with the different symbolic countries they encounter. While not as cohesive or lengthy as Moby-Dick, it shares a similar writing style as well as many of the same themes. As a preface to Mardi, Melville wrote somewhat ironically that his first two books were nonfiction but disbelieved; by the same pattern he hoped the fiction book would be accepted as fact.  Style  = Influence of Rabelais and Swift = The voyage from island to island echoes Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel, especially the last two books. According to scholar Newton Arvin, \\"The praise of eating and drinking is highly Rabelaisian in intention, and so in general is all the satire on bigotry, dogmatism, and pedantry. Taji and his friends wandering about on the island of Maramma, which stands for ecclesiastical tyranny and dogmatism, are bound to recall Pantagruel and his companions wandering among the superstitious inhabitants of Papimany; and the pedantic, pseudo-philosophi of Melville's Doxodox is surely, for a reader of Rabelais, an echo of the style of Master Janotus de Bragmardo holding forth polysyllabically to Gargantua in Book I.\\"Arvin (1950), chapter \\"The Enviable Isles\\", online, [no page numbers] Arvin also recognizes the influence of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, \\"there is something very Swiftian in Melville's Hooloomooloo, the Isle of Cripples, the inhabitants of which are all twisted and deformed, and whose shapeless king is horrified at the straight, strong figures of his visitors from over sea.\\"Arvin (1950), online  Structure  The emotional center of the book, Arvin writes, is the relation between Taji and Yillah, the \\"I\\" and the mysterious blonde who disappears as suddenly as she appeared. Taji begins a quest for her throughout the islands without finding her. Though Arvin finds the allegory of Yillah \\"too tenuous and too pretty to be anything but an artistic miscarriage\\" in the poetic sense, he also finds it \\"extremely revealing\\" in connection with the whole Melville canon. Yillah, associated with the lily in the language of flowers, is \\"an embodiment of the pure, innocent, essentially sexless happiness\\", and Hautia, \\"symbolized by the dahlia\\", embodies \\"the sensual, the carnal, the engrossingly sexual\\". The middle portion of the book is taken up by \\"a series of forays in social and political satire, and by quasi-metaphysical speculations\\" that are, if at all, at best \\"only loosely and uncertainly related to the quest for Yillah\\". The only way to perceive any fabric holding the book together, Arvin feels, is by recognizing \\"a certain congruity among the various more or less frustrated quests it dramatizes--the quest for an emotional security once possessed, the quest for a just and happy sociality once too easily assumed possible, and the quest for an absolute and transcendent Truth once imagined to exist and still longed for.\\"Arvin (1950), online [chapter \\"The Enviable Isles\\"]  Themes  For Arvin, in Mardi Melville rejects not \\"the profounder moralities of democracy\\" so much as \\"a cluster of delusions and inessentials\\" that Americans have come to regard as somehow connected to the idea of democracy. Arvin recognizes three delusions to the cluster: * \\"that political and social freedom is an ultimate good, however empty of content; * that equality should be a literal fact as well as a spiritual ideal; * that physical and moral evil are rapidly receding before the footsteps of Progress.\\" The philosophical plot, Arvin believes, is furnished by the interaction between the intense longing for certainty, and the suspicion that on the great fundamental questions, \\"final, last thoughts you mortals have none; nor can have.\\"Quoted in Arvin (1950), online And even while one of the characters says, \\"Faith is to the thoughtless, doubts to the thinker\\", Arvin feels that Melville struggles to avoid a brutality of what Melville himself calls \\"indiscriminate skepticism\\", and he got closest to expressing \\"his basic thought\\" in Babbalanja's speech in the dark: \\"Be it enough for us to know that Oro\\"‚ÄîGod--\\"indubitably is. My lord! my lord! sick with the spectacle of the madness of men, and broken with spontaneous doubts, I sometimes see but two things in all Mardi to believe:--that I myself exist, and that I can most happily, or least miserably exist, by the practice of righteousness.\\" Reception =Contemporary reviews = Mardi was a critical failure. One reviewer said the book contained \\"ideas in so thick a haze that we are unable to perceive distinctly which is which\\".Miller, Perry. The Raven and the Whale: The War of Words and Wits in the Era of Poe and Melville. New York: Harvest Book, 1956: 246. Nevertheless, Nathaniel Parker Willis found the work \\"exquisite\\". Nathaniel Hawthorne found Mardi a rich book \\"with depths here and there that compel a man to swim for his life... so good that one scarcely pardons the writer for not having brooded long over it, so as to make it a great deal better.\\" The widespread disappointment of the critics hurt Melville yet he chose to view the book's reception philosophically, as the requisite growing pains of any author with high literary ambitions. \\"These attacks are matters of course, and are essential to the building up of any permanent reputation‚Äîif such would ever prove to be mine... But Time, which is the solver of all riddles, will solve Mardi.\\" = Later critical history = In the description of Arvin, \\"the thoughts and feelings he was attempting to express in Mardi were too disparate among themselves and often too incongruous with his South Sea imagery to be capable of fusion into a satisfying artistic whole. In the rush and press of creative excitement that swept upon him in these months, Melville was trying to compose three or four books simultaneously: he failed, in the strict sense, to compose even one. Mardi has several centers, and the result is not a balanced design. There is an emotional center, an intellectual center, a social and political center, and though they are by no means utterly unrelated to each other, they do not occupy the same point in space.\\" References  Sources  * Arvin, Newton (1950).

He formerly served in the Hawaii State House of Representatives from 1984 to 1992 and 1998 to 2000. An immigrant from the Philippines, Cachola became one of the first Filipino Americans to be elected to the Honolulu City Council since statehood in 1959. Education Born in the historic Spanish colonial town of Vigan in the Philippines province of Ilocos Sur, Cachola studied at Quezon University near Manila where he obtained his Bachelor of Laws and Master of Laws degrees. After having settled in Honolulu and obtained United States citizenship, Cachola became an entrepreneur and realtor. Politics With the urging of fellow Filipino Americans in his neighborhood, Cachola ran for the House District 39 seat comprising Aliamanu, Foster Village, and all the military housing districts on the southern coast of Oahu. He served the district until reapportionment in 1991 placed him in House District 30. He successfully ran for the seat and continued his service as a legislator until his election to the Honolulu City Council in 2000, when he replaced outgoing then-Councilmember Donna Mercado Kim in a special election. In the Honolulu City Council, Cachola served as chairman of key positions with budget authority. As Chairman of the Zoning Committee, he was considered one of the most powerful politicians in the City & County of Honolulu following the mayor, managing director and council budget chairman. In 2003, Cachola was elected by his fellow council members as floor leader. Cachola was reelected to the Honolulu City Council on September 18, 2004. In 2005, the City Council approved a tax increase to fund mass transit, the largest and most expensive public works project in state history. In 2007, shortly after the tax went into effect, Cachola was the swing vote in a controversial decision to decide the train's route. Cachola insisted that the route go through Salt Lake as a condition of his support.Council Rejects Mayor‚Äôs Transit Proposal; Salt Lake Added Though the Council voted 5-4 to approve a route with Cachola's changes, some Salt Lake residents voiced opposition to the noise and property devaluation that they feared rail transit would bring to their community.Salt Lake Rail Opponents Speak Out After the following city elections and over loud objections by Cachola and some Salt Lake residents, the new City Council reconsidered the decision and decided to re-route the rail line to pass by Pearl Harbor and the airport, without a Salt Lake alignment. Cachola was fined $2,500 in July 2014 by the Hawaii Campaign Spending Commission for state campaign spending violations and had to reimburse his campaign $32,000 for using campaign money to buy a new truck and allegedly use it for personal reasons. He admits no wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement agreement. In September 2014, the Honolulu Ethics Commission fined Cachola $50,000 \\"based on a number of aggravating factors in the case, [...] including that the misconduct occurred over several years on a monthly basis, that Cachola knew the ethics laws and their penalties but 'blatantly disregarded' them, and that he failed to cooperate with the commission during its investigation.\\" Honolulu Ethics Commission executive director Chuck Totto said in a news release that \\"[t]his case is a perfect storm of public corruption,\\" and that the $50,000 was the largest civil fine ever approved by the commission.

Accessed July 2011. The food is traditionally cooked by steaming the ingredients over layers of seaweed. The shellfish can be supplemented with vegetables, such as onions, carrots, and corn on the cob. Clambakes are usually held on festive occasions along the coast of New England.  Method  Illustration of a pit being dug in the beach sand in preparation for a traditional clambake, 1907 A typical clambake begins with gathering seaweed (traditionally rockweed ‚Äì Ascophyllum nodosum) at the shoreline; seaweed is an important adjunct to cooking the food. To keep the seaweed fresh, it is necessary to have a container large enough to hold both the seaweed and a fair amount of sea water. Clambake from Philadelphia Also important are several round medium-sized stones, or sometimes cannonballs, which are heated in the fire and used to re-radiate heat during the cooking process. Lastly, like most other methods of steaming, a cover is necessary to allow the trapped heat and steam to thoroughly cook the food. Canvas tarps or potato sacks soaked in sea water are often used for this purpose. Once the stones and seaweed have been collected, a fire pit is prepared. Some prefer to simply start a fire within the pit, while others line the edges with flat stones to provide support for a metal grill on which the stones may be placed. The stones used for cooking are then placed in the center of the pit and a wood fire is started, although the exact method of heating the stones varies. The fire must burn until the stones are glowing hot. Care must be taken to ensure that the fire will burn out shortly after this optimal cooking temperature is achieved. The ashes are then swept off the stones and raked between them to form an insulating \\"bed.\\" A layer of wet seaweed is placed over the stones, followed by traditional regional foods such as steamers, mussels, quahogs, and lobsters. Side dishes usually include corn on the cob, potatoes, carrots, and onions. Alternating layers of seaweed and food are piled on top and the entire mound is covered with canvas that has been drenched in water to seal in the heat and prevent the canvas from burning. The food is allowed to steam for several hours. Since many locales outlaw building fires on beaches, and in order to accommodate the dish in homes or backyards, this dish is often prepared in a large pot. This is known as a New England clam boil. Some caterers specialize in clambakes on the beach. Clambakes are also popular in Greater Cleveland, despite that region's not being near the Atlantic Ocean. A typical clambake there includes a dozen clams with half a chicken, sweet potatoes, corn, and other side dishes. Seaweed is not used and the clams, chicken, and sweet potatoes are all steamed together in a large pot. John D. Rockefeller started the tradition in Ohio.

Such laws often authorize the state to seize money earned from deals such as book/movie biographies and paid interviews and use it to compensate the criminal's victims. These laws have been criticized as violating the free-speech guarantee of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The original and namesake law, from the State of New York, was itself ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, though New York and other states have since passed laws with similar goals that attempt to comply with the Court's decision. History and legal status The term \\"Son of Sam\\" is derived from the first law of this type, targeted at serial killer David Berkowitz, who used the name \\"Son of Sam\\" during his notorious murder spree in the mid-1970s New York. After his arrest in August 1977, Berkowitz's intense presence in the media led to widespread speculation that he might sell his story to a writer or filmmaker. Although Berkowitz denied wanting any kind of deal, the New York State Legislature swiftly passed preemptive legal statutes anyway, the first legal restriction of its kind in the U.S. The original New York law was invoked in New York eleven times between 1977 and 1990, including once against Mark David Chapman, the murderer of musician John Lennon. Critics argued that the law infringed on freedom of speech and therefore violated the First Amendment, and that \\"Son of Sam\\" laws take away the financial incentive for many criminals to tell their stories, some of which (such as the Watergate scandal) were of vital interest to the general public. In 1987, lawyers for publishing company Simon & Schuster sued the New York authorities to prevent enforcement of the Son of Sam law with respect to a book they were about to publish called Wiseguy, written by Nicholas Pileggi. The book was about ex-mobster Henry Hill and was used as the basis for the film Goodfellas. The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1991. In an 8‚Äì0 ruling on Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board, the court ruled the law unconstitutional.. The majority opinion was that the law was overinclusive, and would have prevented the publication of such works as The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Thoreau's Civil Disobedience, and even The Confessions of Saint Augustine. Similarly, the state of California's Son of Sam law was struck down in 2002 after being used against Barry Keenan, one of the men who kidnapped Frank Sinatra, Jr. in 1963. After numerous revisions, New York adopted a new \\"Son of Sam\\" law in 2001.N.Y. Executive Law ¬ß 632-a (McKinney 2005). This law requires that victims of crimes be notified whenever a person convicted of a crime receives $10,000 (US) or more‚Äîfrom virtually any source.N.Y. Corrections Law ¬ß 500-c (McKinney 2006). The law then attaches a springing statute of limitations, giving victims an extended period of time to sue the perpetrator of the crime in civil court for their crimes.See N.Y. C.P.L.R. This law also authorizes a state agency, the Crime Victims' Board, to act on the victims' behalf in some limited circumstances.N.Y. Executive Law ¬ß 632-a(2) (McKinney 2005). Thus far, the current New York law has survived court scrutiny. In certain cases, a Son of Sam law can be extended beyond the criminals themselves to include friends, neighbors, and family members of the lawbreaker who seek to profit by telling publishers and filmmakers of their relation to the criminal. In other cases, a person may not financially benefit from the sale of a story or any other mementos pertaining to the crime. Related concepts Regardless of whether a state has a formal Son of Sam law, victims and their families may use civil lawsuits for monetary damages that effectively preclude a wrongdoer (or accused wrongdoer) from profiting from his crime. A prominent example is the litigation between the family of Ron Goldman and O. J. Simpson following Simpson's acquittal for Goldman's murder. Goldman's family won a wrongful death claim against Simpson for more than $30 million. When Simpson later published a book about the murder, If I Did It, a court awarded the book's rights to the Goldman family to help satisfy the judgment. In high-profile criminal cases and cases that are closely tied to national security, such as convictions for terrorism and espionage, a \\"Son of Sam clause\\" has been included in plea bargains. Examples include John Walker Lindh (an American who aided the Taliban in Afghanistan) and Harold James Nicholson (a Central Intelligence Agency officer who spied for Russia). As a result of their plea bargains, any and all profits made from book deals or movie rights would be handed over to the U.S. Treasury. Neither the convicts nor their families would be able to profit. With the advent of the Internet and online sales, many Son of Sam laws are now targeting the sale of so-called \\"murderabilia\\". Few courts have yet issued opinions regarding the constitutionality of many of these new laws. Son of Sam laws are distinct from asset forfeiture, the seizing of assets acquired directly as a result of criminal activity. Where asset forfeiture looks to remove the profitability of crimes by taking away money and assets gained as proceeds from the crime, Son of Sam laws are designed so that criminals are unable to take advantage of the notoriety of their crimes.

Iwa was the twenty-third tropical storm and the twelfth and final hurricane of the 1982 Pacific hurricane season. It developed from an active trough of low pressure near the equator on November 19. The storm moved erratically northward until becoming a hurricane on November 23 when it began accelerating to the northeast in response to strong upper-level flow from the north. Iwa passed within 25 miles of the island of Kauai with peak winds of 90 mph (145 km/h) on November 23 (November 24 Coordinated Universal Time), and the next day it became extratropical to the northeast of the state. The hurricane devastated the islands of Niihau, Kauai, and Oahu with wind gusts exceeding 100 mph (160 km/h) and rough seas exceeding 30 feet (9 m) in height. The first significant hurricane to hit the Hawaiian Islands since statehood in 1959, Iwa severely damaged or destroyed 2,345 buildings, including 1,927 houses, leaving 500 people homeless. Damage throughout the state totaled $312 million (1982 USD, $ USD). One person was killed from the high seas, and three deaths were indirectly related to the hurricane's aftermath. Meteorological history A very active trough of low pressure persisted along the equator in the middle of November, with westerly surface winds and windspread convection located along the trough from 140¬∞ W to 140¬∞ E. An organized circulation developed near Palmyra Atoll on November 18, and steadily developed as it drifted westward. Though very late in the season, warm temperatures to the south of the Hawaiian Islands due to the strongest El Nino in many years allowed the disturbance to develop into Tropical Storm Iwa on November 19 while located about 970 miles (1,760 km) southwest of the southernmost point in Hawaii. The storm tracked slowly northward after forming and initially remained a weak tropical storm. After turning to the northeast, Iwa began slowly intensifying, and on November 23 after turning to the north- northwest Iwa strengthened into a hurricane while located 580 miles (930 km) southwest of the southern tip of Hawaii. Shortly after becoming a hurricane, Iwa turned and accelerated to the northeast in response to strong upper level flow to its north. The hurricane possessed sufficient moisture, instability, and upper divergence for continued intensification, and Iwa reached peak winds of 90 mph (145 km/h) late on November 23 while located 245 miles (395 km) southwest of Waimea on the island of Kauai. Its forward speed increased to 30 to 40 mph, and Iwa passed just north of the island of Kauai on November 23 (November 24 in UTC). The right semicircle of the storm extended across Kauai and Oahu, with gusts from 100 to 120 mph (161 to 193 km/h). After passing Hawaii, the convection of Iwa rapidly deteriorated as it gradually lost tropical characteristics. Late on November 24, the hurricane degenerated into a tropical storm, and on November 25 Iwa became an extratropical cyclone while located about 600 miles (965 km) northeast of Hawaii. Impact Hurricane Iwa produced estimated gusts reaching 120 mph (193 km/h) across Kauai and Oahu. The acceleration of the hurricane concentrated the energy of its swells, resulting in high waves and storm surge across the Hawaiian Islands, though primarily near the path of the center. It is estimated the storm surge reached eight feet (two meters) on the south coast of Kauai. There, the surge reached 900 feet (275 m) inland, exceeding a 100-year flood event for the area. The heaviest rainfall reported from the island chain was from the Intake Wainiha 1086 site, where 20.33 inches (516 mm) was measured. Possible tornadoes were reported in association with a rain squall in Oahu. Waves on the coast of Oahu reached 16.4 feet in height (3 m), and waves on southern Kauai surpassed 30 feet (9 m) in height. Hurricane Iwa passing just north of Kauai on November 24 During the worst of the storm, 5,800 people were evacuated from shoreline areas of Kauai to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kauai, with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk. The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas where there was no protective barrier reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes. The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kauai's oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank. Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kauai without power. Highway 56 on the east side of the island was obstructed by fallen telephone poles, forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads usually reserved for hauling sugar cane from the fields. Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan trees on the island. The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 homes on the island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island's homes unlivable. Rough seas killed a person on a Navy Destroyer the USS Goldsborough DDG-20 in Pearl Harbor when the seaman hit a stanchion, with four others injured on the ship. One of the four injured was swept overboard two miles (three kilometers) from the harbor. Before the arrival of the hurricane, around 1,000 evacuated the low-lying coastline to shelters. Rough waves destroyed four and damaged two deep-water communication cables between Oahu and Kauai. In Oahu, damage from wind and surf was heaviest on the southwest coast between NƒÅnƒÅkuli and MƒÅkaha. The storm surge washed sand into streets in Waikƒ´kƒ´ and flooded cars in areas of basement parking. Wind damage was greatest in areas where winds blew from southerly directions off of mountains. The winds damaged several small aircraft and a Douglas DC-3 plane in Honolulu. Gusty winds shattered glass windows in the Honolulu International Airport, injuring several passengers. Some flights in and out of the Honolulu airport were delayed, while other domestic airports were temporarily closed. The passage of the hurricane damaged at least 6,391 homes, 21 hotels, and two condominium buildings on the island. Additionally, 418 buildings, including 30 businesses, were destroyed on Oahu. Surf damage was reported throughout the Hawaiian islands. 120 people were treated for injuries, though most were minor. An estimated 500 people throughout Hawaii were left homeless due to the hurricane. Damage on the private island of Niihau was severe. An aerial survey indicated 20 homes were destroyed and 160 were damaged, indicating that the hurricane affected nearly all of the island's 226 residents. Reportedly no one was injured on Niihau. At the time, Hurricane Iwa was the costliest storm to hit the state of Hawaii, with damage totaling $312 million (1982 USD, $ USD). Aftermath Three days after Hurricane Iwa passed the state, Governor George Ariyoshi declared the islands of Kauai and Niihau as disaster areas and began filing papers for a federal disaster declaration. On November 28, five days after the hurricane struck, President Ronald Reagan declared the islands of Kauai, Niihau, and Oahu as a disaster area. The declaration allocated federal funds to aid the affected citizens. The state Department of Education decided to close all schools on Kauai indefinitely. The thousands of residents without power celebrated Thanksgiving by cooking turkeys on outdoor grills or smokers. Army and Air Force planes delivered 20,000 Thanksgiving rations to the thousands left in temporary shelters. The United States military also airlifted generators to Kauai due to several days of power outages. By three weeks after the hurricane, utility crews restored power to nearly all major areas in Oahu, while 5,000 remained without power in Kauai. By around a month after the hurricane passed the island, utilities were restored to most of the entire island. All roads and highways were cleared, as well. One 25th Infantry Division soldier at Schofield Barracks died while cleaning up after the hurricane. Two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights. Following the storm, significant redevelopment occurred in Poipu, where the hurricane flooded areas several hundred feet inland. Hurricane Iniki struck the same area ten years later. Officials estimate a hurricane similar to Iwa striking Oahu in 1992 could cause up to $7.5 billion in damage (USD). =Retirement= The Central Pacific Hurricane Center retired the name Iwa subsequent to the storm and replaced it with Io. However, in 2007, the CPHC revised the four rotating lists of tropical cyclone names and replaced the name Io with Iona before it could be used. Iwa was the first retired hurricane in the Central Pacific since the modern system of using Hawaiian naming began in the early 1980s, and it remains one of only four to be retired as of 2015.

Berezovsky was one of the first Russian Imperial composers in the 18th century to be recognized throughout Europe and the first to compose an opera, symphony, and violin sonata. His most popular works are his sacred choral pieces written for the Orthodox Church. Much of his work has been lost; only three of the 18 known choral concertos have been found. Dmitry Bortniansky was thought to be the first Russian symphonic composer until the discovery in 2002 of Berezovsky's Symphony in C by Steven Fox in the Vatican archives, composed around 1770 to 1772. Early life Not much is known about Berezovsky's biography. His life story was reconstructed in a short novel written in 1840 by Nestor Kukolnik and a play by Peter Smirnov staged at the Alexandrine Theatre in Saint Petersburg. Many particulars from these works of fiction had been accepted as fact, but have since been proven inaccurate. Some accounts speculate that Berezovsky was born on 27 October 1745 in Glukhov, and studied at the Kiev Mohyla Academy. However, no hard evidence exists for this information, and his name is missing from the annals of the Academy. Since Glukhov was the only other music school training singers for the Imperial Court Choir, it is likely that he did spend at least some of his childhood there. Today there is a monument to Maxim Berezovsky in Glukhov, which is believed to be his birthplace.\\"Maksym Berezovsky: Tragedy of the Ukrainian Mozart\\", Kateryna Zorkina, The Day Newspaper (Kiev), 16 April 2002. Education On 29 June 1758 he was accepted as a singer into the Prince Peter Fedorovych capella in Oranienbaum (now known as Lomonosov), near Saint Petersburg. Berezovsky participated in Italian operas and his name appears in printed librettos of the operas Alessandro nell'Indie by Francesco Araja and La Semiramide riconosciuta by Vincenzo Manfredini given in Oranienbaum in 1759 and 1760. In 1762, he became a singer of the Italian Capella of the Saint Petersburg Imperial palace, which was the palace chapel choir. Here he studied under singer N. Garani and Capella director F. Zoppis and likely under composers Vincenzo Manfredini and Baldassare Galuppi. He continued as court musician and composer for the majority of the 1760s. In 1763, Berezovsky wed Franzina Uberscher (also translated as Francisca Iberchere), a graduate of the Oranienbaum theatrical school. Not much is known about their life together. When he died in 1777, the composer's government funeral allowance was given to court singer J. Timchenko. This implies that Berezovsky was either separated or widowed from his wife during his final days, since this allowance would normally be given to the wife of the deceased. Berezovsky was sent to Italy in the spring of 1769 to train with renowned teacher padre Giovanni Battista Martini at the Bologna Philharmonic Academy, where he graduated with distinction. Along with fellow graduate Josef Mysliveƒçek, Berezowsky's exam task was to compose a polyphonic work on a given theme. This was a similar exam to the one given to his fellow alumnus Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart several months earlier, after which both graduated with distinction.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0100jkn Berezovsky's piece for four voices is still kept in the Academy's archives. On 15 May 1771 he became a member of the Accademia Filarmonica. Later years His opera Demofonte to the Italian libretto by Pietro Metastasio was staged in Livorno, Italy, and premiered in February 1773. Berezovsky returned to Saint Petersburg in October 1773 (early biographies indicate that he returned in 1775). According to archival discoveries in the late 20th century, Berezovsky was appointed a staff member of the imperial theater and capellmeister of the Royal court capella eight months later. This was a high ranking position for a musician and contradicts the notion that Berezovsky's talent was not appreciated upon his return to Saint Petersburg. Some sources state that he committed suicide as a result of depression for not being accepted upon his return to Saint Petersburg. His first biographer, Eugene Bolkhovitinov, made this assertion in 1804 based on testimonials of those who knew Berezovsky. Marina Ritzarev, a contemporary scholar, asserts that he did not commit suicide but rather likely caught a sudden fever resulting in his death after developing some psychic disease. He died in Saint Petersburg on 24 March (2 April N.S.) 1777.

The molecule is bifunctional, containing both a primary amine and a primary alcohol. Ethanolamine is a colorless, viscous liquid with an odor reminiscent of ammonia. Its derivatives are widespread in nature; e.g., lipids, as precursor of a variety of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), that modulate several animal and plant physiological processes such as seed germination, plant‚Äìpathogen interactions, chloroplast development and flowering, as well as precursor, combined with arachidonic acid (C20H32O2; 20:4, œâ-6), to form the endocannabinoid Anandamide (AEA: C22H37NO2; 20:4, œâ-6). The ethanolamines comprise a group of amino alcohols. A class of antihistamines is identified as ethanolamines, which includes carbinoxamine, clemastine, dimenhydrinate, Chlorphenoxamine, diphenhydramine and doxylamine. Industrial production Monoethanolamine is produced by treating ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia; the reaction also produces diethanolamine and triethanolamine. The ratio of the products can be controlled by the stoichiometry of the reactants. :400px Biochemistry Ethanolamine is biosynthesized by decarboxylation of serine: :HOCH2CH(CO2H)NH2 ‚Üí HOCH2CH2NH2 \\\\+ CO2 Ethanolamine is the second-most- abundant head group for phospholipids, substances found in biological membranes (particularly those of prokaryotes); e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine. It is also used in messenger molecules such as palmitoylethanolamide, which has an effect on CB1 receptors. Applications Ethanolamine is commonly called monoethanolamine or MEA in order to be distinguished from diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA). It is used as feedstock in the production of detergents, emulsifiers, polishes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, and chemical intermediates. For example, reacting ethanolamine with ammonia gives ethylenediamine, a precursor of the commonly used chelating agent, EDTA. 400px =Gas stream scrubbing= Like other amines, monoethanolamine is a weak base and this property is exploited in its use in gas scrubbing. Monoethanolamines can scrub combusted-coal, combusted-methane and combusted-biogas flue emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) very efficiently. Monoethanolamine scrubbing reduces climate change and can make historical coal and biogas industry more modern, healthier and more marketable. Legally, it is especially relevant to the Paris Agreement. MEA carbon dioxide scrubbing is also used to regenerate the air on submarines. Solutions of MEA in water are used as a gas stream scrubbing liquid in amine treaters. For example, aqueous MEA is used to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from various gas streams; e.g., flue gas and sour natural gas.. The MEA ionizes dissolved acidic compounds, making them polar and considerably more soluble. MEA scrubbing solutions can be recycled through a regeneration unit. When heated, MEA, being a rather weak base, will release dissolved H2S or CO2 gas resulting in a pure MEA solution. =Other uses= In pharmaceutical formulations, MEA is used primarily for buffering or preparation of emulsions. MEA can be used as pH regulator in cosmetics. It is also an injectable sclerosant as a treatment option of symptomatic hemorrhoids. 2-5 ml of ethanolamine oleate can be injected into the mucosa just above the hemorrhoids to cause ulceration and mucosal fixation thus preventing hemorrhoids from descending out of the anal canal. =pH-control amine= Ethanolamine is often used for alkalinization of water in steam cycles of power plants, including nuclear power plants with pressurized water reactors. This alkalinization is performed to control corrosion of metal components. ETA (or sometimes a similar organic amine; e.g., morpholine) is selected because it does not accumulate in steam generators (boilers) and crevices due to its volatility, but rather distributes relatively uniformly throughout the entire steam cycle. In such application, ETA is a key ingredient of so-called \\"all-volatile treatment\\" of water (AVT).

After spending 20 years in reserve, she was transferred to Republic of Korea Navy and served another 18 years as Kyong Puk (PF-82) until she was struck in 1985. History Kephart was named in honor of naval aviator Lieutenant William P. Kephart (1915‚Äì1942). She was launched on 6 September 1943 at the Charleston Navy Yard, sponsored by Mrs. A. P. Kephart, Lt. Kephart's mother, and commissioned on 7 January 1944, with Lieutenant Commander I. H. Cammarn in command. =Battle of the Atlantic= After shakedown off Bermuda, Kephart departed New York on 23 March for convoy escort duty in the Atlantic. During the next three months, she made three runs from New York to Gibraltar and Bizerte, Tunisia. Returning to New York on 30 June for conversion to a Charles Lawrence-class high speed transport, she was reclassified APD-61 on 5 July. = Pacific War = Kephart departed New York on 30 September and joined the 7th Fleet at Hollandia, New Guinea, on 10 November. As a unit of TransDiv 103, she departed in convoy on 17 November and arrived at Leyte Gulf, Philippines, on 24 November. After a run to the Palaus, she embarked troops of the 77th Infantry Division at Leyte, and steamed on 6 December with Task Group 78.3 for amphibious assault at Ormoc Bay. During landing operations on 7 December, Kepharts guns splashed two Japanese planes in a fierce raid. Returning to Leyte on 8 December, she embarked soldiers of the 19th Infantry Regiment; she sailed on 12 December for Mindoro, and landed assault troops at San Jose on 15 December, again under heavy enemy air attack. Returning to Leyte on 17 December, she continued on 20 December to Hollandia to prepare for anti-submarine and amphibious operations. Kephart after her conversion to a high-speed transport. Carrying men of the 158th Regimental Combat Team, Kephart departed Noemfoor, Schouten Islands, on 4 January 1945 to rejoin the fight to liberate the Philippines. Steaming to Luzon, she arrived at San Fabien, Lingayen Gulf, on 11 January, and landed reinforcements, despite constant harassment from enemy planes emerging from the heavy air attack unscathed. Returning to Leyte on 15 January for three months of anti- submarine patrol, Kephart took part in scattered landing operations in the Philippines: at Grande Island, Subic Bay (30 January); Puerto Princesa, Palawan (28 February); Zamboanga, Mindanao (10 March); Cebu City, Cebu (26 March); and Cotabato, Mindanao (17 April). Kephart departed Leyte Gulf on 4 May for escort and assault operations in the Dutch East Indies, arriving Morotai on 7 May. After escorting a convoy to Mindanao (18‚Äì20 May), she returned to Morotai on 21 May and embarked troops of the Australian Army for an amphibious assault at Brunei Bay, North Borneo. Sailing on 4 June, she landed troops on 10 June amid dwindling enemy resistance; then she patrolled the South China Sea, hunting submarines before returning Morotai on 19 June. She sailed on 26 June carrying Australian soldiers to the eastern coast of Borneo, arriving on 1 July for the final major amphibious operation of the war ‚Äî the landing operations at Balikpapan, Borneo. Continuing escort and anti- submarine duty, Kephart departed Morotai on 16 July and reached Leyte Gulf two days later. On 4 August she began amphibious training at Albay and Lagonoy Gulfs, Luzon, in preparation for a possible invasion of Japan. After the fighting ended on 15 August, she sailed from Leyte Gulf on 29 August to Okinawa to embark occupation troops for Korea. She reached Jinsen, Korea, on 8 September; and then shuttled between the Philippines and Korea. She steamed from Jinsen on 29 October via Sasebo, Japan, and Okinawa to Tsingtao, China, arriving there on 14 November to support the Chinese Nationalists' effort to repel Communist aggression on the Chinese mainland. =Reserve Fleet= Returning to Okinawa on 22 November, Kephart embarked 147 homebound veterans and departed on 26 November for the United States. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, she reached San Diego, California on 16 December. Two days after unloading her passengers, she sailed for the East Coast, and arrived at New York on New Year's Day 1946. Following overhaul, she departed on 8 February for Green Cove Springs, Florida, arriving there on 11 February. Kephart was decommissioned on 21 June, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange, Texas. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 May 1967 and transferred under the Military Assistance Program to the Republic of Korea on 16 May 1967. Kephart received five battle stars for World War II service. = Transfer to South Korea = Kephart was renamed Kyong Puk (PF-82) by the Republic of Korea Navy. She was redesignated APD-85 in 1972, renumbered APD-826 in 1980, redesignated DE-826 in 1982. Kyong Puk was purchased outright by the Republic of Korea on 15 November 1974.

After leaving the Bourbons, Whiteman recorded as a solo artist, and subsequently became a member of the bands Que Vida, Broken Social Scene and Apostle of Hustle. Beresford left the band in 1994, and performed drum tracks on Tom Cochrane's 1995 album, Ragged Ass Road; Tom Bona replaced him in 1995.

The Record, February 14, 1995. Despite strong critical reviews, however, an expected mainstream breakthrough did not materialize, as the band's manager pursued a strategy of keeping them off the road at first, in the hope of allowing market demand for their live show to build up so that he could book the band into larger venues than they had previously played. Instead of having the intended effect, the strategy merely reduced the album's sales to barely half those of Superior Cackling Hen, and effectively derailed the band's commercial momentum. In addition, when the band did finally tour they maintained a policy of refusing to play venues or music festivals, including Canadian Music Week, which involved sponsorship by tobacco companies, which further limited the number of venues available for them to play.\\"Tobacco sponsor stubs out blatant advertising\\". The Globe and Mail, February 29, 1996. A CD reissue of Sister Anthony was also released in 1995.

The city of Sirkap was built by the Greco-Bactrian king Demetrius after he invaded ancient India around 180 BC. Demetrius founded in the northern and northwestern modern Pakistan an Indo- Greek kingdom that was to last until around 10 BC. Sirkap is also said to have been rebuilt by king Menander I. Archaeological excavations The excavation of the old city was carried out under the supervision of Sir John Marshall by Hergrew from 1912‚Äì1930. In 1944 and 1945 further parts were excavated by Mortimer Wheeler and his colleagues. Most of the discoveries at Sirkap related to the Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian periods (1st-2nd century CE). Overall excavations to the Greek levels have been very limited, and probably much remains hidden underground: in Sirkap, only about one eight of the excavations were made down to the Indo-Greek and early Indo-Scythian levels, and this only in an area far removed from the center of the ancient city, where few discoveries could be expected.

The site of Sirkap was built according to the \\"Hippodamian\\" grid-plan characteristic of Greek cities. It is organized around one main avenue and fifteen perpendicular streets, covering a surface of around , with a surrounding wall wide and long. The ruins are Greek in character, similar to those of Olynthus in Macedonia. Numerous Hellenistic artifacts have been found, in particular coins of Greco-Bactrian kings and stone palettes representing Greek mythological scenes. Some of them are purely Hellenistic, others indicate an evolution of the Greco-Bactrian styles found at Ai-Khanoum towards more indianized styles. For example, accessories such as Indian ankle bracelets can be found on some representations of Greek mythological figures such as Artemis. Following its construction by the Greeks, the city was further rebuilt during the incursions of the Indo-Scythians, and later by the Indo-Parthians after an earthquake in 30 AD. Gondophares, the first king of the Indo-Parthian Kingdom, built parts of the city including the double headed eagle stupa and the temple of the sun god. The city was overtaken by the Kushan kings who abandoned it and built a new city at Sirsukh, about to the north-east.

Religious buildings Buddhist stupas with strong Hellenistic decorative elements can be found throughout the Sirkap site (Stupa of the two eagles ), a Jain temple and a Jain stupa, as well as a Hindu temple, indicating a close interaction of religious cultures. A Greek religious temple of the Ionic order is also visible at the nearby site of Jandial ( from Sirkap), but there is a possibility that it may have been dedicated to a Zoroastrian cult. The site of Sirkap bears witness to the city-building activity of the Indo-Greeks during their occupation of the Indian territory for close to two centuries, as well as their integration of other faiths, especially Buddhism. =Round stupa= One round Stupa is present at Sirkap. It is one of the oldest Stupas in the Indian-Subcontinent. It is assumed that this Stupa was uprooted and thrown to its present location by a strong earthquake in the 1st century AD. When the new city was built later, the Stupa was kept by building a protecting wall around it. The round Stupa at Sirkap. =Apsidal Temple= The building that is known as the Apsidal Temple is the largest sanctuary of Sirkap, measuring about (by contrast: the Parthenon in Athens is ). The Apsidal Temple consists of a square nave with several rooms, used by the Buddhist monks, and a circular room, which gives the building its apsidal shape. After the earthquake that destroyed the city in c. 30 AD, the Buddhist shrine was built in a spacious courtyard. The round part was probably in use for a small stupa, but no traces of it remain. Some carvings were probably done by an artist from Greece. The round room of the Apsidal Temple. =Double-Headed Eagle Stupa= A special Stupa at Sirkap is the so-called 'Double-Headed Eagle Stupa'. The pilasters here are of a Greek design, \\"Corinthian columns\\". In the middle arch, a Greek temple is shown; in the outer, a shrine of a Hindu design can be seen. On top of these sanctuaries, a Double-headed eagle is seated from which the name of the Stupa has been derived. This motive is rather odd, to say the least, as it is originally Babylonian. It seems to have spread to Scythia, and introduced in the Punjab by the Saka rulers. =Dharmarajika Stupa= The nearby Dharmarajika Stupa, is a large stupa that dates from the 2nd century CE. The stupa was built to house relics of the Buddha, while several monastic buildings were built around the stupa. Visit by Apollonius of Tyana The Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana is related to have visited ancient India, and specifically the city of Taxila in the 1st century AD. He describes constructions of the Greek type, probably referring to Sirkap: :\\"Taxila, they tell us, is about as big as Nineveh, and was fortified fairly well after the manner of Greek cities\\".(Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 20) :\\"I have already described the way in which the city is walled, but they say that it was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in Athens, and that the houses were built in such a way that if you look at them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above.\\"(Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 23) See also Map of Sirkap excavations. *Bhir Mound * Google Map images of the site References * Gallery File:SirkapWell.JPG|A well at Sirkap.

Embarking on his role as Bronx Borough President in January 1966, Badillo was met with the ongoing advocacy for the preservation of Bronx Borough Hall as a landmark, led by prior Bronx Borough President Joseph F. Periconi. Periconi had, along with several historians, successfully attained landmark status for the building in October 1965, bestowed by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. It was then placed under final review by the Board of Estimate of New York City. On January 27, 1966, the last day of the 90-day review period, the board voted to revoke the landmark status, deferring to the new incumbent's view on the matter. In 1968 a mysterious fire burned part of the interior. Though still repairable, it was demolished in 1969. U.S. House of Representatives In 1970 Badillo was elected to the United States House of Representatives from New York's 21st District in the South Bronx, becoming the first Puerto Rican to so serve. He was re-elected for three subsequent consecutive terms. He was also a member of the Committee on Education and Labor. In 1976 he was challenged by South Bronx Councilman Ramon Velez in a contest for the Democratic Party nomination for Congressman of the 21st District. Badillo was reelected easily with 75 percent of the vote. In December of that year, he was one of the five Latino members of Congress who established the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Largely by his efforts, job training for unemployed non-English speaking citizens was included in the \\"Comprehensive Manpower Act of 1973\\". Badillo also served on the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee and the Small Business Committee, where he had a seat on the Minority Enterprise and General Oversight Sub-committee. During his time in office he supported legislation intended to counteract various types of discrimination in employment, including discrimination base on age and marital status. Although he would later become a vociferous opponent of bilingual education, as a congressman Badillo was one of the first champions of funding for bilingual education programs. Some proponents of bilingual and ESL education, and opponents of English immersion, attacked Badillo for his newfound opposition to Spanish-language teaching. He was also a critical player in the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and the inclusion of its language access provisions. During his tenure in Congress, he became an important national spokesperson for Federal investment in urban centers. Mayoral campaigns Badillo sought the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York in 1969, 1973, 1977, 1981 and 1985. His closest contest came in his second attempt when he was defeated by then-New York City Comptroller Abe Beame in a runoff primary. In 1981 and 1985 he did not appear on the ballot, dropping out after early moves to stage a campaign failed to generate broad enough support. Badillo unsuccessfully sought a Republican mayoral nomination in 2001, losing in a landslide vote for billionaire businessman and political neophyte Michael Bloomberg who would later prevail in that general election. Deputy Mayor of New York City Badillo resigned from Congress on December 31, 1977, to become deputy mayor of New York City under Mayor Ed Koch, a position he held until September 1979. Badillo was one of seven deputy mayors appointed by Koch for the first portion of his administration. As a deputy mayor Badillo handled labor relations and community outreach for Koch. In a major public disagreement with Mayor Koch over the lack of support for his program to revitalize the South Bronx, Badillo resigned his post. Some argue that Badillo made a major career mistake in giving up his Congressional post for this appointed position under Mayor Koch. Post-City Hall career and State Comptroller campaign After leaving City Hall, Badillo worked as an attorney in New York City. He supported Mario Cuomo for governor over Koch during the 1982 Democratic primary. In late 1983 Cuomo appointed Badillo Chairman of the State of New York Mortgage Agency. In 1985 Badillo considered a bid for mayor against Koch in the Democratic primary. In 1986 Badillo was the Democratic nominee for New York State Comptroller, losing to Republican incumbent Edward Regan. During these years Badillo was also active in Presidential politics, supporting Alan Cranston for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and Michael Dukakis in 1988. City Comptroller campaign In 1993, Badillo ‚Äì though still a Democrat ‚Äì campaigned for Comptroller of New York City on a \\"fusion\\" basis with Republican Rudy Giuliani's mayoral campaign. He also sought the Democratic nomination, but finished third, behind Alan Hevesi and the incumbent Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman. Although Giuliani won the general election, Badillo, running on the Republican and Liberal party lines, was defeated by Hevesi. Giuliani Administration and CUNY Chairmanship Badillo held a series of positions with the Giuliani administration, serving as the mayor's Special Counsel on education policy and as chairman of the board of trustees of the City University of New York. In his capacity as Giuliani's education advisor, Badillo advocated increased mayoral control of the public schools and a revamped curriculum; he was also Giuliani's liaison to the city's board of education. As CUNY Chairman Badillo organized a successful effort to end open enrollment and revamp the curriculum. These actions gained him some support among conservatives but alienated him from the mainstream of the Puerto Rican political leadership, which had been his traditional base. In 1999, Badillo's remarks about Latino immigrants ignited calls for his dismissal. His reference to recent Dominican Republic and Mexico immigrants as \\"pure Indians -- Incas and Mayans who are about, you know, five feet tall with straight hair,\\" and never having a \\"tradition of education\\" were widely criticized, and he apologized two days later. Republican Party switch and 2001 mayoral campaign In the late 1990s Badillo formally joined the Republican Party. He resigned as education special counsel and CUNY Chairman when announcing his candidacy for mayor in 2001. Despite his strong support of Mayor Giuliani, Badillo's bid for mayor never received serious support from Giuliani or the Republican Party, and lost badly in the Republican primary to billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who had just switched parties as Badillo had done earlier. Later career In 2005, Badillo became \\"of counsel\\" to the New York City law firm of Sullivan Papain Block McGrath & Cannavo P.C. In 2006 he joined the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research as a senior fellow. In January 2011 Badillo joined national personal injury law firm Parker Waichman Alonso as a senior counsel in its New York office. Badillo died on December 3, 2014, of congestive heart failure at the age of 85.

His view is that Hispanics will soon make up 25% of the population of the United States and that their failure to excel would be tragic for them and the nation.

The charpai is mostly used in warm areas: its net is made out of cotton, natural fibers and date leaves. It is a simple design that is easy to construct. There are many interpretations of the traditional design and over the years craftspeople have innovated with the weave patterns and materials used. It has a frame of four strong vertical posts connected by four horizontal members; the design makes the construction self-leveling. The weaving is done in many ways, e.g. a diagonal cross weave with one end left for adjustments as linear members, which helps in controlling the sagging of the bed as it ages with use. It was traditionally made out of a wooden frame and cotton ropes but modern charpais may have metal frames and plastic tapes.

The band's music adds elements of rock, jazz and salsa. The Bulgars sixth studio album Tumbling Into Light was released November 10, 2009. The recording was produced by David Newfeld and engineered by Jeremy Darby at the Canterbury Music Company. For the first time the Flying Bulgars are writing songs in English for the upcoming album. The band currently consists of David Buchbinder, Dave Wall, Max Senitt, Peter Lutek, Tania Gill and Victor Bateman. Band Bio The Flying Bulgars is a Toronto-based ensemble. The band has been a significant part of the so-called 'Klezmer Revival' that began in the early 1980s, both in Canada and around the world. Formed by trumpeter and bandleader David Buchbinder in 1987, and now co-lead with Dave Wall, The Flying Bulgars (the Bulgar in the group's name refers to a dance form not an ethnic group) were a product of the rebirth of interest in Yiddish culture in North America. In 2008, the group reached its 20th anniversary, and to celebrate they are releasing their sixth CD in November 2008. All new, original material with songs written for the first time in English are presented with a contemporary folk/alternative sound yet with a solid Jewish-themed foundation. Full of darkness and hope, the tunes mix poetry, anger and longing in a heady mix of Klezmer-inspired melodies. With a fully orchestrated alt-pop sound recorded with the help of Dave Newfield, the mastermind behind successful productions such as Broken Social Scene, it is a time of creative renewal for a band with intents of reinventing itself and moving towards a wider audience. Leader, main composer and founder David Buchbinder has studied with some of the most accomplished jazz men around, from Freddie Stone to Kenny Wheeler to Muhal Richard Abrams. He is at home playing many styles of contemporary music and is breaking out as a composer of film and concert music. In addition to leading his own group, drummer Max Senitt has a focus on Latin music and has played with professionals such as Hilario Duran. Tania Gill is the pianist and composes for several jazz ensembles. Bass master, Victor Bateman recently returned to the band after a long absence, well known for his work with an almost infinite variety of jazz, folk, world and pop artists. Peter Lutek's skills as a tenor and soprano saxophonist and with the clarinet have been appreciated by several philharmonic orchestras. Lead vocalist Dave Wall came to the Flying Bulgars from the Bourbon Tabernacle Choir with whom he recorded three CDs. The Flying Bulgars combine a love for tradition with a fearless commitment to experimentation that has drawn in fans from across Canada and internationally. From the Folk on the Rocks Festival in Yellowknife to the WOMAD festival in Morcombe, England, to the Tollwood Festival in Munich, to the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival in New York, the music is far from the traditional Klezmer found at weddings and bar mitzvahs‚Äîit is a dynamic force in Canadian contemporary World Music. The Bulgars have recorded five CDs and have received two Juno nominations, and they are still the only Klezmer band to have created a music video which received much airplay on MuchMusic. Extended History Rooted in Eastern Europe and the immigrant ghettos of North America, Klezmer music brought together the traditions of the Tsarist Russian military band, gypsy folk music, Hasidic religious song, and Afro-American jazz. The Flying Bulgars blend those traditions with the remarkable talents of six great musicians on trumpet, bass, drums, clarinet, piano and vocals. Formed by trumpeter and leader David Buchbinder in 1987, The Flying Bulgars (the Bulgar in the group's name refers to a dance form not an ethnic group) were a product of the rebirth of interest in Yiddish culture in North America. After the founding of Israel in 1948, the Yiddish language and the art associated with it were marginalized by many Jews for whom Yiddish represented the ghettos of Eastern Europe and the holocaust. In the fifties and sixties it was chic to sing songs in Hebrew, the language of the new Jewish state. In 1975 a group of young musicians in San Francisco, The Klezmorim, released an album called East Side Wedding and the Klezmer renaissance was on. Across North America and Europe dozens of new groups sprang up reclaiming the tradition of Eastern European Jewish music. As the term \\"world music\\" became fashionable, Klezmer music became one of its constituents. The Flying Bulgars became the most prominent Canadian members of the international Klezmer fraternity, as well as being regarded as one of the most adventurous and accomplished Klezmer groups around. Yet at precisely the time when the band was formed something else was happening in Klezmer music. In New York a group of young adventurous musicians were taking Klezmer to the next stage. Klezmer music had always been a fusion of old and new world traditions, Polish dance tunes and jazz, Jewish tradition and Afro-American contemporary popular music. The Jewish New Wave, as it came to be called, brought funk, r&b;, new music and free jazz into the mix, and The Flying Bulgars found that approach suited them just fine. While the band still performs material from the early days of Klezmer, the vast majority of its repertoire is new music written by band members. Today the band is far from the traditional Klezmer found at weddings and bar mitzvahs; it is a dynamic force in Canadian contemporary music, combining a love for tradition with a fearless commitment to experimentation. Just as the classic Klezmer (the word means itinerant musician) of the nineteen twenties mixed everything they knew and heard to make their music, so the members of The Flying Bulgars bring their own broad musical experience to the band in its 21st century configuration. Leader, main composer and founder David Buchbinder has studied with some of the most accomplished jazz men around from Freddie Stone to Kenny Wheeler to Muhal Richard Abrams. He is at home playing many styles of contemporary music and is breaking out as a composer of film and concert music. Daniel Barnes is a highly accomplished drummer whose credits include Joe Sealey's Juno award winning Africville Suite and touring with Ethiopian diva Aster Aweke. Marilyn Lerner is involved in so many projects it is hard to list them all. A pianist of uncommon ability her love for Klezmer based music is reflected in her work with the Bulgars, her collaboration with Dave Wall on a project of contemporary Yiddish song and her membership in Both Ends of the Earth. Bob Stevenson, on clarinet and bass clarinet, brings his long experience in jazz and new music to Klezmer. In addition to ensembles like Arraymusic and Hemispheres, he conducted the 20 piece Klezmer Ashkenaz Orchestra. Bass master, Victor Bateman recently returned to the band after a long absence. Victor was the band's first bassist. He is well known for his work with an almost infinite variety of jazz, folk, world and pop artists as well as his own work as a band leader and very individual interpreter of folk music. He also leads workshops in improvisation. Dave Wall came to the Flying Bulgars from the Bourbon Tabernacle Choir with whom he recorded three CDs. Moved by a desire to focus on his Yiddish roots, Dave has become the finest singer of Yiddish song in the country. Since their founding in 1987 The Flying Bulgar Klezmer Band has worked consistently to develop a musical language that is specific to its place and time, rooted squarely in a folk tradition while embracing the possibilities of the present. This attention to the development of a personal sound along with a highly charged performance style has opened extensive performing opportunities over the years, allowing the band tour across Canada and internationally. From the Folk on the Rocks Festival in Yellowknife to the WOMAD festival in Morcombe, England, to the Tollwood Festival in Munich, to the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival in New York.. They have recorded five CDs, which are distributed internationally and have received two Juno nominations, and are still the only klezmer band to have created a music video, which received much airplay on MuchMusic. For many years the group has been recognized for their unique approach to new Yiddish (klezmer) music, a reputation that has grown with their last several projects. In May 2002 the Flying Bulgars performed their new show - Shekhine-Spirit in the Natural World before a sold out crowd at Toronto's Isabel Bader Theatre. This evening length concert (which featured guest artists Jane Bunnett and Alex Poch-Goldin) was the group's first truly \\"theatrical\\" presentation, melding music, poetry and visual element (stage design/video). The audience response to this show was overwhelming and inspiring. A recording of this new work produced by David Travers-Smith and featuring new compositions by every band member, was released in June 2003. Hailed as \\"a sophisticated, diverse and sweet return to the studio\\" and \\"more complex than anything the Toronto ensemble has tackled before\\", Sweet Return marks the continued evolution of one of the Canada's most accomplished and innovative ensembles. It received a Juno nomination; the third time the band has been so honoured. The last year has been busy for the band. In addition to many shows in their hometown of Toronto they headlined at Ottawa's Tulip Festival in May and June saw them in Nova Scotia at the Multicultural Festival in Dartmouth. In July they were at the Festival d'ete in Quebec City and the Mission and Islands folk music Festivals in BC. In October the Flying Bulgars performed in Montreal and graced soft-seat theaters in Atlantic Canada. The band started off this year with an appearance as a headliner at the Chutzpah! Jewish Music Festival in Vancouver, and was thrilled to have the performance recorded by the CBC for an upcoming radio concert series. In 2008, the group has reached its 20th anniversary‚Äîand to celebrate: the release of their sixth CD this November.

Contrary to the title, the author believes that the events and violence of the Gulf War actually took place, whereas the issue is one of interpretation: were the events that took place comparable to how they were presented, and could these events be called a war? The title is a reference to the play The Trojan War Will Not Take Place by Jean Giraudoux (in which characters attempt to prevent what the audience knows is inevitable). The essays in Lib√©ration and The Guardian were published before, during and after the Gulf War and they were titled accordingly: during the American military and rhetorical buildup as \\"The Gulf War Will Not Take Place\\"; during military action as \\"The Gulf War Is Not Taking Place\\", and after action was over, \\"The Gulf War Did Not Take Place\\". A book of elongated versions of the truncated original articles in French was published in May 1991. The English translation was published in early 1995 translated by Paul Patton.  Summary  Baudrillard argued the Gulf War was not really a war, but rather an atrocity which masqueraded as a war.William Merrin, \\"Uncritical criticism? Norris, Baudrillard and the Gulf War.\\" Economy and Society, Volume 23, Issue 4, 1994, pp. 433‚Äì458, at p. 447. Using overwhelming airpower, the American military for the most part did not directly engage in combat with the Iraqi army, and suffered few casualties. Almost nothing was made known about Iraqi deaths. Thus, the fighting \\"did not really take place\\" from the point of view of the West. Moreover, all that spectators got to know about the war was in the form of propaganda imagery. The closely watched media presentations made it impossible to distinguish between the experience of what truly happened in the conflict, and its stylized, selective misrepresentation through simulacra.Jean Baudrillard, The Gulf War Did Not Take Place.

Career =Big Numbers= At the age of 18 Columbia was hired to assist Bill Sienkiewicz in illustrating Alan Moore's ambitious Big Numbers series. When Sienkiewicz withdrew from the series in 1990 after the release of the first two issues, Moore and his backers at Tundra Publishing asked the young Columbia to become its sole artist. In 1992, with no more issues released, Columbia himself left the project under a cloud of rumors and accusations, including claims that he had destroyed his own artwork for Big Numbers #4.Eastman, Kevin.

Columbia contributed to three issues of the horror anthology From Beyonde in the early nineties, initially under the pen name \\"Lucien\\" and then under his own name. His stories \\"The Biologic Show\\" and \\"Tar Frogs\\" also appeared in the British magazine Deadline. In these works, which focused on visceral and disturbing subject matter including mutilation, incest, and the occult, he moved away from the glossy photorealism of his time with Sienkiewicz towards a scabrous but virtuosic pen-and-ink style that emphasized grotesque physiognomic details such as grinning mouths full of teeth and leering, reptilian eyes. In 1994 Fantagraphics Books published Columbia's comic The Biologic Show #0. It contained partially redrawn versions of his stories from Deadline along with new works. It received mostly enthusiastic reviews and praise from other cartoonists including Mike AllredBack cover, The Biologic Show #0, October 1994, Fantagraphics Books. and Jim Woodring.Woodring, Jim. \\"Muss I Den?\\", Jim Vol. 2 #5, May 1995, Fantagraphics Books.

In later stories such as \\"Amnesia\\" and \\"Alfred the Great\\" Columbia combined cel animation-influenced character drawings with minutely detailed chiaroscuro backgrounds and some use of digital illustration techniques and photo manipulation. \\"The Trumpets They Play!\\", a widely lauded work in this style based on the Book of Revelation, appeared in BLAB! #10 in 1998. During the 1990s Columbia did ancillary tasks such as color separation for the publications of cartoonists including Chris Ware, Walt Holcombe, and Archer Prewitt. He also created artwork for the set of comedian David Cross's 1999 television special The Pride is Back. Although he gave short interviews to several zines during this period,\\"A chat with ol' Al Columbia\\", interview by Ian Lynam, Velour #1 (Berkeley, CA: Migraine, n.d.).Ain't Nothin' Like Fuckin' Moonshine #10 (Portland, OR: Bwana Spoons) the small quantity of his published output and the cancellation of several previously announced titles and anthology contributions, compounded with lingering questions about the fate of Big Numbers, made him an object of much speculation. \\"Whatever happened to Al Columbia?\\" became a perennial question on comics websites and message boards. =2000s and beyond= During the 2000s Columbia made occasional contributions to anthologies including Mome, The Best American Comics, and Ashley Wood's Swallow. On November 19, 2001, The New York Times ran one of his illustrations on its Letters page. His work also appeared in the alternative newsweekly The Stranger and in magazines such as The Believer and Arthur. In 2003 he wrote two issues of The Pogostick, an unfinished comic book series illustrated by Ethan Persoff that was nominated for a Harvey Award. He created the artwork for The Postal Service's 2003 album Give Up. Columbia's personal website, alcolumbia.com, went online in late 2006.

He first appeared in the story \\"No Tomorrow If I Must Return\\" in The Biologic Show #0. Other stories featuring the character include \\"I Was Killing When Killing Wasn't Cool\\", \\"Amnesia\\", and \\"The Trumpets They Play!\\". =Pim and Francie= A pair of impish waifs whose antics get them into horrific trouble, Pim and Francie first appeared in the story \\"Tar Frogs\\" and are the protagonists in \\"Peloria Part One\\" and Pim & Francie: The Golden Bear Days. The two have a loosely defined sibling relationship. According to Columbia they were originally modeled on him and his former girlfriend as cartoon characters before taking on a life of their own. =Knishkebibble the Monkey- Boy= Described in the story \\"Amnesia\\" as a \\"childish icon for mischievous and filthy pleasures,\\" Knishkebibble was introduced in \\"Peloria Part One\\".

The game was popular across the Middle East among people of all social strata and boards for playing it have been found at locations as far away from Mesopotamia as Crete and Sri Lanka. At the height of its popularity, the game acquired spiritual significance, and events in the game were believed to reflect a player's future and convey messages from deities or other supernatural beings. The Game of Ur remained popular until late antiquity, when it stopped being played, possibly evolving into, or being displaced by, an early form of backgammon. It was eventually forgotten everywhere except among the Jewish population of the Indian city of Kochi, who continued playing a version of it until the 1950s when they began emigrating to Israel. The Game of Ur received its name because it was first rediscovered by the English archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley during his excavations of the Royal Cemetery at Ur between 1922 and 1934. Copies of the game have since been found by other archaeologists across the Middle East. The rules of the Game of Ur as it was played in the second century BC have been preserved on a Babylonian clay tablet written by the scribe Itti-Marduk-balƒÅ·π≠u. Based on this tablet and the shape of the , British Museum curator Irving Finkel reconstructed the basic rules of how the game might have been played. The object of the game is to run the course of the board and bear all one's pieces off before one's opponent. Like modern backgammon, the game combines elements of both strategy and luck.  History  graffito version of the game from the palace of Sargon II (British Museum in London) Game box for playing Senet and Twenty Squares, 1635‚Äì1458 B.C. The Game of Ur was popular across the Middle East and boards for it have been found in Iran, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Cyprus, and Crete. Four gameboards bearing a very close resemblance to the Royal Game of Ur were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. These boards came with small boxes to store dice and game pieces and many had senet boards on the reverse sides so that the same board could be used to play either game and merely had to be flipped over. The game was popular among all social classes. A graffito version of the game carved with a sharp object, possibly a dagger, was discovered on one of the human-headed winged bull gate sentinels from the palace of Sargon II (721‚Äì705 BC) in the city of Khorsabad. The Game of Ur eventually acquired superstitious significance and the tablet of Itti-Marduk-balƒÅ·π≠u provides vague predictions for the players' futures if they land on certain spaces, such as \\"You will find a friend\\", \\"You will become powerful like a lion\\", or \\"You will draw fine beer\\". People saw relationships between a player's success in the game and his or her success in real life. Seemingly random events, such as landing on a certain square, were interpreted as messages from deities, ghosts of deceased ancestors, or from a person's own soul. It is unclear what led to the Game of Ur's eventual decline during late antiquity. One theory holds that it evolved into backgammon; whereas another holds that early forms of backgammon eclipsed the Game of Ur in popularity, causing players to eventually forget about the older game. At some point before the game fell out of popularity in the Middle East, it was apparently introduced to the Indian city of Kochi by a group of Jewish merchants. Members of the Jewish population of Kochi were still playing a recognizable form of the Game of Ur, which they called Aasha, by the time they started emigrating to Israel in the 1950s after World War II. The Kochi version of the game had twenty squares, just like the original Mesopotamian version, but each player had twelve pieces rather than seven, and the placement of the twenty squares was slightly different.  Modern rediscovery  The British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley discovered five gameboards of the Game of Ur during his excavation of the Royal Cemetery at Ur between 1922 and 1934. Because the game was first discovered in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, it became known as the \\"Royal Game of Ur\\", but later archaeologists uncovered other copies of the game from other locations across the Middle East. Each of the boards discovered by Wooley date to around 3,000 BC. All five boards were of an identical type, but they were made of different materials and had different decorations. Woolley reproduced images of two of these boards in his 1949 book, The First Phases. One of these is a relatively simple set with a background composed of discs of shell with blue or red centers set in wood-covered bitumen. The other is a more elaborate one completely covered with shell plaques, inlaid with red limestone and lapis lazuli. Other gameboards are often engraved with images of animals.  Gameplay  = Reconstruction = Rules tablet dated 177 BC (British Museum: ) When the Game of Ur was first discovered, no one knew how it was played. Then, in the early 1980s, Irving Finkel, a curator at the British Museum, translated a clay tablet written 177 BC by the Babylonian scribe Itti-Marduk- balƒÅ·π≠u describing how the game was played during that time period, based on an earlier description of the rules by another scribe named Iddin-Bƒìl. This tablet was written during the waning days of Babylonian civilization, long after the time when the Game of Ur was first played. It had been discovered in 1880 in the ruins of Babylon and sold to the British Museum. Finkel also used photographs of another tablet describing the rules, which had been in the personal collection of Count Aymar de Liedekerke-Beaufort, but was destroyed during World War I. This second tablet was undated, but is believed by archaeologists to have been written several centuries earlier than the tablet by Itti-Marduk-balƒÅ·π≠u and to have originated from the city of Uruk. The backs of both tablets show diagrams of the gameboard, clearly indicating which game they are describing. Based on these rules and the shape of the gameboard, Finkel was able to reconstruct how the game might have been played. = Basic rules = The Game of Ur is a race game and it is probably a direct ancestor of the tables, or backgammon, family of games, which are still played today. The Game of Ur is played using two sets of seven checker-like game pieces. One set of pieces is white with five black dots and the other set is black with five white dots. The gameboard is composed of two rectangular sets of boxes, one containing three rows of four boxes each and the other containing three rows of two boxes each, joined together by a \\"narrow bridge\\" of two boxes. The gameplay involves elements of both luck and strategy. Movements are determined by rolling a set of four-sided, tetrahedron-shaped dice. Two of the four corners of each die are marked and the other two are not, giving each die an equal chance of landing with a marked or unmarked corner facing up. The number of marked ends facing upwards after a roll of the dice indicates how many spaces a player may move during that turn. A single game can last up to half an hour and can be very intense. The object of the game is for a player to move all seven of their pieces along the course (two proposed versions of which are shown at right) and off the board before their opponent. On all surviving gameboards, the two sides of the board are always identical with each other, indicating that the two sides of the board belong to each player. When a piece is on one of the player's own squares, it is safe from capture, but, when it is on one of the eight squares in the middle of the board, the opponent's pieces may capture it by landing on the same space, sending the piece back off the board so that it must restart the course from the beginning. This means there are six \\"safe\\" squares and eight \\"combat\\" squares. There can never be more than one piece on a single square at any given time, so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player's mobility. When a player rolls a number using the dice, they may choose to move any of their pieces on the board or add a new piece to the board if they still have pieces that have not entered the game. A player is not required to capture a piece every time they have the opportunity. Nonetheless, players are required to move a piece whenever possible, even if it results in an unfavorable outcome. All surviving gameboards have a colored rosette in the middle of the center row. According to Finkel's reconstruction, if a piece is located on the space with the rosette, it is safe from capture. Finkel also states that when a piece lands on any of the three rosettes, the player gets an extra roll. In order to remove a piece from the board, a player must roll exactly the number of spaces remaining until the end of the course plus one. If the player rolls a number any higher or lower than this number, they may not remove the piece from the board. = Gambling = One archaeological dig uncovered twenty-one white balls alongside a set of the Game of Ur. It is believed that these balls were probably used for placing wagers. According to the tablet of Itti-Marduk- balƒÅ·π≠u, whenever a player skips one of the boxes marked with a rosette, they must place a token in the pot. If a player lands on a rosette, they may take a token from the pot.  References   Further reading  * Botermans, Jack (1988). Le Monde des jeux. Paris: Le Ch√™ne. . * Finkel, Irving (1991).

It stars Catherine Deneuve, Ian Hendry, John Fraser, Patrick Wymark, and Yvonne Furneaux. The main character Carol (Catherine Deneuve) is a beautiful yet withdrawn woman who finds men and sexual advances repulsive. She is left alone in an apartment in a vacation, becoming ever more isolated and lost in her psychological detachment from reality. The film focuses on the point of view of Carol and her vivid hallucinations and nightmares as she comes into contact with men and their desires for her. Shot in London, it is Polanski's first English-language film and second feature-length production, following Knife in the Water (1962). The film debuted at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival before receiving theatrical releases internationally. Upon its release, Repulsion received considerable critical acclaim and currently is considered one of Polanski's greatest works. The film was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Gilbert Taylor's cinematography. Plot Carol Ledoux, a beautiful Belgian manicurist, lives in London with her older sister Helen. Carol is remarkably detached and struggles in her daily interactions. A suitor, Colin, is enamored with her and makes fervent attempts to court her, but Carol seems uninterested. When home, she enjoys looking out the window to see a group of nuns outside of their church playing soccer. Carol is troubled by her sister's relationship with a man named Michael, whom she seems to dislike. She is bothered by his habit of leaving his razor and toothbrush in her glass in the bathroom. At night she is unable to sleep, haunted by the sounds of her sister's lovemaking. They are also constantly pestered by their landlord to pay their rent. When Carol walks home from work, she is bothered by a crack in the sidewalk. Colin happens upon her and she struggles to respond when he talks to her. He drives her home and tries to kiss her several times but she pulls away, running upstairs and vigorously brushing her teeth before weeping. That night Helen questions Carol for throwing away Michael's belongings. At the manicure salon, Carol becomes increasingly distant, barely talking to her coworkers and customers, so much so that her boss decides to send her home for the day. After Helen and Michael leave for Italy on holiday, Carol is left alone in the apartment. At home, Carol takes a rabbit out of the fridge for dinner. Instead of cooking it, she is distracted by a number of Michael's possessions left around the apartment, including a used article of his clothing, which she smells and makes her vomit. After trying on one of her sister's dresses, she sees a dark figure in the mirror. That night, she hears footsteps outside her bedroom. Her isolation begins to take its toll on her. One morning she runs a bath and walks away, causing it to overflow. As she turns on a light, the wall cracks open. She locks herself in her room and again hears footsteps. This time, she hallucinates that a man breaks into her room and rapes her. She is awoken in the hallway by a phone call from Colin but she hangs up. Carol misses three days of work. As she is giving a manicure, she stabs her client in the finger and is sent home early. The uncooked rabbit's head is in her purse. At the apartment, she looks at an old family photo and the wall behind the photograph shatters like a mirror. After continuously being ignored, Colin shows up at her apartment. She refuses to open the door so he breaks in. He declares his love for her, and she responds by clubbing him to death with a candlestick. She cleans the blood, barricades the door, and places Colin's corpse in the bathtub. In bed, she goes through the same rape hallucination. She wakes up the next morning, naked on the floor. Later, she walks down the dark hallway of her apartment where hands appear out of the walls and grab her. Later, the angry wife of Michael calls looking for Helen, causing Carol to cut the wire of the telephone. The landlord comes looking for the rent. After he is unable to get in due to the barricade, he breaks into the apartment and sees Carol. She pays him the rent, but he is disgusted by the state of the apartment. He sees the uncooked rabbit, still sitting out, rotting. He propositions her, offering to forget about the rent, and makes an aggressive pass at her but she hacks him to death with Michael's straight razor. She then sinks deeper into hallucination. When Helen and Michael arrive home, Helen is dismayed at the state of the place. Michael happens on Helen hyperventilating and finds Colin's dead body in the bath. Helen finds Carol under her bed in a catatonic state. Her neighbors flood in as Michael picks her up and carries her out, smiling. The final scene pans over items in the apartment, settling on a family photo showing Carol as a child, blankly staring down an older man we can assume is her father, while others in the photo smile for the camera.

Deciding not to return to communist Poland, nor his birthplace of Paris, he had finally decided to move to London. Here he's stated \\"Repulsion was my discovery of London. I was suddenly overwhelmed by the Anglo-Saxon world: language, objects, sets, people. It was new to me and I was tremendously inspired.\\" The story for Repulsion was conceived by Polanski and G√©rard Brach, who wrote an outline of the script in Paris. They had originally planned on making another film, but the production house wanted to make something that would be a little more commercial. And so the screenplay for a horror film about a woman's psychological paranoia of men was written. According to Polanski, the film was shot on a modest budget of ¬£65,000. To finance the film, Polanski and producer Gene Gutowski approached Paramount Pictures and British Lion Films, but both companies refused. Eventually, Polanski and Gutowski signed a contract with Compton Pictures, a small distribution company that had been known primarily for its distribution of softcore pornography films. The film would be a challenge, as Roman Polanski didn't know London very well, and could barely speak English. The main actress was French, so neither the director, nor actress spoke English. He had asked his producer Gene Gutowski where he thought these characters would live? To which he replied \\"South Kensington\\", which would wind up being the location for the film. The film was shot in black and white by Gilbert Taylor, who had recently worked on Dr. Strangelove and A Hard Day's Night. Taylor photographed the apartments of female friends in Kensington for inspiration.  Soundtrack  The film was scored by Chico Hamilton. The official \\"soundtrack\\" was issued on CD in 2008 by British label Harkit, which specialized in British soundtracks from the 60s. The original music was made on a vinyl issued by the Italian label CAM. Some songs on the soundtrack, are not even heard in the film, such as \\"Seduction in the Dark\\" and \\"Repulsion Nocturne.\\" The main track from the film is called \\"Carol's Walk\\". The song also features on Hamilton's album Chic Chic Chico. Themes and style The film is unusual for being a scary movie that features a female killer. It explores the repulsion Carol feels about human sexuality in general and her suitors' pursuit of her in particular. It has been suggested that the film hints that her father may have sexually abused her as a child, which is the basis of her neuroses and breakdown. Other critics have noted Carol's repeated usage of items related to her sister's boyfriend Michael, as well as noting that his presence greatly provokes Carol at the beginning of the film. The film also approaches the theme of boundary breaking, with Tamar McDonald stating that she saw Carol as refusing to conform to the expected \\"path of femininity\\". It increasingly adopts the perspective of its protagonist. The dream sequences are particularly intense. Repulsion was the first installment in Polanski's \\"Apartment Trilogy\\", followed by Rosemary's Baby (1968) and The Tenant (1976), both of which are horror films that also take place primarily inside apartment buildings. Reception =Critical response= Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times gave the film a positive review stating, \\"An absolute knockout of a movie in the psychological horror line has been accomplished by Roman Polanski in his first English-language film.\\" Jim Emerson, filling in for Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, included the film in his list entitled \\"102 Movies You Must See Before...\\". Upon the film's release to DVD, Dave Kehr reviewed the film for The New York Times praising the film's techniques and themes, saying, \\"Mr. Polanski uses slow camera movements, a soundtrack carefully composed of distracting, repetitive noises (clocks ticking, bells ringing, hearts thumping) and, once Carol barricades herself in the cramped, dark apartment, explicitly expressionistic effects (cracks suddenly ripping through walls, rough hands reaching out of the darkness to grope her) to depict a plausible schizophrenic episode.\\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 95% of 64 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 8.87/10. The consensus states \\"Roman Polanski's first English film follows a schizophrenic woman's descent into madness, and makes the audience feel as claustrophobic as the character.\\" As of June 2019, the film is number 52 on Rotten Tomatoes' list of best rated films. Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 91 based on 8 reviews. =Accolades= At the 15th Berlin International Film Festival in 1965, Repulsion won both the FIPRESCI Prize and the Silver Berlin Bear- Extraordinary Jury Prize. The film was also nominated for a BAFTA in Best Black and White Cinematography. Home media In 2009, the film was released as part of The Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray. Both releases contain two documentary featurettes, audio commentary by Roman Polanski and Catherine Deneuve, original trailers, and a 16-page booklet.

He moved to Beijing in 1990 to become political commissar of the 16th Group Army, later serving as editor of the PLA's flagship newspaper, the PLA Daily. In 1996 Xu became political commissar of the Jinan Military Region. He became Vice-Chairman of the CMC in September 2004. He retired from office in March 2013. Xu was detained and put under investigation on suspicion of bribery in March 2014, in one of the highest profile corruption investigations in PLA history, and was expelled from the Communist Party in June 2014.For other cases of high-level corruption see Xu accumulated massive wealth by routinely demanding large bribes for the promotion of officers under him during his time as Vice-Chairman of the CMC. Xu was undergoing legal proceedings and facing a court martial but charges were dropped after he died of bladder cancer in March 2015. Early life and education Xu was born in 1943 to a working-class family in the town of Wafangdian, Liaoning province; his parents were factory workers. He attended No. 8 Middle School in present-day Dalian. He achieved high scores on his Gaokao exams and was admitted to the elite Harbin Military Engineering Institute in Harbin, where he studied electrical engineering. The institute was a feeder school for the army, and produced many graduates who later went on to become high-ranking officers in the PLA. In April 1966, just prior to the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Xu Caihou, along with all the students attending the institute, were mandated by the government to leave the military to take on civilian jobs. Xu graduated in 1968, in the midst of the Cultural Revolution, and was sent to the countryside to perform manual agricultural labour for over a year on a military-run farm in Tangyuan County in China's northeastern hinterlands. Subsequently, due to his being of proletarian class background (his parents were factory workers), he was allowed the 'privilege' of re-joining the army. Xu enlisted in the spring of 1970 as an officer cadet and was stationed in Jilin province. After joining the officer corps, it took him four years to earn his first promotion. Career After the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was eager to promote young university graduates as part of his military-reform program. Most of the commanding officers of the PLA at the time had only informal or middle school-level education. Beginning in 1982, Xu earned a series of quick promotions. Xu served in Jilin province for much of his early career, generally in roles that facilitated military-political relations. Xu became the political commissar of the 16th Group Army in 1990 and was promoted to major general shortly thereafter. In an incident upon moving to Beijing for work, Xu was offered an air conditioner to cope with the city's summer heat, as a gift from a classmate in university. He reportedly refused the offer, on the grounds that he did not want to have a privilege that his superior officer, who was managing without an air conditioner, lacked. Next, Xu served as the chief editor of the People's Liberation Army Daily newspaper; he stayed on the role for just over a year, being promoted again to lieutenant general in the process. In 1996, he became the political commissar of the Jinan Military Region, with a vast area of jurisdiction over military units in several eastern Chinese provinces. Xu's mission in facilitating \\"political affairs\\" in the military meant that, in practice, he was in charge of the promotion and performance evaluation of army officers. =Central Military Commission= Xu Caihou met U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2009. In 1999, Xu was promoted to the rank of General (Shang Jiang), the highest non- wartime rank in the PLA, and also joined the Central Military Commission, in addition to taking charge of the General Political Department (GPD) as its executive deputy head. In December 2000 he was named the head of the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Central Military Commission, the military's anti-graft and disciplinary enforcement body. Xu's ascendancy in the military also resulted in his rise in the Communist Party's political hierarchy. In November 2002, he assumed full leadership over the GPD. At the party's 16th National Congress, Xu became a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China, a body in charge of the implementation of party policy. Xu's rapid promotions at around the turn of the century were attributed to the support given to him by then-Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin. Observers believe that through Xu, Jiang continued to influence affairs in the military despite his official retirement in 2004; some retired officers simply described Xu and his partner of equal rank Guo Boxiong as \\"Jiang's proxy in the military.\\" During his term as Central Military Commission Vice-Chairman, beginning in 2004, Xu wielded significant authority over personnel decisions in the upper echelons of the military. Xu was seen by some observers as the day-to-day executive authority in the upper military ranks because CPC General Secretary and Central Military Chairman Hu Jintao, nominally Xu's superior, took a relatively hands-off approach to military affairs. In 2007, he was named to the 25-member Politburo, being elected at the 1st Plenary Session of the 17th Central Committee. Xu retired from the Central Military Commission in 2013. Corruption allegations According to numerous reports in Chinese and international media, the practice of exchanging \\"cash for ranks\\" was widespread during Xu's term as Vice- Chairman; the practice was ostensibly common from the highest-ranking officers to the rank-and-file petty officers. According to sources in the army, Xu's power during his CMC Vice-Chairmanship was largely unchecked, they cited an example where one officer attempted to bribe Xu with ten million yuan to secure a higher rank, another officer 'outbid' the first one with twenty million yuan (~$3.2 million), so Xu annulled the arrangement with the first officer. Other accusations suggested that during Xu's term in office, an implicit set of prices were attached to each rank in the army as well as other 'privileges' such as party membership. It was reported in March 2014 that Xu, then aged 70, had been diagnosed with bladder cancer and was undergoing extensive treatment at the 301 Military Hospital in Beijing. A corruption probe was opened at around the same time. There was speculation among some in the military that Xu would be 'spared' charges due to his ill-health. Gu Junshan, one of Xu's allegedly favorite officers, who was promoted during Xu's years in office, had already been under investigation for a wide-reaching corruption scandal involving the military's real estate assets. Xu's supporters, pleading for clemency, said that having terminal cancer was akin to having already received the \\"death penalty,\\" citing the precedent of former Vice-Premier Huang Ju as a case where corruption charges should not be pressed against an official in ill-health. The decision to investigate Xu was reportedly made on 15 March 2014, when Xu was taken from his hospital bed by armed policemen. His wife, daughter and former secretary were also reportedly taken into custody. At a Chinese New Year gala for retired military officials in 2014, Xu reportedly tried to speak to Xi Jinping, who is the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, several times, without success. =Expulsion from the party= Xu was expelled from the Communist Party of China on 30 June 2014. State media described Xu's crimes as abuse of power, accepting bribes directly or via family members in exchange for promotions, and advancing the interests of those close to him through the powers vested in his office. Xu's downfall was unexpected because corruption investigations involving mid-tier military officers are rarely publicly announced in the People's Republic of China as to not compromise national security. Such an announcement involving a high-ranking general was entirely unprecedented. Xu became the highest-ranked officer in the history of the People's Liberation Army to be investigated in corruption. During the investigation into Xu, investigators found over one tonne of cash in his Beijing home, along with precious gems, ancient artifacts, and artwork. It was said that much of the cash was still stowed away neatly in boxes marked with the names of individual officers, and that it took 12 trucks to transport all the materials confiscated from his home. Some analysts believe that Xu's downfall signaled a consolidation of military power directly under the hands of Xi Jinping and is of greater political significance than the corruption investigation surrounding Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee. His downfall had been presented by the Communist Party as part of a wider campaign by Xi Jinping to eradicate corruption and reform the military. In October 2014, Xu was reported to have confessed to taking bribes, becoming the highest-profile figure in China's military to be caught up in Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign.\\"China's biggest 'military tiger' Xu Caihou confesses to taking bribes\\", by Paul Armstrong and Steven Jiang, CNN, 29 October 2014 Death Xu died on March 15, 2015 from bladder cancer and multiple organ failure at the 301 Military Hospital in Beijing at the age of 71, likely during the annual \\"two sessions\\" (Lianghui) meeting of China's legislature and legislative advisory body. There is some speculation that his death was not announced until the conclusion of Lianghui on 15 March to avoid distracting from the proceedings of the nation's pre-eminent annual political gathering. As a result of his death, military prosecutors announced that, \\"in accordance with legal procedures,\\" they will not continue to pursue charges against him, despite having already filed suit in military court, but will continue work in investigating his \\"ill-gotten gains\\".

It is located to the north of Vaduz, the capital, in the central part of the country. it has a population of 6,039https://www.llv.li/files/as/bevolkerungsstatistik-30-juni-2017.pdf making it the most populous administrative district in Liechtenstein, representing an important traffic hub and industrial location of the country. Schaan covers an area of , including mountains and forest. It is a municipality within the electoral district of Oberland in the Principality of Liechtenstein. Schaan has four enclaves, two of which belonging to Vaduz and Planken. History Recent archaeological finds have shown that Schaan has been inhabited for over 6000 years: In the year 15 BC, The Romans conquered, under Augustus, the territory of the present Principality of Liechtenstein and built the Roman province of Raetia. In the 1st century AD, a Military Highway from Milan- Bregenz was created, which ran along the Luzisteig along the right bank of the Rhine, leading to the building of settlements in modern-day Schaan. Also from the 1st century AD are two Roman legionnaire's helmets, which were found in 1887 during digging work above Dux and probably as dedications of the two Roman legionaries Publius Cavidius Felix and Numerius Pomponius, whose names are engraved on the helmets, buried here. They are now housed in the museums of Bregenz and Zurich. The most important Roman building on the municipal land is a fort built in the valley, which was built to protect against the ever more frequent Alemannic invasions. Remains of its foundations and the gate tower are again visible from St. Peter's Church, Schaan. A baptistery from the 5th century, which was found during excavations inside this church, suggests an early Christianization. During excavations, there were also older traces of settlement from prehistoric times. The Alemannic settlement document numerous grave finds. At that time Schaan consisted of two separate parts: The Romanized R√§ter-people had their centre at St. Peter, while the Alemannic population settled in the area of Specki. This dichotomy can still be seen today in the existence of two alpine cooperatives, the North-Alemannic cooperative Gritsch and the southern Rhaeto-Romanian cooperative Guschg. Geography Schaan is the northernmost municipality in the Liechtenstein Oberland. It is bordered to the south by the capital, Vaduz, to the east by Planken and Triesenberg, and to the north by the municipalities of Eschen and Gamprin. In the west, the Rhine forms the natural border with Switzerland, and in the east, the town is dominated by the Three Sisters mountain range. Schaan also has four exclaves within other municipalities, and two enclaves within its municipality. Climate Education There are four kindergarten sites: Malarsch, Pardiel, Rebera, and Werkof.

Prince Edward returned to Aquitaine, where he made himself unpopular with the nobility by levying taxes to pay for his Spanish expedition. John Devereux was fighting again beside him in Gascony (1368) when the province rose in revolt against the Prince, and was present in September 1370 when Edward besieged the city of Limoges and massacred 3,000 inhabitants at its fall.

It is situated in the South Staffordshire district, approximately two miles west of the West Midlands conurbation and the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. Population details for the 2011 census can be found under Kinver. There are a small number of predominantly older scattered houses in it, as well as marina off the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. There is no nucleated village. More built-up nearby areas include Kingswinford, Stourbridge, Kinver and Wolverhampton. The nearest public amenities are approximately one mile away in Wall Heath village. Wooded Pool near Ashwood, Staffordshire History Ashwood was formerly an area of medieval woodland and later heathland, bounded by the Smestow Brook, the River Stour, and cultivated lands in Kingswinford. It was one of the medieval hays (enclosures) of Kinver Forest. It was managed by a bailiff, who had a small farm at Prestwood by the service of keeping the hay. The hay stretched north to Wall Heath and east into what is now part of the built up area of Kingswinford and Wordsley. Domesday Book records it as the manor of Haswic, which was waste on account of the forest. Previously there had been a village in a manor belonging to the priests of Wolverhampton. This may in turn have succeeded a Roman settlement, occupying the site of Greensforge Roman fort. The heath was inclosed mainly as three open fields in the 1680s, on the basis of long leases granted to the commoners, and again by Act of Parliament (Parliamentary inclosure) when the leases expired in the 1780s. The whole of Ashwood was then part of Kingswinford parish, but the rural part of it was transferred to Kinver parish in the 1930s, when the rest of Kingswinford was transferred to Brierley Hill Urban District. The marina occupies the site of Flatheridge pool. It was made as a canal basin, where coal brought down a railway from Pensnett could be loaded into canal barges.

The district was built to accommodate the needs of travelers and visitors to the shrine. It eventually evolved to become one of the most exclusive and well-known geisha districts in all of Japan. The term Gion is related to Jetavana. The geisha in Kyoto do not refer to themselves as geisha; instead, they use the local term geiko. While the term geisha means \\"artist\\" or \\"person of the arts\\", the more direct term geiko means essentially \\"a woman of art\\". Divisions Shirakawa Canal in the Gion district, showing the rear of some ochaya This neighborhood in Kyoto houses two hanamachi, or geiko districts: Gion Kobu (Á•áÂúíÁî≤ÈÉ®) and Gion Higashi (Á•áÂúíÊù±). The two were originally the same district but split many years ago. Gion Kobu is larger, occupying most of the district including the famous street Hanamikoji, while Gion Higashi is smaller and occupies the northeast corner, centered on its rehearsal hall. Despite the considerable decline in the number of geisha in Gion in the last one hundred years, the area is still famous for the preservation of forms of traditional architecture and entertainment. A typical kaiseki restaurant in Gion Part of this district has been declared a national historical preservation district. Recently, the City of Kyoto completed a project to restore the streets of Gion, which included such plans as moving all overhead utilities underground as part of the ongoing effort to preserve the original beauty of Gion. Entertainment =Teahouses= Gion remains dotted with old-style Japanese houses called machiya, which roughly translated means \\"townhouse\\", some of which are ochaya or \\"tea houses\\". These are traditional establishments where the patrons of Gion‚Äîfrom the samurai of old to modern-day businessmen‚Äîhave been entertained by geiko in an exclusive manner for centuries. Inside the ochaya is a private and closed world where the evening's entertainment may include cocktails, conversation, and games as well as traditional Japanese music, singing and dancing. To this day, geiko and maiko (geisha in training) in full regalia can still be seen in the evenings as they move about through the streets of Gion to and from their various engagements at the ochaya. They dance and sing and they entertain for everyone. =Other= There are also many modern entertainment establishments in Gion ‚Äì restaurants of all types, bars, clubs, pachinko, off-track betting, and a very large number of tourist-oriented establishments, particularly along Shij≈ç Street; the region is both a major tourist hub, and a popular nightlife spot for locals. Streets vary dramatically in character, and quiet traditional streets abut modern ones. Among the traditional streets, and environs is a major preserved street. It ranges from Shij≈ç Street at the north end, anchored by the famous Ichiriki Tei, and running south to the major temple of Kennin- ji. The stretch of the Shirakawa River before it enters the Kamo river is also a popular preserved area. It is lined on the south side with traditional establishments which directly abut the river, and some are accessed by crossing bridges from the north side. The north side was previously also lined with buildings, but these were torn down in World War II as a fire-prevention measure, and the section is now primarily a pedestrian street, lined with cherry blossoms. These are lit up in the evening in the spring, and the area is active year-round. Annual events Miyako Odori The geiko and maiko of Gion perform annual public dances, as do those of all five geisha districts in Kyoto. The oldest of these date to the Kyoto exhibition of 1872. The more popular of these is the Miyako Odori, literally \\"Dances of the Old Capital\\" (sometimes instead referred to as \\"Cherry Blossom Dances\\"), staged by the geisha of Gion Kobu, which dates to 1872. The dances run from April 1 through April 30 each year during the height of the cherry blossom (sakura) season. Spectators from Japan and worldwide attend the events, which range from \\"cheap\\" seats on tatami mats on the floor, to reserved seats with a small tea ceremony beforehand. Gion Higashi holds a similar dance in early November, around autumn leaves, known as Gion Odori; this is more recent and has fewer performances.

It is along the Maritsa River in the Thrace region, close to the provincial capital, Haskovo. Dimitrovgrad had a population of 38,015 (2011) and is the administrative centre of Dimitrovgrad Municipality. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009 ‚ÄûWorldCityPopulation‚Äú‚Äûpop-stat.mashke.org‚Äú Founded in 1947, Dimitrovgrad is a planned city built by the People's Republic of Bulgaria following World War II. The recently established communist government designed the town as a socialist model city and a modern industrial center. Dimitrovgrad is named for the first communist leader of Bulgaria, Georgi Dimitrov. History Dimitrovgrad was planned by the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the communist state that came to power following World War II. Construction of the city began on May 10, 1947, with most of the labor provided by youth volunteers who arrived from around Bulgaria. The establishment of Dimitrovgrad was officially announced on 2 September 1947, by Georgi Dimitrov, the leader of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The three villages of Rakovski, Mariyno and Chernokonyovo were merged to form Dimitrovgrad. Construction of the town continued intensively for several more years. The main practical reason behind the new city was to create a modern industrial centre for Bulgaria. there was also an ideological foundation for building it. The widespread destruction in Eastern Europe caused by World War II and the rise of Soviet-backed communist states in the region (known as the Eastern Bloc) lead to numerous cities being built or rebuilt using new socialist planning styles. The original buildings in Dimitrovgrad were built in architectural styles popularly known as \\"Soviet Empire\\" or \\"Stalin Baroque\\", with facades of the earliest often monumental, with plinths, large columns and small decorative balconies. Over time, as the town expanded, buildings were built featuring less ornamentation in the newer Modernist architectural style. In 1970, the first celebration of the national poetry festival 'Penio Penev' took place, and that tradition continues to the present. In 1980, the biennial Bulgarian theatrical poster was held for the first time. In 1987, the museum house Penio Penev was opened. The Courts of Justice in Dimitrovgrad. Penio Penev Park. In 1992, shortly after the collapse of communism in Bulgaria, the monument to Georgi Dimitrov was removed by the authorities. This move proved very unpopular with the local residents, and in 2012 a plan was adopted by Dimitrovgrad city council to restore the statue and re-mount it by 2013. http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2012/06/29/1856367_dimitrovgrad_vrushta_pametnika_na_patrona_si_v_aleia - Restoration of the Georgi Dimitrov monument in Dimitrovgrad] So far this has not happened. Tourism Architecture in Dimitrovgrad is similar to that of the Roman Empire: It has spacious streets and large parks. It is one of the greenest cities in Bulgaria. There are three large parks with about 15 lakes, dozens of species of rare trees, shrubs and flowers, sculptures, gazebos and fountains.  Population  The population of Dimitrovgrad during the first decade after its foundation averaged about 34,000. In the following decades it started growing, mostly because of migrants from rural areas, reaching its peak between 1985 and 1992, when it exceeded 50,000. Since then, particularly during the 1990s, the population declined rapidly due to the poor economic situation in the region that lead to a new migration to the country's capital Sofia and abroad.

Life H. S. Hoff (William Cooper) was born in Crewe, the son of elementary school teachers,Shrapnel, Norman, \\"Novelist who depicted the mysteriousness of ordinary people through a naturalistic eye\\", Obituary,The Guardian, London, 6 September 2002. and read natural sciences at Christ's College, Cambridge. After graduating in 1933 he was a teacher in Leicester, an experience on which he seems to have drawn for his novel, Scenes from Provincial Life. Hoff served in the Signals Branch of the Royal Air Force in World War II, and later became a civil servant, associating closely with C. P. Snow, who appears in light disguise as Robert in Scenes from Provincial Life and its sequels. Amongst his appointments he worked for the UK Atomic Energy Authority and the Crown Agents. After retiring he held an academic position with Syracuse University, New York, lecturing on English literature to its students in London. Hoff wrote four novels between 1934 and 1946 under his own name but made his reputation with his first novel under the pen name William Cooper (used from then on), Scenes from Provincial Life (1950), the first of five more or less autobiographical novels published over the ensuing half century. It was hailed at once by writers such as Kingsley Amis, Anthony Burgess and John Braine who wrote: \\"This book was for me ‚Äì and I suspect many others ‚Äì- a seminal influence\\"Bradbury, Malcolm, Introduction to Scenes from Provincial Life, London: Macmillan, 1969. Deceptively simple in style and both comic and lyrical in tone, the novel tells of events in the lives of its narrator, Joe Lunn, a grammar school physics teacher; his girlfriend Myrtle, who wants him to marry her; his friend Tom, with whom he plans to emigrate to the USA; and various other characters in an English provincial town in the spring and summer of 1939. The novel's naturalism was a conscious rejection of the earlier modernist tradition of the English novel, which Hoff called the \\"Art Novel\\". Malcolm Bradbury wrote of it that 'a good part of the literary styles and temper of the 1950s was set by this book.' There followed, in order of writing, Scenes from Metropolitan Life, Scenes from Married Life (1961), Scenes from Later Life (1983) and Scenes from Death and Life (1999). Scenes from Metropolitan Life, although written in the mid-50s, remained unpublished until 1982, for legal reasons: the real-life prototype for the character of Myrtle, central to the novel, had threatened to sue if it were published. Scenes from Death and Life, his last published work, was turned down by Hoff's publisher Macmillan and was issued by a small independent company. Hoff wrote 17 novels in all as well as short stories, two plays and a biography of his friend C. P. Snow. In 1971 he published an account of the trial of the two Hosein brothers, found guilty in 1970 of the kidnapping and murder of Muriel McKay, whom they had abducted in the belief that she was the wife of Rupert Murdoch. His fictional works were invariably optimistic and often outright comic, but with an understated sympathy for those dealing with the problems of ordinary life. He had a straightforward and uncensorious attitude to the sex lives of his characters and a respect for the young, which gave even his later novels a freshness and a contemporary resonance. In 1951 Hoff married Joyce Harris, the model for the central character of Scenes from Married Life, who died in 1988. They had two daughters. Works Hi Novels *Trina (as H. S.

Etymology  The word pinnace, and similar words in many languages (as far afield as Indonesia, where the boat \\"pinisi\\" took its name from the Dutch pinasSailing the Asian Seas - Phinisi Schooners - Part 2 ), came ultimately from the Spanish pinaza c. 1240, from pino (pine tree), from the wood of which the ships were constructed. The word came into English from the Middle French pinasse.Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed, \\"pinnace\\" Design \\"The pinnace is perhaps the most confusing of all the early seventeenth-century types of vessels. Pinnace was more of a use than a type name, for almost any vessel could have been a pinnace or tender to a larger one. Generally speaking, pinnaces were lightly built, single-decked, square-sterned vessels suitable for exploring, trading, and light naval duties. On equal lengths, pinnaces tended to be narrower than other types. Although primarily sailing vessels, many pinnaces carried sweeps for moving in calms or around harbors.\\"Some Seventeenth-Century Vessels and the Sparrow-Hawk (1980) Accessed 2017-01-22 The rigs of pinnaces included the single-masted fore-and-aft rig with staysail and sprit mainsail to the mizzenmast, and a square sprit-sail under the bowsprit. Open square-sterned pulling boats were also called pinnaces at least as early as 1626. The larger pinnace 'type' was often much larger than the smaller tender type, and frequently carried enough cannon to be considered an (armed) merchantman, or fast and maneuverable small warship.  Pinnaces  The English pinnace Sunne was the first vessel reported built at the Chatham Dockyard, in 1586. English pinnaces of the time were typically of around 100 tons, and carried 5 to 16 guns.Royal Navy Ships, built Woolwich 1513‚Äì1869. Pt 1 1513‚Äì1699. The Dutch built pinnaces during the early 17th century. Dutch pinnaces had a hull form resembling a small race- built galleon and usually rigged as a ship (square rigged on three masts), or carrying a similar rig on two masts (in a fashion akin to the later \\"brig\\"). Pinnaces were used as fast merchant vessels, pirate vessels and small warships. Not all were small vessels, some being nearer to larger ships in tonnage. This type saw widespread use in northern waters, as they had a shallow draught. In 2009 the wreck of an English pinnace with a set of twelve matched cannon was discovered, the first of its type for the time. Vessels at that time typically carried a mixture of unmatched cannon using disparate ammunition. The matched armament is considered revolutionary, and a contributing factor to the deadly reputation of the English naval artillery.

Vultan is the ruler of the Winged Bird-Men, a race of flying extraterrestrials who dwell in Sky City, a metropolis that floats in the sky. He fits the archetype of the Viking: strong, hearty, and with a great appetite for life, food, drink, and women (particularly Flash's girlfriend, Dale Arden). In the comics Prince Vultan is introduced as a reluctant ally of main villain Ming the Merciless; he resents Ming's domination but does not oppose it out of fear of reprisal. However, after Flash and Dr. Zarkov save his city, he reforms into one of Flash Gordon's greatest allies. In the original comic, he has several wives, one of whom tries to kill Dale, as she is jealous of her. He claims to have become King of Sky City after winning one of the Tournaments of Mongo. When Ming tries to kidnap Flash, Vultan calls for a Tournament of Mongo. It is revealed that, along with Ming and King Jugrid of the Lion Men, he is one of the three most powerful rulers on Mongo. When Flash takes over the unconquered Kingdom of Caves, Vultan sends a party of Hawkmen under Captain Khan to help Flash conquer his Kingdom. The Hawkmen later come into conflict with Queen Azura and her Blue Magic Men. The image of the Hawkmen descending to attack Azura's army (from the June 16, 1935 storyline) is one of the most reproduced scenes from the Flash Gordon strip. Vultan and the other Hawkmen provoked some controversy at the time of publication. Some Christian leaders regarded the characters as blasphemous because they resembled angels. In other media In the 1936 film serial, he was portrayed by Jack Lipson (1901-1947). Allan Melvin provided Vultan's voice in the 1979 Filmation animated series. He is referred to here as King Vultan, not Prince. His Sky City is a marvel of Mongo technology, as the massive construct is suspended miles above ground by beams of polarized anti-gravity light. Unlike Prince Barin's kingdom of Arboria, Vultan's Hawkmen do not make use of airships in battle. Instead, they fly under their own power or ride giant warbirds armed with harness-mounted energy cannons. He was portrayed by Brian Blessed in the cult 1980 film Flash Gordon. For the film's soundtrack by the rock group Queen, Freddie Mercury composed a song called \\"Vultan's Theme\\". At the end, he is appointed the General of the Armies when Prince Barin is revealed as the rightful ruler of Mongo. In the 1996 Flash Gordon animated series, Vultan is a somewhat conservative leader, and reluctant to act against Ming for fear of reprisals against his people. His role as Flash's ally is taken by his teenage son, Prince Talon. In the 2007 television series, Vultan appears as the leaders of a group of nomadic mercenaries called Dactyls (a variation of the Hawkmen). In the episode, Ascension, Vultan travels to Earth, using Princess Aura's rift key. He kidnaps a teenage boy who he claims is his son. He is played by Ty Olsson. In a 2008 episode of the animated sitcom Family Guy called \\"Road to Germany\\", Brian, Stewie and Mort enlist the help of Vultan's Hawkman Army in a dogfight over Europe against the Luftwaffe. Blessed returns to voice Vultan briefly during the episode.

Like Double Data-Rate (DDR) SDRAM, QDR SRAM transfers data on both rising and falling edges of the clock signal. The main purpose of this capability is to enable reads and writes to occur at high clock frequencies without the loss of bandwidth due to bus-turnaround cycles incurred in DDR SRAM. QDR SRAM uses two clocks, one for read data and one for write data and has separate read and write data buses (also known as Separate I/O), whereas DDR SRAM uses a single clock and has a single common data bus used for both reads and writes (also known as Common I/O). This helps to eliminate problems caused by the propagation delay of the clock wiring, and allows the illusion of concurrent reads and writes (as seen on the bus, although internally the memory still has a conventional single port - operations are pipelined but sequential). When all data I/O signals are accounted, QDR SRAM is not 2x faster than DDR SRAM but is 100% efficient when reads and writes are interleaved. In contrast, DDR SRAM is most efficient when only one request type is continually repeated, e.g. only read cycles. When write cycles are interleaved with read cycles, one or more cycles are lost for bus turnaround to avoid data contention, hence bus efficiency is reduced. Most SRAM manufacturers constructed QDR and DDR SRAM using the same physical silicon, differentiated by a post-manufacturing selection (e.g. blowing a fuse on chip).(citation needed) QDR SRAM was designed for high-speed communications and networking applications, where data throughput is more important than cost, power efficiency or density. The technology was created by Micron and Cypress, later followed by IDT, then NEC, Samsung and Renesas.

The anatomy term \\"epidural space\\" has its origin in the Ancient Greek language; ·ºêœÄŒØ, \\"on, upon\\" + dura mater also known as \\"epidural cavity\\", \\"extradural space\\" or \\"peridural space\\". In humans the epidural space contains lymphatics, spinal nerve roots, loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, small arteries, dural venous sinuses and a network of internal vertebral venous plexuses. Cranial epidural space In the skull, the periosteal layer of the dura mater adheres to the inner surface of the skull bones while the meningeal layer lays over the arachnoid mater. Between them is the cranial epidural space. The two layers of the dura mater separate at several places, with the meningeal layer projecting deeper into the brain parenchyma forming fibrous septa that compartmentalize the brain tissue. At these sites, the epidural space is wide enough to house the epidural venous sinuses. There are four fibrous septa: # Falx cerebri, that separates the left and right hemispheres of the cerebrum. It contains the superior sagittal sinus and inferior sagittal sinus. # Tentorium cerebelli, which separates the cerebrum from cerebellum and contains the transverse sinus, straight sinus and superior petrosal sinus. # Diaphragma sellae, that encloses the hypophyseal fossa from the superior side, cushioning the pituitary gland. It contains the anterior and posterior intercavernous sinuses. # Falx cerebelli, which separates the left and right cerebellar hemispheres and contains the occipital sinus. In pathological conditions fluid such as blood can fill this space. For example a torn meningeal artery (often the middle meningeal artery) or dural venous sinus (rarely) may bleed into this potential space and result in an epidural hematoma.

Tow-in surfing was invented by surfers who wanted to catch big waves and break the barrier. It has been one of the biggest breakthroughs in surfing history. History Tow-in surfing was pioneered by Laird Hamilton, Buzzy Kerbox, Dave Kalama, and others in the mid 1990s. A surfer is towed into a breaking wave by a partner driving a personal watercraft (PWC, commonly known by the brand name Jet Ski) or a helicopter with an attached tow-line. This method has a demonstrated advantage in situations where the wave is too large (such as Peahi off the north side of Maui), or where position on the wave is extremely critical (Teahupoo off southeast Tahiti). The use of a helicopter for tow-in surfing started to appear in the mid 2000s, and has several advantages over the use of a personal watercraft. The pilot, positioned high above the surfer, is able to spot large waves from farther away and position the surfer accordingly. A helicopter can go faster, and is not affected by the ocean surface like a watercraft, but is much more expensive to operate. Before tow-in surfing was created, surfers weren't capable of catching waves that were between tall on their surfboards made for larger waves called ‚Äúguns‚Äù. The biggest wave one could catch before tow-in surfing was in the range. Tow-in surfing is accomplished by taking a personal water craft (PWC) and a tow-rope and combining that with a surfer. One person pulls the surfer out to the break on the PWC. When the waves comes, the person on the PWC tows the surfer via the tow-rope into the wave. Once the surfer is in the wave, the rope is dropped. The surfer is then on their own to surf some of the biggest waves in the world. Differences Tow-in surfing differs from regular surfing in several different ways. First, the waves are much larger; a surfer has to be towed in to the wave, and there is the risk of a wall of water the size of a three story building falling down on them. Laird Hamilton said ‚ÄúThe sensation is a combination of flying, sailing and just going as fast as you've ever been. Really, it‚Äôs just the sensation of speed.‚Äù Controversy Critics of tow-in surfing decry the noise and exhaust fumes made by PWC engines, as well as the likelihood that new participants can get into predicaments that they have not been trained or conditioned to survive. On the other hand, a skilled team of driver and surfer, who often swap roles in the water during a session, develop a rapport and an understanding of ocean conditions that allows them to proactively watch out for each other. Environmentalists and surfing purists have passed a proposal to shut down tow- in surfing at Mavericks in Northern California, saying that is hazardous to local wildlife and a nuisance to residents.Legislation may end tow-in surfing at MavericksLegislation may end tow-in surfing on the monster waves at Maverick's Tow-in surfing can be quite dangerous without proper training. If surfers get caught in a wave, it feels like being hit by a freight train, especially if the waves are between .

Built to counter a group of fast Russian battleships, Albemarle and her sister ships were capable of steaming at , making them the fastest battleships in the world. The Duncan-class battleships were armed with a main battery of four guns and they were broadly similar to the s, though of a slightly reduced displacement and thinner armour layout. As such, they reflected a development of the lighter second-class ships of the . Albemarle was built between her keel laying in January 1900 and her completion in November 1903. Albemarle had a fairly uneventful career. She spent her first years in service with the Mediterranean Fleet from 1903 to 1905, when she was transferred to the Channel Fleet. In 1907, she was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet; in early 1910 she transferred to the Home Fleet, first as part of the 4th Battle Squadron and later the 6th Battle Squadron. She served with the Grand Fleet on the Northern Patrol during the early stages of the First World War. She was later dispatched to Murmansk in Russia for guard and icebreaking duties for most of 1916. On her return to England, she underwent a refit and was in reserve for the remainder of the war. Decommissioned in April 1919, she was scrapped in 1920. Design Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1915 The six ships of the were ordered in response to the Russian s that had been launched in 1898. The Russian ships were fast second-class battleships, so William Henry White, the British Director of Naval Construction, designed the Duncan class to match the purported top speed of the Russian vessels. To achieve the higher speed while keeping displacement from growing, White was forced to reduce the ships' armour protection significantly, effectively making the ships enlarged and improved versions of the s of 1896, rather than derivatives of the more powerful , , and series of first-class battleships. The Duncans proved to be disappointments in service, owing to their reduced defensive characteristics, though they were still markedly superior to the Peresvets they had been built to counter. Albemarle was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The Duncan-class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 720 officers and ratings. The Duncan-class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by 24 Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The Duncan-class ships had a top speed of from . This made Albemarle and her sisters the fastest battleships in the world for several years. At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for . Albemarle had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. Albemarle had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkhead on the aft end of the belt was thick. Her main battery turrets' sides were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12-inch-thick sides. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Operational history =Pre-World War I= HMS Albemarle, named for George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, was laid down on 1 January 1900 at Chatham Dockyard, and launched on 5 March 1901, when Lady Kennedy, wife of Admiral Sir William Kennedy, Commander-in-Chief of the Nore, performed the christening. She was completed in November 1903. Albemarle was commissioned at Chatham Dockyard on 12 November 1903 for service as Flag extra, Rear Admiral, for the second division of the Mediterranean Fleet. In February 1905 she was transferred to the Channel Fleet to serve as 2nd Flagship for the fleet's deputy commander. She was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet on 31 January 1907, serving as 2nd Flagship there as well. Under Captain Robert Falcon Scotts command, she collided with the battleship on 11 February 1907, suffering minor bow damage. In July 1908, Albemarle visited Canada during the Quebec Tercentenary, in company with her sister ships , , and . She became Flagship, Rear Admiral, at Gibraltar in January 1909 and went to Malta for a refit from May through August 1909. Her Atlantic Fleet service ended in February 1910. On 25 February 1910, Albemarle was recommissioned for service in the 3rd Division, Home Fleet, at Portsmouth. She was paid off at Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit on 30 October 1911; the refit lasted from January to December 1912. Her refit complete, Albemarle was recommissioned at Portsmouth to serve in the 4th Battle Squadron in the First Fleet there. On 15 May 1913, she was reduced to a nucleus crew and assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron, Second Fleet, to serve as a gunnery training ship. =World War I= Albemarle in Canada in 1908 When World War I began in August 1914, plans originally called for Albemarle and battleships , , , , , and to form the 6th Battle Squadron and serve in the Channel Fleet, where it was to patrol the English Channel and cover the movement of the British Expeditionary Force to France. However, plans also existed for the 6th Battle Squadron to be assigned to the Grand Fleet, and, when the war began, the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, requested that Albemarle and her four surviving sister ships of the Duncan class (Cornwallis, Duncan, Exmouth, and Russell) be assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet for patrol duties to make up for the Grand Fleet's shortage of cruisers. Accordingly, the 6th Battle Squadron was abolished temporarily, and Albemarle joined the 3rd Battle Squadron at Scapa Flow on 8 August 1914, and worked with Grand Fleet cruisers on the Northern Patrol. Albemarle and her four Duncan-class sisters, as well as the battleships of the , temporarily were transferred to the Channel Fleet on 2 November 1914 to reinforce that fleet in the face of Imperial German Navy activity in the Channel Fleet's area. The following day, the German fleet raided Yarmouth; at the time, Albemarle and the rest of the 3rd Squadron were dispersed on the Northern Patrol, and were thus unavailable during the German attack. On 13 November 1914, the King Edward VII-class ships returned to the Grand Fleet, but Albemarle and the other Duncans stayed in the Channel Fleet, where they reconstituted the 6th Battle Squadron on 14 November 1914. This squadron was given a mission of bombarding German submarine bases on the coast of Belgium, and was based at Portland, although it transferred to Dover immediately on 14 November 1914. However, due to a lack of anti-submarine defenses at Dover, particularly after the harbour's anti-submarine boom was swept away in a gale, the squadron returned to Portland on 19 November 1914. The squadron was intended to guard against an attempt by the German fleet to land an invasion force in Britain. The 6th Battle Squadron returned to Dover in December 1914, then transferred to Sheerness on 30 December 1914 to relieve the 5th Battle Squadron there in guarding against a German invasion of the United Kingdom. Between January and May 1915, the 6th Battle Squadron was dispersed. Albemarle left the squadron in April 1915 and rejoined the 3rd Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet. She underwent a refit at Chatham Dockyard in October 1915. In November 1915, Albemarle was ordered to move to the Mediterranean with a division of the 3rd Battle Squadron that also included the battleships (the flagship), Zealandia, and Russell. The ships left Scapa Flow on 6 November 1915, but encountered extremely heavy weather that night in the Pentland Firth. Albemarle, heavily loaded with spare ammunition, suffered severe damage early on 7 November in the rough seas, having her forward bridge washed away, killing all of her bridge personnel. Her forward superstructure was also badly damaged in the incident. When her repairs were complete in December 1915, Albemarle was ordered to rejoin the Grand Fleet. She thus became the only Duncan-class ship (other than , which had been wrecked before the war) with no wartime Mediterranean service. In January 1916, Albemarle was detached from the Grand Fleet to serve in North Russia at Murmansk as a guard ship and as an icebreaker in the approaches to Arkhangelsk. At Murmansk, she also served as flagship of Senior Naval Officer, Murmansk. Albemarle returned to the United Kingdom in September 1916, paying off at Portsmouth to provide crews for anti-submarine vessels. She began a refit at Liverpool in October 1916, and upon its completion in March 1917 she went into reserve at Devonport Dockyard; her main-deck casemate 6-inch guns were removed and replaced with four 6-inch guns on her battery deck between September 1916 and May 1917. Albemarle was in reserve until April 1919, used as an overflow accommodation ship for the naval barracks at Devonport, and was attached to the Gunnery School in 1919. The ship was placed on the disposal list in April 1919 and on the sale list in August 1919. She was sold for scrapping to Cohen Shipbeaking Company on 19 November 1919 and arrived at Swansea for scrapping in April 1920.

The title character first appeared in Visions #1, a magazine published by the Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1979. Flaming Carrot can be seen as a parody of various aspects of the superhero genre (though his origin story is much the same as that of Don Quixote). Burden refers to the character as \\"the World's first surrealist superhero!\\" Flaming Carrot is often noted for his distinctive exclamation \\"Ut!\\" Flaming Carrot adventures have been published by Aardvark- Vanaheim, Renegade Press, Dark Horse Comics, and Image Comics, among others. He has guest-starred and made cameos in comics published by Fantagraphics, Mirage Studios, Atomeka Press, and others. Concept and themes The Flaming Carrot was in part inspired by the obscure Golden Age character The Fin. Burden recounted that, \\"I took this particular idea and scratched it down one night when I came home about three o'clock in the morning. I'd been out on the town all night, and it was one of those nights when I came home tired, and fell asleep with my clothes on.\\" Asked to explain the meaning of \\"Ut!\\", he stated, Publication history The Flaming Carrot first appeared in Visions #1 (1979), a direct-market magazine published as the program booklet of the Atlanta Fantasy Fair. Flaming Carrot stories went on to appear in each yearly edition of the magazine through 1987. Bob Burden worked as illustrator and writer with Roxanne Starr working as letterer. In 1981 Burden, under the company name Killian Barracks Press, self-published Flaming Carrot Comics #1, an oversized one-shot.Flaming Carrot Comics Killian Barracks Press, 1981 Series at the Grand Comics Database Four- to eight-page Flaming Carrot stories appeared in each subsequent annual issue of Visions through #4 (1982), that last of which contained an apocryphal Flaming Carrot history that convinced Dave Sim, of the self-publishing company Aardvark-Vanaheim, to publish Flaming Carrot as a regular comic, First, however, Sim included back-up stories of the Carrot in the pages of Aardvark-Vanaheim's Cerebus' #61‚Äì62 (cover-dated April‚ÄìMay 1984). The Carrot eventually guest starred in the series proper in Cerebus #104 (Nov. 1987). In the meantime, Aardvark-Vanaheim had published Flaming Carrot #1-5 (May 1984 - Jan. 1985). Flaming Carrot Comics, Aardvark- Vanaheim, 1984 Series at the Grand Comics Database The company also published a 3-D special, A-V In 3-D #1 (Dec. 1984). After Dave Sim and Deni Loubert, the couple behind Aardvark-Vanaheim, divorced, Loubert established Renegade Press to publish all of Aardvark-Vanaheim's former titles apart from Cerebus. Flaming Carrot was one of these, and remained with Renegade until the publisher went bankrupt in 1988. Renegade published issues #6-17 (March 1985 - July 1987).Flaming Carrot Comics, Renegade Press, 1985 Series at the Grand Comics Database Burden also published a short Flaming Carrot piece in the Fantagraphics anthology Anything Goes! (Oct. 1986). After Renegade, Burden took Flaming Carrot to Dark Horse Comics, which published 14 more issues of Flaming Carrot, #18-31 (June 1988 to Oct. 1994).Flaming Carrot Comics, Dark Horse, 1988 Series at the Grand Comics Database Dark Horse also published Flaming Carrot stories in its anthology Dark Horse Presents #20 (Aug. 1988) and its annual anthology San Diego Comic Con Comics #1. Following issue #31 in 1994, the character appeared only sporadically in one-shots over the next decade. In winter 1994, Dark Horse published Flaming Carrot Stories No. 1, referred to on the cover as a \\"Text Version of Future Issue\\", although a standard pictorial comic version did not later appear. From 1997-1998, the company published four volumes of the Flaming Carrot Comics Collected Album, which was the first time the series had been reprinted, and the 64-page \\"Flaming Carrot Comics Annual No.1\\", featuring a new story. In 1999, Dark Horse published four issues of the spin-off series \\"Bob Burden's Original Mysterymen Comics\\", which did not feature the Flaming Carrot. In 2002, Dark Horse published the crossover special Flaming Carrot & Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman, listed as Flaming Carrot Comics #32 in the indicia. At times, entire Flaming Carrot storylines would simply be abandoned,Burden, Bob. \\"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,\\" Flaming Carrot #24 (Dark Horse Comics, April 1990). and numerous projects and spin-offs promised in the series various letter pages and \\"Bob Speaks\\" columns never came to fruition.Burden, Bob. \\"Bob Speaks,\\" Flaming Carrot #22 (Dark Horse Comics, June 1989). In 1993‚Äì1994, Mirage Studios published the four-issue series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/ Flaming Carrot Crossover. Burden did not do the art for this series, however. Flaming Carrot was relaunched in 2004 with Image Comics and Desperado Publishing. This series lasted two years, comprising four issues (simultaneously numbered 1-4, and 33-36). The final appearance of Flaming Carrot was the 2006 Photo Comic Special #1, featuring photographs instead of illustration. Burden has not published original comic book work since 2007. Fictional character biography The Flaming Carrot origin states that \\"having read 5,000 comics in a single sitting to win a bet, this poor man suffered brain damage and appeared directly thereafter as‚Äîthe Flaming Carrot!\\"Burden, Bob. \\"When the Shoes Aren't Worth the Shine,\\" Flaming Carrot #7 (May 1985). The Carrot, who lives in Palookaville, a neighborhood of Iron City, Flaming Carrot page at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. from the original on April 16, 2012 has staved off at least three alien invasions, a Communist takeover of Iron City, flying dead dogs, the Man in the Moon, Death itself, and a cloned horde of evil marching Hitler's boots. Possessing no real super powers, the Carrot wins the day through sheer grit, raw determination, blinding stupidity, and bizarre luck. Flaming Carrot even died in #6 (fell into a deep toxic waste pit in Palookaville), was brought back from clinical death in #7, described his sojourn in Limbo in #8 and got back at those who sent him to Limbo in #9. Flaming Carrot was also a founding member of the blue collar superhero group the Mystery Men, introduced in a flashback/dream sequence in Flaming Carrot Comics #16. The story of this group was later made into the 1999 movie Mystery Men and a short-lived spin-off comic book series. The Flaming Carrot himself does not appear in the film, although a handful of characters like Mr. Furious, the Shoveler, and Dr. Heller do.  Powers and abilities  The Carrot wears a costume that consists of a giant carrot mask which extends from above his head to below his crotch, a white shirt, red pants, and flippers on his feet (in case he has to swim). The mask has a continually burning flame at the top and a secret compartment containing a nuclear-powered pogo stick (the mask and the pogo stick were invented by Dr. Heller of the Mystery Men). Flaming Carrot also wears a crime fighting utility belt, but unlike that of Batman, his is filled with Silly Putty, rubber bands, random playing cards, sneezing powder, and other similarly frivolous items (which nonetheless can become lethal weapons in his hands). Dr. Heller upgraded Flaming Carrot's equipment after bringing him back from the clinically dead. The Flaming Carrot also relies heavily on his 9mm Radom pistol to kill his enemies without hesitation. Flaming Carrot is able to go into a self-induced state of \\"Zen Stupidity\\" in order to face danger and evil boldly and without trepidation.Burden, Bob. \\"Bob Speaks!\\", Flaming Carrot #33 (Images/Desperado, December 2004).

Specifications The metallic- blue, tank-like SPV serves as Spectrum's primary armoured interceptor ground vehicle. It is long, weighs eight tons, and has a maximum speed of either on land. It is fitted with five pairs of wheels (the three over the front, middle and rear axles constituting the main drive), with additional traction for mountainous environments provided by rear-mounted, hydraulically-lowered caterpillar tracks. Within the hermetically-sealed control compartment, the driver, co-driver and a passenger are seated backwards, facing the rear, to reduce the possibility of injury in the event of a crash; the driver is aided by a video monitor displaying (vertically-flipped) forward and rear views. It is armed with a front-mounted cannon, housed underneath a fold-away panel, and is also equipped with ejector seats and radar. The hydrogenic power unit can be removed and re-assembled as a personal jet pack, or other devices of comparable size (additional components for which are stored towards the back of the vehicle). SPVs are distributed worldwide and are requisitioned from disguised buildings and other structures, guarded by undercover operatives. A Spectrum agent can access an SPV only upon presenting his or her identification to the relevant authority. SPVs are amphibious, all-terrain vehicles that can be driven in extreme environments as well as in cities. Appearances In the pilot episode, \\"The Mysterons,\\" Captain Blue requisitions an SPV from a gas station, where it is hidden inside a fake truck. The station attendant comments that it must be a challenge to drive backwards. Captain Blue's evident expertise in driving SPVs is revealed in this episode; by contrast, Captain Scarlet himself is only moderately skilled at handling SPVs, as he tends to crash them in several episodes. In \\"Winged Assassin,\\" an SPV is used to take on the DT-19 Stratojet on the runway as its Mysteron controllers try to deliberately crash into the Director General's own airplane. As the Mysterons somehow disable the cannons on the SPV's front (Captain Blue presses the \\"Fire\\" buttons but nothing happens), Captain Scarlet ejects Captain Blue and, in what would normally be a suicidal maneuver, rams the wheels of the DT-19 as it is speeding on the runway to try to stop it. The SPV is then crashed in a tracking station after the DT-19 is thus grounded. In \\"Point 783,\\" an SPV hidden in a shop in a small bazaar in the desert is requisitioned by Captain Scarlet under orders to evacuate the Supreme Commander of Earth Forces from the command outpost under attack by the Mysteron-interfered, virtually indestructible, Unitron tank. Captain Scarlet uses the ejector seats after, whilst being pursued by the Unitron, he and the Commander are at gunpoint from one of the Mysteron-rendered majors assigned to the Commander. The SPV and the Unitron fall off a cliff as the SPV no longer had a driver but the Unitron was homing in on the Mysteron major still inside the vehicle. Surprisingly the shot does not show any substantial damage to the SPV after the plunge (it was still intact although the Mysteron was surely killed) and yet the Unitron that fell on top of it was completely unusable. In \\"Manhunt,\\" Captain Black gives his hostage Symphony Angel a chance to escape by using the SPV he himself had stolen from a gas station. This eventually derails the entire Spectrum operation as all personnel end up following the SPV with Symphony, not Captain Black, at the controls. In this episode Captain Scarlet notes that the village he and Blue passed, Stone Point Village, was aptly named as SPV. When Captain Scarlet pursues a renegade air conditioning maintenance truck under Mysteron controllers intent on destroying key links in the Frost Line Outer Space Missile Defense System in the episode \\"Avalanche\\", the SPV takes a battering after liquid oxygen renders the snowy, icy road too slippery to be safe, causing the SPV to crash in the mountains. Captain Scarlet had no external injuries in the crash. This particular SPV requisitioned by Captain Scarlet and Lieutenant Green was stored in a log cabin under the attendance of a French-Canadian logger and was driven off-road in the snow in a bid to lose some of the distance between it and the truck. In \\"Shadow of Fear,\\" an SPV is stationed outside the K14 Observatory. It does not see any action. When the observatory is blown up the ensuing avalanche purportedly takes the SPV with it. Due to the Himalayan terrain, the SPV's role as an active field vehicle is taken up by aerial vehicles like the Spectrum Helicopter, the Angels, and even Cloudbase itself. Note that the SPV was perfectly functional in \\"Avalanche,\\" which used the same backdrop. In \\"Fire at Rig 15,\\" Scarlet requisitions SPV no. 1034 hidden in an oil storage tank near the Bensheba refinery to seek and destroy Jason Smith's truck filled with explosives. Scarlet cuts across the desert (the same set used for the Unitron at Point 783) and guns the SPV over a ditch and some dunes. He then engages in a high-speed pursuit with Smith, the SPV surviving an explosive strewn by Smith, and then rams the truck off the road. The SPV crashes into an oil storage tank in the perimeter of Bensheba and bursts into flames. In \\"The Trap,\\" SPV A75 is requisitioned by Captain Blue to stop Commodore Goddard's Mysteron likeness from \\"clipping the wings of the world,\\" i.e. assassinating the top ten commanders of Earth's Air Forces. It was housed in a garage hidden by a billboard under the maintenance of the Auld Lang Syne Company. Upon its arrival at Glengarry Castle, Scotland, Captain Scarlet uses its jet pack to hunt down Goddard who was stationed with a machine-gun on the battlements. Once the delegates are free, Blue uses the SPV rockets to destroy Goddard. The SPV does get shot a few times by Goddard, but its bulletproof armor saves Captain Blue. In \\"Model Spy,\\" an SPV is requisitioned by Captain Blue (as Adam Swenson) to hunt down Captain Black and his hostage Henri Verdain. Captain Scarlet (as Paul Metcalfe) is picked up by Captain Blue and both force Black into a tunnel, where he is compelled to dispose of Verdain before making good his escape with his Mysteron powers. The SPV was stored in a hidden garage adjacent to a casino. In \\"Special Assignment,\\" the SPV's function as an assault vehicle (based upon its origins as a modified tank) becomes the focus of the plot. The Mysterons wish to break through security at Nuclear City with an SPV, and are hiring Captain Scarlet, now stripped of his captaincy, to help. Scarlet is actually a double agent working for Spectrum and manages to fool the Mysterons by acquiring and driving the SPV for them. In order not to break his cover, when Scarlet requisitions the SPV, he cannot show his Spectrum ID card and has to knock out the attendant of the gas station where the SPV was stored. Scarlet, to warn the Angels of the status of the SPV without breaking his cover to his Mysteron passengers, causes the SPV to emit black smoke. Scarlet ejects from the SPV and the Angels destroy it before it reaches Nuclear City. In \\"Place of Angels,\\" an SPV is used numerous times by Scarlet and Blue as transport while they are tracking a suspect understood to have a K14 virus on their person. In \\"Expo 2068,\\" an SPV pursues a transporter thought to have a nuclear device. When it is discovered that the device was switched into a freight helicopter of the Seneca Construction Co., the SPV is raced to the site of the Expo. Scarlet uses the SPV's jet pack to reach the helicopter. In \\"Noose of Ice,\\" an SPV is driven to the tritonium mine at the North Pole. When the mine is beginning to collapse because the safety mechanisms have been disabled at a booster station, Scarlet takes the SPV across the frozen turnpike to reach the mine, managing to get clear just before the bridge becomes too unstable and falls apart. In \\"Treble Cross,\\" numerous SPVs are seen trying to stop Captain Black leaving Weston Airfield. In \\"The Inquisition,\\" Captain Scarlet evacuates Captain Blue and, using the SPV rocket, destroys his captors's dummy Cloudbase model where they confused Captain Blue in hopes to gain Spectrum secrets. In \\"Inferno,\\" Captains Scarlet and Blue watch from afar in an SPV as the Najama desalinisation plant where they both were sent with Captains Ochre and Magenta goes up in flames due to a Mysteron-controlled rocket's crash. Background In 2002, series creator Gerry Anderson explained how the vehicle's safety features were borne out of his \\"preoccupation\\" ‚Äì demonstrated in various aspects of Captain Scarlet ‚Äì \\"with things not being what they seemed ...With a flick of a switch the walls of these buildings would collapse to reveal this astonishing vehicle inside. I knew kids would find that exciting.\\" He quickly regretted his decision to make the seats rear-facing, commenting: \\" ... we began to realise that the audience was going to say, 'Why are these people facing backwards?' So we wrote an explanation into the first script. Then I realised that not everyone would have seen that episode so we had to put explanations in again and again.\\" The rear-facing system is well received by commentators Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, who praise Anderson's innovation and credit the feature as a \\"work of genius\\". Several filming models were built. They were either balsa or hardwood and in different scales, the largest being long.Bentley, p. 21. The vehicle was designed by special effects director Derek Meddings on the basis of a brief description given in the Andersons' pilot script, which stated that the SPV had reversed seating (and therefore no windscreen) as well as a \\"lightweight power unit\\".Meddings, p. 90. Noting that the occupants faced backwards and viewed the road through a monitor, Meddings commented that \\"all [this] meant to me was that I could design the vehicle without windows,\\" which were replaced with air vents and grilles for realism.Meddings, p. 95. Meddings also added a shock-absorbent front bumper as well as wheels of various sizes, as he believed that vehicles with more vehicles \\"looked more interesting on screen.\\"Meddings, p. 94. A tail fin was added to fulfil his vision of a \\"menacing, shark-like\\" assault vehicle. Toys and kits Various toy versions of the SPV have been released, including a 1968 die-cast toy by Dinky and newer models by Product Enterprises and Corgi. Dinky's version, which remained on sale until 1975, was its best-selling product of all time and one of the most popular die-cast toys ever made in the UK. Meddings' assistant, Mike Trim, made his own version of the SPV.How to Make Your Own SPV, by David Sisson Reception and influence Andrew Blair of website Den of Geek calls the SPV \\"clearly the best vehicle in the show\\". Comparing it to \\"a tank driven at ludicrous speeds, while facing backwards and located in secret garages around the world\\", he argues that the vehicle represents \\"probably the fastest transformation from covert to ridiculously unsubtle that fiction has ever seen.\\" James Taylor of Car magazine ranks the SPV one of the top 10 vehicles from the Gerry Anderson productions. On the vehicle's design, he comments that \\"all-round visibility [was] clearly not a priority of Captain Scarlet's employers.\\" Writing for TV Zone magazine, Tat Wood questions Spectrum's logic in keeping its SPVs hidden until they are needed (\\"inside caravans, gasometers, tubes of Pringles or wherever\\") given that they are \\"then abandoned on the road\\". The SPV's curved front bumper inspired the rounded edges of LaCie's \\"Rugged\\" external hard drive designed by Neil Poulton. The Rhino In the computer-animated remake series Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet (2005), the successor to the SPV is the Spectrum Rhino. The Rhino is more heavily armed than the SPV, and unlike the original is incapable of travelling on water. Instead of being hidden in safehouses, it is deployed from Skybase via Albatross dropships. The driver of the Rhino adopts a normal driving position, in contrast with his predecessor.

Spencer describes himself as \\"the 'good' kind of Islamophobe\\". His published books include two New York Times bestsellers. In 2003 he founded and has since directed a blog that tracks Islamic extremism known as Jihad Watch. He co-founded the anti- Muslim group Stop Islamization of America (American Freedom Defense Initiative) with blogger Pamela Geller. Reports that two of Spencer's books were listed in FBI training materials and that he had given seminars to various law enforcement units in the United States stirred controversy. He has frequently appeared on Fox News. In 2013 the UK Home Office barred Spencer from travel to the UK for 3 to 5 years for \\"making statements that may foster hatred that might lead to inter-community violence\\". Background Spencer was baptized in the Greek Orthodox Church and joined the Melkite Greek Catholic Church in 1984. In a 2006 interview, Spencer stated that his grandparents were forced to emigrate from an area that is now part of Turkey because they were Christians. According to a 2010 interview in New York magazine, Spencer's father worked for the Voice of America during the Cold War, and in his younger days, Spencer himself worked at Revolution Books, a Maoist bookstore in New York City founded by Robert Avakian. Spencer received an M.A. in 1986 in religious studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His masters thesis was on Catholic history. He has said he has been studying Islamic theology, law, and history since 1980. He worked in think tanks for more than 20 years, and in 2002‚Äì2003 was an adjunct fellow with the Free Congress Foundation. Spencer named Paul Weyrich, also a Melkite Catholic, as a mentor of his writings on Islam. Spencer writes, \\"Paul Weyrich taught me a great deal, by word and by example ‚Äì about how to deal both personally and professionally with the slanders and smears that are a daily aspect of this work.\\" Spencer was criticized by clergy in the Catholic Church because of his views on Islam. He left the church in 2016 to return to the Greek Orthodox Church as a result of \\"personal reflection and historical study\\". Views on Islam Spencer is known for his anti-Muslim views. He describes himself as an Islamophobe of \\"the 'good' kind\\", and comments on radical Islam. Spencer co-founded the anti-Muslim group Stop Islamization of America (also known as the American Freedom Defense Initiative) with Pamela Geller in 2010. The organization is designated as a hate group by the Anti- Defamation League\\"Backgrounder: Stop Islamization of America (SIOA)\\" . Extremism. Anti-Defamation League. March 25, 2011 [August 26, 2010]. Retrieved February 16, 2012. and the Southern Poverty Law Center. He and Geller led a campaign to stop the building of Park51, an Islamic community center near the World Trade Center, which they referred to as the \\"Ground Zero Mosque\\". In 2009, Spencer blamed then-president Barack Obama himself for false rumors that Obama was a \\"secret Muslim\\". In July 2011, Wired reported that two of Spencer's books were listed in FBI training materials. Both The Truth About Muhammad and The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam were recommended for agents hoping to better understand Islam. Anders Breivik, the Norwegian spree killer behind the 2011 Norway terrorist attacks which killed 77, cited Spencer 64 times in his manifesto and wrote of him, \\"About Islam I recommend essentially everything written by Robert Spencer.\\" Spencer condemned Breivik and said he was unfairly blamed by the media for the attack. Controversies The government of Pakistan banned Spencer's book, The Truth About Muhammad, in 2016, citing \\"objectionable material\\" as the cause. Onward Muslim Soldiers was banned in Malaysia in 2007. In an October 2010 news article, an investigative report by The Tennessean described Spencer as one of several individuals who \\"... cash in on spreading hate and fear about Islam.\\" Tennessean investigation concluded: \\"IRS filings from 2008 show that Robert Spencer earned $132,537 from the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and Horowitz pocketed over $400,000 for himself in just one year.\\" On April 13, 2017, Spencer spoke at the Truman State University despite protests and a petition against him. He was invited by the Young America's Foundation. On May 1, 2017, Spencer spoke at the University of Buffalo. There he was shouted down and heckled. On May 3, 2017, Spencer spoke at Gettysburg College; 375 alumni urged the college president Janet Morgan Riggs to cancel the speech, but the event went on as planned. Spencer said, \\"There is one kind of diversity that is not valued generally in an academic setting and that is intellectual diversity.\\" On November 14, 2017, Spencer spoke at Stanford University. Many students walked out during the event. Spencer said that \\"a young Icelandic Leftist\\" poisoned him in 2017 in Reykjavik, Iceland. Spencer also criticized the doctor who then treated him and the police who investigated. =Ban from entering the UK= On June 26, 2013, Spencer and Pamela Geller were banned from entering the UK. They were due to speak at an English Defence League march in Woolwich, south London, where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed. Home Secretary Theresa May informed Spencer and Geller that their presence in the UK would \\"not be conducive to the public good\\". A letter from the UK Home Office stated that this decision is based on Spencer's statement that Islam \\"is a religion or a belief system that mandates warfare against unbelievers for the purpose of establishing a societal model that is absolutely incompatible with Western society. ...Because of media and general government unwillingness to face the sources of Islamic terrorism these things remain largely unknown.\\" The decision was to stand for between three and five years. The ban followed a concerted campaign by the UK anti-racism organization Hope not Hate, which said it had collected 26,000 signatures for a petition to the Home Secretary. Spencer and Geller contested the ban, but in 2015 the British Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, arguing that \\"this was a public order case where the police had advised that significant public disorder and serious violence might ensue from the proposed visit.\\" The ban was criticized by Douglas Murray.

Fantasy tropes are a specific type of literary tropes that occur in fantasy fiction. Worldbuilding, plot, and characterization have many common conventions, many of them ultimately originated with, myth and folklore. J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium (and in particular, The Lord of the Rings) for example, was inspired from a variety of different sources including Germanic, Finnish, Greek, Celtic and Slavic myths. Literary fantasy works operate using these tropes, while others use them in a revisionist manner, making the tropes over for various reasons such as for comic effect, and to create something fresh (a method that often generates new clich√©s). Good vs. evil The conflict of good against evil is a theme in the many popular forms of fantasy; normally, evil characters invade and disrupt the good characters' lands. J. R. R. Tolkien delved into the nature of good and evil in The Lord of the Rings, but many of those who followed him use the conflict as a plot device, and often do not distinguish the sides by their behavior. In some works, most notably in sword and sorcery, evil is not opposed by the unambiguously good but by the morally unreliable. =Hero= Heroic characters are a mainstay of fantasy, particularly high fantasy and sword and sorcery. Such characters are capable of more than ordinary behavior, physically, morally, or both. Sometimes they might have to grow into the role ordained for them. This may take the form of maturation, which is often through Coming of Age. Many protagonists are, unknown to themselves, of royal blood. Even in so fanciful a tale as Through the Looking- Glass, Alice is made a queen in the end; this can serve as a symbolic recognition of the hero's inner worth. Commonly, these tales revolve around the maltreated hero coming into his or her own. This can reflect a wish- fulfillment dream, or symbolically embody a profound transformation. =Dark Lord= The forces of evil are often personified in a \\"Dark Lord\\". Besides possessing vast magical abilities, a Dark Lord often controls great armies and can be portrayed as possessing devil-like qualities. A Dark Lord is usually depicted as the ultimate personification of evil, as with Sauron of The Lord of the Rings; Conan the Barbarian's archenemy, Thulsa Doom; the Dark One (Shai'tan) of The Wheel of Time; and the Sith Lords from Star Wars, which include Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. Other notable Dark Lords include: Lord Voldemort of Harry Potter; Darkseid from DC Comics; Thanos from Marvel Comics; Mundus from the Devil May Cry video game series; Dracula of the Castlevania series; Skeletor from Masters of the Universe; Morgoth from The Silmarillion; Arawn Death-Lord from The Chronicles of Prydain; Torak from The Belgariad; Nightmare from Soulcalibur; Ganon from The Legend of Zelda; Exdeath from Final Fantasy V, and Galbatorix from The Inheritance Cycle. The villain of the Demon Sword video game is also literally called Dark Lord. In the Lone Wolf gamebooks, the Dark Lords are a race of powerful evil beings. The protagonists of the Overlord video game franchise are classic Dark Lords in the vein of Sauron. The Dark Lord is usually seen as unmarried, though there has been the occasion when one has attempted to claim a bride. Quest Quests, an immemorial trope in literature, are common in fantasy. They can be anything from a quest to locate the MacGuffins necessary to save the world, to an internal quest of self-realization. Magic In fantasy, magic often has an overwhelming presence, although its precise nature is delineated in the book in which it appears. It can appear in a fantasy world (as in The Lord of the Rings or Shannara), or in a fantasy land that is part of reality but insulated from the mundane lands (as in Xanth), or as a hidden element in real life (as in The Dresden Files). A common trope is that magical ability is innate and rare. As such, magic-wielding people are common figures in fantasy. Another feature is the magic item, which can endow characters with magical abilities or enhance the abilities of the innately powerful. Among the most common are magic swords and magic rings. Self-fulfilling prophecies are amongst the most common forms of magic because they are an often used plot device. Often the effort undertaken to avert them brings them about, thus driving the story. It is very rare for a prophecy in a fantasy to be false, although usually, their significance is only clear with hindsight. Quibbles can undermine the clearest appearing prophecies. In The Lord of the Rings, J. R. R. Tolkien minimized the use of the word 'magic'; beings who use such abilities tend to be confused when they are described this way by others. Science fantasy stories often make use of scientifically implausible powers similar to magic, such as psychics. However, unlike true science fiction works, these powers are used in a pulp manner with no examination of their effects on society, only to create more spectacular effects than science fiction alone can provide. An example of this is the use of the Force by the Jedi in the Star Wars franchise. Medievalism Many fantasy creatures are inspired by European folklore and the romances of medieval Europe. Dragons and unicorns are among the most popular creatures. Other monsters, such as griffins, giants, and goblins also appear. Races of intelligent beings such as elves, dwarves, and gnomes often draw their history from medieval or pre- Christian roots. Characteristics of the hero and heroine also frequently draw on these sources as well. This trope is also very important in the setting of many of these fantasies. Writers from the beginnings of the fantasy genre, such as William Morris in The Well at the World's End and Lord Dunsany in The King of Elfland's Daughter, set their tales in fantasy worlds clearly derived from medieval sources; though often filtered through later views. J. R. R. Tolkien set the type even more clearly for high fantasy, which is normally based in such a \\"pseudo-medieval\\" setting. Other fantasy writers have emulated him, and role-playing and computer games have also taken up this tradition. The full width of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be feudalistic, corrupt empires despite the greater variety of the actual Middle Ages. Settings also tend to be medieval in economy, with many fantasy worlds disproportionately pastoral. These settings are typical of epic fantasy and, to a lesser extent, of sword and sorcery ‚Äî which contains more urban settings ‚Äî than of fantasy in general; the preponderance of epic fantasy in the genre has made them fantasy commonplaces. They are less typical of contemporary fantasy, especially urban fantasy. =Ancient world= A less common inspiration is the ancient world. A famous example is the Hyborian Age (the fictional world of Conan the Barbarian), which features analogues of Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Roman Empire, among others. Three notable recent series with such settings are: Bartimaeus by Jonathan Stroud, Percy Jackson & the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus by Rick Riordan. Races and species Many fantasy stories and worlds refer to their main sapient humanoid creatures as races, rather than species in order to distinguish them from non- sapient creatures. J. R. R. Tolkien popularized the usage of the term in this context, in his legendarium (and particularly in The Lord of The Rings), and the use of races in the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing games further spread the label. Many fantasy and science fiction settings now use the terms race and species interchangeably, such as the World of Warcraft computer game. In role-playing games, race typically refers to any sapient species usable as a player character. Older editions of Dungeons & Dragons called the primary non- human player races (dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf, Half-orc) \\"demi-humans.\\" Later games such as Shadowrun use the term \\"metahuman,\\" and define these humanoid races as subdivisions of \\"Homo sapiens.\\" See also * Archetype * Clich√© * Damsel in distress * Role reversal * Stereotype * Stock character * List of science fiction themes References Sources    ","title":"Fantasy tropes"},{"id":"1001255","text":"(lit., \\"flower town\\") is the Japanese term for districts where geisha live and work.

Life and work Nieuwenhuys was born in Amsterdam. Around the age of 14, Nieuwenhuys and his two-year older brother decided to become painters. From 1938 to 1941 he attended the Rijksnormaalschool in Amsterdam. Later in the Second World War he also took lessons at the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam. At the Rijksacademie he met Karel Appel and Corneille. During World War II Nieuwenhuys painted almost only clowns, nudes and couples making love. Just after the war he started painting fantasy animals like aggressive cocks, cats and bulls. He and his brother Constant had many arguments about his paintings. During the war Constant himself painted only Catholic scenes like Piet√† and Maria portraits or still lifes and thought that Nieuwenhuys chose his subjects too lightly. In 1948 Appel, Elburg, Kouwenaar, Wolvekamp, Corneille, Constant Nieuwenhuys, Brands, Rooskens and Nieuwenhuys founded the Experimentele Groep in Holland that a few months later became the European group CoBrA. Jan was in his paintings of this period influenced by dreams, children's drawings, the artistic expressions of mentally handicapped people and primitive art. Animals such as birds and cats play a leading role in most of his works, along with fantastic creatures and beings that are made up of a combination of human, animal and mechanical elements. A lot of the creatures balance on a rope or wear boats as a hat. Nieuwenhuys was soon disappointed in the members of the CoBrA group, some of them were more interested in fame than being an activist. He could not stand the fighting that was going on between the members and so he left the group in the middle of 1949. Some other members also left, but they later rejoined for the great exhibition in the Stedelijk Museum. In 1964 he said in an interview: \\"The group was not founded as an exposition group but as a group of activists. We wanted to put an effort into that, to fight against the softness in art at the time and using our imagination to change that. Regrettably I must ascertain that many of the Experimentalists of that day also became esthetics. Everything official stops to be combatant. I think that work of some of them look very dormant these days\\". Nieuwenhuys later concentrated only on his work. His paintings became more and more liberated and he experimented with different materials like fluorescent paint and everything he could get his hands on. Everything could become a painting. In an interview from 1964 he said: \\"I start with my material and my color. With that I express myself. From the material I come to my subject and that is maybe contrary to what painters did in earlier days. I paint the way I write, the way I laugh. That is why I paint differently all the time, because my moods change. That‚Äôs the way I feel.\\" \\"As a painter I don‚Äôt want to paint a particular situation. I am not abstract, not really non-figurative. I try to be expressive and therefore I need certain images. Today I am in China, tomorrow in Paris, after tomorrow some other place. We are confronted every day with what happens in the world. You‚Äôre living on a specific spot, but also in the whole world. It‚Äôs maybe therefore that we become so ignorant and hard, because we experience too much. Hunger, war. That particular situation doesn‚Äôt mean anything anymore.\\" From the same interview: \\"I wish, if they see my work later on, that they can see the twentieth century. The artist must give his time a suit. And it doesn‚Äôt matter if he is an architect, poet or painter. In abstract painting I miss the beat of this time, the rudeness. We, the people of today we are living with the fear of an atom bomb. The abstracts are building only a superficial world for you.\\" He died in Amsterdam in 1986.

Similarly, an irreducible module is another name for a simple module. * Absolutely irreducible is a term applied to mean irreducible, even after any finite extension of the field of coefficients. It applies in various situations, for example to irreducibility of a linear representation, or of an algebraic variety; where it means just the same as irreducible over an algebraic closure. * In commutative algebra, a commutative ring R is irreducible if its prime spectrum, that is, the topological space Spec R, is an irreducible topological space. * A matrix is irreducible if it is not similar via a permutation to a block upper triangular matrix (that has more than one block of positive size). (Replacing non-zero entries in the matrix by one, and viewing the matrix as the adjacency matrix of a directed graph, the matrix is irreducible if and only if such directed graph is strongly connected.) * Also, a Markov chain is irreducible if there is a non-zero probability of transitioning (even if in more than one step) from any state to any other state. * In the theory of manifolds, an n-manifold is irreducible if any embedded (n ‚àí 1)-sphere bounds an embedded n-ball. Implicit in this definition is the use of a suitable category, such as the category of differentiable manifolds or the category of piecewise-linear manifolds. The notions of irreducibility in algebra and manifold theory are related. An n-manifold is called prime, if it cannot be written as a connected sum of two n-manifolds (neither of which is an n-sphere). An irreducible manifold is thus prime, although the converse does not hold. From an algebraist's perspective, prime manifolds should be called \\"irreducible\\"; however, the topologist (in particular the 3-manifold topologist) finds the definition above more useful. The only compact, connected 3-manifolds that are prime but not irreducible are the trivial 2-sphere bundle over S1 and the twisted 2-sphere bundle over S1. See, for example, Prime decomposition (3-manifold). * A topological space is irreducible if it is not the union of two proper closed subsets. This notion is used in algebraic geometry, where spaces are equipped with the Zariski topology; it is not of much significance for Hausdorff spaces. See also irreducible component, algebraic variety. * In universal algebra, irreducible can refer to the inability to represent an algebraic structure as a composition of simpler structures using a product construction; for example subdirectly irreducible. * A 3-manifold is P¬≤-irreducible if it is irreducible and contains no 2-sided \\\\mathbb RP^2 (real projective plane). * An irreducible fraction (or fraction in lowest terms) is a vulgar fraction in which the numerator and denominator are smaller than those in any other equivalent fraction.

Iden Payne, was an English actor, director and teacher. Active in professional theater for seventy years, he helped the first modern Repertory Theatre in the United Kingdom, was an early and effective advocate for Elizabethan staging of Shakespeare plays, and served as an inspiration for Shakespeare Companies and University theater programs throughout North America and the British Isles. His name lives on as the name of a theater at the University of Texas as well as annual theater awards presented in Austin, Texas. Early life Born September 5, 1881, in Newcastle-on-Tyne, he was raised and educated in Manchester. He was the youngest of four children. His father, a Unitarian minister, died at age 52, when Payne was eleven years old.\\"A Life in a Wooden O; Memoirs of the Theatre\\" by Ben Iden Payne; Yale University Press 1977 As a young child, the first Shakespeare play he saw was a touring production of Twelfth Night. Too young to understand much of the play, he described himself as being \\"enchanted\\" by the actress who played Viola. During his second year at the Manchester Grammar School he appeared in his first Shakespearean role, as Bassanio in The Merchant of Venice. Soon thereafter, he saw a production of the same play performed in Manchester by the touring company of Henry Irving, one of the great nineteenth-century Shakespearean impresarios. Mr. Irving played Shylock and Ellen Terry performed as Portia. Modified Elizabethan Staging theory Payne‚Äôs most recognized achievement is his method of staging Elizabethan drama, which he called ‚Äúmodified Elizabethan staging.‚Äù Inspired by the founder of the Elizabethan Stage Society, William Poel, Payne‚Äôs taste for Elizabethan staging was meant to draw on actual Elizabethan period stages. The basic premise of this method was that an audience member should feel that ‚Äúhe [or she] was sharing in the action‚Äînot looking at something outside himself‚Äù. This could be achieved by creating a more intimate space, where the audience was not separated from the actors by ‚Äúthe proscenium arch, footlights, or orchestra pits‚Äù. Additionally, audience members were, according to this method, better able to focus in on the actors and the play itself when they were not distracted by ‚Äúfalling curtains, blackouts, planned pauses for resetting scenery‚Ä¶or any other forced interruption‚Äù of the action of the play. This method became instrumental in how Payne staged Shakespeare and he utilized it throughout his career. First professional work While still in school, he started his career as a walk-on actor in 1899 at the F.R. Benson company, a renowned touring Shakespeare company (formal name: Mr. and Mrs. R. F. Benson's Shakespearean and Old English Comedy Company.) Upon being interviewed by Frank Benson, he was introduced to Mrs. Benson; he was astonished to see she was the actress who played Viola in the traveling production of Twelfth Night he had seen as a child. After a four-week trial engagement with Benson, Payne spent a season touring Britain with a much smaller company, Mademoiselle Gratienne.In Memoriam: Ben Iden Payne; University of Texas He returned to Benson the next year, but this engagement was cut short when a fire at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle upon Tyne destroyed the company's stock of scenery and costumes. Payne signed on with the touring troupe of Carlyon and Charlton, a \\"fit-up\\" company (fit-up meaning they traveled with their own stage proscenium, stage curtains, lighting and scenery, which could be installed in any open hall and did not require a formal theater for performances). In 1902, he returned to Benson, where he worked both as an actor and an assistant stage manager, his first non-acting theatrical experience. He toured with Benson and several other companies the next several years, performing Shakespeare in Jamaica with the Benson Company, participating in the first production (staged by the Arthur Hare Company) of The Importance of Being Earnest performed after the trial and imprisonment of Oscar Wilde, as well as working with the companies of Mr. and Mrs. A.B. Tapping, Norman V. Norman, Madge McIntosh and the Shakespearean actor Ian Maclarean. During that period, he married the actress Mona Limerick; they had three children. Payne's wife, Mona Limerick Stage director at the Abbey Theatre As the tour with McIntosh petered out, Payne interviewed with the famous director and producer, Harley Granville-Barker. Granville-Barker referred him to Cyril Keightley, who took him on tour to Ireland. Shortly thereafter, and unexpectedly, Payne was approached by William Butler Yeats, one of the Directors of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. Unknown to Payne, Granville-Baker had recommended him for the position; equally unknown to him at the time, the English financial patron of the Abbey, Annie Horniman, insisted on an English professional stage manager as a condition for a three- year subsidy she was making to the theater.\\"W.B.Yeates and the Idea of the Theatre\\", by James W. Flannery Payne met with Yeats and the other two directors of the Abbey, Lady Gregory and J.M. Synge, for an interview the weekend that Synge's masterpiece, The Playboy of the Western World, opened. Payne was in the first row of the audience when the famous \\"Playboy\\" riots broke out in the house, with audience members breaking out in a pandemonium of shouting during the second half, over the alleged scandalous content of the play. Payne was engaged as stage director of The Abbey Theatre, but with strict instructions that he was not to participate in the production of Irish folk plays. Payne was not aware at the time that his employment was made at the insistence of Horniman, nor that Lady Gregory and Synge were opposed to bringing in a British play director to the Irish National Theatre. The engagement lasted only a few months; after taking the company on a British tour from Glasgow, Scotland to London, Payne resigned his position. He maintained a friendship with Yeats. Manchester Repertory Company The day after resigning his position with the Abbey, he received a note from Horniman, the Abbey patron. She was unhappy with her relationship with the Irish National Theatre (the unhappiness was mutual) and she wanted to sponsor a new theatrical venture, under Payne's direction. Payne proposed establishing a repertory company in Manchester, a major provincial city in England and Payne's boyhood home. With Horniman's funding he established the Manchester Repertory Company, the first true repertory company in theatre in England. He directed many of the early plays of George Bernard Shaw and John Galsworthy.\\"As I remember, Adam\\", by Angus Bowmer, 1975, chapter 2 In 1907, Payne used William Poel to direct Measure for Measure, by William Shakespeare, with the Manchester Repertory Company.\\"Golden Fire; The Anniversary Book of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival\\", by Edward and Mary Brubaker, 1985, p. 40 et seq. Poel was an early-twentieth-century innovative advocate of producing Shakespeare plays as written, without the heavy scenery and butchered text of grand nineteenth-century productions by the likes of Henry Irving. Poel's production at Manchester Repertory may have been his best, as Payne had cast it with talented, professional actors, and not the amateurs Poel usually worked with.\\"William Poel and the Elizabethan Revival\\", by Robert Speaight The next year, Payne produced Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing as a Christmas play at Manchester. To keep the pace of the play flowing, without long interruptions during scene changes, he staged played connecting scene in front of a neutral curtain drawn across the proscenium. This was an early experiment in staging Shakespeare plays as continuous action, as was the style at the Globe Theater when the plays were first written and produced. Payne resigned as director of Manchester Repertory in 1911, both for personal reasons (his wife, Mona Limerick, did not get along with Horniman) and because he believed new management could produce more popular plays that might stem the red ink of the operation.  Coming to America  In 1913, Payne was invited to the United States to organize a season of modern plays for the Chicago Theatre Society, a pioneering community theater.Oregon Shakespearean Festival (now Oregon Shakespeare Festival) 1961 Souvenir Program, p. 4 He had been referred to that company by Horniman. The Society produced a repertory season of plays by Shaw and Galsworthy, as well as a conventionally staged production of Measure for Measure. In February 1914, he produced a series of plays in Indianapolis for the Drama League of America. The next year he directed a little theater company in Philadelphia. Carnegie Tech While in Chicago, Kenneth Sawyer Goodman, the namesake of the Goodman Theatre, introduced Payne to Thomas Woods Stevens and Dr. Arthur Hamerschlag. Dr. Hamerschlag was the first President of Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and Stevens was the first chairman of the Department of Drama there, the first professional drama department in a university. Payne directed You Never Can Tell, by George Bernard Shaw during the department's first year of operation. Payne was associated with School of Drama at Carnegie Tech from 1914, and two years later he first directed the annual Shakespeare play,Theatre Arts Monthly Magazine July 1939, article by Thomas Woods Stevens, p. 495 to 1950, excepting the Stratford years of 1935‚Äì43. While at Carnegie Tech he tried out Poel's concept of Shakespeare productions performed on English Renaissance theatre stages, without elaborate scenery, by staging an annual Elizabethan production there. At Carnegie they had first used elaborate scenery for Shakespeare plays, but Payne discovered that the more they simplified the scenery the better it was for the production and the more immediate was the appeal to the audience. In 1925 Stevens departed Carnegie to manage the newly created Goodman Theatre in Chicago, and Payne succeeded him as Chairman of the Drama Department. During first year as chair in 1925, he directed a production of Shakespeare's Hamlet fully using the staging technique he came to describe as \\"modified Elizabethan staging\\". He left the Chair of the Drama Department in 1928, but Payne returned every year through 1951 (except for the years at Stratford), directing 58 plays at Carnegie between 1914 and 1951, 26 of them by Shakespeare. Broadway career In 1915, Payne produced the first staging of Hobson's Choice by Harold Brighouse for The Shubert Organization.In 1916 he directed John Barrymore in his first success in a serious role, in the American premiere of Justice by John Galsworthy. According to Angus L. Bowmer, founder of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, a financial backer demanded that Barrymore be replaced, fearing a disastrous drinking binge. Payne replied, in effect, that if they replaced Barrymore they would have to find a new director. Barrymore stayed and the performance launched his career. Justice had been produced by John D. Williams, press agent for Charles Frohman. In 1917, Payne accepted a position as a stage director of the Charles Frohman Company, a leading American producing organization. Payne would split his time between directing professionally in New York City and directing students at the School of Drama at Carnegie Tech, sometimes preferring the attitude and commitment of his \\"apprentice actors\\" in Pittsburgh to his professional actors on Broadway.\\"Theatre Arts Monthly\\"July 1939; article by B. Iden Payne, p. 496 et seq. Payne was unhappy with the work at Frohman, with its emphasis on type casting, and a 'star system' where engaging a celebrity actor (who cared more about their own performance than the good of the play as a whole) was the main concern, and he left in 1923. He returned to Broadway in 1943 to direct several plays for the Theatre Guild of New York. Inspiration on other theaters As a Guest Director at The University of Washington in the summer of 1930, he staged Shakespeare's Cymbeline and Love's Labour's Lost on an Elizabethan style, on a temporary Thrust stage. The productions inspired a young graduate student, Angus L. Bowmer, who acted in and staged managed the productions. Bowmer went on to incorporate these staging concepts when he founded the Oregon Shakespeare Festival five years later.http://www.shakespeareinamericanlife.org/transcripts/appel1.cfm Payne directed Shakespeare's Cymbeline at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 1956, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1961. In 1934, Payne and Thomas Woods Stevens edited and produced several short (one hour) productions of Shakespeare plays that were presented during the second year of the Chicago World's Fair (Century of Progress) at a crude reconstruction of Shakespeare's Globe Theater. This recreation of the Globe, and these short Shakespeare plays, inspired the 1935 California Pacific International Exposition to build a recreation of the Globe there as well, designed by Stevens, and stage their short 50 minute Shakespeare playsHistory of the Old Globe 1935-1960 The Old Globe Production History The exhibition was such a success that the recreated Globe in San Diego was preserved following the exposition, and became the home of the Old Globe Theatre. Payne returned to the Old Globe in San Diego in 1949 to direct its first Summer Shakespeare Festival, a production of Twelfth Night in 1949, and directed there several summers through 1964. Stratford Festival Payne returned to England from 1935 to 1943 to direct the Stratford Memorial Theater Festival in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Having experimented with quasi-Elizabethan at Carnegie Tech, he was forced by the tradition of the organization's management and the restrictions of the huge old Memorial Theater to use traditional proscenium techniques,. The experience was unhappy for Payne, and he departed in 1943.\\"Five and Eighty Hamlets\\", by J. C. Trewin, 1987; pp. 42‚Äì44, 62 He directed no fewer than thirty seven productions at Stratford. Later academic career and the University of Texas Payne produced Shakespeare plays as a guest professor at the University of Washington in 1943 and 1946, the University of Iowa in 1943, the University of Missouri in 1948, the University of Colorado in 1953, the University of Michigan in 1954, San Diego State University 1949‚Äì52, Allan Hancock College, California in 1968, and the Banff School of Fine Arts, Banff, Alberta, Canada 1959‚Äì1963. Payne went to the University of Texas at Austin in 1946 and spent the rest of his career as an academic there.Texas Historical Society online: http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpa74 He served as Chairman of the Department of Drama 1947‚Äì1947 and again 1951‚Äì52. He directed 29 plays at Texas, 24 by Shakespeare, and retired as Professor Emeritus of Drama in May 1973. He directed his last production at Texas in 1968, Shakespeare's The Tempest. The B. Iden Payne Awards,http://www.bidenpayneawards.org/ awarded to actors, directors, and designers for outstanding contributions to theater in Austin, Texas, are named in his honor. In 1976, one of the three theaters on campus at the University of Texas in Austin was named after him.

Another way to state this is that Occam's razor requires the elimination of only those entities that are unnecessary, not as many entities as could conceivably be eliminated. Lev Vygotsky provides the following illustration of the idea, in his Thought and Language: :\\"Two essentially different modes of analysis are possible in the study of psychological structures. It seems to us that one of them is responsible for all the failures that have beset former investigators of the old problem, which we are about to tackle in our turn, and that the other is the only correct way to approach it. :The first method analyzes complex psychological wholes into \\"elements\\". It may be compared to the chemical analysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen, neither of which possesses the properties of the whole and each of which possesses properties not present in the whole. The student applying this method in looking for an explanation of some property of water -- why it extinguishes fire, for example -- will find to his surprise that hydrogen burns and oxygen sustains fire .... :In our opinion the right course to follow is to use the other type of analysis, which may be called \\"analysis into units\\". By \\"unit\\", we mean a product of analysis which, unlike elements, retains all the basic properties of the whole, and which cannot be further divided without losing them. Not the chemical composition of water, but its molecules and their behaviour, are the key to the understanding of the properties of water ...\\" In other words: to conserve the properties under investigation, it is necessary to remain within a certain level of complexity. Irreducibility is most often deployed in defence of the reality of human subjectivity and/or free will, against those who treat such things as folk psychology, such as Paul and Patricia Churchland. In ‚ÄúLife's Irreducible Structure‚Äù, Micheal Polanyi argues that higher-order sciences such as biology and other chemical processes can not be explained by the fundamentalist perspective. Indeed, machines and the humans that make them fall into \\"boundary conditions\\" that produce phenomena that itself can not be reduced further. He writes > The lowest level is the production of a voice; the second, the utterance of > words; the third, the joining of words that make sentences; the fourth, the > working of sentences into a style; the fifth, and the highest, the > composition of the text.

The Londons were near repeats of the preceding s, but with modified armour protection. Venerables main battery consisted of four 12-inch (305-mm) guns, and she had top speed of . The ship was laid down in January 1899, was launched in November that year, and was completed in November 1902. Commissioned that month, Venerable served in the Mediterranean Fleet until 1908, and was subsequently recommissioned into the Channel Fleet. Following a major refit in 1909, she served with the Atlantic and Home Fleets. After the outbreak of World War I, she took part in defensive and offensive operations with the Channel Fleet, shelling German positions in Belgium through May 1915. Thereafter transferred to the Mediterranean, she saw service in the Dardanelles campaign in mid-1915, and then in the Adriatic through 1916. That December, she returned to England and was refitted as a depot ship in 1918. She was sold for scrap in 1921 and was ultimately broken up in 1922. Design Line-drawing of the Formidable class; the Londons were identical in appearance The five ships of the London class were ordered in 1898 in response to increased naval construction for the Russian Navy. The design for the London class was prepared in 1898; it was a virtual repeat of the preceding , though with significant revision to the forward armour protection scheme. Rather than a traditional transverse bulkhead for the forward end of the main belt armour, the belt was carried further forward and gradually tapered in thickness. Deck armour was also strengthened. Venerable was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 714 officers and enlisted men. The Formidable-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The Formidable-class ships had a top speed of from . Venerable had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading or elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to sixteen 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. The tubes were placed on the broadside, abreast of the main battery barbettes. Venerable had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on the aft end of the belt was thick. Her main battery turrets sides were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history =Pre-World War I= HMS Venerable was laid down at Chatham Dockyard on 2 January 1899, launched on 2 November 1899, and completed in November 1902. After many delays due to difficulties with her machinery contractors, HMS Venerable commissioned on 12 November 1902 by Captain George Edwin Patey for service as Second Flagship, Rear Admiral, Mediterranean Fleet. She left Chatham on 20 November, called at Sheerness to adjust compasses, and arrived at the Mediterranean the following month. In 1903, she had an experimental fire control system for evaluation. During her Mediterranean service, she ran aground outside Algiers harbor, suffering slight hull damage, and underwent a refit at Malta in 1906‚Äì1907. On 12 August 1907 she was relieved as flagship by battleship HMS Prince of Wales, and her Mediterranean service ended on 6 January 1908, when she paid off at Chatham Dockyard. Venerable recommissioned on 7 January 1908 for Channel Fleet service. She paid off at Chatham for an extensive refit in February 1909, during which her 3-pounder guns were removed and a rangefinder was installed on her foremast. The refit complete, Venerable recommissioned on 19 October 1909 for service in the Atlantic Fleet. On 13 May 1912 she transferred to the Second Home Fleet at the Nore, and went into the commissioned reserve with a nucleus crew as part of the 5th Battle Squadron. In 1913, her anti-torpedo nets were removed and a pair of searchlights were installed on her forward bridge. =World War I= When World War I broke out in August 1914, the 5th Battle Squadron was assigned to the Channel Fleet, based at Portland. Returning to full commission, Venerable patrolled the English Channel, and on 25 August 1914 covered the movement of the Portsmouth Marine Battalion to Ostend, Belgium, In October 1914, Venerable was attached to the Dover Patrol for bombardment duties in support of Allied troops fighting on the front. She bombarded German positions along the Belgian coast between Westende and Lombardsijde from 26 to 30 October 1914 during a German attack on Belgian defences in the Battle of the Yser; she also served as the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Dover Patrol, Rear Admiral Sir Horace Hood, from 27 to 29 October. On the 27th, German field guns were moved up close to shore, which forced most of the light vessels to retreat, though the heavily armoured Venerable remained on station until reports of a German U-boat in the area prompted Hood to withdraw to Dunkirk. Venerable was back on station on 28 October, along with the gunboat and three monitors, to blunt another German attack. Later that day, she ran lightly aground on an uncharted sandbank, but was at that time out of range of German guns and was able to free herself with help from at high tide. By the end of the month, the flooding from the opened sluices around Nieuwpoort had blocked the German advance, diverting German attacks further inland, out of range of Venerables guns. The German guns along the coast had by this time been hidden, which made it far more difficult to engage them with naval gunfire, so Venerable was recalled. On 3 November, she was detached to support East Coast Patrols during the German raid on Yarmouth, though she did not see action with German warships. The 5th Battle Squadron transferred from Portland to Sheerness on 14 November 1914 to guard against a possible German invasion of the United Kingdom. The squadron returned to Portland on 30 December 1914. Venerable, in company with the tender Excellent and escorting destroyers and minesweepers, again bombarded German positions near Westende on 11 March 1915. The bombardment was meant to divert German attention during the British attack at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. She returned again on 10 May in an attempt to suppress German artillery that had been shelling Dunkirk, but German counter-battery fire prevented Venerable from dropping anchor or achieving any success. On 12 May 1915, Venerable was ordered to the Dardanelles to replace the battleship in the Dardanelles Campaign. She steamed to the Mediterranean with the battleship ; the British hoped to take advantage of the experience both ships' crews had gained in bombarding coastal positions in Belgium. From 14 August 1915 to 21 August 1915, she supported Allied attacks on Ottoman positions at Suvla Bay. By the 21st, weather conditions worsened significantly, preventing the ships from being able to observe targets. In October, Venerable arrived at Gibraltar for a refit. Emerging from the refit in December 1915, she transferred to the Adriatic Sea to reinforce the Italian Navy against the Austro-Hungarian Navy, serving there until December 1916. Venerable then returned to the United Kingdom, arriving at Portsmouth Dockyard on 19 December 1916, where she was laid up. In February and March 1918 she was refitted there as a depot ship, and she moved to Portland on 27 March 1918 to serve as a depot ship for minelaying trawlers. She was attached to the Northern Patrol through August 1918, then to the Southern Patrol from September to December 1918. Venerable paid off into care and maintenance at Portland at the end of December 1918. She was placed on the disposal list there in May 1919 and on the sale list on 4 February 1920. She was sold to Stanlee Shipbreaking Company for scrapping on 4 June 1920, resold to Slough Trading Company in 1922, then resold again to a German firm in the middle of 1922. She was towed to Germany to be broken up.

The Condemnations at the medieval University of Paris were enacted to restrict certain teachings as being heretical. These included a number of medieval theological teachings, but most importantly the physical treatises of Aristotle. The investigations of these teachings were conducted by the Bishops of Paris. The Condemnations of 1277 are traditionally linked to an investigation requested by Pope John XXI, although whether he actually supported drawing up a list of condemnations is unclear. Approximately sixteen lists of censured theses were issued by the University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put together into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider that they encouraged scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science.Woods, pp. 91‚Äì92 From this perspective, some historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science. Condemnation of 1210 The Condemnation of 1210 was issued by the provincial synod of Sens, which included the Bishop of Paris as a member (at the time Pierre II de la Chapelle).Grant (1974), p. 42 The writings of a number of medieval scholars were condemned, apparently for pantheism, and it was further stated that: \\"Neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of excommunication.\\" However, this had only local force, and its application was further restricted to the Arts faculty at the University of Paris. Theologians were therefore left free to read the prohibited works, the titles of which were not even specified. Alexander of Aphrodisias was probably among the Aristotelian commentators whose influence was targeted.Th√©ry, pp. 7 ff. The University of Toulouse (founded in 1229) tried to capitalise on the situation by advertising itself to students: \\"Those who wish to scrutinize the bosom of nature to the inmost can hear the books of Aristotle which were forbidden at Paris.\\" However, whether the prohibition had actually had an effect on the study of the physical texts in Paris is unclear. English scholars, including Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon, studied at Paris, when they could have chosen to study at the University of Oxford, where the works could still be discussed in public. It is assumed that at the least they continued to be read in Paris in private, and there are also signs that their discussion had become public by 1240. Condemnation of 1270 By 1270, the ban on Aristotle's natural philosophy was a dead letter.Rubenstein, p. 215 Nevertheless, the Bishop of Paris, √âtienne Tempier, convened a meeting of conservative theologians and in December 1270 banned the teaching of certain Aristotelian and Averroist doctrines at Paris.Rubenstein, p. 216 Thirteen propositions were listed as false and heretical, some relating to Averroes' doctrine of the soul and the doctrine of monopsychism, and others directed against Aristotle's theory of God as a passive unmoved mover. The banned propositions included: Late 13th century French manuscript of Averroes' commentary on Aristotle's De Anima *\\"That there is numerically one and the same intellect for all humans\\". *\\"That the soul separated [from the body] by death cannot suffer from bodily fire\\". *\\"That God cannot grant immortality and incorruption to a mortal and corruptible thing\\". *\\"That God does not know singulars\\" (i.e., individual objects or creatures). *\\"That God does not know things other than Himself\\". *\\"That human acts are not ruled by the providence of God\\".Rubenstein, pp. 216‚Äì217 *\\"That the world is eternal\\".Rubenstein, p. 217 *\\"That there was never a first human\\". Those who \\"knowingly\\" taught or asserted them as true would suffer automatic excommunication, with the implied threat of the medieval Inquisition if they persisted. It is not known which of these statements were \\"taught knowingly\\" or \\"asserted\\" by teachers at Paris, although Siger of Brabant and his radical Averroist colleagues at the Faculty of Arts were targets. Evidently, the radical masters had taught that Aristotle put forward controversial propositions‚Äîwhich according to the Averroists would have been true at least in philosophy, even if rejected in theology‚Äîthe doctrine of two truthsNot to be confused with the Buddhist doctrine of two truthsEtienne Gilson, Reason and Revelation in the Middle Ages, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1938 (1966 Reprint), section on \\"Averroism\\"‚Äîand questions such as free will and the immortality of the soul were doubtless subject to scholarly debate between masters and students. However, it seems \\"inconceivable\\" that any teacher would deny God's Providence. Condemnation of 1277 Devotional and Philosophical Writings, c. 1330. Prior to the condemnations, many scholars relied heavily on Aristotle (right). The chain of events leading up to Bishop Tempier's condemnation of 1277 is still not entirely clear. The Catholic Encyclopedia records that the theologians of the University of Paris had been very uneasy due to the antagonism that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines. According to the historian Edward Grant, the theologians desired to condemn Aristotle's teachings on the eternity of the world and the unicity of the intellect.Grant (1974) On 18 January 1277, Pope John XXI instructed Bishop Tempier to investigate the complaints of the theologians. \\"Not only did Tempier investigate but in only three weeks, on his own authority, he issued a condemnation of 219 propositions drawn from many sources, including, apparently, the works of Thomas Aquinas, some of whose ideas found their way onto the list.\\" The list published on 7 March condemned a great number of \\"errors\\", some of which emanated from the astrology, and others from the philosophy of the Peripatetics. These included: *9. \\"That there was no first man, nor will there be a last; on the contrary, there always was and always will be generation of man from man.\\"Grant (1974), p 48. *49. \\"That God could not move the heavens with rectilinear motion; and the reason is that a vacuum would remain.\\" *87. \\"That the world is eternal as to all the species contained in it; and that time is eternal, as are motion, matter, agent, and recipient; and because the world is from the infinite power of God, it is impossible that there be novelty in an effect without novelty in the cause.\\" The penalty for anyone teaching or listening to the listed errors was excommunication, \\"unless they turned themselves in to the bishop or the chancellor within seven days, in which case the bishop would inflict proportionate penalties.\\" The condemnation sought to stop the Master of Arts teachers from interpreting the works of Aristotle in ways that were contrary to the beliefs of the Church. In addition to the 219 errors, the condemnation also covered Andreas Capellanus's De amore, and unnamed or unidentified treatises on geomancy, necromancy, witchcraft, or fortunetelling. The condemnation of 1277 was later partially annulled \\"insofar as the teachings of Thomas Aquinas would seem to be implied.\\"Grant (1974), p. 47.La condamnation parisienne de 1277, d√©c. 1999, David Pich√© =Assessment= Interior of the Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre, the former site of the School of Theology and Arts and later associated with the Faculty of Arts at the University of Paris The long list has often been labelled as not being particularly organised, and that it is \\"broad in scope to the point of confusion.\\" However, the order on the roll has been attributed to factors such as the order in which the errors appeared in the examined works. The list was reorganised shortly after 1277, possibly to facilitate its use in the academic community. In the 20th century, the articles were once again reorganised by Dominican Pierre Mandonnet, numbering and distinguishing the 179 philosophical theses from the 40 theological ones. The list was summarised into groupings and further explained by John F. Wippel. It has also been emphasised by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that \\"Tempier's theses express positions that cannot be maintained in light of revealed truth, and for this reason are each followed by the qualification 'error'.\\" Another problem was that Tempier did not identify the targets of his condemnation, merely indicating that it was directed against unspecified members of the Arts Faculty in Paris. Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia have been singled out as the most prominent targets of the 1277 censure, even though their names are not found in the document itself, appearing instead in the rubrics of only two of the many manuscripts that preserve the condemnation. These two scholars were important proponents of the Averroist movement. The ground-breaking study by the historian Roland Hissette has shown that many of the censured propositions appear to have come from Aristotle, from Arab philosophers, or from \\"the philosophers\\" (i.e. other Greek philosophers). The role that Pope John XXI played in the lead up to the condemnations is a more recent point of discussion. Because the papal letter preceded Tempier's condemnation by only about six weeks, the traditional assumption was that Tempier had acted on papal initiative, and in an overzealous and hasty way. However, more than forty days after Tempier produced his list, another papal letter gives no indication that the Pope was as yet aware of Tempier's action, and seems to suggest otherwise. It is therefore possible that Tempier had already been preparing his condemnations prior to receiving the Pope's first letter. The Pope himself had not played any direct role in the condemnations, having merely requested an investigation, and one scholar has argued that there was \\"less than enthusiastic papal approval of the bishop of Paris' actions.\\"Dales (1980b), p. 254; quoted by Woods, p. 91 =Effects= Giovanni di Paolo's St. Thomas Aquinas Confounding Averro√´s. Tempier investigated the works of both Aquinas and Averroes. Pierre Duhem considered that these condemnations \\"destroyed certain essential foundations of Peripatetic physics\\". Although the Aristotelian system viewed propositions such as the existence of a vacuum to be ridiculously untenable, belief in Divine Omnipotence sanctioned them as possible, whilst waiting for science to confirm them as true. From at least 1280 onward, many masters at Paris and Oxford admitted that the laws of nature are certainly opposed to the production of empty space, but that the realisation of such a space is not, in itself, contrary to reason. These arguments gave rise to the branch of mechanical science known as dynamics. Pierre Duhem and Edward Grant state this caused a break from Aristotle's work and forced the teachers of the time to believe Aristotle's work imperfect. According to Duhem, \\"if we must assign a date for the birth of modern science, we would, without doubt, choose the year 1277 when the bishop of Paris solemnly proclaimed that several worlds could exist, and that the whole of heavens could, without contradiction, be moved with a rectilinear motion.\\"Duhem, II, p. 412; transl. by Grant (1962), p. 200, n. 8. Duhem's view has been extremely influential in the historiography of medieval science, and opened it up as a serious academic discipline. \\"Duhem believed that Tempier, with his insistence of God's absolute power, had liberated Christian thought from the dogmatic acceptance of Aristotelianism, and in this way marked the birth of modern science.\\" The condemnations certainly had a positive effect on science, but scholars disagree over their relative influence.Woods, pp. 91‚Äì92 Historians in the field no longer fully endorse his view that modern science started in 1277. Edward Grant is probably the only contemporary historian of science who comes closest to Duhem's vision. What historians do agree upon is that the condemnations allowed science \\"to consider possibilities that the great philosopher never envisioned.\\"Woods, p. 92 According to the historian of science Richard Dales, they \\"seem definitely to have promoted a freer and more imaginative way of doing science.\\"Dales (1980a), p. 550; quoted by Woods, p. 92 Others point out that in philosophy, a critical and skeptical reaction followed on from the Condemnations 1277.Lindberg, p. 107 Since the theologians had asserted that Aristotle had erred in theology, and pointed out the negative consequences of uncritical acceptance of his ideas, scholastic philosophers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (both Franciscan friars) believed he might also be mistaken in matters of philosophy. The Scotist and Ockhamist movements set Scholasticism on a different path from that of Albert the Great and Aquinas, and the theological motivation of their philosophical arguments can be traced back to 1277.Lindberg, pp. 107‚Äì108 They stressed the traditional Franciscan themes of Divine Omnipotence and Divine Freedom, which formed part of Ockham's first thesis.Lindberg, p. 108 Ockham's second thesis was the principle of parsimony: also known as Ockham's razor.Lindberg, p. 109 This developed a new form of logic, based on an empiricist theory of knowledge. \\"While Scholastic in setting,\\" as David Lindberg writes, it was \\"thoroughly modern in orientation. Referred to as the via moderna, in opposition to the via antiqua of the earlier scholastics, it has been seen as a forerunner of a modern age of analysis.\\" Other, even more skeptical thinkers in the mid-14th century included John of Mirecourt and Nicholas of Autrecourt.Lindberg, p. 110 It has been suggested that the new philosophy of nature that emerged from the rise of Skepticism following the Condemnations, contained \\"the seeds from which modern science could arise in the early seventeenth century.\\"Lindberg, p. 111 See also *History of Science in the Middle Ages *Medieval university *Renaissance of the 12th century Notes References * Dales, Richard C.

Historically, EDA has also been known as skin conductance, galvanic skin response (GSR), electrodermal response (EDR), psychogalvanic reflex (PGR), skin conductance response (SCR), sympathetic skin response (SSR) and skin conductance level (SCL). The long history of research into the active and passive electrical properties of the skin by a variety of disciplines has resulted in an excess of names, now standardized to electrodermal activity (EDA). The traditional theory of EDA holds that skin resistance varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. Sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, and skin conductance is an indication of psychological or physiological arousal. If the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is highly aroused, then sweat gland activity also increases, which in turn increases skin conductance. In this way, skin conductance can be a measure of emotional and sympathetic responses. More recent research and additional phenomena (resistance, potential, impedance, and admittance, sometimes responsive and sometimes apparently spontaneous) suggest that EDA is more complex than it seems, and research continues into the source and significance of EDA. History In 1849, Dubois-Reymond in Germany first observed that human skin was electrically active. He immersed the limbs of his subjects in a zinc sulfate solution and found that electric current flowed between a limb with muscles contracted and one that was relaxed. He therefore attributed his EDA observations to muscular phenomena. Thirty years later, in 1878 in Switzerland, Hermann and Luchsinger demonstrated a connection between EDA and sweat glands. Hermann later demonstrated that the electrical effect was strongest in the palms of the hands, suggesting that sweat was an important factor. Vigouroux (France, 1879), working with emotionally distressed patients, was the first researcher to relate EDA to psychological activity. In 1888, the French neurologist F√©r√© demonstrated that skin resistance activity could be changed by emotional stimulation and that activity could be inhibited by drugs. In 1889 in Russia, Ivane Tarkhnishvili observed variations in skin electrical potentials in the absence of any external stimuli, and he developed a meter to observe the variations as they happened in real time.Handbook of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology (eds. Gianfranco Denes, Luigi Pizzamiglio). Psychology Press, 1999. . Page 33. The scientific study of EDA began in the early 1900s. One of the first references to the use of EDA instruments in psychoanalysis is the book by C. G. Jung entitled Studies in Word Analysis, published in 1906.The Biofeedback Monitor Jung and his colleagues used the meter to evaluate the emotional sensitivities of patients to lists of words during word association. Jung was so impressed with EDA monitoring, he allegedly cried, \\"Aha, a looking glass into the unconscious!\\" Jung described his use of the device in counseling in his book, Studies in Word Association, and such use has continued with various practitioners. The controversial Austrian psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich also studied EDA in his experiments at the Psychological Institute at the University of Oslo, in 1935 and 1936, to confirm the existence of a bio-electrical charge behind his concept of vegetative, pleasurable \\"streamings\\".Reich, W. \\"Experimentelle Ergebnisse ueber die electrische Funktion von Sexualitat und Angst\\" (Sexpolverlag, Copenhagen, 1937). Translated as \\"Experimental investigation of the electrical function of sexuality and anxiety\\" in Journal of Orgonomy, Vol. 3, No. 1-2, 1969. By 1972, more than 1500 articles on electrodermal activity had been published in professional publications, and today EDA is regarded as the most popular method for investigating human psychophysiological phenomena. As of 2013, EDA monitoring was still on the increase in clinical applications. Description Skin conductance is not under conscious control. Instead, it is modulated autonomously by sympathetic activity which drives human behavior, cognitive and emotional states on a subconscious level. Skin conductance, therefore, offers direct insights into autonomous emotional regulation. Human extremities, including fingers, palms, and soles of feet display different bio-electrical phenomena. They can be detected with an EDA meter, a device that displays the change electrical conductance between two points over time. The two current paths are along the surface of the skin and through the body. Active measuring involves sending a small amount of current through the body. Some studies include the human skin's response to alternating current, including recently deceased bodies. =Physiological basis= There is a relationship between emotional arousal and sympathetic activity, although the electrical change alone does not identify which specific emotion is being elicited. These autonomic sympathetic changes alter sweat and blood flow, which in turn affects GSR and GSP. The amount of sweat glands varies across the human body, being highest in hand and foot regions (200‚Äì600 sweat glands per cm2). The response of the skin and muscle tissue to external and internal stimuli can cause the conductance to vary by several microsiemens. A correctly calibrated device can record and display the subtle changes. The combined changes between electrodermal resistance and electrodermal potential make up electrodermal activity. Galvanic skin resistance (GSR) is an older term that refers to the recorded electrical resistance between two electrodes when a very weak current is steadily passed between them. The electrodes are normally placed about an inch apart, and the resistance recorded varies according to the emotional state of the subject. Galvanic skin potential (GSP) refers to the voltage measured between two electrodes without any externally applied current. It is measured by connecting the electrodes to a voltage amplifier. This voltage also varies with the emotional state of the subject. Examples A painful stimulus such as a pinprick elicits a sympathetic response by the sweat glands, increasing secretion. Although this increase is generally very small, sweat contains water and electrolytes, which increase electrical conductivity, thus lowering the electrical resistance of the skin. These changes in turn affect GSR. Another common manifestation is the vasodilation (dilation) of blood vessels in the face, referred to as blushing, as well as increased sweating that occurs when one is embarrassed. EDA is highly responsive to emotions in some people. Fear, anger, startled response, orienting response, and sexual feelings are among the reactions that may be reflected in EDA. These responses are utilized as part of the polygraph or lie detector test. EDA in regular subjects differs according to feelings of being treated fairly or unfairly, but psychopaths have been shown to manifest no such differences.Oshumi, T., Ohira, H. \\"The positive side of psychopathy: Emotional detachment in psychopathy and rational decision-making in the ultimatum game\\". Personality and Individual Differences 49, 2010, pp. 451-456 This indicates that the EDA record of a polygraph may be deceptive in a criminal investigation. = Different units of EDA = EDA reflects both slow varying tonic sympathetic activity and fast varying phasic sympathetic activity. Tonic activity can be expressed in units of electrodermal level (SCL), while phasic activity is expressed in units of electrodermal responses (EDR). Phasic changes (EDR) are short-lasting changes in EDA that appear as a response to a distinct stimulus. EDRs can also appear spontaneously without an observable external stimulus. These types of EDRs are referred to as ‚Äúnonspecific EDR‚Äù (NS.EDR). The phasic SCR is useful when investigating multifaceted attentional processes. Tonic changes (EDL) are based on the phasic parameters. The spontaneous fluctuations of nonspecific EDR can be used to evaluate tonic EDA. More specifically by using the frequency of ‚Äúnonspecific EDR‚Äù as an index of EDA during a specific time period, e. g. 30‚Äì60 seconds. Tonic EDA is considered useful in investigations of general arousal and alertness. Uses EDA is a common measure of autonomic nervous system activity, with a long history of being used in psychological research. Hugo D. Critchley, Chair of Psychiatry at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School states, \\"EDA is a sensitive psychophysiological index of changes in autonomic sympathetic arousal that are integrated with emotional and cognitive states.\\" Many biofeedback therapy devices utilize EDA as an indicator of the user's stress response with the goal of helping the user to control anxiety. EDA is used to assess an individual's neurological status without using traditional, but uncomfortable and expensive, EEG-based monitoring. EDA has also been studied as a method of pain assessment in premature born infants. Oftentimes, EDA monitoring is combined with the recording of heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure, because they are all autonomically dependent variables. EDA measurement is one component of modern polygraph devices, which are often used as lie detectors. The E-meter used by the Church of Scientology as part of its practice of \\"auditing\\" and \\"security checking\\", is a custom EDA measurement device. Possible problems External factors such as temperature and humidity affect EDA measurements, which can lead to inconsistent results. Internal factors such as medications and hydration can also change EDA measurements, demonstrating inconsistency with the same stimulus level. Also, the classic understanding has treated EDA as if it represented one homogeneous change in arousal across the body, but in fact different locations of its measurement can lead to different responses; for example, the responses on the left and right wrists are driven by different regions of the brain, providing multiple sources of arousal; thus, the EDA measured in different places on the body varies not only with different sweat gland density but also with different underlying sources of arousal. Lastly, electrodermal responses are delayed 1‚Äì3 seconds. These show the complexity of determining the relationship between EDA and sympathetic activity. The skill of the operator may be a significant factor in the successful application of the tool. See also * Affective computing * Biosignal * Electroacupuncture Notes References Carlson, Neil (2013).

He was one of the eight founders of the Bombay Natural History Society and a brother of the famous naturalist Robert Swinhoe. Swinhoe was commissioned ensign in the 56th Regiment of Foot without purchase in 1855, serving in the Crimea and reaching India after the 1857 Mutiny. He exchanged into a lieutenancy in the 15th Foot without purchase in 1858 and returned to the 56th Foot in 1859, transferring to the Bombay Staff Corps later the same year. He was at Kandahar with Lord Roberts in 1880, and collected 341 birds there and on the march back to India. These were described in The Ibis (1882: 95-126). He was promoted lieutenant- colonel in 1881 and colonel in 1885. Swinhoe was a keen shikari and had shot 50-60 tigers. He was also a member of the British Ornithologists' Union and contributed papers to The Ibis on the birds of southern Afghanistan and central India, and donated 300 bird skins from each country to the British Museum. While at Mhow he collaborated with Lieutenant Henry Edwin Barnes on the birds of central India. (Ibis 1885: 62-69, 124-138) He collected insects, chiefly Lepidoptera from Bombay, Poona, Mhow and Karachi districts. He had one of the largest collections of Indian Lepidoptera at the time (40,000 specimens of 7,000 species and 400 new species described by him), and completed the Lepidoptera Indica series after the death of Frederic Moore in 1907. He also published in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History. He also wrote A Revision of the Genera of the Family Liparidae which covered 1130 entries and published a Catalogue of the Moths of India (Calcutta, 1887‚Äì89) with Everard Charles Cotes.

A ring that is a semisimple module over itself is known as an Artinian semisimple ring. Some important rings, such as group rings of finite groups over fields of characteristic zero, are semisimple rings. An Artinian ring is initially understood via its largest semisimple quotient. The structure of Artinian semisimple rings is well understood by the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem, which exhibits these rings as finite direct products of matrix rings. For a group-theory analog of the same notion, see semisimple representation.  Definition  A module over a (not necessarily commutative) ring with unity is said to be semisimple (or completely reducible) if it is the direct sum of simple (irreducible) submodules. For a module M, the following are equivalent: # M is semisimple; i.e., a direct sum of irreducible modules. # M is the sum of its irreducible submodules. # Every submodule of M is a direct summand: for every submodule N of M, there is a complement P such that M = N ‚äï P. For the proof of the equivalences, see Semisimple representation#Equivalent characterizations. The most basic example of a semisimple module is a module over a field; i.e., a vector space. On the other hand, the ring Z of integers is not a semisimple module over itself (because, for example, it is not an artinian ring.) Semisimple is stronger than completely decomposable, which is a direct sum of indecomposable submodules. Let A be an algebra over a field k. Then a left module M over A is said to be absolutely semisimple if, for any field extension F of k, F \\\\otimes_k M is a semisimple module over F \\\\otimes_k A.  Properties  * If M is semisimple and N is a submodule, then N and M/N are also semisimple. * If each M_i is a semisimple module, then so is \\\\bigoplus_i M_i. * A module M is finitely generated and semisimple if and only if it is Artinian and its radical is zero.  Endomorphism rings  * A semisimple module M over a ring R can also be thought of as a ring homomorphism from R into the ring of abelian group endomorphisms of M. The image of this homomorphism is a semiprimitive ring, and every semiprimitive ring is isomorphic to such an image. * The endomorphism ring of a semisimple module is not only semiprimitive, but also von Neumann regular, .  Semisimple rings  A ring is said to be (left)-semisimple if it is semisimple as a left module over itself. Surprisingly, a left-semisimple ring is also right-semisimple and vice versa. The left/right distinction is therefore unnecessary, and one can speak of semisimple rings without ambiguity. A semisimple ring may be characterized in terms of homological algebra: namely, a ring R is semisimple if and only if any short exact sequence of left (or right) R-modules splits. In particular, any module over a semisimple ring is injective and projective. Since \\"projective\\" implies \\"flat\\", a semisimple ring is a von Neumann regular ring. Semisimple rings are of particular interest to algebraists. For example, if the base ring R is semisimple, then all R-modules would automatically be semisimple. Furthermore, every simple (left) R-module is isomorphic to a minimal left ideal of R, that is, R is a left Kasch ring. Semisimple rings are both Artinian and Noetherian. From the above properties, a ring is semisimple if and only if it is Artinian and its Jacobson radical is zero. If an Artinian semisimple ring contains a field as a central subring, it is called a semisimple algebra. = Examples = * A commutative semisimple ring is a finite direct product of fields. A commutative ring is semisimple if and only if it is artinian and reduced. * If k is a field and G is a finite group of order n, then the group ring k[G] is semisimple if and only if the characteristic of k does not divide n. This is Maschke's theorem, an important result in group representation theory. * By the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem, a unital Artinian ring R is semisimple if and only if it is (isomorphic to) M_{n_1}(D_1) \\\\times M_{n_2}(D_2) \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times M_{n_r}(D_r), where each D_i is a division ring and each n_i is a positive integer, and M_n(D) denotes the ring of n-by-n matrices with entries in D. * An example of a semisimple non-unital ring is M_{\\\\infty}(K), the row-finite, column-finite, infinite matrices over a field K. = Simple rings = One should beware that despite the terminology, not all simple rings are semisimple. The problem is that the ring may be \\"too big\\", that is, not (left/right) Artinian. In fact, if R is a simple ring with a minimal left/right ideal, then R is semisimple. Classic examples of simple, but not semisimple, rings are the Weyl algebras, such as the \\\\mathbb{Q}-algebra : A=\\\\mathbb{Q}{\\\\left[x,y\\\\right]}/\\\\langle xy- yx-1\\\\rangle\\\\ , which is a simple noncommutative domain. These and many other nice examples are discussed in more detail in several noncommutative ring theory texts, including chapter 3 of Lam's text, in which they are described as nonartinian simple rings. The module theory for the Weyl algebras is well studied and differs significantly from that of semisimple rings. = Jacobson semisimple = A ring is called Jacobson semisimple (or J-semisimple or semiprimitive) if the intersection of the maximal left ideals is zero, that is, if the Jacobson radical is zero. Every ring that is semisimple as a module over itself has zero Jacobson radical, but not every ring with zero Jacobson radical is semisimple as a module over itself. A J-semisimple ring is semisimple if and only if it is an artinian ring, so semisimple rings are often called artinian semisimple rings to avoid confusion. For example, the ring of integers, Z, is J-semisimple, but not artinian semisimple.  See also  * Socle * semisimple algebra  References  = Notes = = References =   * R.S. Pierce.

It was also built under contract by Austin Motors, Daimler, Standard Motors, Siddeley-Deasy and the Coventry Ordnance Works. Intended as a replacement for the vulnerable B.E.2, the R.E.8 was widely regarded as more difficult to fly and gained a reputation in the Royal Flying Corps for being \\"unsafe\\" that was never entirely dispelled. Although eventually it gave reasonably satisfactory service, it was never an outstanding combat aircraft. Nonetheless, it remained the standard British reconnaissance and artillery observation aircraft from mid-1917 to the end of the war, serving alongside the rather more popular Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8. More than 4,000 R.E.8s were eventually produced; these aircraft saw service in a range of different theatres, including Italy, Russia, Palestine and Mesopotamia, as well as the Western Front. The R.E.8 was rapidly withdrawn from service after the end of the conflict, by which time it was regarded as totally obsolete. Development =Background= Design of the new type had begun in late 1915,Hare 1990, p. 258. so that it was conceptually at least almost contemporary with the B.E.12 and the B.E.2e ‚Äì like these earlier types, it was designed for inherent stability in line with the dominant pre-war belief in the necessity of stability to perform the aerial observation role.Bruce 1966, p. 3. The B.E.2 had already been subject to considerable criticism and a deliberate effort was made to address each of the earlier type's failings. In particular, the more powerful motor was intended to improve the feeble speed and climb of the B.E.2 and to allow a better payload; this permitted the type to operate as a true two-seater, since the observer no longer had to be left at home when bombs or a full fuel load were carried, there was no need for his seat to be at the centre of gravity ‚Äì as a result, he could now be seated behind the pilot, in the proper position to operate a defensive machine gun. Another consequence of the additional engine power was the possibility of fitting a forward-mounted gun for the pilot. =Design and testing= Early production R.E.8 with the small vertical fin. There is no fairing over the sump. As early as March 1916, the design appears to have mostly been settled; features included the selection of a Royal Aircraft Factory 4a air-cooled V12 engine (capable of 140 hp) to power the type along with a sizable fin and rudder. During the early design process, a smaller tail fin was substituted for the original, a step which later caused some controversy. By early April 1916 a mock-up of the R.E.8 had been completed, and construction of a pair of prototypes was underway. On 16 June 1916, the first of these prototypes was submitted for its final pre-flight inspection in advance of the type's maiden flight. On 17 June 1916, the first R.E.8 test flight was conducted by F.W. Goodden.Mason 1994, p. 61. Goodden would perform all of the early flights with the type; on 1 July 1916, Sefton Brancker was flown by Goodden in the type to Hounslow, London. On 16 July 1916, the second prototype, furnished with a different design of propeller, performed its first flight. During late July 1916, the second of two prototypes was dispatched to France for service trials, the results of which were largely successful, with aircrew being generally quite favourably impressed. During August 1916, the second prototype returned to Farnborough, Hampshire, where it underwent modification based upon its experiences in France. The R.E.8 possessed a conventional wire-braced fabric-covered wooden structure, along with an unequal-span wing arrangement. The engine installation closely resembled that of the B.E.12, complete with the same large air scoop and similar vertically mounted exhausts protruding over the upper wing to carry the fumes clear of the crew. Apart from the disposition of the cockpits, the main visually distinguishable difference was that the engine was slightly raked back, to improve take off and landing characteristics.Bruce 1954, p. 577. The early production R.E.8s were more or less identical to the prototypes. R.E.8 with enlarged fin, at training unit The R.E.8 adopted a set of single bay, unequal span wings, identical to those of the earlier B.E.2e; although the span (and thus the wing area) had been increased slightly by the use of a wider upper centre section, and lower stub wings to match. On the B.E.2e, these wings functioned to maintain the stability of the B.E.2c while providing the aircraft with superior levels of manoeuvrability; although the long extensions on the upper wing gave rise to fears they would be prone to collapse if the aircraft was dived too sharply, which in turn did not help to build trust in the aircraft.Cheesman 1962, pp. 50‚Äì56. Several other features, such as the tailplane, were also identical to those previously used upon the B.E.2e. R.E.8s of No 3 Sqn AFC For the purpose of making the R.E.8 less tiring to fly, the pilot's controls included a wheel to adjust the tailplane incidence in flight and a primitive form of rudder trim (applied to the rudder bar) was provided to alleviate the constant pressure necessary to counteract the torque generated by the propeller. Basic flight controls were installed in the observer's cockpit, which folded out of the way when not in use; these were connected to the elevators, rudder and throttle, but not to the ailerons, and were intended to give observers a chance to make a forced landing if the pilot was killed or incapacitated rather than to offer true dual control.Hare 1990, pp. 259‚Äì260. Although not so underpowered as the B.E.2, the R.E.8 was still handicapped by a less than adequate powerplant, and a model re-engined with the Hispano-Suiza engine was projected as the R.E.8a from quite an early stage. The cowling designed for the liquid-cooled engine closely resembled that of the B.E.12b or the S.E.5a. Supplies of Hispano-Suiza engines, more urgently required for other types, never permitted production of the R.E.8a, although a prototype was constructed and underwent trials during December 1916. Plans to mount Rolls-Royce aero engines, such as the Eagle or Falcon were also abortive, for similar reasons. These engines were in chronically short supply and reserved for various other types in British service, including the Airco DH.4 and the Bristol Fighter. =Production= During August 1916, production of an initial batch of 50 aircraft was commenced by the Royal Aircraft Factory itself.Bruce 1966, pp. 4‚Äì5. On 25 August, a contract was placed with Austin Motors for the completion of 100 R.E.8s; on 30 August, Siddeley-Deasy was also contracted to produce a further 100 examples. By September 1916, full-scale production was well under way.Hare 1990, p. 259. By the end of September, a further 850 R.E.8s had been ordered from a range of manufacturers.Bruce 1966, p. 5. During December 1916, the first contractor- produced R.E.8s began to appear.Bruce 1966, p. 6. The Vickers-Challenger interrupter gear and the Scarff ring were still in short supply, being required for the Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter and other types; accordingly, a few early R.E.8s were built with a pillar mounting for the observer's gun as an interim measure. An alternative to the pilot's synchronised Vickers had been designed, consisting of a fixed Lewis gun with deflector plates fitted to the propeller, although this was never used, a Vickers gun for the pilot being mounted on the port side of the fuselage in a similar position to that on the B.E.12, at first synchronised by the Vickers-Challenger gear and then by the improved Constantinesco hydraulic gear.Hare 1990, p. 261. Photographs of this armament installation make it clear that the cocking handle of the Vickers gun was in easy reach of the pilot and that a normal Aldis sight was often mounted in the pilot's windscreen, giving the lie to statements that the forward firing gun could not be sighted properly due to its position, although the lack of standisation complicated maintenance in operational squadrons.Bruce 1966, pp. 5‚Äì6. In total, 4,077 R.E.8s were constructed; a further 353 aircraft that had been on order were cancelled as a consequence of the armistice. Only a handful of production aircraft were actually completed by the Royal Aircraft Factory; instead, the bulk of the work was issued out to several private companies, who were responsible for the type throughout its production life, including Austin Motors, Daimler, Standard Motors, Siddeley-Deasy and the Coventry Ordnance Works.Bruce 1966, p. 12. Operational history The first production aircraft reached 52 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in France in November 1916. The inexperienced pilots of 52 Squadron found their new mounts thoroughly dangerous and several were killed spinning in off a stall while attempting to land; they were grateful to return to the B.E.2e by exchanging aircraft with 34 Squadron in January 1917. Experienced pilots had fewer problems with the new type and re-equipment of B.E.2 squadrons continued. Pilot's notes for the R.E.8, prepared in the field, drew attention to the fact that it had a higher landing speed than the B.E.2e (hardly surprising, since it was heavier and had almost the same wing area) and that it gave almost no warning of a stall. This seems to have been the source of most complaints about the type's \\"trickiness\\". Preparing an R.E.8 for a night bombing raid The Royal Aircraft Factory conducted spinning tests on the type, concluding that the R.E.8 was quite hard to spin and recovered easily; but the fin was redesigned with slightly increased area to improve spin recovery. The modification resulted in the production version being no less stable than the B.E.2e; and while this was an advantage for artillery observation and photography it gave the R.E.8 little chance to out-manoeuvre enemy fighters. An even larger fin was fitted to some R.E.8s used as trainers. Some pilots flew the R.E.8 with an empty reserve fuel tank (or even filled the tank with fire extinguisher fluid) to avoid a perceived tendency of R.E.8s to burn on crashing. None of these measures would have made the aircraft any \\"safer\\", if the problem was one of poor stalling characteristics. Several pilots who flew the type mentioned that they had no problems but were careful to keep the airspeed well above stalling point.Rowe 2001 pp. 64‚Äì70 Preparing for a night take off R.E.8s began to arrive at the front in numbers just as the period of German air superiority known as \\"Bloody April\\" was taking a heavy toll of all types in the RFC; and early service was not auspicious. On 13 April 1917, six R.E.8s from 59 Squadron were sent on a long range photo reconnaissance mission, missed their intended escorts, and were met by the picked fighter pilots of Jasta 11, who shot them all down within five minutes.Bruce 1954, pp. 577‚Äì578. The casualty rate in R.E.8 squadrons became more sustainable as new Allied fighter types regained air superiority and pilot training and tactics improved. Although never a popular aeroplane, it was reasonably satisfactory for the tasks demanded of it and was even regarded with some affection, gaining the rhyming slang nickname \\"Harry Tate\\" (after a popular music hall artist of the time). Some crews flew their slow, cumbersome mounts quite aggressively; the German fighter ace Eduard Ritter von Dostler was shot down by an R.E.8 of 7 Squadron, while 3 Squadron Australian Flying Corps (AFC) was credited with 50 air victories in 12 months of operations.Schaedel 1972, p. 23. Lts Pithey and Rhodes of 12 Squadron were the most successful R.E.8 crew in air-to-air combat, being credited with twelve victories.Franks (et al.) 1997 pp. 72‚Äì73 An R.E.8 crew are briefed before a mission Although supplemented by other types, the R.E.8 remained the standard RFC artillery observation, air photography and general short range reconnaissance aircraft for the remainder of the war, equipping 18 RFC squadrons in 1917 and 19 squadrons in 1918. Belgium was the only country other than Britain and the Dominions to operate the R.E.8 during the First World War, receiving 22 in July 1917. At least some of the Belgian examples were fitted with Hispano-Suiza engines, in a SPAD type cowling, rather than the S.E.5a type cowling of the R.E.8a.Bruce 1966, p. 9. It was hoped to be able to replace the R.E.8 with a version of the Bristol Fighter powered by the Sunbeam Arab engine but the combination proved unsuccessful and few \\"Arab Bristols\\" were ever built.Cheesman 1962, p.62 A few R.E.8 squadrons were issued with one or two standard (Falcon engined) F.2bs in the last weeks of the war.Molkentin 2010, caption to plate 28 (between pp. 184‚Äì185) By November 1918, the R.E.8 was regarded as totally obsolete and surviving examples were quickly retired after the Armistice. Nor was the type popular with the private owners who purchased surplus RAF aircraft after the war and no R.E.8s came onto the civil register. Variants ;R.E.8 :Standard general purpose aircraft, powered by 140 hp (104 kW) RAF 4a engine. ;R.E.8a :Conversion of one R.E.8 with 200 hp (149 kW) Hispano-Suiza engine in a square, S.E.5 (or B.E.12b) type cowling. No production due to shortage of Hispano engines.Hare 1990, p. 267. At least some of the R.E.8s supplied to Belgium were also re-engined with Hispanos ‚Äì in this case in a cowling resembling that of the later SPADs. ;R.E.9 :R.E.8 modified with equal-span wings similar to those of the B.E.2c/d and the larger fin and rudder fitted to some R.E.8s at training units. Two were converted in 1917, but they showed no advantage over the standard R.E.8 (climb and manoeuvrability were worse) and no production followed.

Its population consists of some 19,629 inhabitants (as of the year 2014). The city is located on the foothills of the Tsiv-Gombori Range at above sea level. History The first archaeological findings from Telavi date back to the Bronze Age. One of the earliest surviving accounts of Telavi is from the 2nd century AD, by Greek geographer Claudius Ptolemaeus, who mentions the name Teleda (a reference to Telavi). Telavi began to transform into a fairly important and large political and administrative center in the 8th century. Interesting information on Telavi is provided in the records by an Arab geographer, Al-Muqaddasi of the 10th century, who mentions Telavi along with such important cities of that time's Caucasus as Tbilisi, Shamkhor, Ganja, Shemakha and Shirvan. Speaking about the population of Telavi, Al- Muqaddasi points out that for the most part it consisted of Christians. Ikalto (c. 800) From the 10th until the 12th century, Telavi served as the capital of the Kingdom of Kakheti and later Kingdom of Kakhet-Hereti. During the so- called Golden Era of the Georgian State (12th‚Äì13th centuries), Telavi turned into one of the most important political and economic centers of the Georgian State. After the disintegration of the united Georgian Kingdom in the 15th century, the role of Telavi started to decline and the city eventually became an ordinary town of trade and crafts. Telavi regained its political importance in the 17th century when it became a capital of the kingdom of Kakheti. By 1762, it turned into the second capital (after Tbilisi) of the united Eastern Georgian Kingdom of Kartl-Kakheti. The reign of King Erekle II, who was born and died in this city, was a special epoch in the history of Telavi. During this period (1744‚Äì1798) it grew into a strategic and cultural centre. Erakle II established there a theological seminary and founded a theatre. Erekle II's reforms touched upon all aspects of life in the country. They changed fundamentally the political, economical and cultural orientation of Kartli- Kakheti and, subsequently of the whole Georgia. His name became a symbol of freedom and national independence of the Georgian people. Erakle II is still called affectionately \\"Patara Kakhi\\" (Little Kakhetian), and his heroic deeds are described in folk literature. Russian rule The Alazani River Plain, with the Caucasus Mountains in the background, view from Telavi In 1801, after the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti was annexed by the Russian Empire, Telavi lost its status as a capital. In the 19th century, the city was given the status of an administrative center of an uyezd within the Tbilisi Gubernyia. During that period, the economy of the city was mainly composed of small-scale industries (leather painting, pottery production, wine-making, etc.), commerce and agriculture. The town's population was about 12,000 in the end of the 19th century (including about 9,000 Armenians and 2,000 ethnic Georgians). Heritage Telavi and its surroundings are rich in historical, architectural and natural monuments. The most important heritage monuments preserved within the city limits include: *Dzveli Galavani (\\"Old Walls\\") - fortress of the first Kakhetian kings (9th‚Äì10th centuries) *Church of the St. Mary (16th century) *Church of the Holy Trinity (6th century) *Fortress Batonis Tsikhe (\\"Fortress of Master\\") built in the 17th century; one of the only well- preserved medieval royal palaces in Georgia *Korchibashishvilebis Tsikhe - castle of the local noblemen named Korchibashishvilis (16th‚Äì18th century) *akhvakhishvilebis Tsikhe - castle of the local noblemen named Vakhvakhishvilis (18th century) Telavi is the only city in Georgia where four fortification monuments from four historical periods remain relatively intact. Due to this reason, architects, scholars and art historians consider Telavi as the most \\"medieval\\" city in the country. Another curious sight in Telavi is a 900-year-old plane tree which is high and around the trunk. Other notable landmarks around Telavi include the Alaverdi Cathedral (11th century), the second highest cathedral in Georgia after the newly built Tbilisi Sameba Cathedral; the Ikalto Academy (8th-12th centuries‚Äì), where the famous Georgian writer Shota Rustaveli studied; the Church of St. George (dedicated to the patron saint of Georgia, where it is said that there are 365 churches named St. George); ruins of the city and castle of Gremi (the former capital of Kakheti during the 15th‚Äì17th centuries); Shuamta, a complex made of three churches of different periods‚Äî6th, 7th and 8th centuries‚Äîin a highland forest; Akhali Shuamta (\\"New Shuamta\\" in English), the monastery close to Dzveli Shuamta (\\"Old Shuamta\\" in English), built in the 16th century; the stunning Tsinandali Gardens (the residential Palace of Noblemen Chavchavadzes family); and many others. Geography Telavi faces the Tsiv-Gombori Range to the south and southwest and borders on the Alazani Valley to the north and east. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, which runs to the north of the Alazani Valley, can be seen from most of Telavi. At present, the city of Telavi is connected with Tbilisi by two highways. The most widely traveled (and better- paved) highway runs through the rural areas of Kakheti and is longer (the overall length of the highway is approximately ) than the route, which runs through the highlands of the Gombori Mountain Range. The shorter route (approximately ) is quite scenic, but is less used due to the reconstruction works that are being carried out there from 2014, but now it is used way, it is little difficult for non professional and non experienced drivers, road is too much narrow and dangerous. Because of its beauty, historical monuments and hospitality and the reputation for kindness of its residents, the city is a popular tourist destination in Georgia. In popular culture Telavi serves as the hometown of the Georgian bush pilot Mimino (Vakhtang Kikabidze) in the 1977 Soviet comedy Mimino. See also * Kakheti References *Rosen, Roger.

The river is long and drains an area of 23,700 km¬≤. While it has been said that the river's name comes from Nicolas Gatineau (sometimes spelled Gastineau), a fur trader who is said to have drowned in the river in 1683, the original inhabitants, the Algonquin Anicinabek, assert that the name comes from their language. The name they give the river is \\"Te-nag√†dino-z√¨bi\\", which means \\"The River that Stops [One's Journey]\\".  Geography  Draveurs Bridge (highway 50-route 148) crossing Gatineau River (view upstream on october 7, 2018 from Jacques-Cartier street). The geography of the area was altered with the construction of the Baskatong Reservoir, and it is still possible to travel upstream on the Gatineau and reach a point where a small portage will bring you to the headwaters of the Ottawa River. The Ottawa River then flows northwest and turns south where it eventually flows more easterly and connects with the Gatineau. The river flows through the communities of: * Maniwaki * Gracefield * Low * Wakefield * Chelsea * Cantley * Gatineau A covered wooden bridge over the river at Wakefield, built in 1915, was destroyed by arson in 1984, but has been rebuilt. History = Exploration and naming = Farrellton, circa 1930 This river was an important transportation corridor for native people of the region and early explorers. On June 4, 1613, Samuel de Champlain passed here while travelling on the Ottawa River to L'Isle-aux-Allumettes. He wrote: He noted this \\"river coming from the north\\" but did not give its name. According to the Bulletin des recherches historiques (1895), the land-surveyor No√´l Beaupr√© wrote an official report on the river on February 3, 1721, but without naming it, leaving it unclear if its current name was in use in the 18th century. In 1783, in a report to the governor Frederick Haldimand, lieutenant David Jones called the river by the name \\"River Lettinoe\\". According to Lucien Brault (History of Pointe-Gatineau, 1948), this would be the first written reference to the name Gatineau. On the charts of his account from 1830, but recalling events from the beginning of the 19th century, the traveller and fur trader Jean-Baptiste Perrault called the river \\"n√†g√†tinong\\" or \\"√†gatinung\\". On a plan of the Rideau Canal, drawn by lieutenant-colonel John By in 1831, the river is called \\"Gatteno\\". Finally, \\"R. Gatineau\\" appears on the chart of William Henderson in 1831, and on the one of Thomas Guesses, in 1861. This name recollects the memory of a fur trader from the 17th century, Nicolas Gatineau or Gastineau. Inhabitant of Trois-Rivi√®res, he had traded near a river located between the Ottawa and Saint-Maurice Rivers, which was then customarily called river of Gatineau. But according to Raymond Douville, at the end of the 17th century Louis (1674-1750) and Jean-Baptiste (1671-1750), sons of Nicolas, established a trading post, or just a supply post, on a point located at the mouth of the river, site of the future Point-Gatineau. Therefore, the toponym given to the river is more likely a credit to the Gatineau sons than to Nicolas.Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec = Economic uses = Chelsea Hydroelectric Station and dam From the 19th century until 1991, the river was used to transport logs to sawmills near the mouth of the river. Philemon Wright and his descendants played an important role in the development of the lumber industry in the Gatineau valley. In more recent times, with declining quality in the forests of the region, logs were used for pulp and paper. The river has been extensively dammed and is an important source of hydroelectric power. In 1925, three hydroelectric dams were constructed along the lower Gatineau River, making them one of the biggest economic and industrial projects in the region's history. These are now known today as the Paugan, Chelsea and Rapides-Farmers Hydroelectric Stations (Centrale Paugan, Centrale Chelsea and Centrale Rapides-Farmers). The stations are located within the municipalities of Low, Cantley and Gatineau. The Hull- Chelsea-Wakefield Railway, a tourist steam train, followed a route up the Gatineau valley to Wakefield. J.

It was so named because the thin cylindrical metal outer shell which hinged open when the bomblet deployed gave it the superficial appearance of a large butterfly. The design was very distinctive and easy to recognise. SD 2 bomblets were not dropped individually, but were packed into containers holding between 6 and 108 submunitions e.g. the AB 23 SD 2 and AB 250-3 submunition dispensers. The SD 2 submunitions were released after the container was released from the aircraft and had burst open. Because SD 2s were always dropped in groups (never individually) the discovery of one unexploded SD 2 was a reliable indication that others had been dropped nearby. This bomb type was one of the first cluster bombs ever used in combat and it proved to be a highly effective weapon. The bomb containers that carried the SD 2 bomblets and released them in the air were nicknamed the \\"Devil's Eggs\\" by Luftwaffe air and ground crew.\\"Operation Barbarossa\\", Jonathan Garraway, Fly Past, Key Publishing, No. 359, June 2001, p. 70 Description The SD 2 submunition was a long cylinder of cast iron, which was slightly larger in diameter before its wings deployed. A steel cable 121 mm long was attached via a spindle to an aluminium fuze screwed into the fuze pocket in the side of the bomblet. The outer shell was hinged and would flip open as two half-cylinders when it was dropped. Additionally, spring-loaded wings at the ends would flip out. The wings at the end were canted at an angle to the airflow, which turned the spindle (connected to the fuze) anti-clockwise as the bomblet fell. After the spindle had revolved approximately 10 times (partially unscrewing itself from the bomb) it released a spring-loaded pin inside the fuze, which fully armed the SD 2 bomb. The wings and arming spindle remained attached to the bomb after the fuze had armed itself, as the bomb descended towards the ground. Butterfly bombs contained the kleine Z√ºndladung 34 (kl. Zdlg. 34/Np with a blasting cap and 7 grams of Nitropenta) booster and the main explosive filling consisting of 225 grams of cast F√ºllpulver 60/40 (Amatol) explosive. The fragmentation density produced by an SD 2 was 1 fragment per m¬≤ in 8 meters radius from a ground burst SD 2 bomb; overall, the body of an SD 2 did produce about 250 fragments with a mass of over 1 gram and a still greater number of lighter fragments. The fragments were generally lethal to anyone within a radius of and could inflict serious fragmentation injuries (e.g. deep penetrating eye wounds) as far away as . Butterfly bombs were usually painted either straw yellow (desert camouflage), or, if fitted with the DoppZ (41) or (41) A fuze, dark green or grey. Butterfly bombs could be fitted with any one of three fuzes, which were made of aluminium and stamped with the model type surrounded by a circle: * 41 fuze - has an external selector switch with two settings. The \\"Zeit\\" (time) setting will detonate the bomb in the air, approximately 5 seconds after being armed. The \\"AZ\\" (Aufschlagz√ºnder - impact) setting triggers detonation when the bomb hits the ground. The fuze is armed if 4 screw threads at the base of the arming spindle are visible. This fuze is highly sensitive to disturbance if the selector switch is set to \\"Zeit\\" and the bomb is unexploded. The particular switch setting of any type 41 fuze is clearly visible on its exterior. * 67 fuze - clockwork time delay. Time of detonation can be set between 5 and 30 minutes after arming itself in the air. This fuze also has an external selector switch for impact detonation. The particular switch setting of any type 67 fuze is clearly visible on its exterior. * 70 fuze - anti-handling device (i.e. booby trap) will trigger detonation if the bomb is moved after impact with the ground. The fuze is armed if 3 screw threads at the base of the arming spindle are visible. Butterfly bombs in a submunitions container could have a mixture of different fuzes fitted to increase disruption to the target. Additionally, when a single fuze type with two operating functions was fitted (e.g. type 41), bombs in a submunitions container could have either or both possible fuze settings selected by the Luftwaffe ground crew. Fuze variants such as the 41A, 41B, 70B1, 70B2, etc., also existed. These variants were inserted into the fuze pocket via a bayonet fitting (the fuze was held in place via two steel clips) but otherwise functioned identically. As with more modern cluster bombs, it was not considered practical to disarm butterfly bombs which had fully armed themselves but failed to detonate. This was because SD 2 fuzes were deliberately designed to be extremely difficult and dangerous to render safe once they had armed themselves. Instead, the standard render safe procedure for any unexploded SD 2 butterfly bomb was to evacuate the area for at least 30 minutes (in case the bomblet was fitted with a type 67 time delay fuze), then surround it with a ring of sandbags (to contain the explosion) and destroy it in situ by detonating a small explosive charge beside it. Other solutions were to attach a long string to the bomb and tug on it after taking cover, or for bombs in open countryside, shooting at them with a rifle from a safe distance. Not all unexploded SD 2 butterfly bombs still have their wings attached. In some cases the wings have rusted away and fallen off. The SD 2 then resembles a rusty tin can with an aluminium disc (the fuze) in its side, sometimes with a short stub projecting from it. Regardless of age and condition, all unexploded SD 2s remain highly sensitive to disturbance and can easily detonate. Use Butterfly bombs were first used against Ipswich in 1940, but were also dropped on Kingston upon Hull, Grimsby and Cleethorpes in June 1943, amongst various other targets in the United Kingdom. Lieutenant Colonel Eric Wakeling led the clearance of the unexploded ordnance in Grimsby within the Royal Engineers. They were subsequently used against Allied forces in the Middle East. The British Government deliberately suppressed news of the damage and disruption caused by butterfly bombs in order to avoid encouraging continued use by the Germans. On October 28, 1940, some butterfly bombs that had failed to arm themselves properly were discovered in Ipswich by British Army ordnance technicians Sergeant Cann and 2nd Lieutenant Taylor. By screwing the arming rods back into the fuzes (i.e. the unarmed position) they were able to recover safe examples of the new weapon system to allow the British to reverse-engineer and understand the mechanism. The SD 2 saw use in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941. Twenty to thirty aircrews had been picked to drop SD 2s and SD10s (10 kg submunitions) on key Soviet airfields, a flight of three aircraft being assigned to each field. The purpose of these early attacks was to cause disruption and confusion as well as to preclude dispersion of Soviet planes until the main attack was launched. It was reported that Kampfgeschwader 51 lost 15 aircraft due to accidents with the SD 2s - nearly half of the total Luftwaffe losses that day. Luftwaffe monthly consumption of the SD 2 increased from 289,000 examples in the summer of 1941 to 436,000 in July 1943 and 520,000 in August 1943. This increase was nowhere near high enough to match the Luftwaffe senior leadership's demands. The AB 250-2 bomblet dispenser could carry 144 SD 2 anti-personnel submunitions, or 30 of the anti-armor SD-4 submunitions. While the AB 250-3 could carry 108 SD 2s. AB 250s were most frequently carried by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 F/G series, but in practice, they could be lifted by a wide variety of aircraft, including the Me 262. Because of Hitler's interference, these jet-powered fighters were pressed into service as a Jabo (JagdBomber, fighter-bomber), a role for which they were poorly suited. Notably, Me 262s were sent on nuisance raids against Eindhoven in early October, loaded with AB 250 bomblet dispensers.Forsyth, Robert (2012). Me 262 Bomber and Reconnaissance Units. Osprey Publishing. pp 31. . The last recorded UK death from a German butterfly bomb in England occurred on November 27, 1956, over 11 years after the end of the war: Flight Lieutenant Herbert Derrington of the RAF was examining an SD 2 at the \\"Upminster bomb cemetery\\" (some remote sandpits situated East of RAF Hornchurch, where explosive ordnance disposal experimental and research work took place) when it detonated. He died of shrapnel and blast injuries at Oldchurch Hospital the same day. On the island of Malta in 1981 Paul Gauci, a 41-year-old Maltese man, died after welding a butterfly bomb to a metal pipe and using it as a mallet, thinking it was a harmless can. The latest find of such a bomb was on 28 October 2009, by an 11-year-old boy in a secluded valley close to a heavily bombarded airfield. This bomb was safely detonated on-site by the Armed Forces of Malta.

US copy The United States manufactured a copy of the SD 2 for use during World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War, designating it the M83 submunition. The 3 fuze types used on the M83 submunition were slightly modified versions of the original German designs:- * M128A1 - airburst or impact fuze. Airburst detonation occurred 2.5 seconds after arming. Detonation on impact was instantaneous. The fuze setting is clearly marked on the exterior and was selectable by ground crew * M130A1 - clockwork time fuze with time delays ranging from 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 minutes. Has no markings, but is recognisable by the square-shaped fitting for the arming spindle * M131A1 - anti-disturbance fuze. Detonation triggered when the device was disturbed. Has no markings, but is recognisable by the pentagonal-shaped fitting for the arming spindle The M83 fragmentation bomblet was used in the US M28 and M29 cluster bombs.

It is the sequel to 1989 Konami's Crime Fighters, although it was marketed internationally as a stand-alone game with no previous connections. Gameplay The first stage The four men of the game's hero gang, The Cobras, fight through waves of enemies to rescue Kate, The Cobras' fifth member, who was kidnapped by the Dead End Gang. As with most beat-em-ups, the game features primarily side-scrolling action. Player score is based on number of opponents eliminated. The option of attacking an enemy while they are knocked down was new to the genre. The game uses 'punch' and 'kick' buttons rather than 'jump' and 'attack'. The special punch-plus-kick attack is the only aerial attack. Every time this special attack is performed, it takes away one bar of energy from the character. The players can also use different weapons that belong to enemies or are hidden inside boxes, including a shotgun (with limited cartridges), baseball bats, knives, and bottles. Players can also double-team enemies and vice versa. After defeating the Big Boss at the end of the chapters, the game continues: first it resuscitates all the bosses for a massive final fight, and if the player defeats them all, then the game repeats endlessly, with an amped-up level of difficulty.Vendetta aka Crime Fighters 2 (Arcade/Konami/1991) [720p] YouTube Plot Dead End City is a place controlled with a firm grip by the \\"Dead End\\" gang, an endless parade of violent criminals. Their only obstacle is the opposing hero gang, called The Cobras. The Cobras number five members: Blood (former prizefighter, with a passing resemblance to Wesley Snipes), Hawk (former professional wrestler, with a passing resemblance to Hulk Hogan), Boomer (a martial artist, possibly based on Jean-Claude Van Damme), Sledge (a military ex-convict with a passing resemblance to Mr. T) and Kate, the damsel in distress, described as Hawk's protegee and wearing a blue shirt similar to his. One day, Kate is kidnapped by the Dead End Gang under the leadership of Faust, who is looking for the leadership of all street gangs in an attempt to take full control of the city. The four men go to enemy territory to save Kate, fighting through the waves of enemies sent against them. Development Vendetta was showcased at the 1991 Las Vegas Amusement Expo. =Censorship= Vendetta was censored in some countries when released outside of the Asian market (particularly in the United States, while the uncensored version was released in some countries, like Argentina), as to remove an enemy character who dresses in leather (in a S & M style) and fights by grabbing hold of the playable character and then proceeding to dry hump and lick him.Vendetta (Arcade) Game Index ScrollBoss This character also continues to do the same if the protagonist is down.Japanese version of Vendetta YouTube A second type of dog enemy was also removed from the game for trying to do something similar to the character. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Vendetta on their August 1, 1991 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the year. British gaming magazine The One reviewed Vendetta in 1991, reviewing it alongside 'D.D. Crew, stating that \\"one will probably face into insignificance at the expense of the other. If it was up to me, Konami's Vendetta would be the one to take the prizes.\\" The One praises D.D. Crew's sprite size and \\"well-crafted\\" graphics, however, they call the gameplay \\"fine\\" but \\"all a bit sterile\\", stating that Vendetta has \\"a lot more atmosphere\\", and the graphics, while smaller, are \\"much more imaginatively drawn - and the animations are smooth and inventive.\\" The One states that \\"Vendetta has both class and imagination\\" and calls its gameplay \\"a cathartic experience\\".

Georgia‚Äôs most important roads and railways converge there, making Samtredia the country‚Äôs vital transport hub. The Kopitnari Airport is also located in from Samtredia. The town's population is 25,318 as of the 2014 all-Georgia census. The climate is humid subtropical, with mild and warm winters and hot summers.Samtredia Municipality. Imereti regional administration. Accessed on May 1, 2008. Samtredia evolved from a crucial railway junction in the 1870s and acquired town status in 1921. In the 1895s there was built the first school in town, 14th public school which today is known as 12th public school. Under Soviet rule, the local economy diversified from transportation to food and wood production. Due to its strategic location, Samtredia played a prominent role in the civil unrest early in the 1990s when anti-Soviet opposition groups blocked the Samtredia junction from July 26 to 31 1990 in order to force the Soviet Georgian leadership to adopt a liberal election code.Jonathan Wheatley (2005), Georgia from National Awakening to Rose Revolution: Delayed Transition in the Former Soviet Union, p. 52. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., . The junction was again blocked in March‚ÄìApril 1991, this time by the new government of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, in an attempt to exert pressure on the central Soviet authorities. This blockade, however, inflicted heavy damage not only to the economy of Georgia but to the neighbouring Armenia, which was largely dependent on Georgia‚Äôs railways. In 1993, Samtredia became one of the major battlegrounds in the Georgian Civil War in which the forces loyal to the ousted President Gamsakhurdia confronted the post-coup government troops, and briefly controlled the town from October 17 to October 23, 1993, putting all communications to Tbilisi under threat.Cornell, Svante (2001), Small Nations and Great Powers: A Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict in the Caucasus, p. 173.

It is a colorless solid that is soluble in organic solvents, but poorly soluble in water (0.344 wt % at 83 ¬∞C). BPA is a precursor to important plastics, primarily certain polycarbonates and epoxy resins, as well as some polysulfones and certain niche materials. BPA-based plastic is clear and tough, and is made into a variety of common consumer goods, such as plastic bottles including water bottles, food storage containers (commonly called \\"Tupperware\\"), baby bottles, sports equipment, CDs, and DVDs. Epoxy resins derived from BPA are used to line water pipes, as coatings on the inside of many food and beverage cans, and in making thermal paper such as that used in sales receipts. In 2015, an estimated 4 million tonnes of BPA-derived chemical were produced, making it one of the highest volume of chemicals produced worldwide. BPA is a xenoestrogen, exhibiting estrogen-mimicking, hormone-like properties. Although the effect is very weak, the pervasiveness of BPA-containing materials raises concerns. Since 2008, several governments have investigated its safety, which prompted some retailers to withdraw polycarbonate products. Since then, BPA- free plastics have been manufactured using alternative bisphenols such as bisphenol S and bisphenol F, but there is controversy around whether these are actually safer.  Uses  Bisphenol A is primarily used to make plastics, such as this polycarbonate water bottle. In 2003, U.S. consumption was 856,000 tons, of which 75% was used to make polycarbonate plastic and 21% for epoxy resins. In the U.S., less than 5% of the BPA produced is used in food contact applications, but remains in the canned food industry and printing applications, such as sales receipts. =Polycarbonates= Bisphenol A is a precursor to polycarbonate plastics. Its reaction with phosgene is conducted under biphasic conditions; the hydrochloric acid is scavenged with aqueous base: :500px 3.6 million tonnes (8 billion pounds) of BPA are consumed for this purpose yearly. These polymers do not contain BPA, but esters derived from it. =Epoxy and vinyl ester resins= BPA is a precursor in production of major classes of resins, specifically the vinyl ester resins. This application usually begins with alkylation of BPA with epichlorohydrin. vinyl ester\\" derived from bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, sometimes called BADGE. Free-radical polymerization gives a highly crosslinked polymer. =Specialized derivatives= BPA is a versatile building block from which many derivatives have been prepared. Nitration give dinitrobisphenol A. Bromination gives tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), which exhibits fire retardant properties. Several drug candidates have been developed from bisphenol A, including Ralaniten, Ralaniten acetate, and EPI-001. Health effects  The largest exposure humans have had to BPA is by mouth from sources such as food packaging, the epoxy lining of metal food and beverage cans, and plastic bottles.Heather Caliendo for PlasticsToday ‚Äì Packaging Digest, 20 June 2012 History of BPA BPA has been found to bind to both of the nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs), ERŒ± and ERŒ≤. It is 1000- to 2000-fold less potent than estradiol. BPA can both mimic the action of estrogen and antagonize estrogen, indicating that it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or partial agonist of the ER. At high concentrations, BPA also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). In addition to receptor binding, the compound has been found to affect Leydig cell steroidogenesis, including affecting 17Œ±-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase and aromatase expression and interfering with LH receptor-ligand binding. In 1997, adverse effects of low- dose BPA exposure in laboratory animals were first proposed. Modern studies began finding possible connections to health issues caused by exposure to BPA during pregnancy and during development. As of 2014, research and debates are ongoing as to whether BPA should be banned or not. A 2007 study investigated the interaction between bisphenol A's and estrogen-related receptor Œ≥ (ERR-Œ≥). This orphan receptor (endogenous ligand unknown) behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. BPA seems to bind strongly to ERR-Œ≥ (dissociation constant = 5.5 nM), but only weakly to the ER. BPA binding to ERR-Œ≥ preserves its basal constitutive activity. It can also protect it from deactivation from the SERM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (afimoxifene). This may be the mechanism by which BPA acts as a xenoestrogen. Different expression of ERR-Œ≥ in different parts of the body may account for variations in bisphenol A effects. BPA has also been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30). According to the European Food Safety Authority \\"BPA poses no health risk to consumers of any age group (including unborn children, infants and adolescents) at current exposure levels\\". But in 2017 the European Chemicals Agency concluded that BPA should be listed as a substance of very high concern due to its properties as an endocrine disruptor. In 2012, the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of BPA in baby bottles. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also holds the position that BPA is not a health concern. In 2011, Andrew Wadge, the chief scientist of the United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency, commented on a 2011 U.S. study on dietary exposure of adult humans to BPA, saying, \\"This corroborates other independent studies and adds to the evidence that BPA is rapidly absorbed, detoxified, and eliminated from humans ‚Äì therefore is not a health concern.\\" The Endocrine Society said in 2015 that the results of ongoing laboratory research gave grounds for concern about the potential hazards of endocrine-disrupting chemicals ‚Äì including BPA ‚Äì in the environment, and that on the basis of the precautionary principle these substances should continue to be assessed and tightly regulated. A 2016 review of the literature said that the potential harms caused by BPA were a topic of scientific debate and that further investigation was a priority because of the association between BPA exposure and adverse human health effects including reproductive and developmental effects and metabolic disease. In July 2019, the European Union upheld a decision by the European Chemicals Agency to list BPA as a substance of very high concern, the first step in the procedure for restrictions of its use. The decision is based on concerns for BPA toxicity for human reproduction.  Environmental effects  In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that over one million pounds of BPA are released into the environment annually. BPA can be released into the environment by both pre-consumer and post-consumer leaching. Common routes of introduction from the pre-consumer perspective into the environment are directly from plastics, coat and staining manufacturers, foundries who use BPA in casting sand, or transport of BPA and BPA-containing products. Post- consumer BPA waste comes from effluent discharge from municipal wastewater treatment plants, irrigation pipes used in agriculture, ocean-borne plastic trash, indirect leaching from plastic, paper, and metal waste in landfills, and paper or material recycling companies. Despite a rapid soil and water half-life of 4.5 days, and an air half-life of less than one day, BPA's ubiquity makes it an important pollutant. BPA has a low rate of evaporation from water and soil, which presents issues, despite its biodegradability and low concern for bio-accumulation. BPA has low volatility in the atmosphere and a low vapor pressure between 5.00 and 5.32 Pascals. Aqueous solutions of BPA absorbs at wavelengths greater than 250 nm. BPA interferes with nitrogen fixation at the roots of leguminous plants associated with the bacterial symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti. BPA affects soybean seedlings with respect to root growth, nitrate production, ammonium production, and the activities of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase. At low doses of BPA, the growth of roots were improved, the amount of nitrate in roots increased, the amount of ammonium in roots decreased, and the nitrate and nitrite reductase activities remained unchanged. However, at considerably higher concentrations of BPA, the opposite effects were seen for all but an increase in nitrate concentration and a decrease in nitrite and nitrate reductase activities. Nitrogen is both a plant nutritional substance, but also the basis of growth and development in plants. A 2005 study conducted in the United States had found that 91‚Äì98% of BPA may be removed from water during treatment at municipal water treatment plants. A more detailed explanation of aqueous reactions of BPA can be observed in the Degradation of BPA section below. Nevertheless, a 2009 meta- analysis of BPA in the surface water system showed BPA present in surface water and sediment in the U.S. and Europe. According to Environment Canada in 2011, \\"BPA can currently be found in municipal wastewater. [‚Ä¶]initial assessment shows that at low levels, bisphenol A can harm fish and organisms over time.\\" BPA affects growth, reproduction, and development in aquatic organisms. Among freshwater organisms, fish appear to be the most sensitive species. Evidence of endocrine-related effects in fish, aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, and reptiles has been reported at environmentally relevant exposure levels lower than those required for acute toxicity. There is a widespread variation in reported values for endocrine-related effects, but many fall in the range of 1Œºg/L to 1 mg/L. A 2009 review of the biological impacts of plasticizers on wildlife published by the Royal Society with a focus on aquatic and terrestrial annelids, molluscs, crustaceans, insects, fish and amphibians concluded that BPA affects reproduction in all studied animal groups, impairs development in crustaceans and amphibians and induces genetic aberrations. Toxicity BPA exhibits very low acute toxicity as indicated by its LD50 of 4 g/kg (mouse). In those mice, weight gain was reduced and exhibited estrogen-like properties. Reports indicate that it is a minor skin irritator as well, though less so than phenol. The FDA's National Center for Toxicology Research conducted its own research studies. In rodent studies, the amount of BPA passed from the mother to the unborn offspring after oral administration was found to be insignificant. The BPA administration dose for the rodents was 100-1000 times higher than human exposure.  Production  World production capacity of BPA was 1 million tons in the 1980s, and more than 2.2 million tons in 2009. It is a high production volume chemical. This compound is synthesized by the condensation of acetone (hence the suffix A in the name) with two equivalents of phenol. The reaction is catalyzed by a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or a sulfonated polystyrene resin. Industrially, a large excess of phenol is used to ensure full condensation; the product mixture of the cumene process (acetone and phenol) may also be used as starting material: :Synthesis of bisphenol A from phenol and acetone Numerous ketones undergo analogous condensation reactions. =BPA substitutes= Concerns about the health effects of BPA have led many manufacturers to replace BPA with substitutes such as bisphenol S (BPS) and diphenyl sulfone. However, health concerns have been raised about these substitutes as well. Identification in plastics type 7 plastics may contain bisphenol A In the U.S., plastic packaging is split into seven broad classes for recycling purposes by a Plastic identification code. As of 2014 there are no BPA labeling requirements for plastics in the U.S. \\"In general, plastics that are marked with Resin Identification Codes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are very unlikely to contain BPA. Some, but not all, plastics that are marked with the Resin Identification Code 7 may be made with BPA.\\" Type 7 is the catch-all \\"other\\" class, and some type 7 plastics, such as polycarbonate (sometimes identified with the letters \\"PC\\" near the recycling symbol) and epoxy resins, are made from bisphenol A monomer. Type 3 (PVC) may contain bisphenol A as an antioxidant in \\"flexible PVC\\" softened by plasticizers, but not rigid PVC such as pipe, window frames, and siding.  History  Bisphenol A was prepared in 1891 by Russian chemist Aleksandr Dianin.See: * –ê. –î–∏–∞–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ (1891) \\"–û –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç–∞—Ö—ä –∫–æ–Ω–¥–µ–Ω—Å–∞—Üi–∏ –∫–µ—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–≤—ä —Å—ä —Ñ–µ–Ω–æ–ª–∞–º–∏\\" (On condensation products of ketones with phenols), –ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫–æ-—Ö–∏–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ (Journal of the Russian Physical Chemistry Society), 23 : 488-517, 523‚Äì546, 601‚Äì611; see especially pages 491-493 (\\"–î–∏–º–µ—Ç–∏–ª–¥–∏—Ñ–µ–∏–æ–ª–º–µ—Ç–∞–∏—å\\" (dimethyldiphenolmethane)). * Reprinted in condensed form in: A.

In 1934 workers at I.G. Farbenindustrie reported the coupling of BPA and epichlorohydrin. Over the following decade, coatings and resins derived from similar materials were described by workers at the companies of DeTrey Freres in Switzerland and DeVoe and Raynolds in the US. This early work underpinned the development of epoxy resins, which in turn motivated production of BPA. The utilization of BPA further expanded with discoveries at Bayer and General Electric on polycarbonate plastics. These plastics first appeared in 1958, being produced by Mobay and General Electric, and Bayer.Volker Serini \\"Polycarbonates\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. In terms of the endocrine disruption controversy, the British biochemist Edward Charles Dodds tested BPA as an artificial estrogen in the early 1930s. He found BPA to be 1 / 37,000 as effective as estradiol. Dodds eventually developed a structurally similar compound, diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was used as a synthetic estrogen drug in women and animals until it was banned due to its risk of causing cancer; the ban on use of DES in humans came in 1971 and in animals, in 1979. BPA was never used as a drug. BPA's ability to mimic the effects of natural estrogen derive from the similarity of phenol groups on both BPA and estradiol, which enable this synthetic molecule to trigger estrogenic pathways in the body. Typically phenol-containing molecules similar to BPA are known to exert weak estrogenic activities, thus it is also considered an endocrine disrupter (ED) and estrogenic chemical. Xenoestrogens is another category the chemical BPA fits under because of its capability to interrupt the network that regulates the signals which control the reproductive development in humans and animals.  Legislation  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ended its authorization of the use of BPA in baby bottles and infant formula packaging, based on market abandonment, not safety. The European Union and Canada have banned BPA use in baby bottles. Currently in the United States, there are 12 states, in addition to Washington D.C. that have restrictions in place against BPA. These states include California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Each state's restrictions differ slightly, but all restrict the use of BPA in some way. The following are some examples of legislation in place in these states: * California - Assembly Bill 1319 (2011) prohibits the manufacture and sale of bottles and cups with BPA at detectable levels above 0.1 parts per billion if these items are meant to be used by children 3 years old or younger. It requires manufacturers to use alternative non-toxic materials that are not categorized as carcinogenic or reproductive toxicants. * Delaware - Senate Bill 70 (2011) prohibits the sale of bottles and cups containing BPA if the items are designed to be used by children 4 years old or younger. * Illinois - Senate Bill 2950 (2011) prohibits the sale of empty containers like bottles or cups designed to store food and beverage for children that contain BPA * Maine - House Bill 330 (2011) helped process BPA to be recognized as a priority chemical under Title 38, ¬ß1691, Maine's law on toxic chemicals in products designed to be used by children. BPA was formally designated as a substance that must pass through certain reporting requirements for manufactureres of products that contain BPA, as well as authorize the prohibition of sale of products that are reported to contain BPA.

He served also as Cardinal Secretary of State under Popes Benedict XV and Pope Pius XI.  Biography  =Early life= Gasparri was born on 5 May 1852Kertzer, The Pope and Mussolini, pg. 51. in Capovallazza di Ussita, a small village in the Apennine Mountains in central ItalyKertzer, The Pope and Mussolini, pg. 7. (in the modern province of Macerata, then part of the Papal States). His parents were Bernardino Gasparri and Giovanna Sili. The youngest of 10 children born to a family of shepherds, Pietro was the favorite. Pietro was a weak and sickly child, while his 9 siblings were strong and vivacious; some thought that he would not live long. His father would often sleep in the fields with the sheep, and Pietro entertained the family by reading stories of saints as the family was gathered by the warmth of the hearth. They would all be brought to tears as they listened to the stories of the martyrs. Pietro's mother had the \\"gift of tears\\", which she gave to all her children, especially Pietro, according to his memoir. =Canonical scholar and curial diplomat= He was for many years the head of the Department of Canon Law at the Catholic University of Paris,McCormick, Vatican Journal, pp. 44-45 (entry from January 2, 1927). where he was a professor from 1880 to 1898.Ren√© Wehrl√©, De la coutume dans le droit canonique. Essai historique s'√©tendant des origines de l'√âglise au pontificat de Pie XI (Paris: Recueil Sirey, 1928) pg. 396. He served as the Apostolic delegate to Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru from 1898 to 1901, when he became a member of the Curia and returned to Rome. Shortly after becoming pope, Pius X asked Gasparri how long it would take to codify canon law. Gasparri answered that, with sufficient staff, it could be done in 25 years. Pius X replied, \\"Then do it\\".Peters, The Life of Benedict XV, pg. 204. Gasparri was called to Rome in 1904 to take the post of Secretary for the Commission for the Codification of Canon Law, in which he spent the next 13 years in seclusion, digesting volumes of decrees and studies compiled over centuries to create the first definitive legal text in the history of Catholicism. His efforts resulted in the 1917 Code of Canon Law, in effect until 1983. On 18 October 1917, Pope Benedict named him the first president of the newly created Pontifical Commission for Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law. Beginning in 1929, he also played a significant role in early stages of the codification of Eastern Catholic canon law. =Secretary of State= He was made a Cardinal-Priest of S. Bernardo alle Terme in 1907. In January 1915 he chose to become Cardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina, however he retained in commendam his former title until December 1915. He served as the Cardinal Secretary of State under Popes Benedict XV and Pius XI, beginning with his appointment on 13 October 1914.Rhodes, The Vatican in the Age of the Dictators, p. 40 On 4 December 1916 he became Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church. =1922 conclave= In the 1922 conclave that elected Pope Pius XI, Gasparri was the \\"champion of the moderates\\" who wanted to continue Pope Benedict XV's more centrist policies vis-√†-vis the modern world. He was 69 years old and considered a possible compromise candidate for the papacy. =Retirement and death= By 1928, Gasparri was suffering from heart disease and diabetes, slept poorly, and‚Äîdespite Pius XI's urging‚Äîrefused to take time off, fearing that the pope would replace him in his absence.Kertzer, The Pope and Mussolini, pg. 105. For years, he had been receiving signals that his services were no longer valued by the pope. He submitted his resignation as Secretary of State and after several weeks Pope Pius accepted it on 7 October 1930. Gasparri died on 18 November 1934. At his death he was still President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Codification of the Canon Law of the Eastern Churches, and Camerlengo. Canon Law reform In response to the request of the bishops at the First Vatican Council, Pope Pius X ordered the creation of a general Roman Catholic canon law codification, which did not exist at that time. He entrusted Pietro Gasparri, who was aided in the work by Giacomo della Chiesa (the future Benedict XV) and Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pius XII). Perhaps the ablest canonist in the Roman Curia at the time, the work of codification, simplification, and modernization of canon law was for the most part the work of Gasparri.McCormick, Vatican Journal, p. 44 (entry from January 2, 1927). Work began with collecting and reducing diverse documents into a single code, presenting the normative portion in the form of systematic short canons shorn of the preliminary considerations (\\"Whereas ...\\" etc.) and omitting those parts that had been superseded by later developments. The code was promulgated on 27 May 1917 as The Code of Canon LawLa Due, The Chair of Saint Peter, pg. 256. (Latin: Codex Iuris Canonici) by Pope Benedict XV, who set 19 May 1918 as the date on which it came into force.Ap. Const. Providentissima Mater Ecclesia, 27 May 1917 For the most part, it applied only to the Latin Church except when \\"it treats of things that, by their nature, apply to the Oriental\\",Canon 1, 1917 Code of Canon Law such as the effects of baptism (cf. canon 87). In the succeeding decades, some parts of the 1917 Code were retouched, especially under Pope Pius XII. Papal diplomacy Under Gasparri's leadership, the Vatican successfully concluded a record number of diplomatic agreements with European governments, many of which heading new states, created after World War I. On 29 March 1924, a concordat was signed between Gasparri and Bavaria, with France on 10 February 1925, Czechoslovakia on 2 February 1928, Portugal on 15 April 1928, and Romania on 19 May 1932.Concordata, Index. =Lateran Treaty= The Lateran Treaty is the crowning achievement of Pietro Gasparri, as it ended the sixty-year conflict between the Vatican and the Kingdom of Italy. It was signed on 11 February 1929, with Mussolini himself signing on behalf of Italy.Kertzer, Prisoner of the Vatican, p. 292 It includes three agreements made in 1929 between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See, ratified on 7 June 1929, thus ending the \\"Roman Question\\". Main Vatican negotiator for Pietro Gasparri was the Roman lawyer Francesco Pacelli,Rhodes, The Vatican in the Age of the Dictators, p. 42 the brother of then-Apostolic Nuncio to Germany Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII). On the day of the signing, before leaving for the Lateran Palace, Gasparri met with Pius XI in order for him to approve the final draft of the agreements. After kneeling for the pope's blessing, Gasparri left the room with tears in his eyes, feeling the enormous importance of what would take place later that day.Kertzer, The Pope and Mussolini, pg. 108. = Russia and the Soviet Union = Gasparri's watch in the Vatican coincided with major changes in Europe after World War I. With the Russian Revolution, the Vatican was faced with a new, so far unknown situation, an ideology and government which rejected not only the Catholic Church but religion as a whole. = Lithuania and Estonia = Gasparri managed to conclude a concordat with Lithuania. The relations with Russia changed drastically for a second reason. The Baltic states and Poland gained their independence from Russia after World War I, thus enabling a relatively free Church life in those former Russian countries. Estonia was the first country to look for Vatican ties. On 11 April 1919 Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri informed the Estonian authorities that the Vatican would agree to have diplomatic relations. A concordat was agreed upon in principle a year later, June 1920. It was signed on 30 May 1922. It guarantees freedom for the Catholic Church, establishes an archdiocese, liberates clergy from military service, allows the creation of seminaries and catholic schools, describes church property rights and immunity. The Archbishop swears alliance to Estonia. Relations with Catholic Lithuania were slightly more complicated because of the Polish occupation of Vilnius, a city and archiepiscopal seat, which Lithuania claimed as well as its own, though the majority of its population was Polish and it was a major center of Polish culture. Polish forces had occupied Vilnius. This generated several protests of Lithuania to the Holy See. Relations with the Holy See were defined during the pontificate of Pope Pius XI (1922‚Äì1939). Lithuania was recognized by the Vatican in November 1922. The recognition included a stipulation by Pietro Gasparri to Lithuania. There were diplomatic standstills, as the Lithuanian government refused to accept virtually all episcopal appointments by the Vatican. The relations did not improve when, in April 1926, Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized the Lithuanian ecclesiastical province without regard to Lithuanian demands and proposals, the real bone of contention being Vilnius which belonged to Poland. In autumn 1925, Meƒçislovas Reinys, a Catholic professor of theology, became the Lithuanian foreign minister and asked for an agreement. The Lithuanian military took over a year later and a proposal of a concordat, drafted by the papal visitator Jurgis Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius, was agreed upon by the end of 1926. The concordat was signed a year later. Its content follows largely the Polish Concordat of 1925. = Poland = In October 1918 Pope Benedict XV congratulated the Polish people on their independence. In a public letter to the archbishop Kakowski of Warsaw, he remembered their loyalty and the many efforts of the Holy See to assist them. He expressed his hopes that Poland would again take its place in the family of nations and continue its history as an educated Christian nation. In March 1919, he nominated ten new bishops and, soon after, Achille Ratti, already in Warsaw as his representative, as papal nuncio. He repeatedly cautioned Polish authorities against persecuting Lithuanian and Ruthenian clergy. During the Bolshevik advance against Warsaw, he asked for worldwide public prayers for Poland. Gasparri sent Nuncio Ratti to stay in the Polish capital. On 11 June 1921 he wrote to the Polish episcopate, warning against political misuses of spiritual power, urging again peaceful coexistence with neighbouring people, stating that \\"love of country has its limits in justice and obligations\\". He sent nuncio Ratti to Silesia to act against potential political agitations of the Catholic clergy. Ratti, a scholar, intended to work for Poland and build bridges to the Soviet Union, hoping even to shed his blood for Russia. Pope Benedict XV needed him as a diplomat and not as a martyr and forbade any trip into the USSR, although he was the official papal delegate for Russia. Therefore, he discontinued his contact with Russia. This did not generate much sympathy for him within Poland at the time. He was asked to go. \\"While he tried honestly to show himself as a friend of Poland, Warsaw forced his departure, after his neutrality in Silesian voting was questioned\\" by Germans and Poles. Nationalistic Germans objected to a Polish nuncio supervising elections, and Poles were upset because he curtailed agitating clergy. November 20, when German Cardinal Adolf Bertram announced a papal ban on all political activities of clergymen, calls for Ratti's expulsion climaxed in Warsaw. Two years later, Achille Ratti became Pope Pius XI, shaping Vatican policies towards Poland with Pietro Gasparri and Eugenio Pacelli for the following thirty-six years. (1922‚Äì1958) Pope Pius XI (1922-1939) Warsaw forced his departure as Nuncio. Two years later, he was Pope. He signed concordats with numerous countries including Lithuania and Poland During the pontificate of Pope Pius XI,(1922‚Äì1939) Church life in Poland flourished: There were some anti-clerical groups opposing the new role of the Church especially in education. But numerous religious meetings and congresses, feasts and pilgrimages, many of which were accompanied by supportive letters from the Pontiff, took place. Under the pontificate of Pope Pius XI, his Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri with unusual candour expressed his views on the post-war order and the future of Poland: He told Ludwig von Pastor that the Peace Treaty of Versailles will most certainly end in a new war, maybe even ten wars.Von Pastor 681 He expressed his pleasure at the outcome of the Locarno treaty. However, the Polish Corridor continued to be a dark point in his estimation, requiring compromises.Von Pastor 833 At the same time, he opined, Poland can only exist if she works either with her neighbour in the East or West. Since the Soviet Union could not be relied upon, he considered it \\"outright stupid, to destroy bridges to the West. Poland will have to pay dearly later on, once Germany recuperates\\". Concordat with Poland On 10 February 1925 a concordat (Concordat of 1925) was signed between Pietro Gasparri, Cardinal Secretary of State for the Vatican, and Stanislaw Grabski for Poland.Joanne M Restrepo Restrepo SJ, Concordata Regnante Sancissimo Domino Pio XI Inita, Pontificia Universitas Gregoriana, Romae, 1932 The concordat has 27 articles, which guarantee the freedom of the Church and the faithful. It regulates the usual points of interests, Catholic instruction in primary schools and secondary schools, nomination of bishops, establishment of seminaries, and a permanent nuncio in Warsaw, who also represents the interests of the Holy See in Gda≈Ñsk.Concordata, 3.Concordata 8 The concordat stipulates, that no part of Polish territory can be placed under the jurisdiction of a bishop outside of PolandConcordata 26 The Church enjoys full protection of the State, and prays for the leaders of Poland during Sunday Mass and on 3 May. Clerics make a solemn oath of allegiance to the Polish StateConcordata 12 If clergy are under accusation, trial documents will be forwarded to ecclesiastical authorities if clergy are accused of crimes. If convicted, they will not serve incarceration in jails but will be handed over to Church authorities for internment in a monastery or convent.Concordata 22 The concordat extends to the Latin rite in five ecclesiastical provinces of Gniezno and Poznan, Varsovie, Wilno, Lwow and Cracovie. It applies as well to united Catholics of the Greco-Ruthenian rite in Lwow, and Przemysl, and, to the Armenian rite in Lwow.Concordata 9 for religious celebration in the specific rites, Canon law must be observed.Concordata 18 Catholic instruction is mandatory in all public schools, except universities.Concordata 13 In Article 24 Church and State recognize each other's property rights seeming in part from the time of partition before 1918. This means, property rights and real estate titles of the Church are respected. A later agreement will define the status of expropriated Church properties. Until that time, the State will pay Church endowments for its clergy. On paper the concordat seemed to be a victory for the Church. But Polish bishops felt forced to take measures against early violations, in the area of marriage legislation and property rights. Pope Pius XI was supportive of this and of episcopal initiatives to have their own plenary meetings. In the Florestano Vancini's film The Assassination of Matteotti (1973), Gasparri is played by Michele Malaspina.

Corneille was born in Liege, Belgium, although his parents were Dutch and moved back to the Netherlands when he was 12. He studied art at the Academy of Art in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. He was one of the founders of the REFLEX movement in 1948 and in 1949 he was also one of the founders of the COBRA movement, which has had great influence on Scandinavian art. He was active within the group from the beginning, not only painting but also publishing poetry in the Cobra magazine. He was a cofounder of the '. Corneille was not only inspired by the drawings of children, when he heard during a Cobra Museum visit in the nineties that there was an ‚ÄúArt Lending for Children‚Äù he talked with the founder Roby Bellemans and asked him to send more information to his home in Paris about this project. He decided to promote the initiative because he agreed how important it was to approach children with art that connects with their experience. He started with a support list and convinced other artists like Shinkichi Tajiri to sign.

Rusbridger became editor-in-chief of The Guardian in 1995, having been a reporter and columnist earlier in his career. Rusbridger stood down from the post at the end of May 2015 and was succeeded by Katharine Viner. In 2014, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \\"building a global media organisation dedicated to responsible journalism in the public interest, undaunted by the challenges of exposing corporate and government malpractices\\". Since 2015, Rusbridger has been Principal of Lady Margaret Hall in the University of Oxford. He was appointed chair of the University's Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in 2016. In 2020, Rusbridger was announced as one of the first members of the Oversight Board created by Facebook. Life and career =Early career= Rusbridger was born in Lusaka,Ken Auletta \\"Annals of Communications: Freedom of Information\\", The New Yorker, 7 October 2013 Northern Rhodesia, a protectorate (now Zambia), the son of B. E. (n√©e Wickham) and G. H. Rusbridger, the Director of Education of Northern Rhodesia. When Rusbridger was five, the family returned to Britain and he was educated at Lanesborough Prep School, Guildford, where he was also a chorister at Christ Church, and Cranleigh School, a boys' independent school in Surrey. At Magdalene College, Cambridge, he read English Literature. During the vacations of his first two years at university, he worked for the Cambridge Evening News as an intern, and accepted a job offer from the newspaper after graduation. He stayed with the Evening News until 1979. He then joined The Guardian as a reporter, and subsequently wrote the paper's diary column and later became a feature writer. In November 1985, Rusbridger had a brief stint as a Royal reporter following the Prince and Princess of Wales around Melbourne, Australia. Fascinated by gadgets, at this stage he was already using a Tandy word processor and an early (slow) modem to file stories back to London.Alan Rusbridger \\"Alan Rusbridger ‚Äì Editor, The Guardian\\" , Press Gazette, 23 November 2005. He left in 1986 to become TV critic of The Observer, then an entirely separate newspaper, before moving to America to be the Washington editor of the short-lived London Daily News in 1987. After returning to The Guardian, he launched the \\"Weekend\\" supplement in 1988, followed by the paper's \\"G2\\" section. He became features editor in 1994.Stephen Armstrong \\"MEDIA: PROFILE; Guardian of journalistic integrity: Alan Rusbridger, Editor, the Guardian\\", PR Week, 11 October 1996. =Editor of The Guardian= Appointment and early years Rusbridger was appointed as the editor of The Guardian by the Scott Trust in late January 1995 after a decisive vote of the National Union of Journalists chapel, management and trustees in an electoral college.Maggie Brown \\"Guardian names its new editor\\", The Independent, 25 January 1995 As editor he defended the paper against a number of high-profile defamation suits, including those from the Police Federation and the Conservative MPs, Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken. In the case involving Hamilton, and the lobbyist Ian Greer, he said: \\"They weren‚Äôt going to fight us in the court so they tried to do it through the TV studio.\\" Rusbridger countered them by being available for TV interviews over three days to ensure that their version of events did not gain precedence. Hamilton's case collapsed shortly before a court hearing, while Aitken was demonstrated to have perjured himself, and served a prison sentence as a result.Alan Rusbridger \\"The long, slow road to libel reform\\", guardian.co.uk, 10 May 2011. Seen early in his editorship as a modernising new broom, he commented in June 1997 shortly after the election of Tony Blair's first New Labour government that the \\"old\\" Guardian: \\"opposed lots of things the Tories did which we'd now think weren't terribly bad in retrospect ... I mean, a lot of the trade union stuff doesn't seem as horrendous now as it seemed at the time.\\"Rob Brown \\"New Government! New Guardian! Alan Rusbridger is shaking up his staff with Blairite conviction\\", The Independent, 2 June 1997. From around 1997, he oversaw the launch and development of the newspaper's website, initially known as Guardian Unlimited. Berliner, digital and corporate In September 2005 The Guardian responded to the tabloid re-launches of The Times and The Independent by moving from a broadsheet format to the \\"Berliner\\" format, which is common in the rest of Europe. The print edition of the newspaper still accounted for about 75% of the company's revenue around 2012. In a profile of Rusbridger though, published in the New Statesman at the end of May 2012, former newspaper editor Peter Wilby cast doubt on whether Rusbridger's enthusiasm for online journalism, freely available without a paywall, and the large amount of money invested by the group, would ever gain a return or ensure the long-term survival of the newspaper.Peter Wilby \\"Alan Rusbridger: the quiet evangelist\\", New Statesman, 30 May 2012. Until May 2016, he was a member of the board of Guardian News and Media, of the main board of the Guardian Media Group and of the Scott Trust, which owns The Guardian and The Observer, of which he was executive editor. Rusbridger received ¬£471,000 in pay and benefits in 2008‚Äì9,Guardian profile. but then volunteered to a series of pay cuts, bringing his revenue to ¬£395,000 in fiscal year 2012. Publication of Wikileaks and Edward Snowden material As editor-in- chief, in August 2013 Rusbridger took the decision to destroy hard drives containing information leaked to The Guardian by Edward Snowden, rather than comply with a government demand to hand over the data. An alternative action was agreed and in the presence of the authorities the drives were destroyed, Rusbridger described performing the task as \\"slightly pointless\\". \\"Given that there were other copies, I saw no reason not to destroy this material ourselves.\\" On 3 December 2013 Rusbridger gave evidence before a Home Affairs Select Committee hearing on counterterrorism at the UK Parliament with regard to the publication of information leaked by Snowden.Anthony Faiola, \\"Guardian editor defends publication of Snowden files\\", The Washington Post, 3 December 2012. In the film The Fifth Estate (2013), about The Guardians former association with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Rusbridger was portrayed by Peter Capaldi. Resignation In December 2014, Rusbridger announced he would step down as editor of The Guardian in the summer of 2015. On 20 March 2015, The Guardian announced Katharine Viner as Rusbridger's successor.

The expansion in the later years of Rusbridger's editorship led to unsustainable losses and several hundred job cuts were planned. According to a report in The Times in April 2016, staff were opposed to Rusbridger returning. Viner and chief executive David Pemsel were also opposed to Rusbridger becoming Chair of the Scott Trust. =Other activities= On 17 December 2014, a week after it was published that Rusbridger was stepping down as editor of The Guardian, news was announced that Rusbridger had been elected Principal of Lady Margaret Hall, a constituent college of Oxford University.

Today, the term almost always refers to an electric-motor-driven appliance, although there are some manual devices also referred to as \\"food processors\\". Food processors are similar to blenders in many forms. A food processor typically requires little to no liquid during use, unlike a blender, which requires a set amount of liquid in order for the blade to properly blend the food. Food processors are used to blend, chop, dice, and slice, allowing for quicker meal preparation. History One of the first electric food processors was the Starmix, introduced by German company Electrostar in 1946. Although the basic unit resembled a simple blender, numerous accessories were available, including attachments for slicing bread, milk centrifuges and ice cream bowls. In a time when electric motors were expensive, they also developed the piccolo, where the food processor's base unit could drive a vacuum cleaner. In the 1960s, Albrecht von Goertz designed the Starmix MX3 food processor. Although the entire company was rebranded as Starmix in 1968 following the success of the processors, they later focused on vacuum cleaners and electric hand-dryers and the last mixer was produced around the year 2000. In France, the concept of a machine to process food began when a catering company salesman, Pierre Verdun, observed the large amount of time his clients spent in the kitchen chopping, shredding and mixing. He produced a simple but effective solution, a bowl with a revolving blade in the base. In 1960, this evolved into Robot-Coupe, a company established to manufacture commercial \\"food processors\\" for the catering industry. In the late 1960s, a commercial food processor driven by a powerful commercial induction motor was produced. Robot-Coupe's Magimix food processor arrived from France in the UK in 1974, beginning with the Model 1800. Then, a UK company Kenwood Limited started their own first Kenwood Food Processor, 'processor de- luxe,' in 1979. Carl Sontheimer introduced this same Magimix 1800 food processor to North America in 1973 under the Cuisinart brand, as America's first domestic food processor. Sontheimer contracted with a Japanese manufacturer to produce new models in 1977 in order to immediately launch his new Japanese-made food processor in 1980 when his contract with Robot-Coupe expired. = Marc Harrison's Cuisinart Re-design = Disability research was an ongoing project because the first food processor created was not user friendly for all individuals. In 1978, Marc Harrison was a professor at the Rhode Island School of Design. He specialized in Industrial Design. Cuisinart, an American company, contacted and hired Marc Harrison in 1978 to update the Food Processor. Marc Harrison updated the product to focus on making the machine usable for those with limited abilities with fine motor skills and eyesight, which in turn made it easier for any user to operate. These updates included larger writing on the base of the product to benefit those who have vision impairments, and larger handles and buttons. These updates were created so that the food processor could be accessible for all users. Functions Food processors normally have multiple functions, depending on the placement and type of attachment or blade. Design and operation The base of the unit houses a motor which turns a vertical shaft. A bowl, usually made of transparent plastic, fits around the shaft. Cutting blades can be attached to the shaft; these fit so as to operate near the bottom of the bowl. Shredding or slicing disks can be attached instead; these spin near the top of the bowl. A lid with a \\"feed tube\\" is then fitted onto the bowl. The feed tube allows ingredients to be added while chopping or slicing. It also serves as a chute through which items are introduced to shredding or slicing disks. A \\"pusher\\" is provided, sized to slide through the feed tube, protecting the user's fingers. Almost all modern food processors have safety devices which prevent the motor from operating if the bowl is not properly secured to the base or if the lid is not properly secured to the bowl.  Variations  A food chopper is basically a food processor of a smaller size. It also suits better for chopping food than for making smoothies.Food Processor vs Food Chopper: Which Should You Choose?, TheFoodChopper.com, accesat la 19 mai 2017 See also *Blade grinder *Blender *Bread machine *Coffee grinder *Electric pressure cooking *Food processing * Ultrasonic homogenizer *Grater, a non-electric kitchen cutting implement *Home robot *Mandoline, a kitchen cutting device that uses similar styles of blades to some food processors *Multicooker *Donvier References External links * Howstuffworks \\"How Food Processors Work\\" Food preparation appliances Garde manger Products introduced in 1946 20th-century inventions German inventions ","title":"Food processor"},{"id":"1001476","text":"Surrender of Breda, by Vel√°zquez, shows Ambrosio Spinola, commander of the Spanish tercio, receiving the keys to the city from a defeated Dutch general in 1625. A tercio ( \\"third\\") or tercio espa√±ol (\\"Spanish third\\") was a type of Spanish pike and shot infantry unit known for its numerous victories on the battlefields of Europe during the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, and was a major development of early modern combined arms warfare. The tercio was an administrative unit nominally composed of up to 3,000 soldiers (but in practice usually 1,000 to 2,000 due to illness, desertion or manpower shortages) subdivided originally into 10 (later 12) compa√±√≠as, composed of pikemen and arquebusiers or musketeers. These companies were deployed in battle and were further subdivided into units of 30 soldiers. These smaller units could be deployed individually or brought together to form what were sometimes called \\"Spanish squares.\\" Tercio-type units were also used by other European powers, especially the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire. The care that was taken to maintain a high number of viejos soldados (\\"old soldiers\\" or veterans) in the units, and their professional training, together with the particular personality imprinted on them by the hidalgos of the lower nobility that commanded them, made the tercios the best infantry in Europe for over a century. History Deployment of disembarked Tercios, 1583. The use of massed pike formations by Spanish armies began in the Granada War (1482‚Äì92). During the Italian Wars (1494-1559), the Spanish general Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, called \\"El Gran Capit√°n\\" (\\"The Great Captain\\") combined pikemen, arquebusiers and swordsmen (rodeleros) into colunelas (\\"columns\\") as a counter to the French army of the Valois kings, composed of heavily armoured gendarmes (professional versions of the medieval knight), Swiss and German Landsknecht mercenary pikemen, and heavy cannons. These conflicts at the end of the 15th century and during the early 16th century evolved into a tactically unique combination of combined arms centered around heavy infantry.This emphasis on the infantry was the result of Spain's shortage of cavalry and dependence on mules in daily life. Davies, T. R. 1961\\" Davies, T. R. (1961).. A colunela, later called coronel√≠a (\\"colonelcy\\"), commanded by a coronel (\\"colonel\\"), appointed by the King, would theoretically have up to 6,000 men, but by 1534 this had been reduced to the tercio with a nominal maximum of 3,000.Davis, Trevor. The Golden Century of Spain, 1501‚Äì1621 London: Macmillan and Co, 1961. Page 24. Armies using tercio companies of 250 to 300 soldiers generally intended to field four of these companies in a tercio, with three tercios arrayed with one in front and two behind, in echelon formation on either side. The Spanish tercios rarely had more than 1500 men in practice, originally consisting of 1/3 pikemen, 1/3 swordsmen, and 1/3 arquebusiers or musketeers. Over time, the number of swordsmen was gradually reduced, and the composition of the tercio became 1/2 pikemen and 1/2 musketeers. The only tercio to have its full complement of 3,000 men was the Tercio de Galeras or the \\"Galleys' Tercio\\", dedicated only for deployment in galleys and galleons and specialized in naval warfare and amphibious warfare. It was assigned in 1537 by royal assent to the Spanish fleets in the Mediterranean and is the ancestor of the modern Spanish Marine Infantry. Composition and characteristics A tercio in \\"bastioned square,\\" in battle Although other powers adopted the tercio formation, their armies fell short of the fearsome reputation of the Spanish, who possessed a core of professional soldiers, which gave them an edge that was hard for other states to match.Lynch, John. The Hispanic World in Crisis and Change, 1578‚Äì1700 Cambridge: Blackwell, 1992. Page 117. That army was further supplemented by \\"an army of different nations\\", a reference to the fact that many of the troops were from the German states, and the Italian and Walloon territories of the Spanish Netherlands, as was characteristic of European warfare before the levies of the Napoleonic Wars. In the 16th and 17th centuries, however, the core of Spanish armies were formed by Spanish subjects, who were frequently praised by others for their cohesiveness, superiority in discipline and overall professionalism.Davies, T. R. 1961 =Formations= Schematic battle formation of a Tercio around 1600. Within the tercio, ranks of pikemen arrayed themselves together into a hollow pike square (cuadro) with swordsmen ‚Äì typically equipped with a short sword, a buckler, and javelins ‚Äì inside; as the firearm rose in prominence, the swordsmen declined and were phased out. The arquebusiers (later, musketeers) were usually split up in several mobile groups called \\"sleeves\\" (mangas) and typically deployed with one manga at each corner of the cuadro. By virtue of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed the staying power of its pike-armed infantry, the ranged firepower of its arquebusiers, as well as the ability to conduct assaults with sword-and-buckler men. In addition to its inherent ability to repulse cavalry and other units along its front, the long-range firepower of its arquebusiers could also be easily shifted to the flanks, making it versatile in both offensive and defensive evolutions, as demonstrated by the success of the tercios at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. battle of Nieuwpoort 1600. Groups of tercios were typically arrayed in dragon-toothed formation (staggered, with the leading edge of one unit level with the trailing edge of the preceding unit; see the similar hedgehog defence concept). This enabled enfilade lines of fire and somewhat defiladed the army units themselves. Odd units alternated with even units, respectively one forward and one back, providing gaps for an unwary enemy to enter and outflank itself, where it would become subjected to the combined direct and raking crossfire from the guns of three separate tercios. From their inception, tercio formations were meant to co-ordinate their field operations with cavalry. = Leadership of the Tercio = Officers of a tercio: an alabardero, alf√©rez and arcabucero Mirroring military organization today, the tercio was led by a Maestre de Campo appointed by the King as the commanding officer and guarded by eight halberdiers. Assisting him was the sergeant major and a Furir Major in charge of logistics and armaments, with companies led by a Captain, also of royal appointment, with an Ensign in charge of the company color. Companies had Sergeants, Furrieles (Furirs) and Corporals in them. The Sergeants served as seconds-in-command of the company and brought the captain's orders to his soldiers; the Furrieles were at orders to provide the necessary weapons and munitions, as well as additional men to the companies; and the Corporals, who led groups of 25 (similar to today's platoons), were always in obedience to the Captain's orders and brought to him any possible cases of disorder in the unit. Each company had corps of drums made up of drummers and fifers, sounding duty calls in battle, with the drum major and fife major being provided by the tercio headquarters. The tercio staff included a medical component (made up of a professional medic, a barber, and surgeons), chaplains and preachers, and a judicial unit, plus military constables enforcing order. They all reported to the Maestre de campo directly.  Organization  Tercios that initially served in Italy and the Spanish Netherlands were organized into: * 10 companies of 300 led by Captains, in which ** 8 were Pikemen's Companies and ** 2 were of arquebusiers The companies were later reduced to 250-strong units. During the actions in the Netherlands, the tercios were reorganized into three coronelias (\\"colonelcies\\"), led by coronels (\\"colonels\\") each composed of a headquarters unit and four companies each (the predecessor of today's battalions), but as a whole continued to be subdivided into the same 10 companies of 250 personnel each, two of arquebusiers and 8 of pikemen. Colonels were also of royal appointment. Staff Organization of a Tercio.

They were made up of volunteers and built up around a core of professional soldiers and were highly trained. Sometimes later tercios did not stick to the all-volunteer model of the regular Imperial Spanish army ‚Äì when the Habsburg king Philip II found himself in need of more troops, he raised a tercio of Catalan criminals to fight in Flanders,Lynch, John. Spain Under the Habsburgs, Volume One: Empire and Absolutism, 1516 to 1598. Oxford: Blackwell, 1964. Page 109. a trend he continued with most Catalan criminals for the rest of his reign.Lynch, Spain Under the Habsburgs page 200. A large proportion of the Spanish army (which by the later half of the 16th century was entirely composed of tercio units: Tercio of Savoy, Tercio of Sicily) was deployed in the Netherlands to quell the increasingly difficult rebellion against the Habsburgs. Ironically, many units of Spanish tercios became part of the problem rather than the solution when the time came to pay them: with the Spanish coffers depleted by constant warfare, units often mutinied. For example, in April 1576, just after winning a major victory, unpaid tercios mutinied and occupied the friendly town of Antwerp, in the so-called Spanish Fury at Antwerp and sacked it for three days.Israel, The Dutch Republic, p. 185. Completely reliant on his troops, the Spanish commander could only comply.Lynch, Spain Under the Habsburgs page 284. =Specialized Tercios= On 24 February 1537 the Tercio de Galeras (Tercio of Galleys) was created. Today, the Real Infanter√≠a de Marina (Spanish Marine Infantry) consider themselves successors of the legacy and heritage of the Galleys Tercios making it the oldest currently operating marines unit in the world. There were other units of naval tercios such as Tercio Viejo de Armada (Old Navy Tercio) or Tercio Fijo de la Mar de N√°poles (Permanent Sea Tercio of Naples). Such specialized units were needed for the protracted war with the Ottoman Empire over the entire Mediterranean. =Naming conventions= Most tercios were named according to the place where they were raised or first deployed: thus they were Tercio de Sicilia, de Lombard√≠a, de N√°poles (Tercio of Sicily, of Lombardy, of Naples) and so on. Other tercios were named for their commanding officer, such as Tercio de Moncada for its commander Miguel de Moncada (whose most famous soldier was Miguel de Cervantes). Some tercios were named by their main function, such as Galeras or Viejo de Armada. =Colours= File:Cross of Burgundy (Template).svg|The Cross of Burgundy was adopted as the symbol of the Tercios and the Spanish Empire.

In 1578, under the reorganization of the Portuguese Army conducted by King Sebastian, four ter√ßos were established: the Ter√ßo of Lisbon, the Ter√ßo of Estremadura, the Ter√ßo of Alentejo, and the Ter√ßo of Algarve. Each had about 2,000 men, formed into eight companies. The infantry of the army organized for the expedition to Morocco in 1578 was made up of these four ter√ßos together with the Ter√ßo of the Adventurers (totally made up of young nobles), three mercenary ter√ßos (the German, the Italian, and the Castilian), and a unit of elite sharpshooters of the Portuguese garrison of Tangier. This was the Portuguese force which fought the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir. While united with the Spanish Crown, from 1580 to 1640, Portugal kept the organization of ter√ßos, although the Army had declined. Several Spanish tercios were sent to Portugal; the principal of them, the Spanish infantry Tercio of the City of Lisbon, occupied the main fortresses of the Portuguese capital. The Ter√ßo of the Navy of the Crown of Portugal, the ancestor of the modern Portuguese Marines, was created in this period. After the restoration of Portuguese sovereignty in 1640, the Army was reorganized by King John IV of Portugal. The ter√ßos remained the basic units of the Portuguese infantry. Two types of ter√ßos were organized: the paid ter√ßos (first line permanent units) and the auxiliary ter√ßos (second line militia units). Portugal won the Restoration War with these ter√ßos. At the end of the 17th century, the ter√ßos were already organized as modern regiments. However, the first line ter√ßos were only transformed into regiments in 1707, during the War of the Spanish Succession ‚Äì after the Spanish tercios were transformed into regiments in 1704. The second line ter√ßos were only transformed into militia regiments in 1796. Some of the old ter√ßos are direct ancestors of modern regiments of the Portuguese Army. Evolution and replacement The Battle of Rocroi (1643) marked the end of the supremacy of the Spanish Tercios, painting by Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau picture The first challenge to the dominance of the Spanish tercios came at the Battle of Nieuwpoort (1600). The victor of Nieuwpoort, the Dutch stadtholder Maurice, Prince of Orange, believed he could improve on the tercio by combining its methods with the organisation of the Roman legion. These shallower linear formations brought a greater proportion of available guns to bear on the enemy simultaneously. The result was that the tercios at Nieuwpoort were badly damaged by the weight of Dutch firepower. Yet the Spanish army very nearly succeeded in spite of internal dissensions that had compromised its regular command. The Eighty Years' War (1568‚Äì1648) in the Low Countries continued to be characterized by sieges of cities and forts, while field battles were of secondary importance. Maurice's reforms did not lead to a revolution in warfare, but he had created an army that could meet the tercios on an even basis and that pointed the way to future developments. During the Thirty Years War (1618‚Äì1648) tercio formations began to be tested by more linear formations created and led by the brilliant Swedish soldier- king Gustavus Adolphus. However, eventually, the tried-and-true tactics and professionalism of the Spanish tercios defeated the Swedish army at the Battle of N√∂rdlingen (1634). Throughout its history, the tercio's composition and battlefield formations and tactics evolved to meet new challenges. Tercio formations with well-trained troops and good cavalry support continued to win major battles in the 17th century such as Wimpfen (1622), Fleurus (1622), Breda (1624), N√∂rdlingen (1634), Thionville (1639), Honnecourt (1641) and Valenciennes (1656). It was not until Rocroi (1643) that the Spanish tercio's reputation of near invincibility in open battle was shattered. Still, the Rocroi defeat was precipitated by the collapse of the supporting cavalry rather than the failure of the tercio's infantry. Tercios continued to win battles after Rocroi but their battlefield style continued to evolve. In this period steady improvements in firearms and field artillery were giving the shallower linear style an increasing advantage. By the late 17th century the tercios had adopted so much of the linear style that their battlefield formations and tactics often had little resemblance to the classic tercio formations and tactics of the previous century. In 1704, the regular Spanish tercios were transformed into regiments and the pikeman as an infantry type was dropped. Those of the reserves and the militia would later be transformed into similar organisations.

In the 1980s, a violent Gorkhaland movement within India led by the prominent Tamang Subhas Ghising was viewed as a security threat due to the proximity of the Siliguri Corridor. Madan Tamang, a Tamang-Indian politician and proponent for Gorkhaland statehood, was assassinated in 2010, with the West Bengal government placing blame on another Gorkhaland political party, in effect weakening the movement. Gorkhaland Territorial Administration was created in place of statehood in India.

Fraker and stars Klinton Spilsbury, Michael Horse and Christopher Lloyd. It is based on the story of The Lone Ranger, a Western character created by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker. Its producers outraged fans by not allowing actor Clayton Moore to wear the character's mask when making public appearances, and created further bad buzz when the dialogue of leading man Klinton Spilsbury was dubbed by another actor, James Keach. The film was a huge commercial failure, and Spilsbury has not appeared in any films since. Plot The outlaw Butch Cavendish (Christopher Lloyd) and his gang of outlaws ride into a Texas village, killing everyone except a young boy, John Reid (Klinton Spilsbury). A tribe of Comanche Indians takes John to their reservation, where one of the tribe's young braves, Tonto (Michael Horse) teaches him to shoot a bow and arrow with precision and how to track. The two eventually become blood brothers, and John later leaves the reservation. He goes on to become a Texas Ranger. Cavendish and his gang ambush a party of Rangers (Reid among them), killing all except Reid, who is rescued by Tonto. When John recovers from his wounds, he teaches himself to shoot with silver bullets, and he captures and tames a white horse, which he names Silver. He dedicates his life to fighting the crime that Cavendish represents. To this end, John becomes the great masked western hero, The Lone Ranger. With the help of Tonto, the pair go to rescue President Grant (Jason Robards) when Cavendish takes him hostage.

Custer Production =Development= The rights to the character had been bought in 1954 by Jack Wrather, an oil billionaire, and his wife Bonita Granville. They had made many attempts to create a Lone Ranger movie that would appeal to a modern audience, including making Tonto an equal partner and mentor to the Lone Ranger. By the late 1970s they believed that the story was ripe for retelling in an epic vein similar to Ilya and Alexander Salkind's Superman (1978), with the potential for sequels. In October 1977 Lew Grade announced he would make the film as part of a slate of movies worth $97 million, including Love and Bullets, Escape to Athena, and Raise the Titanic. Most of the films Grade would finance himself but Lone Ranger was a co production with Wrather. Grade said the Lone Ranger would likely be played by an unknown, after a wide talent search.FILM CLIPS: Lew Grade's $97 Million Projects Kilday, Gregg. Los Angeles Times 15 Oct 1977: b9.

Two of the movie's four screenwriters, Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, had previously created the hit TV series Charlie's Angels; they had also worked together on another hit series, Mannix. According to Larry McMurtry, novelist George MacDonald Fraser had written an excellent script for the film, but he was not credited in the finished film. =Casting= Actors considered for the lead included Stephen Collins, Nicholas Guest, and Bruce Boxleitner. The part eventually went to Klinton Spilsbury, a photographer who had studied art (particularly sculpting) in New York. Spilsbury, whose father was a football coach at the University of Arizona, had grown up on a ranch in Chihuahua, Mexico. Spilsbury signed to a three-picture deal. \\"He looked great in the mask, which seems like an odd thing to say,‚Äù Starger said. ‚ÄúBut that was important because we had to find an actor whose eyes were not close together. The mask doesn‚Äôt look good if the eyes are too close.‚Äù Tonto was played by Michael Horse, a silversmith by trade, whose only other acting experience had been a bit part in a Raquel Welch TV-movie. \\"For me this is an adventure and fun,\\" he said. \\"Who knows if I can act. I'll soon find out. And if I'm a flop I'll just go off fishing.\\" Horse would later make himself known as a supporting regular on David Lynch's prime-time soap opera Twin Peaks. =Shooting= This film was shot in New Mexico, Utah, and California starting April 1980. Many scenes were shot in Monument Valley. Spilsbury was reportedly difficult during the shoot. ‚ÄúHe came onto the set as if he was playing the role of a movie star,‚Äù says Lloyd. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know whether it was an affectation that he chose to bring with him, or whether he sincerely felt that that‚Äôs what was called for. And this was a problem from beginning to end. He did things that simply hindered the production.‚Äù This included getting involved in several brawls at night during the shoot. The movie's ballad-narration, The Man In The Mask, was performed by country music artist Merle Haggard, and composed by John Barry with lyrics written by Dean Pitchford of Footloose and Sing fame. The filmmakers were unhappy with Spilsbury's acting. \\"You just never believed what he was saying because he memorized the lines but he had never internalized them,‚Äù says Jim Van Wyck, who was a DGA assistant director trainee on the film. ‚ÄúIt was like he was reading the script, but the intonations were wrong.‚Äù This dialogue was eventually overdubbed for the entire movie by actor James Keach. \\"His inflections were a little strange, but I actually didn‚Äôt think he was that bad, to be honest with you,‚Äù says Keach. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt have him redo it. But it was a very well-paying job at the time, so I accepted it.‚Äù Five horses were used to play Silver.HEADING FOR A SILVER ROUNDUP Greco, Mike. Los Angeles Times 18 May 1980: t7. The film was part of a brief revival of the Western in 1980, which also included The Long Riders, Heaven's Gate and The Mountain Men.Back In The Saddle Again: Hollywood's $100-Million Stampede to Bring Back the Western BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN By Pat Dowell. The Washington Post 11 May 1980: H1. =Clayton Moore lawsuit= Part of the plan was to shoot a feature film with a new actor to replace the 65-year-old Clayton Moore, who had starred in the long-running and hugely successful television series for much of the 1950s. Wrather had a vision for the retelling of the story, and he felt that the profile of the character would be devalued by Moore's continuing to appear in costume, as he had done for many years entertaining children in hospitals and appearing at county and state fairs. Also, he did not want audiences to believe that the aging Moore would reprise his role as the Lone Ranger. The producers obtained a court injunction barring Moore from appearing in public with his trademark black mask. He was also permitted to sign autographs only as \\"The Masked Man.\\" Moore responded by changing his costume slightly and replacing the mask with similar-looking wraparound sunglasses, and by cross-litigating against Wrather. The suit was eventually dismissed. ‚ÄúI thought that was really kind of nasty and unnecessary,‚Äù said Christopher Lloyd. ‚ÄúNothing Moore was doing was really interfering with the film. I thought that was kind of terrible.‚Äù Release The film was to have been released by AFD. However that company shut down in February 1981 after a series of unsuccessful films, particularly Raise the Titanic (film), and the film would be released by Universal, along with other Grade movies like On Golden Pond and The Great Muppet Caper.Film Clips: Show- Biz Segue: From Agent To Studio Chief Pollock, Dale.

Los Angeles Times 11 Mar 1981: h1 Jack Wrather was good friends with Ronald and Nancy Reagan and the Reagans were to attend the premiere.

Los Angeles Times 19 May 1981: f2. Reception =Box office= The film was released in 1981 to massive negative publicity fueled by the above controversy and was one over a 1,000 screens. The opening week was considered a disaster, making only $4 million. The film ultimately grossed just $12 million against its $18 million budget. Other contributing factors were the lack of public interest in Westerns by the 1980s and alterations to some fundamental elements of the Lone Ranger's character, such as his trademark silver bullets being made into magical talismans in the movie instead of mere symbolism. Lew Grade, who invested in the movie, had managed to sell it to TV for $7.5 million, and also to HBO.Lew Grade, Still Dancing: My Story, William Collins & Sons 1987 p 259 Marvin Starger claimed the film cost $13 million rather than the reported $18 million but said with advertising and prints costing $10 million the film lost $10 million. Fraker never directed again and Spilsbury never acted again. =Critical= The film received generally mediocre reviews: Retrieved October 2, 2013. Time Out London said, \\"The mystery is how Fraker, a gifted cameraman who made a superb directing debut in Westerns with Monte Walsh, could produce such a clinker as this.\\" The Los Angeles Times said \\"you can have a very good time watching it.\\"LEGENDARY MASKED MAN RIDES AGAIN Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times 21 May 1981: k5. Lew Grade later wrote, in his autobiography Still Dancing: My Story, that he thought that the problem with the movie was that it took an hour and ten minutes before the Ranger first pulled on his mask. \\"The mistake was not dispensing with the legend in ten minutes and getting on with the action much earlier on,\\" his text said. =Awards and nominations= The film was nominated for, and won, several Golden Raspberry Awards: *Won: Worst Actor (Klinton Spilsbury) *Won: Worst New Star (Klinton Spilsbury) *Won: Worst Musical Score *Nominated: Worst Picture *Nominated: Worst \\"Original\\" Song (The Man in the Mask) Merchandise A novelization of the movie, written by Gary McCarthy and published by Ballantine Books, was released in 1981. The film was adapted into a newspaper comic published between 1981 and 1984 that was written by Cary Bates and illustrated by Russ Heath. A line of action figures was created by the toy company Gabriel in 1982, including Buffalo Bill Cody, Butch Cavendish, George Custer, The Lone Ranger, and Tonto.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects. Historical examples of work-related cancer clusters are well documented in the medical literature. Notable examples include: scrotal cancer among chimney sweeps in 18th century London; osteosarcoma among female watch dial painters in the 20th century; skin cancer in farmers; bladder cancer in dye workers exposed to aniline compounds; and leukemia and lymphoma in chemical workers exposed to benzene.Cancer Facts . National Cancer Institute. U.S. National Institutes of Health. Cancer cluster suspicions usually arise when members of the general public report that their family members, friends, neighbors, or coworkers have been diagnosed with the same or related cancers. State or local health departments will investigate the possibility of a cancer cluster when a claim is filed. In order to justify investigating such claims, health departments conduct a preliminary review. Data will be collected and verified regarding: the types of cancer reported, numbers of cases, geographic area of the cases, and the patients clinical history. At this point, a committee of medical professionals will examine the data and determine whether or not an investigation (often lengthy and expensive) is justified. In the U.S., state and local health departments respond to more than 1,000 inquiries about suspected cancer clusters each year. It is possible that a suspected cancer cluster may be due to chance alone; however, only clusters that have a disease rate that is statistically significantly greater than the disease rate of the general population are investigated. Given the number of inquiries it is likely that many of these are due to chance alone. It is a well-known problem in interpreting data that random cases of cancer can appear to form clumps that are misinterpreted as a cluster. A cluster is less likely to be coincidental if the case consists of one type of cancer, a rare type of cancer, or a type of cancer that is not usually found in a certain age group. Between 5% to 15% of suspected cancer clusters are statistically significant. Examples seem to form a pattern. In this randomly generated scatter graph, arcs and patterns appear to exist that have formed only by coincidence. Some of the larger or more well known cancer clusters include: * At least 700 cases of clear cell carcinoma caused by the prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol in the US in the mid 1900s. * The Camp Lejeune water contamination incident in which multiple chemicals were found in drinking water. The CDC found that marines stationed at the base had a 10% higher rate of cancer deaths than those stationed elsewhere.

Although he was viewed by some as a religious radical during the Somerset Protectorate, he entertained Queen Elizabeth I of England at Cobham Hall in 1559, signalling his acceptance of the moderate regime. Biography William Brooke was the son of George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham (d. 29 September 1558), and Anne Braye (d. 1 November 1558).. Before 1544, Brooke attended The King's School, Canterbury and Queens' College, Cambridge. He spent much of his younger life in Europe. In the early 1540s, he visited Padua. By 1545, William Brooke married Dorothy Neville, daughter of George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny, but the marriage was unhappy, and they later separated after 1553. At the end of the decade, he served in northern France, where his father was in charge of Calais, and in 1549, he accompanied William Paget's embassy to Brussels. Like his father, Brooke sympathized with the anti-Marian nobles; he sided with the rebels during Wyatt's rebellion, and the intervention of his brother-in-law, Henry Nevill, 6th Baron Bergavenny, was needed to keep him from prison. In 1555, he served as MP for Rochester. In the late 1550s, Brooke's opportunities expanded in a number of areas. His father died in 1558, when he was just over thirty, and he succeeded him as Baron Cobham. Soon after, his wife Dorothy died, and in 1560 at Whitehall, he was free to marry Frances Newton, the daughter of Sir John Newton of Barr's Court, Gloucestershire. Brook became Warden of the Cinque Ports, a position in which he wielded great power over a large number of seats in Parliament. Most important, the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, and his close friendship with William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, made him a powerful noble. When Queen Mary I of England had died, it was Queen Elizabeth who had deputed him to inform Queen Mary's husband, Philip II of Spain, of her death. This embassy was only the first in a long series of missions and intrigues. Along with William Cecil, he numbered among his friends some nobles, such as the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Arundel, whose loyalty to Queen Elizabeth was far from certain. Brooke suffered some months' house imprisonment as a result of a very tangential role in the Ridolfi plot. In 1578, he joined Francis Walsingham's failed mission to the Low Countries; on this mission, he presumably served as Cecil's agent. In the late 1580s, he helped John Whitgift search for the author of the Martin Marprelate tracts. Brooke was made a Knight of the Garter on 14 April 1585, and appointed to the Privy Council by 12 February 1586. He was involved in a minor capacity in the events that ended with the death of Mary, Queen of Scots. During the Armada crisis, he was on a diplomatic mission to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. In 1589, his eldest daughter Elizabeth married William Cecil's youngest son, Robert Cecil, who would later be made the Earl of Salisbury. By the early 1590s, Brooke had assumed a less active role in government. In 1592, Brooke's second wife Frances died. He succeeded Baron Hunsdon, as Lord Chamberlain in August 1596, and held the office until his death on 6 March 1597. During his time, William Brooke built Cobham Hall, a Tudor style mansion that remained in his family till the mid-17th century. Marriages and issue Portrait of William Brooke and his Family, 1567. William Brooke married firstly Dorothy Nevill (d. 22 September 1559), daughter of George Nevill, 5th Baron Bergavenny, by his third wife, Lady Mary Stafford, daughter of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham,. Through her father, Dorothy was the second-cousin of his father, George Brooke. By his first wife Dorothy, he had a daughter, Frances Brooke (b.1549), who married firstly Thomas Coppinger (1546‚Äì1580), and secondly Edward Becher (born c.1545). He married secondly Frances Newton, daughter of Sir John Newton and Margaret Poyntz. By his second wife Frances, he had four sons and three daughters: *Sir Maximilian Brooke (4 December 1560 ‚Äì July 1583), eldest son and heir, who predeceased his father, and died without issue. *Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham (22 November 1564 ‚Äì 24 January 1619), who married Lady Frances Howard (1566 ‚Äì July 1628), daughter of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, widow of Henry FitzGerald, Earl of Kildare, by whom he had no issue. *Sir William Brooke (11 December 1565 ‚Äì 1597) MP. Killed in duel. *Sir George Brooke (17 April 1568 ‚Äì 5 December 1603), who married firstly Elizabeth Burgh (died c. 1637), the eldest daughter and coheir of Thomas Burgh, 3rd Baron Burgh (d. 14 October 1597), by whom he had a son, William Brooke (1601‚Äì1643), and two daughters, Elizabeth Brooke and Frances Brooke. *Elizabeth Brooke (12 January 1562 - 24 January 1597), who married Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, by whom she had issue. *Frances Brooke (born 12 January 1562), who married firstly, John Stourton, 9th Baron Stourton (1553‚Äì1588), and secondly, as his second wife, Sir Edward More (1555-1623). *Margaret Brooke (2 June 1563 ‚Äì 1621), who married, as his second wife, Sir Thomas Sondes of Throwley, Kent (1544‚Äì1593), by whom she had a daughter, Frances Sondes (1592‚Äìc.1634), who married Sir John Leveson (d.1613). The husband of Margaret Brooke, Sir Thomas Sondes, became convinced that her daughter Frances was not his child, and levied a fine of his lands, thus effectively depriving Margaret of her jointure, and died a few months later. His brother and heir, Sir Michael Sondes, honoured Margaret's jointure, but the Sondes family never acknowledged her daughter Frances; and Margaret and Frances returned to Cobham Hall. Before he died in 1597, William Brooke made his second son Henry promise to care for his daughter Margaret, and she and her daughter remained at Cobham Hall on their own after his death. At an unknown date, Margaret went mad, and on 4 November 1602, it was reported that Doctor John Dee had been called in and 'hath delivered the Lady Sondes of a devil or of some other strange possession'. Nothing further is known of her circumstances, apart from the fact that 'the mad Lady Sondes' died in 1621, aged fifty-seven. Her daughter Frances had two daughters by Sir John Leveson, Christian and Frances. After Sir John Leveson's death, Frances married, as his first wife, Thomas Savile, who later became Earl of Sussex. There was no issue from the marriage.

They were played by comedians Paul Whitehouse and Harry Enfield respectively. They are parodies of a certain style of ageing celebrity BBC Radio 1 disc jockey who started out with the station in the 1960s and stayed there until the mid-1990s. The characters incorporated the personalities, character traits and lifestyles of several different real-life DJs. The characters reference such DJs as Tony Blackburn, Dave Lee Travis, Simon Bates, Alan Freeman, Mike Read, Peter Powell, Noel Edmonds and Jimmy Savile amongst others. Enfield's parody of Radio One's increasing irrelevance to the youth audience it supposedly catered for was a factor in 1990s controller of Radio One Matthew Bannister's decision to terminate the employment of many older presenters. The characters had their own TV special in 1994 in which Enfield retired them, reflecting the changes at Radio One. However they returned for Comic Relief in 1997. Whitehouse and Enfield also reprised their roles to present a special edition of Pick of the Pops in 2007, commemorating the 40th birthday of Radio 2 following the death of Alan Freeman. They have been called \\"one of the great comic creations of our time\\" Development Harry Enfield stated that his choice of characters for his show was a calculated move to gain the biggest possible audience by creating archetypes people could relate to. Whereas he aimed many of his characters at a young audience, Smashie and Nicey were created for a segment of the programme designed to appeal to \\"older people\\". Enfield described them as \\"a bit more highbrow\\" than the other characters. Character profile \\"Smashie and Nicey\\" are two disc jockeys working at Radio Fab FM, a parody of BBC Radio 1. Each sketch would involve the two talking a stereotypically, obsessively self-regarding disc jockey spiel: reminiscing about their careers, modestly shrugging off their many works of \\"charidee\\", and generally being bland and irrelevant, before using a fader (in the form of a giant lever) to play their favourite record \\"You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet\\" by Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive. The characters reference a stereotype of late 80s Radio 1 DJs, in that they are egotistical, bland, and out of touch with their younger listenership. = Mike Smash = Mike Smash, played by Whitehouse, was loosely based on Tony Blackburn, although he resembles Noel Edmonds and Mike Read in appearance, his vocalisation had similarities to Mike Read and pop star Cliff Richard. His DJ persona is shown as more lightweight and chirpy than Nice, although he is revealed as a troubled individual in private. The television special introduced elements of Noel Edmonds and Jimmy Savile into Smashie's character, with the Nice character played out similar stories to those from the lives of Mike Read, Bill Grundy and Kenny Everett. In the 1994 TV special, reflecting real events at Radio One, the DJs were sacked from Fab FM, in a manner that deliberately mirrored Simon Bates' and Dave Lee Travis' departure from Radio 1, being replaced with young, 'irreverent' DJs. They were banished to \\"Radio Quiet\\" and left to reminisce about the good old days and try to pretend to themselves that they were still a powerful cultural force. One notable catchphrase used by Smash was \\"lodda work for charidee\\" (but he doesn't want to talk about it). He also describes things \\"quite lidderally\\" (literally) and as \\"poptastic\\", \\"pop-a-doodle-doo\\", \\"popadopoulos\\" and other words beginning with \\"pop\\", which Nicey will change to \\"rock\\". = Dave Nice = Quasi-Australian-accented ageing rocker Dave (short for, it was eventually revealed, Davenport rather than David) Nice was a mixture of the then Radio 1 Rock Show presenter Alan Freeman (whose radio persona, perhaps deliberately, bordered on self-parody) and Simon Bates, with elements of Dave Lee Travis and Tommy Vance. Nice ‚Äî played by Enfield ‚Äî was portrayed as more aggressive and angry than Smash, liking heavy rock and being very opinionated. In the 1994 TV special Smashie and Nicey: The End of an Era he was shown to be a misanthropic alcoholic. He frequently mentions spending time with a \\"young friend\\" in his on-air chats with Smashie, and reveals in their private conversation during the record being played that the \\"young friends\\" are male. Appearances The characters first appeared in Harry Enfield's Television Programme in 1990 and continued to appear in the series for four years. The characters became very popular, appearing in adverts, featuring on their own compilation album, Let's Rock, and presenting the 30th anniversary special edition of Top of the Pops on New Year's Day 1994, They were deliberately dropped by Enfield in 1995 after the changes at Radio 1 had rendered the satire pointless, although they returned for Comic Relief in 1997. Whitehouse and Enfield also reprised their roles to present a special edition of Pick of the Pops on 30 September 2007, commemorating the 40th birthday of Radio 2 and following the death of Alan Freeman. Dale Winton made the opening announcement but was quickly evicted by Smashie and Nicey who proceeded to play the top 40 from 27 September 1967. During the show Nicey accidentally confessed to being gay (which was previously alluded to in the 1994 special, and may be an allusion to Alan Freeman's admission, also in 1994, that he had been bisexual before he became celibate). At the end of the show he emotionally begged the Controller of BBC Radio to give him a job, \\"even if it's only on Digital Radio 8\\" (a fictional station). Dave Nice briefly appeared in the 2015 special An Evening with Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse, revealing that he had been cleared of \\"all but one of the charges\\" by Operation Yewtree, echoing what had happened to Dave Lee Travis. Whitehouse reprised the role of Smashie for a two-part special Smashie's Xmastastic Playlist, which aired on Gold on 23 and 24 December 2017. It is revealed in these specials that Smashie is asexual.https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-12-23/paul-whitehouses-radio- dj-smashie-to-return-solo-to-tv-this-christmas/ =1994 TV special= A TV special named Smashie and Nicey: The End of an Era was shown on BBC1 in 1994. The special began in the 1960s, with Nicey presenting Blue Peter and dancing on stage with Freddie and the Dreamers in doctored footage of the band's appearance on the show performing \\"You Were Made For Me\\", interviewing The Beatles, and becoming a DJ on offshore station \\"Radio Geraldine\\" where Smashie was initially his teaboy. It combined elements from the careers of several real DJs, with Smashie seen hosting a Saturday night TV show called Smashie's House Party, a parody of Noel's House Party, and having turned his show into a plea for his wife (named specifically as \\"Tessa\\") to come back after she had left him, repeatedly playing Bobby Goldsboro's \\"Honey\\" (Tony Blackburn did precisely this in the mid-1970s when his wife, actress Tessa Wyatt, left him). Similarly, Nicey was revealed to have advertised \\"Deptford Draylons\\", alluding to Alan Freeman's ads for Brentford Nylons, to have interviewed the Sex Pistols (in doctored footage of their famous interview with Bill Grundy) and to have fronted The Dave Nice Video Show, a parody of The Kenny Everett Video Show. The duo were also said to have performed on the Band Aid single \\"Do They Know It's Christmas\\". Freeman himself made a cameo appearance, as did Blackburn, David Jensen and John Peel. The programme was repeated on BBC Two in August 2015, however some material (such as Smash asking a member of the Top of the Pops audience how old she was) was edited out. Relevance to Radio 1 at the time The sketches proved very popular, largely because they reflected the image that Radio 1 had at the time. Much of the station's output was widely considered dull and unchallenging, and the average age of both listeners and presenters had risen above thirty, when it was intended to cater to a young audience. When Matthew Bannister arrived at Radio 1 in 1993 with a mission to rejuvenate the station, he referred directly to the characters in stating that his goal was to rid it of its \\"Smashie and Nicey\\" image. Whitehouse later expressed his unease after being congratulated by BBC Director-General John Birt for assisting this process stating that Birt was a greater menace than any of the DJs who were \\"harmless\\". In 1993, Dave Lee Travis commented on the characters in Q magazine, saying \\"This Smashie and Nicey crap that they keep bringing up. Is that funny? It doesn't raise a smile with me.\\" See also *BBC Radio 1 in the 1990s *Harry Enfield *Harry Enfield's Television Programme  References  Comedy sketches Comedy television characters Fictional DJs Fictional radio personalities Television duos Harry Enfield ","title":"Smashie and Nicey"},{"id":"1001599","text":"Nasva, Estonia Ice sailing in the Netherlands in 1938. An iceboat (occasionally spelled ice boat or traditionally called an ice yacht) is a recreational or competition sailing craft supported on metal runners for traveling over ice. One of the runners is steerable. Originally, such craft were boats with a support structure, riding on the runners and steered with a rear blade, as with a conventional rudder. As iceboats evolved, the structure became a frame with a seat or cockpit for the iceboat sailor, resting on runners. Steering was shifted to the front. Because of their low resistance to forward motion over ice, iceboats are capable of speeds exceeding . Because of their speed, iceboats are used both for recreation and for racing. Racing craft typically carry one person. A related activity, land sailing, employs sailing craft similar to iceboats, but riding on wheels instead of runners. History Ice boat on Saint Lawrence River, Quebec City, ca 1858-1860 Classic iceboats on the alt=Several boats with their sails at various stages of dismantling surrounding a large vehicle with a wooded promontory behind them. In the far right upper background a portion of a bridge is visible Ice Boating in Toledo, Ohio The history of iceboating began in Europe in areas where smooth ice was found in the bays of the Baltic Sea and the canals of the Netherlands. Initially boats were used for commerce, but soon evolved into pleasure craft‚Äî\\"ice yachts\\". Ice sailing came to North America, where the sailing craft evolved into recreational and racing versions. = Venues = Iceboating began in the 17th century as a documented means of transport on the frozen Gulf of Riga and the canals of the Netherlands into the 18th century. Ice boats carried cargo on Dutch canals during the 17th century. The first iceboats were introduced on New York State's Hudson River in the United States in 1790, where the practice flourished as a sport. The first recorded boat, built in 1790 by Oliver Booth of Poughkeepsie, was a square box atop three runners, the two forward runners being nailed to the box and the third acted as a rudder operated by a tiller. This type of craft was accessible to sportsmen of modest means. In the mid-19th century, two \\"ice yachting\\" clubs had formed, the Poughkeepsie Ice Yacht Club (1865) and the Hudson River Ice Yacht Club (1870), where wealthy boat owners sailed large iceboats with up to seven crew members. Boats were as long as and sailed as fast as , a record exceeding any other conveyance in 1885, set by the Icicle. The first American Challenge Pennant occurred in 1881 on the Hudson river with five ice-yacht clubs competing. Races were sailed five times around a triangular course with one-mile legs, two of which were to windward. Iceboats were divided into four classes with sail areas ranging from less than 300 square feet to over 600 square feet. By the beginning of the 20th century, iceboating had spread to Minnesota (Lake Minnetonka and White Bear Lake), Wisconsin (Lake Winnebago and Lake Pepin) and venues in Maine and Vermont. In Canada, there were venues on Lake Ontario (Kingston) and the Saint Lawrence River. A European ice sailing club formed first in Sweden (1901), followed by the European Ice Yachting Union, which formed in 1928 with member states Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden, Austria, and Germany. = Evolution of design = Dutch Iceboats, 17th century 17th-century Dutch ice yachts consisted of flat-bottomed sailboats atop a cross-wise plank, resting on outboard metal runners, which carried the bulk of the weight of the craft. At the stern was a steering runner, attached to a rudder-like structure. to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at bow, stern and each end of the planking. These boats used conventional gaff mainsails and jibs, attached to the mast by travellers. A tiller or wheel stern controls the steering runner. In the 19th century iceboats evolved into a box, riding on cross-pieces, supported by runners. These \\"stern-steerer\\" iceboats were generally rigged as sloops, with a jib sail forward of the mast, although the catboat style with a single sail was also used. In 1879 the archetypical Hudson River iceboat began to emerge. The Robert Scott, designed and built by H. Relyea, had a single backbone and wire guy-ropes. The mast on subsequent boats were stepped further forward than in the past with shortened jibs were shortened and the center of effort and resistance brought into balance, aligning both with the main runners. The shallow cockpit box became elliptical. In the early 1900s some smaller iceboats, called scooters, were designed to traverse both ice and water with a shallow, oval hull on fixed runners. These sailing craft were steered by manipulating the sails, there being no rudder. The traditional stern-steerer boats were largely replaced by front steering boats in the 1930s, following the development of this style by Walter Beauvois of Williams Bay, Wisconsin in a boat named the Beau Skeeter. This boat led to the \\"Skeeter\\" class, and the Skeeter Ice Boat Club formed on Geneva Lake, Wisconsin. The Skeeter class adopted the logo of a mosquito on their sail, and has evolved into an aerodynamically clean machine. The Skeeter class is limited to just of sail. In 1937, The Detroit News sponsored a new home-buildable ice boat design, which became the International DN. In 1968 Dick Slates of Pewaukee, Wisconsin designed and built the Nite with two wooden prototypes. The design was refined and fiberglass production began in 1970. Speed Diagram of apparent wind (VA) on an iceboat on different points of sail Iceboats designs dating from the mid 20th century onwards typically consist of a triangular or cross-shaped frame, supported by three skate blades called \\"runners\\", with the steering runner in front. Runners are made of iron or steel with sharpened edges, which hold onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails, as they develop propulsive lift. Given their low forward resistance, iceboats can sail up to five times the speed of the true wind. Because the velocity of the iceboat (VB) is so much greater than the true wind velocity (VT), the apparent wind (VA) is only a few degrees from the direction of travel on most points of sail and the sail is close-hauled in each. VA is generated by the combination of iceboat velocity (VB) and true wind velocity (VT).See page 204 of = Attainable speeds = Different classes of iceboat can achieve speeds, as follow. * International DN: . * Classic iceboats and Skeeters: . Record: Das Boot, . Record: classic iceboat, Debutaunte, . = Race courses = Because of the high boat speeds, iceboat race courses are established around fixed marks which are to be rounded in a one-way route, enhancing boat-to-boat traffic safety. The courses are a straight line upwind and downwind, which necessitates tacking upwind and jibing downwind. Classes IceOptimists International DN class iceboats at the start of a race in Znin, Poland Monotype XV Among the classes of iceboat are sailing craft that have associations in Europe and North America: IceOptimist, International DN, and Monotype XV. Others are regional in North America: Nite, Renegade, and Skeeter. = IceOptimist = The IceOptimist is a youth iceboat class that uses the sails and the rig of the International Optimist dinghy. The first design was built in Estonia in 1978, with scaled-down elements of a DN. In 2002, the class was registered under the guardianship of IDNIYRA Europe with the permission of IODA. World and European Championships are sailed each winter with a fleet of approximately 40 racers. = International DN = The International DN class is the most popular class in both North America and Europe. It is a one-person wood boat twelve feet long with a cross-plank eight feet long that carries a mast high. Modern competitive DNs use flexible masts commonly made of composite materials. The DN 60 derives its name from the 1937 request of The Detroit News for a high-performance, inexpensive, home-built iceboat design. Modern DNs share many one-design features with the original boat, including the basic aerodynamic fuselage design, runner configurations and of high-performance sail. = Monotype XV = The Monotype XV is a class of stern-steering iceboat based on a 1932 design by Estonian, Erik von Holst. It may be single or double-handed. The one-design class is built according to close specifications, little changed since the 1930s. It is the largest one- design iceboat class in Europe and the only double-handed iceboat class for which there are international championships. The is in length and width with a high mast. = Nite = Nite is a class of iceboat that has a two-seat side- by-side fiberglass fuselage and a sail. It is constructed according to tight specifications. = Renegade = The Renegade is a class of home-built iceboat whose prototype appeared in 1947 in Wisconsin, designed by Elmer Millenbach to be carried atop an automobile. Plans were published in 1950. It has a sail on a flexible aerodynamic spar. = Skeeter = The Skeeter class is divided into sub-classes (A, B and C) all of which are limited to of sail area. A-class boats may be single or two-place tandem with a mast that does not exceed . They may incorporate carbon fiber construction. B-class boats have seats for two (side by side). C-class skeeters may be single or two-place tandem with a mast that does not exceed .

Early life Born in Orlando, Florida, his father gave him up to live in foster homes and reformatories after he was convicted of a petty crime. Knowles himself was first incarcerated at the age of 19, and in the years following, he spent more time in prison. In early 1974, Knowles was serving time at Raiford Prison in Florida (now known as Florida State Prison) when he began corresponding with a divorcee in San Francisco named Angela Covic, who made a trip to the prison to visit Knowles. Upon her arrival, Knowles proposed to Covic. After she accepted his proposal, she became instrumental in getting Knowles released from prison by paying for his legal counsel. Upon his release, Knowles flew directly to California to be with her. After a psychic warned her of the entry of a new dangerous man in her life, Covic ended the relationship and called off the wedding. Although this has never been verified, Knowles claimed to have murdered three people on the streets of San Francisco the night that Covic broke off their relationship. Devastated by the rejection, Knowles returned to Jacksonville, Florida. He was soon arrested after stabbing a bartender during a fight, but he picked a lock in his detention cell and escaped on July 26, 1974. Murders Knowles' cross-country murder spree began in Jacksonville on the night of his escape. He broke into the home of 65-year-old Alice Curtis, bound and gagged her, ransacked her home for money and valuables, then stole her car. Curtis choked to death on her gag. On the street where he intended to abandon the car, Knowles recognized family acquaintances Lillian and Mylette Anderson. Lillian was eleven years old and her sister Mylette was seven. In fear that they would identify him, he kidnapped them both, strangled them, and buried their bodies in a nearby swamp. = August = Knowles claimed that, soon after this, he murdered a teenaged girl who was walking home, but at the time of this confession he did not identify her to police. On December 21, 2011, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation identified her as 13-year-old Ima Jean Sanders, who had run away from Beaumont, Texas in July 1974 to be with her mother in Warner Robins, Georgia and then disappeared on August 1, 1974. On August 2, 1974, the day after the Anderson sisters disappeared, Knowles met Marjorie Howie, 49, in Atlantic Beach, Florida. She either invited him or was forced by him to go to her apartment, where he strangled her with a nylon stocking and stole her television set. On August 23, 1974, Knowles showed up in Musella, Georgia, and forced his way into the home of Kathie Sue Pierce, who was there with her three-year-old son. Knowles strangled Pierce, but left her child physically unharmed. = September = On September 3, 1974, Knowles entered Scott's Inn, a roadside pub near Lima, Ohio and met William Bates, a 32-year-old account executive for Ohio Power Company. The bartender, who knew Bates, recalled that Bates and a young redheaded man had several drinks that evening and left together. Bates' wife then reported him missing, and the police realized that his car was missing as well. Near the bar, police found an abandoned car that was subsequently traced back to Alice Curtis. In October, Bates' nude body was found. He had been strangled and dumped in the woods. Now driving Bates' car, he moved on to a campground in Ely, Nevada, where, on September 18, 1974, he bound and shot two elderly campers, Emmett and Lois Johnson. Because it was a seemingly random murder, there were no leads until Knowles later confessed to the crime, although he did use their credit cards for a short period to pay his expenses. On September 21, 1974, Knowles' killing spree continued, this time in Seguin, Texas. There, he came upon stranded motorcyclist Charlynn Hicks, whom he abducted and raped before strangling her with her own pantyhose and dragging her body through a barbed- wire fence. Her body was found four days later. Traveling then to Birmingham, Alabama, Knowles met beautician Ann Dawson on September 23, 1974. It is unclear as to whether he abducted her or if she traveled with him willingly, but she paid the bills while they traveled together until he killed her on September 29, 1974. Knowles claims to have dumped her body into the Mississippi River, but it was never recovered. = October = Knowles arrived in Marlborough, Connecticut in the middle of October, 1974, where he continued his vicious killing spree. He entered the home of Karen Wine and her 16-year- old daughter Dawn on October 16, where he bound and raped them, before killing them with a nylon stocking. The only thing found missing from their home was a tape recorder. By October 18, 1974, Knowles had made his way to Woodford, Virginia, where he broke into the home of 53-year-old Doris Hosey and shot her to death with her husband's rifle, then wiped his prints from the gun and placed it beside her body. Afterward, police would find no signs of robbery to offer them a motive in the case. Still driving William Bates' stolen car, Knowles picked up two hitchhikers in Key West, Florida with the intention of killing them both, but his plan went awry when a policeman stopped him for a traffic violation. Unaware of who he was dealing with, the officer let Knowles go with a warning. Shaken by the experience, Knowles had mercy on his victims and dropped them off in Miami, Florida and contacted his lawyer shortly thereafter. He rejected his lawyer's suggestion of surrender, but arranged a meeting with him that lasted only long enough to hand over a taped confession. He slipped out of town before police were informed of his presence. = November = On November 6, 1974 in Milledgeville, Georgia, Knowles befriended Carswell Carr and was invited back to Carr's house to spend the night. Over drinks, he stabbed Carr to death and then strangled Carr's 15-year-old daughter. After murdering the girl, Knowles attempted to engage in necrophilia with her corpse. In the wake of his flight from Macon, Knowles was suspected in the November 2nd murder of hitchhiker Edward Hillard, found in some nearby woods, and his companion Debbie Griffin, whose body has never been recovered. While bar-hopping in Atlanta on November 8, Knowles met British journalist Sandy Fawkes, impressing her with his looks which were a \\"cross between Robert Redford and Ryan O'Neal\\". They spent the night together, but, he was repeatedly unable to perform when they attempted to have sex over the next few days, suggesting impotence with a willing companion. They parted ways on November 10, but the next day Knowles picked up an acquaintance of Fawkes, Susan Mackenzie, and demanded sex from her at gunpoint. She escaped and notified police, but when patrolmen tried to stop him, Knowles brandished a sawed-off shotgun and made his escape. Days later, in West Palm Beach, Florida, he invaded the home of invalid Beverly Mabee, where he abducted her sister and stole their car. From there, he traveled to Fort Pierce, Florida, arriving the following night. He dropped off his hostage without harm or incident. Capture of Knowles On the morning of November 16, Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Charles Eugene Campbell recognized the stolen car near Perry, Florida and attempted to make an arrest, but after he was pulled over, Knowles was able to wrestle the officer's pistol away from him. Taking Campbell hostage, he drove away in his patrol car, later using its siren to stop motorist James Meyer in order to ditch the Highway Patrol vehicle and continue in a less conspicuous automobile. Now burdened with two prisoners, Knowles took the two men into a remote, wooded area in Pulaski County, Georgia and handcuffed them to a tree before shooting each of them in the head at close range. Shortly thereafter, Knowles crashed the car through a police roadblock (the roadblock was set up by Henry County Chief Detective Philip S. Howard and Officer Jerry Key) in Henry County, Georgia after being involved in a car chase with Henry County sheriff‚Äôs Deputy Charles Hancock. He escaped the vehicle on foot and fired shots at the pursuing officers. Knowles was shot in the foot during his escape and Officer Jerry Key was injured when Knowles stolen car crashed into his patrol car. A chaotic footrace ensued, with Knowles pursued by dogs, law enforcement officers from several agencies, and helicopters. Knowles was finally cornered on November 17 by 27-year-old former Vietnam War Veteran and hospital maintenance worker David Clark, an armed civilian with a shotgun several miles (kilometers) from the focused area of the search, who escorted Knowles to Joe and Becky Stonecypher's nearby house where Becky Stonecypher made a phone call to the police and was handcuffed by Henry County Investigators Paul Robbins and Billy Payne. Knowles was outside of the perimeter established for the manhunt and would have escaped if not for the actions of the local citizens. Once in custody, Knowles claimed to be responsible for 35 murders, but only 20 were ever corroborated.  Death  On December 18, 1974, Sheriff Earl Lee and Agent Ronnie Angel from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation were travelling down Interstate 20 with Knowles, who was handcuffed in the back seat. Their destination was Henry County, Georgia, where Knowles had, per a Georgia GBI press release, admitted to dumping a handgun he had taken from Florida State Trooper Charles Eugene Campbell, after killing him with it. The GBI reported, \\"Knowles grabbed Lee's handgun, discharging it through the holster in the process and while Lee was struggling with Knowles and attempting to keep control of the vehicle, Angel fired three shots into Knowles' chest, killing him instantly\\".

Biography Major Greenwood junior was born in Shoreditch in London's East End, the only child of Major Greenwood, a doctor in general practice there (\\"Major\\" was his forename, not a military rank.) and his wife Annie, daughter of Peter Lodwick Burchell, F.R.C.S., M.B., L.S.A.Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th ed., vol. I, 1965, pg 338-343, 'Greenwood formerly of Haddenham' pedigree The Greenwood family is recorded back to the twelfth century in the person of Wyomarus Greenwode, of Greenwode Leghe, near Heptonstall, Yorkshire, caterer to the Empress Maude in 1154. Greenwood was educated on the classical side at Merchant Taylors' School and went on to study medicine at University College London and the London Hospital. On qualifying in 1904 he worked for a time as assistant to his father but after a few months he gave up clinical practice for good. He went to work as a demonstrator for the physiologist Leonard Hill (father of the future statistician Austin Bradford Hill) at the London Hospital Medical College. Leonard Hill recalled, \\"By recognising the ability of a student with nothing behind him to show his worth and by appointing him my assistant I may claim to have started Greenwood on his career.\\" While Greenwood made a good start in physiological research he was already drawn to statistics; his first paper in Biometrika appeared in 1904. After a period of study with Karl Pearson he was appointed statistician to the Lister Institute in 1910. There he worked on a wide range of problems, including a study of the effectiveness of inoculation with the statistician Udny Yule. In the First World War Greenwood first served in the Royal Army Medical Corps but then was put in charge of a medical research unit at the Ministry of Munitions. There he investigated the health problems associated with factory work, one result of which was an influential study of accidents which he produced with Yule. In 1919 Greenwood joined the newly created Ministry of Health with responsibility for medical statistics. He co-authored a number of papers (see publications) with Ethel Newbold during his tenure there (and wrote a touching obituary for her on her early death in 1933). In 1928 he became the first professor of Epidemiology and Vital Statistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine where he stayed until he retired in 1945. He established a group of researchers, of whom the most important was Austin Bradford Hill. Greenwood played the same role in A. B. Hill‚Äôs career as Hill‚Äôs father had played in his. The Royal Society awarded the Buchanan Medal to Greenwood in 1927, and elected him a Fellow in 1928. The election certificate stated > Engaged in medical research. Has applied the statistical method to the > elucidation of many problems of physiology, pathology, hygiene and > epidemiology. Is the author, or joint author, of more than sixty papers > dealing with these applications, including important contributions to the > experimental study of epidemiology (Journ Hyg, 24, 1925, Greenwood and > Topley; ibid, 25, 1926, Greenwood, Newbold, Topley and Wilson). Has done > much to encourage and develop the use of modern statistical methods by > medical laboratory investigators, and, as Chairman of the Medical Research > Council's Statistical Committee, to secure the adequate planning and > execution of field investigations. He was elected President of the Royal Statistical Society in 1934 and awarded its Guy Medal in Gold in 1945. Greenwood produced a large body of research, was the first holder of important positions in modern medical statistics and wrote extensively on the history of his subject, but as Austin Bradford Hill wrote in his obituary, \\"in the future, it may well indeed seem that one of his greatest contributions, if not the greatest, lay merely in his outlook, in his statistical approach to medicine, then a new approach and one long regarded with suspicion. And he fought this fight continuously and honestly‚Äîfor logic for accuracy, for ‚Äòlittle sums.‚Äô\\" His name is attached to the Greenwood formula for the variance or standard error (SE) of the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier estimator of survival.Kaplan, Edward L. in a retrospective on the seminal paper in \\"This week's citation classic\\". Current Contents 24, 14 (1983). Available from UPenn as PDF. A statistical method invented by Major Greenwood in a statistical study of infectious diseases is still used in present-day research. The Greenwood statistic was used to discover that there is some kind of order in the placement of genes on the chromosomes of living things and this inspired a new look at epigenetics, which is now considered to be as important as genetics in how living organisms develop and evolve. Greenwood lived at Loughton, where among his neighbours were Sir Frank Baines, Millais Culpin, and Leonard Erskine Hill. Publications   \\\\ * Edgar L. Collis and Major Greenwood.

Radical beginnings  Zasulich was born in Mikhaylovka, in the Smolensk Governorate of the Russian Empire, as one of four daughters of an impoverished minor noble. When she was 3, her father died and her mother sent her to live with her wealthier relatives, the Mikulich family, in Byakolovo. After graduating from high school in 1866, she moved to Saint Petersburg, where she worked as a clerk. Soon she became involved in radical politics and taught literacy classes for factory workers. Her contacts with the Russian revolutionary leader Sergei Nechaev led to her arrest and imprisonment in 1869. After Zasulich was released in 1873, she settled in Kiev, where she joined the Kievan Insurgents, a revolutionary group of Mikhail Bakunin's anarchist supporters, and became a respected leader of the movement. As her lifelong friend and fellow revolutionary Lev Deich wrote: :Because of her intellectual development, and particularly she was so well read, Vera Zasulich was more advanced than the other members of the circle.... Anyone could see that she was a remarkable young woman. You were struck by her behavior, particularly by the extraordinary sincerity and unaffectedness of her relations with others.\\"Lev Deich. \\"Yuzhnye buntari\\" in Golos Minuvshego, Vol. 9, p.54. Quoted in Five Sisters: Women Against the Tsar, eds. Barbara A. Engel, Clifford N. Rosenthal, Routledge, 1975, reprinted in 1992, , pp.61-62.  Trepov incident  In July 1877, a political prisoner, Alexei Bogolyubov, refused to remove his cap in the presence of Colonel Fyodor Trepov, the governor of St. Petersburg famous for his suppression of the Polish rebellions in 1830 and 1863. In retaliation, Trepov ordered Bogolyubov to be flogged, which outraged not only revolutionaries but also sympathetic members of the intelligentsia. A group of six revolutionaries plotted to kill Trepov, but Zasulich was the first to act. She and her fellow social revolutionary, Maria (Masha) Kolenkina, were planning to shoot two government representatives: the prosecutor Vladislav Zhelekhovskii in the Trial of the 193 and another enemy of the populist movement. Following the Bogolyubov flogging, they decided that the second target should be Trepov.Barbara A. Engel and Clifford N. Rosenthal \\"Five Sisters: Women Against the Tsar\\" (1975), p.61. Waiting until after the verdict was announced at the Trial of 193, on 24 January 1878 they went for their respective targets. Kolenkina's attempt against Zhelekhovskii failed, but Zasulich used a British Bulldog revolver and shot and seriously wounded Trepov.Ana Siljak, Angel of Vengeance: the \\"Girl Assassin,\\" the Governor of St. Petersburg, and Russia's Revolutionary World (2008), p. 2, 10-11. At her widely publicized trial, presided over by the prominent liberal judge Anatoly Koni, the sympathetic jury found Zasulich not guilty, an outcome that tested the effectiveness of the judicial reform of Alexander II. On one interpretation, it demonstrated the courts' ability to stand up to the authorities. However, Zasulich also had a very good lawyer, who turned the case on its head so that it \\"very soon became obvious that it was Colonel Trepov rather than his would-be assassin who was really being tried\\".Adam B. Ulam, In the Name of the People: Prophets and Conspirators in Prerevolutionary Russia (1977) That Trepov and the government now appeared as the guilty party demonstrated the ineffectiveness of both the courts and the government. Fleeing before she could be rearrested and retried, Zasulich became a hero to populists and the radical part of the Russian society. Despite her previous record, she was against the terror campaign that would eventually lead to the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881.  Conversion to Marxism  After the trial had been annulled, Zasulich fled to Switzerland, where she became a Marxist and co-founded the Emancipation of Labour group with Georgi Plekhanov and Pavel Axelrod in 1883. The group commissioned Zasulich to translate a number of Karl Marx's works into Russian, which contributed to the growth of Marxist influence among Russian intellectuals in the 1880s and 1890s and was one of the factors that led to the creation of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1898. In mid-1900, the leaders of the radical wing of the new generation of Russian Marxists, Julius Martov, Vladimir Lenin and Alexander Potresov, joined Zasulich, Plekhanov and Axelrod in Switzerland. In spite of the tensions between the two groups, the six founded Iskra, a revolutionary Marxist newspaper, and formed its editorial board. They were opposed to the more moderate Russian Marxists (known as \\"economists\\") as well as ex-Marxists like Peter Struve and Sergei Bulgakov and spent much of 1900‚Äì1903 debating them in Iskra.  Menshevik leader  The Iskra editors were successful in convening a pro-Iskra Second Congress of the RSDLP in Brussels and London in 1903. However, Iskra supporters unexpectedly split during the Congress and formed two factions, Lenin's Bolsheviks and Martov's Mensheviks, Zasulich siding with the latter. She returned to Russia after the 1905 Revolution, but her interest in revolutionary politics waned. She entered the independent Yedinstvo-faction of her old friend PlekhanovSee Leopold H. Haimson. The Making of Three Russian Revolutionaries, Cambridge University Press, 1987, , p.472, note 6. in early 1914. As a member of this small faction, Zasulich supported the Russian war effort during World War I and opposed the October Revolution of 1917. In the winter of 1919, a fire broke out in her room. She was accommodated by two sisters who lived in the same courtyard, but she developed pneumonia and died in Petrograd on 8 May 1919. In his book Lenin, Leon Trotsky, who was friendly with Zasulich in London in 1900, wrote: > Sasulich was a curious person and a curiously attractive one.

The first high power electronic devices were mercury-arc valves. In modern systems, the conversion is performed with semiconductor switching devices such as diodes, thyristors, and power transistors such as the power MOSFET and IGBT. In contrast to electronic systems concerned with transmission and processing of signals and data, in power electronics substantial amounts of electrical energy are processed. An AC/DC converter (rectifier) is the most typical power electronics device found in many consumer electronic devices, e.g. television sets, personal computers, battery chargers, etc. The power range is typically from tens of watts to several hundred watts. In industry a common application is the variable speed drive (VSD) that is used to control an induction motor. The power range of VSDs start from a few hundred watts and end at tens of megawatts. The power conversion systems can be classified according to the type of the input and output power * AC to DC (rectifier) * DC to AC (inverter) * DC to DC (DC-to-DC converter) * AC to AC (AC-to-AC converter)  History  Power electronics started with the development of the mercury arc rectifier. Invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902, it was used to convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). From the 1920s on, research continued on applying thyratrons and grid-controlled mercury arc valves to power transmission. Uno Lamm developed a mercury valve with grading electrodes making them suitable for high voltage direct current power transmission. In 1933 selenium rectifiers were invented. Julius Edgar Lilienfeld proposed the concept of a field-effect transistor in 1926, but it was not possible to actually construct a working device at that time. In 1947, the bipolar point- contact transistor was invented by Walter H. Brattain and John Bardeen under the direction of William Shockley at Bell Labs. In 1948 Shockley's invention of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) improved the stability and performance of transistors, and reduced costs. By the 1950s, higher power semiconductor diodes became available and started replacing vacuum tubes. In 1956 the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) was introduced by General Electric, greatly increasing the range of power electronics applications. By the 1960s, the improved switching speed of bipolar junction transistors had allowed for high frequency DC/DC converters. R. D. Middlebrook made important contributions to power electronics. In 1970, he founded the Power Electronics Group at Caltech. He developed the state-space averaging method of analysis and other tools crucial to modern power electronics design.http://www.ieee- pels.org/pels-news/220-professor-r-d-middlebrook-passed-away = Power MOSFET = A breakthrough in power electronics came with the invention of the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. Generations of MOSFET transistors enabled power designers to achieve performance and density levels not possible with bipolar transistors. Due to improvements in MOSFET technology (initially used to produce integrated circuits), the power MOSFET became available in the 1970s. In 1969, Hitachi introduced the first vertical power MOSFET, which would later be known as the VMOS (V-groove MOSFET). From 1974, Yamaha, JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba began manufacturing audio amplifiers with power MOSFETs. International Rectifier introduced a 25 A, 400 V power MOSFET in 1978.Jacques Arnould, Pierre Merle Dispositifs de l'√©lectronique de puissance, √âditions Herm√®s, (in French) This device allows operation at higher frequencies than a bipolar transistor, but is limited to low voltage applications. The power MOSFET is the most common power device in the world, due to its low gate drive power, fast switching speed, easy advanced paralleling capability, wide bandwidth, ruggedness, easy drive, simple biasing, ease of application, and ease of repair. It has a wide range of power electronic applications, such as portable information appliances, power integrated circuits, cell phones, notebook computers, and the communications infrastructure that enables the Internet. In 1982, the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) was introduced. It became widely available in the 1990s. This component has the power handling capability of the bipolar transistor and the advantages of the isolated gate drive of the power MOSFET.  Devices  The capabilities and economy of power electronics system are determined by the active devices that are available. Their characteristics and limitations are a key element in the design of power electronics systems. Formerly, the mercury arc valve, the high-vacuum and gas-filled diode thermionic rectifiers, and triggered devices such as the thyratron and ignitron were widely used in power electronics. As the ratings of solid-state devices improved in both voltage and current-handling capacity, vacuum devices have been nearly entirely replaced by solid-state devices. Power electronic devices may be used as switches, or as amplifiers.Muhammad H. Rashid,POWER ELECTRONICS HANDBOOK DEVICES, CIRCUITS, AND APPLICATIONS Third Edition The structure introduced in this work is a multilevel inverter, which uses Separate DC Sources. The multilevel inverter using cascaded-inverter with SDCS synthesizes a desired voltage from several independent sources of DC voltages, which may be obtained from batteries, fuel cells, or solar cells. This configuration recently becomes very popular in AC power supply and adjustable speed drive applications. This new inverter can avoid extra clamping diodes or voltage balancing capacitors.Butterworth-Heinemann,2007 An ideal switch is either open or closed and so dissipates no power; it withstands an applied voltage and passes no current, or passes any amount of current with no voltage drop. Semiconductor devices used as switches can approximate this ideal property and so most power electronic applications rely on switching devices on and off, which makes systems very efficient as very little power is wasted in the switch. By contrast, in the case of the amplifier, the current through the device varies continuously according to a controlled input. The voltage and current at the device terminals follow a load line, and the power dissipation inside the device is large compared with the power delivered to the load. Several attributes dictate how devices are used. Devices such as diodes conduct when a forward voltage is applied and have no external control of the start of conduction. Power devices such as silicon controlled rectifiers and thyristors (as well as the mercury valve and thyratron) allow control of the start of conduction, but rely on periodic reversal of current flow to turn them off. Devices such as gate turn-off thyristors, BJT and MOSFET transistors provide full switching control and can be turned on or off without regard to the current flow through them. Transistor devices also allow proportional amplification, but this is rarely used for systems rated more than a few hundred watts. The control input characteristics of a device also greatly affect design; sometimes the control input is at a very high voltage with respect to ground and must be driven by an isolated source. As efficiency is at a premium in a power electronic converter, the losses that a power electronic device generates should be as low as possible. Devices vary in switching speed. Some diodes and thyristors are suited for relatively slow speed and are useful for power frequency switching and control; certain thyristors are useful at a few kilohertz. Devices such as MOSFETS and BJTs can switch at tens of kilohertz up to a few megahertz in power applications, but with decreasing power levels. Vacuum tube devices dominate high power (hundreds of kilowatts) at very high frequency (hundreds or thousands of megahertz) applications. Faster switching devices minimize energy lost in the transitions from on to off and back, but may create problems with radiated electromagnetic interference. Gate drive (or equivalent) circuits must be designed to supply sufficient drive current to achieve the full switching speed possible with a device. A device without sufficient drive to switch rapidly may be destroyed by excess heating. Practical devices have non-zero voltage drop and dissipate power when on, and take some time to pass through an active region until they reach the \\"on\\" or \\"off\\" state. These losses are a significant part of the total lost power in a converter. Power handling and dissipation of devices is also a critical factor in design. Power electronic devices may have to dissipate tens or hundreds of watts of waste heat, even switching as efficiently as possible between conducting and non-conducting states. In the switching mode, the power controlled is much larger than the power dissipated in the switch. The forward voltage drop in the conducting state translates into heat that must be dissipated. High power semiconductors require specialized heat sinks or active cooling systems to manage their junction Temperature; exotic semiconductors such as silicon carbide have an advantage over straight silicon in this respect, and germanium, once the main- stay of solid-state electronics is now little used due to its unfavorable high temperature properties. Semiconductor devices exist with ratings up to a few kilovolts in a single device. Where very high voltage must be controlled, multiple devices must be used in series, with networks to equalize voltage across all devices. Again, switching speed is a critical factor since the slowest-switching device will have to withstand a disproportionate share of the overall voltage. Mercury valves were once available with ratings to 100 kV in a single unit, simplifying their application in HVDC systems. The current rating of a semiconductor device is limited by the heat generated within the dies and the heat developed in the resistance of the interconnecting leads. Semiconductor devices must be designed so that current is evenly distributed within the device across its internal junctions (or channels); once a \\"hot spot\\" develops, breakdown effects can rapidly destroy the device. Certain SCRs are available with current ratings to 3000 amperes in a single unit.  DC/AC converters (inverters)  DC to AC converters produce an AC output waveform from a DC source. Applications include adjustable speed drives (ASD), uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), Flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), voltage compensators, and photovoltaic inverters. Topologies for these converters can be separated into two distinct categories: voltage source inverters and current source inverters. Voltage source inverters (VSIs) are named so because the independently controlled output is a voltage waveform. Similarly, current source inverters (CSIs) are distinct in that the controlled AC output is a current waveform. DC to AC power conversion is the result of power switching devices, which are commonly fully controllable semiconductor power switches. The output waveforms are therefore made up of discrete values, producing fast transitions rather than smooth ones. For some applications, even a rough approximation of the sinusoidal waveform of AC power is adequate. Where a near sinusoidal waveform is required, the switching devices are operated much faster than the desired output frequency, and the time they spend in either state is controlled so the averaged output is nearly sinusoidal. Common modulation techniques include the carrier-based technique, or Pulse-width modulation, space-vector technique, and the selective-harmonic technique. Voltage source inverters have practical uses in both single-phase and three-phase applications. Single-phase VSIs utilize half-bridge and full- bridge configurations, and are widely used for power supplies, single-phase UPSs, and elaborate high-power topologies when used in multicell configurations. Three-phase VSIs are used in applications that require sinusoidal voltage waveforms, such as ASDs, UPSs, and some types of FACTS devices such as the STATCOM. They are also used in applications where arbitrary voltages are required as in the case of active power filters and voltage compensators. Current source inverters are used to produce an AC output current from a DC current supply. This type of inverter is practical for three-phase applications in which high-quality voltage waveforms are required. A relatively new class of inverters, called multilevel inverters, has gained widespread interest. Normal operation of CSIs and VSIs can be classified as two-level inverters, due to the fact that power switches connect to either the positive or to the negative DC bus. If more than two voltage levels were available to the inverter output terminals, the AC output could better approximate a sine wave. It is for this reason that multilevel inverters, although more complex and costly, offer higher performance. Each inverter type differs in the DC links used, and in whether or not they require freewheeling diodes. Either can be made to operate in square-wave or pulse- width modulation (PWM) mode, depending on its intended usage. Square-wave mode offers simplicity, while PWM can be implemented several different ways and produces higher quality waveforms. Voltage Source Inverters (VSI) feed the output inverter section from an approximately constant-voltage source. The desired quality of the current output waveform determines which modulation technique needs to be selected for a given application. The output of a VSI is composed of discrete values. In order to obtain a smooth current waveform, the loads need to be inductive at the select harmonic frequencies. Without some sort of inductive filtering between the source and load, a capacitive load will cause the load to receive a choppy current waveform, with large and frequent current spikes. There are three main types of VSIs: # Single-phase half-bridge inverter # Single-phase full-bridge inverter # Three-phase voltage source inverter = Single-phase half-bridge inverter = Figure 8: The AC input for an ASD. FIGURE 9: Single-Phase Half-Bridge Voltage Source Inverter The single-phase voltage source half-bridge inverters, are meant for lower voltage applications and are commonly used in power supplies. Figure 9 shows the circuit schematic of this inverter. Low-order current harmonics get injected back to the source voltage by the operation of the inverter. This means that two large capacitors are needed for filtering purposes in this design. As Figure 9 illustrates, only one switch can be on at time in each leg of the inverter. If both switches in a leg were on at the same time, the DC source will be shorted out. Inverters can use several modulation techniques to control their switching schemes. The carrier-based PWM technique compares the AC output waveform, vc, to a carrier voltage signal, vŒî. When vc is greater than vŒî, S+ is on, and when vc is less than vŒî, S- is on. When the AC output is at frequency fc with its amplitude at vc, and the triangular carrier signal is at frequency fŒî with its amplitude at vŒî, the PWM becomes a special sinusoidal case of the carrier based PWM. This case is dubbed sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (SPWM).For this, the modulation index, or amplitude- modulation ratio, is defined as '. The normalized carrier frequency, or frequency-modulation ratio, is calculated using the equation '. If the over- modulation region, ma, exceeds one, a higher fundamental AC output voltage will be observed, but at the cost of saturation. For SPWM, the harmonics of the output waveform are at well-defined frequencies and amplitudes. This simplifies the design of the filtering components needed for the low-order current harmonic injection from the operation of the inverter. The maximum output amplitude in this mode of operation is half of the source voltage. If the maximum output amplitude, ma, exceeds 3.24, the output waveform of the inverter becomes a square wave. As was true for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), both switches in a leg for square wave modulation cannot be turned on at the same time, as this would cause a short across the voltage source. The switching scheme requires that both S+ and S- be on for a half cycle of the AC output period. The fundamental AC output amplitude is equal to '. Its harmonics have an amplitude of '. Therefore, the AC output voltage is not controlled by the inverter, but rather by the magnitude of the DC input voltage of the inverter. Using selective harmonic elimination (SHE) as a modulation technique allows the switching of the inverter to selectively eliminate intrinsic harmonics. The fundamental component of the AC output voltage can also be adjusted within a desirable range. Since the AC output voltage obtained from this modulation technique has odd half and odd quarter wave symmetry, even harmonics do not exist. Any undesirable odd (N-1) intrinsic harmonics from the output waveform can be eliminated. = Single- phase full-bridge inverter = FIGURE 3: Single-Phase Voltage Source Full- Bridge Inverter FIGURE 4: Carrier and Modulating Signals for the Bipolar Pulsewidth Modulation Technique The full-bridge inverter is similar to the half bridge-inverter, but it has an additional leg to connect the neutral point to the load. Figure 3 shows the circuit schematic of the single-phase voltage source full-bridge inverter. To avoid shorting out the voltage source, S1+ and S1- cannot be on at the same time, and S2+ and S2- also cannot be on at the same time. Any modulating technique used for the full-bridge configuration should have either the top or the bottom switch of each leg on at any given time. Due to the extra leg, the maximum amplitude of the output waveform is Vi, and is twice as large as the maximum achievable output amplitude for the half-bridge configuration. States 1 and 2 from Table 2 are used to generate the AC output voltage with bipolar SPWM. The AC output voltage can take on only two values, either Vi or ‚ÄìVi. To generate these same states using a half-bridge configuration, a carrier based technique can be used. S+ being on for the half-bridge corresponds to S1+ and S2- being on for the full-bridge. Similarly, S- being on for the half-bridge corresponds to S1- and S2+ being on for the full bridge. The output voltage for this modulation technique is more or less sinusoidal, with a fundamental component that has an amplitude in the linear region of less than or equal to one '. Unlike the bipolar PWM technique, the unipolar approach uses states 1, 2, 3 and 4 from Table 2 to generate its AC output voltage. Therefore, the AC output voltage can take on the values Vi, 0 or ‚ÄìV [1]i. To generate these states, two sinusoidal modulating signals, Vc and ‚ÄìVc, are needed, as seen in Figure 4. Vc is used to generate VaN, while ‚ÄìVc is used to generate VbN. The following relationship is called unipolar carrier-based SPWM '. The phase voltages VaN and VbN are identical, but 180 degrees out of phase with each other. The output voltage is equal to the difference of the two phase voltages, and do not contain any even harmonics. Therefore, if mf is taken, even the AC output voltage harmonics will appear at normalized odd frequencies, fh. These frequencies are centered on double the value of the normalized carrier frequency. This particular feature allows for smaller filtering components when trying to obtain a higher quality output waveform. As was the case for the half-bridge SHE, the AC output voltage contains no even harmonics due to its odd half and odd quarter wave symmetry. = Three-phase voltage source inverter = FIGURE 5: Three-Phase Voltage Source Inverter Circuit Schematic FIGURE 6: Three-Phase Square-Wave Operation a) Switch State S1 b) Switch State S3 c) S1 Output d) S3 Output Single-phase VSIs are used primarily for low power range applications, while three-phase VSIs cover both medium and high power range applications. Figure 5 shows the circuit schematic for a three- phase VSI. Switches in any of the three legs of the inverter cannot be switched off simultaneously due to this resulting in the voltages being dependent on the respective line current's polarity. States 7 and 8 produce zero AC line voltages, which result in AC line currents freewheeling through either the upper or the lower components. However, the line voltages for states 1 through 6 produce an AC line voltage consisting of the discrete values of Vi, 0 or ‚ÄìVi. For three-phase SPWM, three modulating signals that are 120 degrees out of phase with one another are used in order to produce out of phase load voltages. In order to preserve the PWM features with a single carrier signal, the normalized carrier frequency, mf, needs to be a multiple of three. This keeps the magnitude of the phase voltages identical, but out of phase with each other by 120 degrees. The maximum achievable phase voltage amplitude in the linear region, ma less than or equal to one, is '. The maximum achievable line voltage amplitude is ' The only way to control the load voltage is by changing the input DC voltage. = Current source inverters = FIGURE 7: Three-Phase Current Source Inverter Figure 8: Synchronized- Pulse-Width-Modulation Waveforms for a Three-Phase Current Source Inverter a) Carrier and Modulating Signals b) S1 State c) S3 State d) Output Current Figure 9: Space-Vector Representation in Current Source Inverters Current source inverters convert DC current into an AC current waveform. In applications requiring sinusoidal AC waveforms, magnitude, frequency, and phase should all be controlled. CSIs have high changes in current over time, so capacitors are commonly employed on the AC side, while inductors are commonly employed on the DC side. Due to the absence of freewheeling diodes, the power circuit is reduced in size and weight, and tends to be more reliable than VSIs. Although single-phase topologies are possible, three-phase CSIs are more practical. In its most generalized form, a three-phase CSI employs the same conduction sequence as a six-pulse rectifier. At any time, only one common-cathode switch and one common-anode switch are on. As a result, line currents take discrete values of ‚Äìii, 0 and ii. States are chosen such that a desired waveform is output and only valid states are used. This selection is based on modulating techniques, which include carrier-based PWM, selective harmonic elimination, and space-vector techniques. Carrier-based techniques used for VSIs can also be implemented for CSIs, resulting in CSI line currents that behave in the same way as VSI line voltages. The digital circuit utilized for modulating signals contains a switching pulse generator, a shorting pulse generator, a shorting pulse distributor, and a switching and shorting pulse combiner. A gating signal is produced based on a carrier current and three modulating signals. A shorting pulse is added to this signal when no top switches and no bottom switches are gated, causing the RMS currents to be equal in all legs. The same methods are utilized for each phase, however, switching variables are 120 degrees out of phase relative to one another, and the current pulses are shifted by a half-cycle with respect to output currents. If a triangular carrier is used with sinusoidal modulating signals, the CSI is said to be utilizing synchronized-pulse-width-modulation (SPWM). If full over-modulation is used in conjunction with SPWM the inverter is said to be in square-wave operation. The second CSI modulation category, SHE is also similar to its VSI counterpart. Utilizing the gating signals developed for a VSI and a set of synchronizing sinusoidal current signals, results in symmetrically distributed shorting pulses and, therefore, symmetrical gating patterns. This allows any arbitrary number of harmonics to be eliminated. It also allows control of the fundamental line current through the proper selection of primary switching angles. Optimal switching patterns must have quarter-wave and half-wave symmetry, as well as symmetry about 30 degrees and 150 degrees. Switching patterns are never allowed between 60 degrees and 120 degrees. The current ripple can be further reduced with the use of larger output capacitors, or by increasing the number of switching pulses. The third category, space-vector-based modulation, generates PWM load line currents that equal load line currents, on average. Valid switching states and time selections are made digitally based on space vector transformation. Modulating signals are represented as a complex vector using a transformation equation. For balanced three-phase sinusoidal signals, this vector becomes a fixed module, which rotates at a frequency, œâ. These space vectors are then used to approximate the modulating signal. If the signal is between arbitrary vectors, the vectors are combined with the zero vectors I7, I8, or I9. The following equations are used to ensure that the generated currents and the current vectors are on average equivalent. = Multilevel inverters = FIGURE 10: Three-Level Neutral-Clamped Inverter A relatively new class called multilevel inverters has gained widespread interest. Normal operation of CSIs and VSIs can be classified as two-level inverters because the power switches connect to either the positive or the negative DC bus. If more than two voltage levels were available to the inverter output terminals, the AC output could better approximate a sine wave. For this reason multilevel inverters, although more complex and costly, offer higher performance. A three-level neutral-clamped inverter is shown in Figure 10. Control methods for a three-level inverter only allow two switches of the four switches in each leg to simultaneously change conduction states. This allows smooth commutation and avoids shoot through by only selecting valid states. It may also be noted that since the DC bus voltage is shared by at least two power valves, their voltage ratings can be less than a two-level counterpart. Carrier-based and space-vector modulation techniques are used for multilevel topologies. The methods for these techniques follow those of classic inverters, but with added complexity. Space-vector modulation offers a greater number of fixed voltage vectors to be used in approximating the modulation signal, and therefore allows more effective space vector PWM strategies to be accomplished at the cost of more elaborate algorithms. Due to added complexity and number of semiconductor devices, multilevel inverters are currently more suitable for high-power high- voltage applications. This technology reduces the harmonics hence improves overall efficiency of the scheme.  AC/AC converters  Converting AC power to AC power allows control of the voltage, frequency, and phase of the waveform applied to a load from a supplied AC system . The two main categories that can be used to separate the types of converters are whether the frequency of the waveform is changed. AC/AC converter that don't allow the user to modify the frequencies are known as AC Voltage Controllers, or AC Regulators. AC converters that allow the user to change the frequency are simply referred to as frequency converters for AC to AC conversion. Under frequency converters there are three different types of converters that are typically used: cycloconverter, matrix converter, DC link converter (aka AC/DC/AC converter). AC voltage controller: The purpose of an AC Voltage Controller, or AC Regulator, is to vary the RMS voltage across the load while at a constant frequency. Three control methods that are generally accepted are ON/OFF Control, Phase-Angle Control, and Pulse Width Modulation AC Chopper Control (PWM AC Chopper Control). All three of these methods can be implemented not only in single-phase circuits, but three-phase circuits as well. * ON/OFF Control: Typically used for heating loads or speed control of motors, this control method involves turning the switch on for n integral cycles and turning the switch off for m integral cycles. Because turning the switches on and off causes undesirable harmonics to be created, the switches are turned on and off during zero-voltage and zero-current conditions (zero-crossing), effectively reducing the distortion. * Phase-Angle Control: Various circuits exist to implement a phase-angle control on different waveforms, such as half- wave or full-wave voltage control. The power electronic components that are typically used are diodes, SCRs, and Triacs. With the use of these components, the user can delay the firing angle in a wave which will only cause part of the wave to be in output. * PWM AC Chopper Control: The other two control methods often have poor harmonics, output current quality, and input power factor. In order to improve these values PWM can be used instead of the other methods. What PWM AC Chopper does is have switches that turn on and off several times within alternate half-cycles of input voltage. Matrix converters and cycloconverters: Cycloconverters are widely used in industry for ac to ac conversion, because they are able to be used in high-power applications. They are commutated direct frequency converters that are synchronised by a supply line. The cycloconverters output voltage waveforms have complex harmonics with the higher order harmonics being filtered by the machine inductance. Causing the machine current to have fewer harmonics, while the remaining harmonics causes losses and torque pulsations. Note that in a cycloconverter, unlike other converters, there are no inductors or capacitors, i.e. no storage devices. For this reason, the instantaneous input power and the output power are equal. * Single-Phase to Single-Phase Cycloconverters: Single-Phase to Single-Phase Cycloconverters started drawing more interest recently because of the decrease in both size and price of the power electronics switches. The single-phase high frequency ac voltage can be either sinusoidal or trapezoidal. These might be zero voltage intervals for control purpose or zero voltage commutation. * Three-Phase to Single-Phase Cycloconverters: There are two kinds of three-phase to single-phase cycloconverters: 3œÜ to 1œÜ half wave cycloconverters and 3œÜ to 1œÜ bridge cycloconverters. Both positive and negative converters can generate voltage at either polarity, resulting in the positive converter only supplying positive current, and the negative converter only supplying negative current. With recent device advances, newer forms of cycloconverters are being developed, such as matrix converters. The first change that is first noticed is that matrix converters utilize bi-directional, bipolar switches. A single phase to a single phase matrix converter consists of a matrix of 9 switches connecting the three input phases to the tree output phase. Any input phase and output phase can be connected together at any time without connecting any two switches from the same phase at the same time; otherwise this will cause a short circuit of the input phases. Matrix converters are lighter, more compact and versatile than other converter solutions. As a result, they are able to achieve higher levels of integration, higher temperature operation, broad output frequency and natural bi- directional power flow suitable to regenerate energy back to the utility. The matrix converters are subdivided into two types: direct and indirect converters. A direct matrix converter with three-phase input and three-phase output, the switches in a matrix converter must be bi-directional, that is, they must be able to block voltages of either polarity and to conduct current in either direction. This switching strategy permits the highest possible output voltage and reduces the reactive line-side current. Therefore, the power flow through the converter is reversible. Because of its commutation problem and complex control keep it from being broadly utilized in industry. Unlike the direct matrix converters, the indirect matrix converters has the same functionality, but uses separate input and output sections that are connected through a dc link without storage elements. The design includes a four-quadrant current source rectifier and a voltage source inverter. The input section consists of bi-directional bipolar switches. The commutation strategy can be applied by changing the switching state of the input section while the output section is in a freewheeling mode. This commutation algorithm is significantly less complexity and higher reliability as compared to a conventional direct matrix converter. DC link converters: DC Link Converters, also referred to as AC/DC/AC converters, convert an AC input to an AC output with the use of a DC link in the middle. Meaning that the power in the converter is converted to DC from AC with the use of a rectifier, and then it is converted back to AC from DC with the use of an inverter. The end result is an output with a lower voltage and variable (higher or lower) frequency. Due to their wide area of application, the AC/DC/AC converters are the most common contemporary solution. Other advantages to AC/DC/AC converters is that they are stable in overload and no-load conditions, as well as they can be disengaged from a load without damage. Hybrid matrix converter: Hybrid matrix converters are relatively new for AC/AC converters. These converters combine the AC/DC/AC design with the matrix converter design. Multiple types of hybrid converters have been developed in this new category, an example being a converter that uses uni-directional switches and two converter stages without the dc-link; without the capacitors or inductors needed for a dc-link, the weight and size of the converter is reduced. Two sub-categories exist from the hybrid converters, named hybrid direct matrix converter (HDMC) and hybrid indirect matrix converter (HIMC). HDMC convert the voltage and current in one stage, while the HIMC utilizes separate stages, like the AC/DC/AC converter, but without the use of an intermediate storage element. Applications: Below is a list of common applications that each converter is used in. * AC Voltage Controller: Lighting Control; Domestic and Industrial Heating; Speed Control of Fan,Pump or Hoist Drives, Soft Starting of Induction Motors, Static AC Switches (Temperature Control, Transformer Tap Changing, etc.) * Cycloconverter: High-Power Low-Speed Reversible AC Motor Drives; Constant Frequency Power Supply with Variable Input Frequency; Controllable VAR Generators for Power Factor Correction; AC System Interties Linking Two Independent Power Systems. * Matrix Converter: Currently the application of matrix converters are limited due to non-availability of bilateral monolithic switches capable of operating at high frequency, complex control law implementation, commutation and other reasons. With these developments, matrix converters could replace cycloconverters in many areas. * DC Link: Can be used for individual or multiple load applications of machine building and construction.  Simulations of power electronic systems  Output voltage of a full-wave rectifier with controlled thyristors Power electronic circuits are simulated using computer simulation programs such as PLECS, PSIM and MATLAB/simulink. Circuits are simulated before they are produced to test how the circuits respond under certain conditions. Also, creating a simulation is both cheaper and faster than creating a prototype to use for testing.  Applications  Applications of power electronics range in size from a switched mode power supply in an AC adapter, battery chargers, audio amplifiers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, through variable frequency drives and DC motor drives used to operate pumps, fans, and manufacturing machinery, up to gigawatt-scale high voltage direct current power transmission systems used to interconnect electrical grids. Power electronic systems are found in virtually every electronic device. For example: * DC/DC converters are used in most mobile devices (mobile phones, PDA etc.) to maintain the voltage at a fixed value whatever the voltage level of the battery is. These converters are also used for electronic isolation and power factor correction. A power optimizer is a type of DC/DC converter developed to maximize the energy harvest from solar photovoltaic or wind turbine systems. * AC/DC converters (rectifiers) are used every time an electronic device is connected to the mains (computer, television etc.). These may simply change AC to DC or can also change the voltage level as part of their operation. * AC/AC converters are used to change either the voltage level or the frequency (international power adapters, light dimmer). In power distribution networks AC/AC converters may be used to exchange power between utility frequency 50 Hz and 60 Hz power grids. * DC/AC converters (inverters) are used primarily in UPS or renewable energy systems or emergency lighting systems. Mains power charges the DC battery. If the mains fails, an inverter produces AC electricity at mains voltage from the DC battery. Solar inverter, both smaller string and larger central inverters, as well as solar micro-inverter are used in photovoltaics as a component of a PV system. Motor drives are found in pumps, blowers, and mill drives for textile, paper, cement and other such facilities. Drives may be used for power conversion and for motion control. For AC motors, applications include variable-frequency drives, motor soft starters and excitation systems. In hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), power electronics are used in two formats: series hybrid and parallel hybrid. The difference between a series hybrid and a parallel hybrid is the relationship of the electric motor to the internal combustion engine (ICE). Devices used in electric vehicles consist mostly of dc/dc converters for battery charging and dc/ac converters to power the propulsion motor. Electric trains use power electronic devices to obtain power, as well as for vector control using pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifiers. The trains obtain their power from power lines. Another new usage for power electronics is in elevator systems. These systems may use thyristors, inverters, permanent magnet motors, or various hybrid systems that incorporate PWM systems and standard motors. = Inverters = In general, inverters are utilized in applications requiring direct conversion of electrical energy from DC to AC or indirect conversion from AC to AC. DC to AC conversion is useful for many fields, including power conditioning, harmonic compensation, motor drives, and renewable energy grid-integration. In power systems it is often desired to eliminate harmonic content found in line currents. VSIs can be used as active power filters to provide this compensation. Based on measured line currents and voltages, a control system determines reference current signals for each phase. This is fed back through an outer loop and subtracted from actual current signals to create current signals for an inner loop to the inverter. These signals then cause the inverter to generate output currents that compensate for the harmonic content. This configuration requires no real power consumption, as it is fully fed by the line; the DC link is simply a capacitor that is kept at a constant voltage by the control system. In this configuration, output currents are in phase with line voltages to produce a unity power factor. Conversely, VAR compensation is possible in a similar configuration where output currents lead line voltages to improve the overall power factor. In facilities that require energy at all times, such as hospitals and airports, UPS systems are utilized. In a standby system, an inverter is brought online when the normally supplying grid is interrupted. Power is instantaneously drawn from onsite batteries and converted into usable AC voltage by the VSI, until grid power is restored, or until backup generators are brought online. In an online UPS system, a rectifier-DC-link-inverter is used to protect the load from transients and harmonic content. A battery in parallel with the DC-link is kept fully charged by the output in case the grid power is interrupted, while the output of the inverter is fed through a low pass filter to the load. High power quality and independence from disturbances is achieved. Various AC motor drives have been developed for speed, torque, and position control of AC motors. These drives can be categorized as low-performance or as high-performance, based on whether they are scalar-controlled or vector-controlled, respectively. In scalar- controlled drives, fundamental stator current, or voltage frequency and amplitude, are the only controllable quantities. Therefore, these drives are employed in applications where high quality control is not required, such as fans and compressors. On the other hand, vector-controlled drives allow for instantaneous current and voltage values to be controlled continuously. This high performance is necessary for applications such as elevators and electric cars. Inverters are also vital to many renewable energy applications. In photovoltaic purposes, the inverter, which is usually a PWM VSI, gets fed by the DC electrical energy output of a photovoltaic module or array. The inverter then converts this into an AC voltage to be interfaced with either a load or the utility grid. Inverters may also be employed in other renewable systems, such as wind turbines. In these applications, the turbine speed usually varies causing changes in voltage frequency and sometimes in the magnitude. In this case, the generated voltage can be rectified and then inverted to stabilize frequency and magnitude. = Smart grid = A smart grid is a modernized electrical grid that uses information and communications technology to gather and act on information, such as information about the behaviors of suppliers and consumers, in an automated fashion to improve the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of the production and distribution of electricity. Electric power generated by wind turbines and hydroelectric turbines by using induction generators can cause variances in the frequency at which power is generated. Power electronic devices are utilized in these systems to convert the generated ac voltages into high- voltage direct current (HVDC). The HVDC power can be more easily converted into three phase power that is coherent with the power associated to the existing power grid. Through these devices, the power delivered by these systems is cleaner and has a higher associated power factor. Wind power systems optimum torque is obtained either through a gearbox or direct drive technologies that can reduce the size of the power electronics device. Electric power can be generated through photovoltaic cells by using power electronic devices. The produced power is usually then transformed by solar inverters. Inverters are divided into three different types: central, module- integrated and string. Central converters can be connected either in parallel or in series on the DC side of the system. For photovoltaic \\"farms\\", a single central converter is used for the entire system. Module-integrated converters are connected in series on either the DC or AC side. Normally several modules are used within a photovoltaic system, since the system requires these converters on both DC and AC terminals. A string converter is used in a system that utilizes photovoltaic cells that are facing different directions. It is used to convert the power generated to each string, or line, in which the photovoltaic cells are interacting. Power electronics can be used to help utilities adapt to the rapid increase in distributed residential/commercial solar power generation. Germany and parts of Hawaii, California and New Jersey require costly studies to be conducted before approving new solar installations. Relatively small-scale ground- or pole-mounted devices create the potential for a distributed control infrastructure to monitor and manage the flow of power. Traditional electromechanical systems, such as capacitor banks or voltage regulators at substations, can take minutes to adjust voltage and can be distant from the solar installations where the problems originate. If voltage on a neighborhood circuit goes too high, it can endanger utility crews and cause damage to both utility and customer equipment. Further, a grid fault causes photovoltaic generators to shut down immediately, spiking demand for grid power. Smart grid-based regulators are more controllable than far more numerous consumer devices. In another approach, a group of 16 western utilities called the Western Electric Industry Leaders called for mandatory use of \\"smart inverters\\". These devices convert DC to household AC and can also help with power quality. Such devices could eliminate the need for expensive utility equipment upgrades at a much lower total cost.

It once hosted several artillery batteries, and still contains the Prince of Wales Tower - the oldest Martello tower in North America (1796).Prince of Wales Tower National Historic Site of Canada The park is a popular recreational spot for Haligonians, as it hosts forest walks and affords views across the harbour and out toward the Atlantic. Plays are performed in the park every summer by a professional theatre company called Shakespeare by the Sea. The performances take place at Cambridge Battery, and include both Shakespearean productions and original musicals based on classic fairy tales for audiences of all ages. The company also operates the 80-seat Park Place Theatre in the lower parking lot of the park, which is used as a rain venue during the summer, and for fall/winter indoor productions. Point Pleasant Park is owned by the British government under the administration of the Minister of the Department of Canadian Heritage and is leased to Halifax Regional Municipality for a ceremonial 1 shilling per year. The original lease for the land was negotiated by Sir William Young in 1866. History =18th-19th Century=  St. Aspinquid Chapel  St. Aspinquid‚Äôs Chapel was established by Priest Louis-Pierre Thury at Chebucto (present day Halifax, Nova Scotia) in the late 17th century. The chapel is a natural stone amphitheatre located by Chain Rock Battery on the Northwest Arm at Point Pleasant Park. There are numerous notable people who were interned in the burial grounds around the chapel. The chapel was also the location of the Mi‚Äôkmaq celebration the Feast of St. Aspinquid (St. Aspinquid's Day), which was conducted through much of the 18th century. The Chapel is also the site of a battle during the French and Indian War between two Mi'kmaq chiefs (1760).  Establishing Halifax  In 1749, Edward Cornwallis arrived under instruction of the British Government to create a sizeable military and civilian settlement of 4000 in Halifax which sparked Father Le Loutre's War. He first settled Point Pleasant Park but then, being too exposed to the elements, moved the settlement below Citadel Hill. Halifax was to become a strategic settlement for the British and fortifications were primarily intended to prevent enemy ships from getting into the Halifax Harbour. Fortifications began to be constructed at present-day Point Pleasant Park toward the end of the French and Indian War. There were a total of seven fortifications constructed: Chain Rock, Chain Battery, Point Pleasant Battery, Northwest Arm Battery, Fort Ogilvie, Prince of Wales Tower and Cambridge Battery. Most were rebuilt or modified four or five times over the subsequent 200 years.  French and Indian War  There were four defences that were constructed during the French and Indian War: Chain Battery, Chain Rock, Point Pleasant Battery and Northwest Arm Battery. The defences were built of logs, earth, and stone. They were built with wood-burning fireplaces, and furnaces were later added for smelting cannon shot. Chain Battery and Chain Rock were basic fortifications built on the natural terrain to protect the Northwest Arm. Unlike most of the other fortifications, the battery here was not rebuilt in the 19th century, so it retains its original 1762 layout. Because it was abandoned so early, the area has been reforested for most of the historic period. Point Pleasant Battery is one of the oldest fortification batteries. Though Point Pleasant Battery was first constructed in 1762, what is visible today dates mostly from the early 20th century. The fourth battery - the Northwest Arm Battery - was built during the war, just west of Point Pleasant, was damaged in 1895 and was falling into the sea. It was moved further along the Northwest Arm shore. Northwest Arm Battery was first built in 1762 and disused after the 1860s. Archeological remains associated with its barracks include a summer house built for the Park in the 1880s. The battery here retains its early 19th century configuration.  French Revolutionary Wars  Prince of Wales Tower - oldest Martello Tower in North America (1796), Point Pleasant Park Halifax Nova Scotia In 1792, during the French Revolutionary Wars, the threat of an immediate French attack alerted the British military in Halifax to the possibility of a landing in the harbour and batteries were upgraded and improved. Fort Ogilvie was built at this time and is located in the eastern part of Point Pleasant Park. It was built by the order of General Ogilvie, then commander of the Halifax garrison. Ogilvie named the battery after himself. In 1796-97, a battery was built on high ground behind the point at a location capable of defending the point batteries. A few years later, the battery was converted to a large round stone tower known as the Prince of Wales Tower, similar to the Martello Towers built in large numbers elsewhere by the British military. The Prince of Wales Tower is 26 feet high and is 72 feet in diameter. The exposed material is ironstone rubble masonry, with walls. The original construction permitted six mounted guns on the roof and four guns on the second storey. Further modifications were made over the next seventy years. By 1813, the Tower mounted four 6-pound guns on garrison carriages on its barrack level, two 24-pound guns on traversing platforms and six 24-pound carronades on traversing slides on top. After 1864, the Tower was used as a self-defensible depot magazine. The park was the site of several small farms during the early settlement of Halifax. A rock outcropping at Black Rock Beach was used to gibbet the bodies of executed criminal such as the pirate Edward Jordan in 1809. Cambridge Battery is situated back from the Point Pleasant and Northwest Arm batteries along the shore. It was approved in 1862 and completed in 1868. The battery was named in honour of the Duke of Cambridge, who was the head of the military during much of Queen Victoria's reign. = 20th century = Halifax Memorial, dedicated to the Canadian servicemen and women who died at sea during both World Wars and includes the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Merchant Navy and the Canadian Army Halifax Memorial, Point Pleasant Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia The Cambridge Battery was abandoned by the time of the First World War. In 1929, the military temporarily vacated the park before returning in 1938 during the Second World War. Although the Martello tower ceased to be important for military purposes in the late 19th century, some of the other fortifications in the Park continued to be used by the military until the close of the Second World War. Fort Ogilvie and Cambridge Battery were upgraded with modern weapons during the Second World War. A gun from this era is still visible at Fort Ogilvie. Small amounts of stone were quarried in the park in the 19th century, the small quarries today forming a pond near the park entrance. In the 1920s, the Halifax streetcar line was extended into the park as far as the Prince of Wales Tower but the route was abandoned in the 1940s. The park was the target of a \\"group\\" calling itself \\"Loki 7\\" in 1994, when they planted a pipe bomb in a garbage bin. Nobody was injured. In 1943 a large Canadian steamship, SS Point Pleasant Park, was named after the park. The mayor of Halifax presented the ship's captain with a framed picture of the Yonge Street gate which was displayed in the dining room aboard the ship until it was torpedoed in 1945.\\"Point Pleasant Park\\", Halifax Herald December 15, 1943, p. 1 In 2000 the Canadian Food Inspection Agency planned to cut 10,000 trees to halt an outbreak of Brown Spruce Longhorn Beetle (Tetropium fuscum). This plan was challenged by the Friends of Pt. Pleasant Park in the courts, which resulted in a temporary injunction stopping the cutting. The injunction was later removed but there was a reduction in tree cutting to less than 2000. =21st century= In September 2003, Point Pleasant Park was devastated by Hurricane Juan. Nearly three quarters of the park's trees were knocked down and the park remained closed until June 2004. While there were still trees remaining, the park now had a very thin canopy. Assistance from the Canadian federal government allowed Halifax Regional Municipality to make significant progress in the recovery and renewal of the park. As of June 2008 over 70,000 Acadian forest trees had been planted in the park, surpassing the number of trees lost to Hurricane Juan. The comprehensive plan for Point Pleasant Park proposed long-term care for the park's forest based on Canada's national standard for sustainable forest management. The process of Adaptive Management would be used to guide the renewal and care of Point Pleasant, one of Canada's oldest urban parks. Military monuments HMCS Bonaventure's anchor monument Point Pleasant is the location to numerous monuments associated with the heritage of Halifax and the sea. The largest is the Halifax Monument, better known as the Sailor's Memorial, which commemorates members of the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Merchant Navy and Canadian Army who were lost at sea. It was first erected in 1924 in a headland near the park but moved to Citadel Hill in 1954 when names from World War II were added. However the cross on Citadel Hill had decayed by 1966 so it was replaced in 1967 by the present monument in Point Pleasant.Kitz, p. 145-146 The current memorial consists of a Cross of Sacrifice inscribed with the names of 3257 Canadian men and women who were buried at sea as a result of the World Wars. The most well- known casualties listed on the monument are the nursing sisters who died on the HMHS Llandovery Castle during World War 1. (415 Canadians from naval and merchant ships who died in the Atlantic Ocean during World War I.) The original monument has been replaced by two later monuments.\\"Monuments, World Wars I and II\\". Canadian Encyclopedia SS Point Pleasant Park Monument, Point Pleasant Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada The ship's anchor from the aircraft carrier HMCS Bonaventure serves as a monument to the men and women who died while serving the Canadian Navy during Peacetime.

Bocchini Jr. issued a statement defending the police for stopping Niederer from heckling the First Lady, but some free speech advocates felt the charge was unwarranted. :\\"It is our determination that the police officers had more than enough probable cause to arrest Ms. Sapir-Niederer and were justified in their actions,\\" said Bocchini. \\"Taking all factors into consideration, including the recent loss of her son while serving in the armed forces in Iraq, I believe that the continued prosecution of matter would serve no useful purpose.\\" References External links *CBS reports arrest, September 17, 2004 *CNN report on that story *CBS Photo journal of Niederer *Police dismiss charges against woman who interrupted first lady *Her Son Was Told by the Recruiter He Wouldn't See Combat; Now He's Dead - Counterpunch article American activists People from Pennington, New Jersey Year of birth missing (living people) Living people ","title":"Sue Niederer"},{"id":"1001643","title":"Music of the Final Fantasy series"},{"id":"1001645","text":"Ivan Konstantinoviƒç Ajvazovskij, Inspection of the Black Sea Fleet in 1849, 1886 This is a list of Russian ships of the line from the period 1668‚Äì1860: The format is: Name, number of guns (rank/real amount), launch year (A = built in Arkhangelsk), fate (service = combat service, BU = broken up) Russian- built battleships =Early Russian Ships of the Line= 1971 Soviet postage stamp honoring the Oryol. *Oryol 22 guns (\\"–û—Ä—ë–ª\\", launched May 1668, Caspian Sea) ‚Äì Captured and badly burnt by Razin's rebels 1670, thereafter left to rot.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 183,402, the largest as a science city. As of 2018, the population is more than 220,000 people. It was known as Kaliningrad () from 1938 to 1996 and served as the leading Soviet center for production of anti-tank and air-defense guns. In 1946, in the aftermath of World War II, the artillery plant was reconstructed for production of rockets, launch vehicles, and spacecraft, under the guidance of Russian scientist and academician Sergei Korolev, who envisioned, consolidated and guided the activities of many people in the Soviet space-exploration program. The plant later became known as the RKK Energia; when the Vostok space vehicle was being developed, this research center was designated as NII-88 or POB 989. Russian Mission Control Center is also located in Korolyov. Though the real control is decentralized due to security reasons and all space aircraft may be controlled from many different locations across Russia, the historic center of control is still in Korolev, and is called FCC - Flights Control Center. In July 1996, the city was renamed in commemoration of Sergei Korolev, the father of the Soviet/Russian space program, who died in 1966. Since 1997, Korolyov has hosted the International Space Olympics, an annual competition for young people to promote space related research. History Mission control center \\"–¶–£–ü\\" (\\"TsUP\\") of the Russian Federal Space Agency (April 2004) Korolyova Avenue is one of the central streets of the city Springtime evening panoram to central part of the city. In the 12th century, a Slavic settlement was located on the site of modern Korolyov. The settlement stood on a junction of trade routes between the Moscow and Vladimir-Suzdal principalities. After the Mongol conquests in the 13th century, the region was in decline. The village of Podlipki had formed on the site by the 18th century, when one of the first textile factories in Russia was established there. From the late 19 century, Podlipki was also known as a dacha village frequented by many literaliKorolyov in Wikivoyage, as can be witnessed by the name of Podlipki-Dachnye railway station. They later moved their dachas to Peredelkino in Moscow's southeastern suburb, when Podlipki became a closed city. In 1924, the first OGPU working commune in the Soviet Union was established at Podlipki. In 1938, the Kalininsky settlement near an artillery plant (which had previously been relocated from Leningrad to better protect it in case of any future war) was granted town status and named Kaliningrad (meaning Kalinin City, after Mikhail Kalinin; not to be confused with the Baltic port city also renamed Kaliningrad several years later). Over the next three decades the town expanded greatly as a home of rocket manufacturing for both military missiles and the Soviet space program. As such it was a closed city. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Korolyov City Under Oblast Jurisdiction‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #11/2013-OZ As a municipal division, Korolyov City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Korolyov Urban Okrug.Law #53/2014-OZ In June 2014, Yubileyny, Moscow Oblast Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction was merged into Korolyov City Under Oblast JurisdictionLaw #54/2014-OZ. Additionally, the town of Yubileyny was struck from the Inventory Data of the Administrative-Territorial and Territorial Units of Moscow Oblast in August 2014. and on the municipal side, Yubileyny Urban Okrug was merged into Korolyov Urban Okrug. The town of Yubileyny ceased to exist as an independent entity. Demographics As of 1 January 2016, Korolyov was in 93 place out of 1112 cities in Russia based on demographics. On 2 June 2014, the city of Yubileniy officially became a part of Korolyov. With a total population of 220 thousand people, Korolyov became the third largest city in Moscow Oblast based on population after Balashikha (428,400) and Khimki (239 967). Economy The main enterprise of the city is the RKK Energia, but there are several kinds of industry in the city. This naukograd (science city) is the place in which the first Youth Residential Complex in the Soviet Union was built. Another notable company located in the city is OAO Kompozit, which is engaged in the field of materials science. Today the city is prosperous overall. But in the Soviet-era economy, the city typified the wide contrasts and ironic juxtapositions that arose as some aspects of life were heavily funded by the government while others remained chronically underfunded. Yuri Krotkov described in his 1967 memoir. how, at the same time that advanced technology was being built for space rockets, the textile plants of old Podlipki went on for decades with nearly no improvement on their 1920s equipment, and starkly impoverished workers in various hard and glamourless jobs of prerevolutionary days crossed paths, sometimes resentfully, with the skilled technicians and scientists, who were substantially better paid despite the slogans of Soviet ideology around the equal dignity of manual labourers. Sports The bandy club Vympel has played in the Russian Bandy Supreme League, which is the second-highest division.\\"–ö–ê–õ–ï–ù–î–ê–†–¨ ‚Äî–∏–≥—Ä –ü–µ—Ä–≤–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –ø–æ —Ö–æ–∫–∫–µ—é —Å –º—è—á–æ–º —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∏ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–π –ª–∏–≥–∏ ‚Äî –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–∑–æ–Ω 2008/09 –≥.–≥.\\" (in Russian language). Their home arena has a capacity of 10 000. A plan existed to equip the stadium with artificial ice, but the project has been abandoned. Although an indoor ice hockey-sized arena entered the plans instead, the official reason given was financial problems. Now Vympel only plays in the amateur league of Moscow Oblast. In 2014 a bandy federation for the city was founded. Notable people The area was a place of elite dachas at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. Many famous people, such as Konstantin Stanislavsky, Anton Chekhov, Valery Bryusov, Boris Pasternak, Anna Akhmatova, Isaac Levitan, Pavel Tretyakov, Marina Tsvetaeva, and Vladimir Lenin, lived here.

Like other bearings they permanently rotate between parts, but they are designed to support a predominantly axial load. Thrust bearings come in several varieties. *Thrust ball bearings, composed of bearing balls supported in a ring, can be used in low thrust applications where there is little axial load. *Cylindrical thrust roller bearings consist of small cylindrical rollers arranged flat with their axes pointing to the axis of the bearing. They give very good carrying capacity and are cheap, but tend to wear due to the differences in radial speed and friction which is higher than with ball bearings. *Tapered roller thrust bearings consist of small tapered rollers arranged so that their axes all converge at a point on the axis of the bearing. The length of the roller and the diameter of the wide and the narrow ends and the angle of rollers need to be carefully calculated to provide the correct taper so that each end of the roller rolls smoothly on the bearing face without skidding. These are the type most commonly used in automotive applications (to support the wheels of a motor car for example), where they are used in pairs to accommodate axial thrust in either direction, as well as radial loads. They can support greater thrust loads than the ball type due to the larger contact area, but are more expensive to manufacture. A tapered roller thrust bearing *Spherical roller thrust bearings use asymmetrical rollers of spherical shape, rolling inside a house washer with a raceway with spherical inner shape. They can accommodate combined radial and axial loads and also accommodate misalignment of the shafts. They are often used together with radial spherical roller bearings. Spherical roller thrust bearings offer the highest load rating density of all thrust bearings. *Fluid bearings, where the axial thrust is supported on a thin layer of pressurized liquid‚Äîthese give low drag. *Magnetic bearings, where the axial thrust is supported on a magnetic field. This is used where very high speeds or very low drag is needed, for example the Zippe-type centrifuge. Thrust bearings are commonly used in automotive, marine, and aerospace applications. They are also used in the main and tail rotor blade grips of RC (radio controlled) helicopters. Thrust bearings are used in cars because the forward gears in modern car gearboxes use helical gears which, while aiding in smoothness and noise reduction, cause axial forces that need to be dealt with. Thrust bearings are also used with radio antenna masts to reduce the load on an antenna rotator. One specific thrust bearing in an automobile is the clutch \\"throw out\\" bearing, sometimes called the clutch release bearing. Fluid film thrust bearings Exploded view of a Michell type thrust bearing. Note, each sector shaped pad can pivot on the ridges on the lower plate Fluid-film thrust bearings were invented by Albert Kingsbury, who discovered the principle in the course of bearing and lubrication investigations commencing in 1888 while a student. His first experimental bearing was tested in 1904. He filed for a patent in 1907, and it was granted in 1910.https://www.asme.org/about- asme/who-we-are/engineering-history/landmarks/123-kingsbury-thrust-bearing The first Kingsbury bearing in hydroelectric service, one of its major applications, was installed at the Holtwood Generating Station in 1912. It remains in full use today. Thrust bearings were independently invented by Australian engineer George Michell (pronounced Mitchell) who patented his invention in 1905. Fluid thrust bearings contain a number of sector-shaped pads, arranged in a circle around the shaft, and which are free to pivot. These create wedge-shaped regions of oil inside the bearing between the pads and a rotating disk, which support the applied thrust and eliminate metal-on- metal contact. Kingsbury and Michell's invention was notably applied to the thrust block in ships. The small size (one-tenth the size of old bearing designs), low friction and long life of Kingsbury and Michell's invention made possible the development of more powerful engines and propellers. They were used extensively in ships built during World War I, and have become the standard bearing used on turbine shafts in ships and power plants worldwide.

The painting was historically displayed above the Vilnius city gate; city gates of the time often contained religious artifacts intended to ward off attacks and bless passing travelers. The painting is in the Northern Renaissance style and was completed most likely around 1630. The Virgin Mary is depicted without the infant Jesus. The artwork soon became known as miraculous and inspired a following. A dedicated chapel was built in 1671 by the Discalced Carmelites. At the same time, possibly borrowing from the Eastern Orthodox tradition, the painting was covered in expensive and elaborate silver and gold clothes leaving only the face and hands visible. The legend tells that in 1702, when Vilnius was captured by the Swedish army during the Great Northern War, Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn came to her people's rescue. At dawn, the heavy iron city gates fell, crushing and killing four Swedish soldiers. After this, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Army successfully counter-attacked near the gate. On 5 July 1927, the image was canonically crowned by Pope Pius XI. The chapel was later visited by Pope John Paul II in 1993. It is a major site of pilgrimage in Vilnius and attracts many visitors, especially from Poland. History The Gate of Dawn in Vilnius; the painting can be seen through the glass window It is believed that the painting was commissioned by the government of Vilnius. It was customary to place paintings or sculptures of various saints in niches of walls hoping that they would protect the building. The governor of Vilnius ordered two paintings, one depicting Christ the Saviour (Salvator Mundi), and the other the Virgin Mary. Both of them decorated the Gate of Dawn of the Vilnius city wall ‚Äì a defensive structure with no religious importance at the time. The painting of Christ decorated the exterior of the gate, while that of the Virgin was in the same place as it is now ‚Äì a small niche, protected by shutters from rain and snow. Narrow and steep stairs led to a small balcony where the faithful could light candles and pray. In 1650, Albert Wijuk Koja≈Çowicz published Miscellanea, listing all miraculous paintings of Mary, but did not mention Our Lady of the Gate of the Dawn. In the mid-17th century the Discalced Carmelites built the Church of Saint Teresa and their monastery near the Gate of Dawn. In 1655, the city was captured, looted, and depopulated during the Battle of Vilnius of the Russo-Polish War. It was likely that the city government, short of funds, transferred maintenance of the gate and the paintings to the Carmelites. The painting of Christ was moved to the Carmelite monastery and later to Vilnius Cathedral (a fresco of Jesus was painted in its original niche in the 19th century; it was uncovered in 1976). In 1671, the monks built a wooden chapel to Our Lady next to the gate tower; it was around the time that the painting was covered in expensive silver clothes. By then, the painting was already an object of public veneration and the chapel dedication ceremony was attended by many prominent figures of the time including Chancellor Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac, Grand Hetman Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac, and senators of the general sejm. Interior of the chapel of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn (1847) In May 1715, the wooden chapel burnt down, but the painting was saved and placed in the Church of St Teresa. In 1720, the current brick chapel was dedicated in the presence of four bishops, a number of senators, and a large crowd of the faithful. In 1761, the monk Hilarion published Relacja o cudownym Obrazie Naij≈õwiƒôtszej Marji Panny etc, the primary source for the painting's early history and also the first collection of various miracles attributed to it. In 1773 Pope Clement XIV granted an indulgence to the faithful, designating the chapel as a place of public worship, and established a charitable society. At the turn of the 19th century, Tsarist authorities demolished the city wall and all the city's gates, except the Gate of Dawn and its chapel. In 1829, the chapel underwent restoration and acquired elements of late Neoclassicism. Since the entrance to the chapel was from inside the Carmelite monastery, women could not go inside. Because of this, one female devotee sponsored the construction of a two-storey gallery on the side of the street in 1830. In 1927, major restoration works were completed under bishop Romuald Ja≈Çbrzykowski. With permission from Pope Pius XI, the painting was solemnly crowned Mother of Mercy on 2 July 1927 by the Archbishop of Warsaw Alexander Cardinal Kakowski. The ceremony was attended by President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki, First Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, Primate of Poland August Hlond, 28 other bishops, and other dignitaries. Painting =Origin and inspiration= The origin of the painting is not known. According to historian Teodor Narbutt (1784‚Äì1864), the painting was acquired by Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania (c. 1296‚Äì1377), as a war trophy from Crimea. This note, based on dubious sources, along with dark colors of the painting that resembled Byzantine icons, inspired 19th-century Russian historians to claim that the painting was Orthodox and not Roman Catholic. This theory was popularized in various articles, brochures, studies and is sometimes quoted today. Others claimed that the painting was commissioned by King of Poland Sigismund II Augustus and depicted his wife Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. With silver cloth covering the entire painting, except for the face and hands, it was very hard for art historians to determine in what period the painting was created. In 1927, the silver cover was removed for the first time in decades. The painting was analyzed and restored. Based on the new data gathered during the restoration, Mieczys≈Çaw Skrudlik came to a conclusion that the painting was completed around 1630‚Äì50 and linked it with another painting in the Corpus Christi Church in Krak√≥w, created by artist Luke in 1624. Mary Ka≈Çamajska Saeed in her 1990 thesis argued that Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn was a work of a local artist and was inspired by contemporary Flemish mannerist painter Marten de Vos through an engraving of Thomas de Leu. In 1993, on the occasion of pope's visit, the painting was restored and one of its planks was dated based on its tree-rings. The scientists concluded that the oak grew in 1434‚Äì1620. =Description= Chapel of the Gate of Dawn The original painting is and was painted by an unknown artist on 8 oak planks thick. As usual for Northern Europe, a very thin layer of chalk priming was applied to the planks before painting in tempera. Later Our Lady was repainted in oil paint. Some restoration work was completed in the mid-19th century. Major restoration works were completed in 1927. The painting depicts complex personality and devotion to Mary. Her head is gently leaning to her right, her eyes are half closed, her hands are crossed in devotion; this reminds that she is a virgin, humble servant of the Lord, merciful mother and patron of the people. At the same time, her head is surrounded by an aureola with golden rays and her body is usually covered in elaborate gold and silver clothes and crowns; these are the symbols of her divine and majestic role as the Queen of Heaven. The painting also reminds of Tota pulchra es (You are all beautiful), an old Catholic prayer. =Casing= Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn The tradition to decorate paintings with clothes or revetment (riza) of precious metals may have been borrowed from Eastern Orthodoxy. The clothing of Our Lady is composed of three gilded silver parts, each completed by different artists at a different period. The head and shoulders were covered in 1670‚Äì90; the chest piece was adapted from a different painting in 1695‚Äì1700; the bottom of the painting was completed by the 1730s. The clothes are richly decorated in floral motifs: roses, tulips, narcissi, carnations, and at least six other species. The flowers were references to hortus conclusus (enclosed garden), and a symbol of Mary's virginity and purity. The circle of stars represents the immaculate conception. The head of Our Lady is adorned with two crowns. Two little angels lower the large Rococo-style crown with colored glass inlays upon the smaller Baroque crown. Some argued that the two crowns, resembling royal and ducal insignia, represented the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania respectively. In 1927, duplicate crowns were made of pure gold, donated by the people, and were blessed by Pope Pius XI. On 2 July 1927 the Canonical Coronation took place and the painting received the title of Mother of Mercy. The gold crowns were lost, possibly during World War II. Sculptures of Mary's parents ‚Äì St Joachim and St Anne ‚Äì stand on both sides of the painting between the altar columns. Veneration =Miracles and votive offerings= Detail of votive offerings In 1761, the monk Hilarion published a book enumerating 17 miracles attributed to the painting and the Virgin Mary. The first miracle he recorded occurred in 1671, the same year the first chapel was built. A two-year-old child fell from the second floor onto a stone pavement and was badly injured. The parents then prayed to Our Lady and the next day the child was healthy once again. In 1702, Vilnius was captured by the Swedish Army during the Great Northern War. The Swedes, who were Protestants, mocked the painting, forbade songs and prayers, and caroused around the Gate of Dawn. One soldier even shot at the painting (the bullet hole can still be seen on the right sleeve). In the early morning of Great and Holy Saturday, the heavy iron gates fell and crushed four Swedish soldiers ‚Äì two died instantly and two later from their injuries. The next day, Easter Sunday, the Lithuanian Army successfully counter-attacked near the gate. The commander, grateful for the victory, bestowed a large silver votive offering upon the chapel. The painting is also credited with other miracles: subduing a city fire in 1706, punishing a Russian soldier for an attempt to steal her silver clothes in 1708, and numerous miraculous healings. Other stories of various miracles were kept by the Carmelite monks, but those books have not survived. Votive offerings became a tradition. They are usually small silver objects (hearts, crucifixes, figures of praying people, images of cured eyes, legs, arms). Several times (1799, 1808, 1810) some of these objects were taken down and melted into liturgical objects. In 1844 there was a total of 785 offerings. Twelve years later, in 1856, the number had almost doubled to 1,438. From 1884 to 1927 a journal of new offerings was kept. During that time 2,539 new gifts were registered. Currently, there are about 8,000 silver votive objects in the chapel. The large crescent moon located right beneath Our Lady is also a votive offering. Its origins are unknown but it bears an inscription in Polish and a date of 1849. The crescent goes well with the silver cloth, adding additional parallels with the Woman of the Apocalypse, described in the Book of Revelation as \\"a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars\\". =Divine Mercy= The icon of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn has become associated with the messages of Divine Mercy. Eight years after the icon was conferred the title of Mother of Mercy, the first exposition of the Divine Mercy image, painted by Eugene Kazimierowski under the direction of Saint Faustina Kowalska, took place at the chapel on April 1935.Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul ¬ß89; https://liturgicalyear.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/divine-mercy-in- my-soul.pdf In her Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul, she writes of a mystical experience involving the icon in the Gate of Dawn chapel. On 15 November 1935, Saint Faustina was at the Gate of Dawn chapel participating in the last day of the novena before the feast day of the icon, 16 November. She writes of seeing the icon taking on \\"a living appearance\\" and speaking to her, telling her \\"accept all that God asked of me like a little child, without questioning; otherwise it would not be pleasing to God.\\"Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul ¬ß529; https://liturgicalyear.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/divine-mercy-in-my- soul.pdf =Shrines in other locations= St. Mary's Church in Gda≈Ñsk Lithuanian Chapel () in the St. Peter's Basilica Today this holy image is venerated by Roman Catholic and Orthodox faithful of many countries whose origins lie in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, including Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and their diasporas worldwide. In Lithuania itself there are 15 churches as well as Lithuanian parishes in Montreal and Buenos Aires devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Gate of Dawn. On 26 February 2007 the parish of Our Lady of Vilnius (Au≈°ros Vart≈≥ Parapija) was closed by the Archdiocese of New York. The sanctuary had featured an icon of Our Lady, painted by the artist Tadas Sviderskis in the 1980s. In Poland the biggest church devoted to Our Lady is the Marian Basilica in Gda≈Ñsk. Other shrines of the holy icon are found in Poland (Bia≈Çystok, Drogosze, Kƒôtrzyn, Olsztyn, Skar≈ºysko-Kamienna and Wroc≈Çaw), United Kingdom (Kidderminster), United States (South River, NJ), and Australia. A copy of the painting can also be found in Church of Saint-S√©verin in Paris. There is a Vilnius' Gate of Dawn Mother of Mercy Chapel () in the St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. It was consecrated by the Pope Paul VI in 1970 and it is a place where Pope John Paul II had his first prayer after being elected as the Pope in 1978. Only Lithuania, Poland, Hungary and Ireland have such chapels in the St. Peter's Basilica.

The series takes place in a fictional universe, the same world as Toriyama's previous series Dr. Slump, and follows the adventures of Son Goku. The series commenced with Goku's boyhood years as he trains in martial arts and explores a fantastical version of in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls that are used to summon a wish-granting dragon. The tone of the series becomes more action oriented and less comedic when Goku reaches adulthood, as he and his allies would find themselves defending Earth against various threats, overcoming seemingly insurmountable opponents and eventually emerging victorious against progressively more powerful foes. During the course of the story, Goku encounters allies such as Bulma, Master Roshi, and Trunks, rivals such as Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, and Vegeta, and villains such as Frieza, Cell and Majin Buu. Goku's group of associates, known as the , bolster its ranks throughout the series with the addition of former enemies and new heroes. The group is also known in Japanese as the „Äê„Éâ„ÉÉ„Ç´„É≥„Éê„Éà„É´„ÄëZÊà¶Â£´/„É™„É≥„ÇØ„Çπ„Ç≠„É´ or TEAM \\"Z\\"Team Z Song (Dragon Ball Z Resurrection F) - YouTube in other media, and in the English dub of Dragon Ball Z as the Earth's Special Forces.Dragon Ball Z episode 122, \\"Mystery Revealed\\" While many of the characters are humans with superhuman strength and/or supernatural abilities, the cast also includes anthropomorphic animals, extraterrestrial lifeforms, and even deities who govern the world and the universe. The series also includes depictions of the afterlife and time travel as a means of creating historical divergences. Dragon Ball Super in particular expanded the setting of the series to include parallel universes; Universe 7, or the Seventh Universe in the English dub, is designated as the universe where the vast majority of the Dragon Ball series takes place. Creation and conception Earth, known as the and designated as \\"Planet 4032-877\\" by the celestial hierarchy, is the main setting for the entire Dragon Ball series, as well as related media such as Dr. Slump, Nekomajin, and Jaco the Galactic Patrolman. It is mainly inhabited by , a term used inclusively to refer to all of the intelligent races native to the planet, including humans, anthropomorphic beings, and monsters. Earthlings play a predominant role in almost every media in the Dragon Ball franchise, a result of Earth's pride of place as the series' primary setting. Starting from the Dragon Ball Z series, various extraterrestrial species such as the and have played a more prominent role in franchise media. Akira Toriyama initially based most of the characters on those of the Chinese novel Journey to the West, Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Tang Sanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, and redeveloped one of his earlier one-shot manga series, Dragon Boy. To be creative with the character, Toriyama stated in 1995 that he designed Goku not as a monkey like the Journey to the West character, but as a human-looking boy with a monkey's tail to give him a distinguishing feature. However, in 2003 he elaborated saying he added the tail because his editor told him without it Goku had no distinguishing features; while this was probably a joke, he went ahead and did it. Toriyama later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on, and that he never thought of making Goku an alien until Vegeta appeared. Martial arts tournaments, as well as characters such as Krillin and , a yogi-inspired recurring tournament competitor, were eventually added to give the series a greater emphasis on fighting and martial arts. Knowing readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while continuing to plan an eventual victory. When having fights in the manga, he had the characters go to a place where nobody lived to avoid difficulties in drawing destroyed buildings. In order to advance the story quickly, he introduced Goku's signature flying nimbus cloud, then gave most fighters the ability to fly, and later granted Goku teleportation. Going against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Ball's most powerful characters with small statures. He later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his editor was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. The reason there are many anthropomorphic characters is simply that he finds it easier to make them look different if they are animals rather than humans. For the female characters, Toriyama created women he deemed \\"beautiful and sexy\\", but also \\"strong\\". He did however state that he has trouble drawing females and this is the reason there are few women characters in the Dragon Ball series. During the second half of the series, Toriyama placed less emphasis on the imagery, simplifying the lines and sometimes making things \\"too square\\"; found problems determining the colors; and sometimes altered them mid-story. Many of Dragon Ball's characters have names that are puns, and which match those of characters related to them. For example, Bulma and her family are named after undergarments, Saiyans are named after vegetables, and because Frieza is a pun on freezer, the Ginyu Force are named after products that one keeps in a refrigerator. Toriyama explained that he does not like giving names to techniques, but did so at his editor's opinion. His wife was the one who named the series' signature , but he named all the others, even selecting them specifically for each character; saying someone like Vegeta would use names in English, and using kanji for the more sophisticated Piccolo. Toriyama came up with the Red Ribbon Army, particularly its Muscle Tower, from the video game Spartan X, in which enemies tend to appear very fast. He said he created King Piccolo because all his villains up to that point had something \\"likeable\\" about them, so the character was born in an attempt to have a truly evil opponent. The Ginyu Force and their poses were influenced from the sentai and tokusatsu television shows he watched with his children. Toriyama created Androids 17 and 18 after Kazuhiko Torishima, his former editor, was disappointed with Androids 19 and 20 as villains. Main characters Members of the Dragon Team or Z Fighters in volume 13 of the Dragon Ball Z manga series, from left to right: Vegeta, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, Yamcha, Krillin, Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, and Future Trunks The overarching protagonist of the Dragon Ball series for much of its history is Goku, who along with Bulma form the Dragon Team to search for the Dragon Balls at the beginning of the series. After the truth of Goku's heritage is revealed, Saiyan characters play a central narrative role from Dragon Ball Z onwards: Bardock and Trunks from an alternate future timeline serve as the protagonists of their respective side stories, while Goku's son Gohan briefly assumes the role of series protagonist following the conclusion of the Cell Games Saga. Krillin, Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks from the series' main timeline have appeared in lead roles for certain story arcs following their introduction into the series. Vegeta is featured as the co-protagonist for Dragon Ball Super, while the anime-exclusive sequel Dragon Ball GT feature Goku, Pan, and Trunks as the main characters. =Son Goku= , the most prominent protagonist in the series, is immensely strong, pure of heart, and extremely competitive, but dedicated to defending his adopted home Earth from internal or external threats. First introduced as a young boy, Goku was originally conceived by creator Akira Toriyama as a variation of Sun Wukong, protagonist of the Chinese novel Journey to the West; wherefore Goku also sported a prehensile tail until later. Upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series, the two then embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls. After, Goku receives martial arts training from Master Roshi, meeting his lifelong friend Krillin and learning the famous Kamehameha technique, and enters the World Martial Arts Tournament to fight the strongest warriors on the planet. When the evil King Piccolo, and later his offspring Piccolo, tries to conquer the planet, Goku receives training from Earth's deities to defeat them. Though he appears human, it is later revealed that Goku is descended from an alien warrior race known as the Saiyans, who sent him, originally named Kakarot, to Earth to prepare it for conquest. Goku sacrifices his life to save the planet from his brother Raditz, but must quickly get stronger in the afterlife under the tutelage of King Kai, to save it from the other incoming Saiyans Nappa and Vegeta. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats a powerful tyrant Frieza. This sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to attain further training. =Bulma= first appears as a teenager, using the Dragon Radar, a fictional device she created to detect the energy signal emitted by Dragon Balls. She is led to Goku's location by the signal emitted by the four-star ball in his possession, and ends up recruiting him as a bodyguard while hoping to get his four-star ball to grant her wish for a boyfriend. She gives up on the wish after meeting Yamcha, and much later in the series, she ends up forming a relationship with Vegeta. Bulma has also assumed the role of inventor, and has consistently provided critical tech support to Goku and his friends with their battles against various enemies and threats throughout the series. Some of her notable innovations include a microband that could make her shrink, and a time machine that brought her son from an alternate future timeline, Trunks, to the past. =Krillin= , Krillin in the English anime dub, is a bald martial artist and one of Goku's best friends. He is the classmate of Goku under Master Roshi's tutelage; initially his rival but later a friend, and a loyal companion in adventures thereafter. He is killed by King Piccolo's spawn Tambourine, but later revived by Shenron. After the fight with the Saiyans, he travels to Planet Namek, where, after several battles, he is killed by Frieza. After once again being brought back to life, this time by the Namekian Dragon Balls, he helps out during the Android and Cell arcs. He then forms a relationship with Android 18 and has a daughter, . =Piccolo= is the spawn of King Piccolo, created to get revenge on Goku in the wake of his death, subsequently assuming the role as the \\"evil half\\" of Kami. However, after just narrowly being defeated by Goku, he has to team up with him and his friends when opposing the invading Saiyans, including training Goku's son Gohan. He is later revealed to be a Namekian ‚Äì a green-skinned, four-fingered, hairless humanoid species who created the series' titular Dragon Balls. He dies sacrificing himself to protect Gohan during the fight against the Saiyan Nappa, and trains in the afterlife under King Kai before being wished back to life by the Namekian Dragon Balls. While during the fights with Frieza and the Androids he maintains the partnership temporarily, and by the time of the Cell and Majin Buu arcs he accepts the fact they are allies. =Son Gohan= is Goku's eldest son with Chi-Chi, who first appears at the age of four years. He is then kidnapped by Goku's brother, Raditz, and locked up in a space pod. However, his temper flares and he bursts out of the space pod, dealing a blow to Raditz, but also knocking himself out. After the battle, Piccolo takes and trains him for a year as he realizes Gohan's potential. Gohan slowly becomes one of the strongest characters in the series, at one point holding his own against Frieza and eventually defeats Cell. During the Majin Buu arc he forms a relationship with Videl, with whom at the end of the original manga he has a daughter named Pan. =Vegeta= is the last prince of the Saiyan people, and the fourth generation of the Saiyan royal bloodline to bear his namesake. He is first shown conquering a planet with his partner Nappa by listening to Raditz's fight on Earth using their scouters. The two of them travel to Earth in search of the Dragon Balls. He ends up fighting a newly revived Goku, but retreats after persistent attacks by Yajirobe, Krillin and Gohan. He flees to recuperate before heading off to Planet Namek to collect its Dragon Balls before Frieza could While on Namek, Vegeta proceeds to battle and kill many of Frieza's underlings. He is later forced to team up with Gohan, Goku, Piccolo, and Krillin so they could fight off Frieza. After Frieza's defeat, Vegeta lives on Earth and forms a relationship with Bulma. When the Androids arrive, it is revealed he has fathered a son with Bulma, Trunks. Throughout the rest of the series, Vegeta fights alongside Goku and their associates to defeat their enemies, but they still maintain a competitive rivalry with each other. Later in the series, he and Bulma have a younger child daughter named , known as Bulla in the English dub; unlike her father and brother, and despite being half Saiyan, she does not show any interest in fighting. =Bardock= , Burdock in Viz's English manga translation, is the husband of , and the father of Raditz and Kakarrot (Goku). Bardock's story is shown in the 1990 Dragon Ball Z TV special and in Toriyama's 2014 Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child special. Bardock's basic design was originally conceived for the TV special by the anime staff, with Toriyama slightly altering it. His armor was based on that of Toshiro Mifune's character in Seven Samurai, at the insistence of director Mitsuo Hashimoto. Toriyama stated that Bardock's tragic story moved him and so decided to include him in the manga; Bardock appears in two panels during Goku's first confrontation with Frieza, when Frieza comments that Goku looks just like that Saiyan who resisted when he destroyed planet Vegeta and the narrator informs the reader that he was Goku's father. Bardock also stars in the 2011 spin-off manga Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock by Naho ≈åishi, and the subsequent animated short film adaptation. In Bardock - The Father of Goku, during a routine planet conquering mission on the planet Kanassa, one of the surviving inhabitants strikes Bardock, giving him its native ability to see into the future in the process. Soon, Bardock began to see visions of Frieza's plan to destroy Planet Vegeta and all of the Saiyans, as well as Goku's future on Earth. Bardock attempts to prevent the destruction of his race by challenging Frieza in orbit of planet Vegeta, but is obliterated by Frieza. Before his death, however, Bardock has one final vision of Goku challenging Frieza, and is able to die pleased knowing his son would avenge their people. In Dragon Ball Minus, which takes place a month before the destruction of Planet Vegeta, Bardock has a strong feeling that Frieza is up to something when they receive an order for all Saiyans to return home, so he convinces Gine to send their infant son, Kakarrot, in a space pod to Earth, a planet far enough away to escape Frieza's interest, with a native population weak enough to pose no threat to Kakarot. This scenario for Goku's origin story is adapted in the film Dragon Ball Super: Broly. He is voiced by Masako Nozawa in Japanese, and by Sonny Strait in the Funimation dub. =Trunks= first appears as an unknown young man who easily defeats Frieza and his father King Cold, prior to Goku's return to Earth from Planet Namek. It is then revealed that he is Vegeta and Bulma's future child, who has traveled back in time to inform Goku of the coming of the Androids that in his time have killed everyone besides Goku, who died of a heart disease around the same time. He helps fight against the Androids and Cell, before returning to the future. Trunks' backstory is detailed in The History of Trunks, and the character reappears in Dragon Ball Super and Super Dragon Ball Heroes. Just as the Androids arrived, the Trunks from the series' main timeline was born. Seven years later as a child, Trunks, already able to turn Super Saiyan despite his age, fights against Majin Buu by using the fusion technique with his best friend Goten to form the composite being . In Dragon Ball GT, an adult Trunks travels through space with Pan and a de-aged Goku in search of the Black Star Dragon Balls during the first half of the series,. =Son Goten= is the youngest son of Goku and Chi-Chi. When first introduced, Goten strongly resembles his father in appearance, with the same hair-style and similar clothing. However, as a teenager at the end of the series his appearance has changed to include a shirt bearing his name and a longer, shaggier hairstyle. Goten was trained by his older brother Gohan in preparation for the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament, which their father would be attending. During the training, Gohan discovers Goten is already quite strong, due to the fact that he has been training with their mother (in stark contrast to Gohan's childhood), and can become a Super Saiyan despite still being a child. Like several characters in the series, he can also perform the Kamehameha technique. In order to save the world from Majin Buu, Goku and Piccolo teach Goten and Trunks the fusion technique which allows them to form the single being . Gotenks battles Buu multiple times but even when he transforms into a Super Saiyan 3 he is unable to defeat Buu. Buu temporarily absorbs Gotenks, increasing his own power, but Vegeta and Goku are able to retrieve them from Buu. When Buu destroys the Earth, Goten and Trunks are killed. The Dragon Balls later bring Goten back to life along with the rest of the Earth in order to give energy to Goku's Genki-Dama attack, which defeats Buu. Goten and Trunks appear as the protagonists of the eleventh Dragon Ball Z feature movie, Bio-Broly. Japanese fans voted Goten the sixth most popular character of the Dragon Ball series in a 2004 poll. Goten is ranked number 13 on IGN's Top 13 Dragon Ball Z Characters List, and came in 6th place on Complex.com's list \\"A Ranking of All the Characters on 'Dragon Ball Z\\"; Sheldon Pearce notes that the character exists mostly as part of a pair with Trunks, who's the assertive member of the duo, and their bond makes them extremely compatible to undergo the fusion technique. Masako Nozawa voices Goten in Japanese, while he is voiced by Kara Edwards (as a child) and Robert McCollum (as a teen) in the Funimation dub. He is also voiced by Dana Hayes in the Bang Zoom! Entertainment dub. =Pan= is the granddaughter of Goku and daughter of Gohan and Videl, as such her ancestry comes from both humans and the extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Pan appears as a young child in the final instalments of the original manga and Dragon Ball Z anime series, and is featured as one of the protagonists of the Dragon Ball GT anime series and its television special A Hero's Legacy. According to Dragon Ball GT producer K≈çz≈ç Morishita, Pan's role in the GT series was intended to be a strong but constantly imperiled character who had to be rescued by Goku, essentially a ‚Äúheroine who makes Goku a hero‚Äù. In Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods film and Dragon Ball Super, Videl, pregnant with Pan, volunteers for a ritual on behalf of her unborn daughter as a sixth Saiyan participant is required. She shows signs of being a prodigy in subsequent episodes of Dragon Ball Super, being able to fly as a toddler. In Japanese media she is voiced by Y≈´ko Minaguchi. In the English versions of Dragon Ball Z, she is voiced by Brenna O'Brien in the Ocean dub and Kate Bristol in the Funimation dub.

Though he seems frail, he is a mighty warrior, having trained Grandpa Gohan and Ox-King, Goku and Krillin, and a few others. Despite his lechery and occasional whimsy or foolishness he is often depicted as wise, cantankerous, and perceptive. He is often accompanied by his talking sea turtle companion, referred to as , who often tries to point out his faulty ways. He is bald, sports a thick van dyke beard, and wears sunglasses, beach clothes, or martial arts suits. He usually wields a walking stick and, in early appearances, wears a turtle's shell on his back. When wishing to appear anonymously in the World Martial Arts Tournament, Master Roshi uses the name , wears a wig and discards his sunglasses. Master Roshi was trained by , who have also trained his cohortian-turned-rival ; he has also received additional training from Korin. =Yamcha= , known as Zedaki in the Harmony Gold dub, is introduced as a desert bandit alongside his constant companion Puar, trying to steal Goku and Bulma's Dragon Balls and wish not to feel nervous when near women. He eventually becomes Goku's ally and begins a relationship with Bulma, and later becomes a pupil of Master Roshi. His signature attack is the , a physical barrage of punches and palm strikes, ending with a double palm strike. As a result of training under Master Roshi, Yamcha is able to perform the Kamehameha and develops the , an energy sphere directed by psychokinesis. He also later trains under Kami to prepare for the impending Saiyan invasion, but dies against one of their Saibamen. Before being wished back to life by the Namekian Dragon Balls, he trained under King Kai in the afterlife. He then helps out during the battles with the Red Ribbon Androids and Cell, but for the most part does not participate in fighting. =Tien Shinhan= , named Tien Shinhan in the Funimation anime dub and also known as Shinto in the Harmony Gold dub, is first introduced, having been trained by Master Roshi's rival Master Shen, trying to kill Goku and his fellow-students. Later, he and his friend and fellow student Chiaotzu become their allies; holding out against King Piccolo's minion until Goku arrives. In the fight with the Saiyans, Tien Shinhan dies of exhaustion against Nappa. He trains in the afterlife under King Kai before being revived by the Namekian Dragon Balls. Tien Shinhan continues to train and helps out during the battles with the Androids and Cell, but for the most part does not participate in fighting until the return of Frieza and the Tournament of Power. =Chiaotzu = , Chiaotzu in the English anime dub, is a small human that resembles a Jiangshi with white skin, red cheeks, and has one hair under his hat. Though he is not physically strong, Chiaotzu is skilled with psychokinesis and telepathy. Chiaotzu is first introduced at the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament, having been trained by Master Roshi's rival Master Shen, trying to kill Goku and his fellow-students. After his friend and fellow student Tien Shinhan decides that Master Shen's teachings are wrong, the two leave him and join with Goku and his companions to defeat King Piccolo. After assisting Tien Shinhan and Master Roshi in finding the Dragon Balls, Chiaotzu is killed by King Piccolo while trying to thwart his wish for eternal youth, but is later revived using the Dragon Balls. In the battle against the Saiyans, he self-destructs on Nappa in order to save Tien Shinhan, but it is ineffective. He trains in the afterlife under King Kai before being revived, this time by the Namekian Dragon Balls. Chiaotzu then joins the other characters when they gather for the return of Frieza, but Trunks kills the tyrant before a fight ensues. From then on, Chiaotzu is generally no longer involved in battle, although he continues to train with Tien Shinhan. He is voiced by Hiroko Emori in Japanese, by Rebecca Forstadt in the Harmony Gold dub, by Cathy Weseluck in the Ocean dub, and by Monika Antonelli in Funimation's dubs, except in Kai onwards where Brina Palencia voices him. =Android 18= is a human turned into a cyborg by Doctor Gero. After being released, she travels with Androids 16 and 17 in order to kill Goku, though they are interrupted by Cell and the Dragon Team several times. She and 17 are eventually absorbed by Cell, but later during the Cell Games, a hard blow from Gohan causes Cell to regurgitate her. Though Krillin is unable to wish for her to be turned into a human, he is able to have her self-destruct device removed. Krillin later pursues 18 and, at some point, they have a daughter named . In an alternate future timeline, she is a mass murdering android who is eventually killed by Trunks. In 2014, Toriyama revealed her real name to be . =Beerus= is a deity who appears in the fourteenth and fifteenth Dragon Ball Z films, as well as in Dragon Ball Super. A purple catlike being seen wearing traditional Egyptian clothing and ornaments, he is a God of Destruction whose occupation is to maintain balance, who destroy planets, civilizations or external threats that put the development of the universe the deity oversees at risk. Son Goku undertakes a ritual transformation into the Super Saiyan God and fights Beerus, just to be defeated by the God of Destruction. Having enjoyed the match, Beerus spares both Goku and the Earth. Beerus later forms a team consisting of Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Buu, and to participate in the Tournament of Destroyers after answering a challenge by his brother and fellow God of Destruction Champa. Beerus would later form another team consisting of notable fighters from Universe 7 to participate in the Tournament of Power, organized by the superior deity Zeno. =Whis= is an angelic being who appears in the fourteenth and fifteenth Dragon Ball Z films, as well as in Dragon Ball Super. A tall teal humanoid with pronounced effeminate features, he is an , a being of extremely high status within the multiverse hierarchy. Each Angel is bound to the service of a God of Destruction of their respective universes, and rarely leaves them unaccompanied. Their role is to guide their deity to master their destructive capabilities, train their deity in martial arts and also to perform trivial duties such as preparing meals for their deity. They are tasked with supervising their deity and keeping them in check, and will intervene when they go too far. Whis is Beerus' martial arts teacher who always accompanies him wherever he goes. He is unmatched in power and possesses tremendous speed, effortlessly defending himself against Goku and Vegeta and when training the two for the fight against the resurrected Frieza. As an attendant to his universe's God of Destruction, Whis is responsible for monitoring Beerus and keeping him in line; for example, he would not permit him to engage his brother and long time rival Champa in any physical fight, as it is said that both of their respective universes will be destroyed should their fighting escalate. The character's name stems from a misunderstanding. Toriyama incorrectly believed that Beerus' name was a pun on the word \\"beer\\" and so decided to follow the same rule to name the character's assistant. Thus, he ended up naming the character Whis, a pun on . Whis is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese media and Ian Sinclair in the Funimation dub. Antagonists =Red Ribbon Army= Red Ribbon Army logo The is a paramilitary organization led by , a short man who has his forces raid towns in search for the Dragon Balls on a quest for world domination. However, the plan is secretly a ruse, so he can really use the power of the Dragon Balls to become taller. The second in command, , who loyally obeys Red, shoots him after hearing the real plan and attempts to take command of the army, only to be killed by Goku after he was able to easily wipe out most of their forces. The many operatives of the Red Ribbon Army serve as obstacles for Goku during his second quest for the Dragon Balls. Goku quickly becomes the top of their hit list when he first comes into contact with them by easily defeating , who is sentenced to death for losing to a little boy. Though they first believe it was only a fluke, they then realize the threat Goku is when he defeats the forces under in their northern stronghold known as . Among the forces under General White is the android brute , the ninja and his four identical brothers, and the large extraterrestrial monster . or Mechanical Man No. 8, the first Red Ribbon Android operative seen in the series, is eventually activated and deployed against Goku. Android 8 turns out to be kindhearted and dislikes fighting; he befriends Goku, defects from the Red Ribbon Army, and later lives peacefully with the locals of and adopts the alias (\\"Eighter\\" in the anime) as suggested by Goku. Android 8 is seen towards the end of the original manga series, giving energy for Goku's Genki-Dama to destroy Majin Buu. Other members include General Blue; , an anthropomorphic tiger whom Goku defeated when arriving at the land of Korin; and , the only known female operative of the army. A is referred to once by Commander Red, but is never seen. In the aftermath of the Red Ribbon Army's defeat, a surviving member known as Doctor Gero continues to create more advanced androids and uses them as part of his long term vendetta against Goku. In the film Dragon Ball: Mystical Adventure, Sergeant Metallic appear as a soldier in Emperor Chiaotzu's army. Several key members of the Red Ribbon Army appears in the alternate-retelling film Dragon Ball: The Path to Power, where many of them get altered character designs. Sergeant Major Purple appears in the 1990s Dr. Slump anime, as well as the unofficial live-action Korean film, Dragon Ball: Ssawora Son Goku, Igyeora Son Goku as one of Pilaf's subordinates. The North American English releases of the manga by Viz Media have edited Adjutant Black's lips by shading them in, possibly to downplay racist stereotypes, similar to their censorship of Mr. Popo. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network opined that the Red Ribbon army arc was where the Dragon Ball series was at its peak, a pleasant balance between the frivolity of early Dragon Ball and the ponderous solemnity of Dragon Ball Z in terms of series' tone. He thought the Red Ribbon Army were effective villains, as it was first time Goku has faced real bad guys, as opposed to goofy Team Rocket-esque wannabes like Emperor Pilaf. General Blue , one of the Red Ribbon Army's leaders and seemingly its most powerful member in the original Dragon Ball series, has special telekinetic abilities that allow him to paralyze other individuals and can also be used to control objects. He is a neat freak, and when he does not enjoy Bulma's attempts at seduction, she states that he is gay. He manages to steal the Dragon Radar during their final encounter but after returning to the army's headquarters is set to be executed for not obtaining any of the Dragon Balls after multiple failures. He is allowed to fight the mercenary Mercenary Tao to redeem himself, though Tao easily kills Blue using only his tongue. Blue appears in the alternate-retelling film Dragon Ball: The Path to Power, and as a member of Emperor Chiaotzu's army holding the rank of lieutenant in the film Dragon Ball: Mystical Adventure where he is also murdered by Mercenary Tao in the same aforementioned manner. He also appears in the remade 1990s version of the Dr. Slump anime, where he attempts to take the Dragon Balls from Goku and Arale, and in a few episodes of Dragon Ball GT. He is voiced by Toshio Furukawa in Japanese, who said it was a difficult role to play because of the character's homosexuality, and Sonny Strait in the Funimation dub. Doctor Gero was the chief scientist of the Red Ribbon Army. After the downfall of the organization, he continues using his research and development work on Red Ribbon Androids to seek revenge against Goku. After creating a more advanced series of Red Ribbon Androids, such as Androids 16, 17 and 18, he eventually implants his own brain into an exact replica of his body, becoming . Both he and , a round, pale android and the most loyal of Gero's creations, are able to absorb the energy of others using small devices on their hands. The two eventually attack Goku and his friends. 19 successfully drains Goku of his energy while Goku is affected by his heart virus, but is destroyed by Vegeta afterwards. Doctor Gero flees and returns to his laboratory to release Androids 17 and 18 as a last resort, but 17 turns on his creator and murders him following a brief altercation. Doctor Gero's death at the hands of Android 17 was retold in the seventh Dragon Ball Z film, which features his other creations, Androids 13, 14, and 15 as the antagonists; they do not appear in the manga or anime series. He appears once more in Dragon Ball GT, planning to return to Earth along with Doctor Myu by creating another Android 17. They succeed, though Myuu betrays Gero and has the newly formed Super 17 kill him once again. He is voiced by K≈çji Yada in Japanese, Brian Dobson in the Ocean dub, and Kent Williams in the Funimation dub. =Mercenary Tao = , Mercenary Tao or General Tao in English anime dubs, is a top assassin for hire and the younger brother of , Master Roshi's lifelong rival. He wears a custom made pink gi with the kanji for on the front and the English phrase \\"KILL YOU!\\" on the back. He is first introduced in the series by being hired by the Red Ribbon Army to take out Goku and retrieve the Dragon Balls he possesses. He murders General Blue with only his tongue, slew Bora the guardian of Korin Tower with his own spear, and seemingly kills Goku. After succeeding in the initial battle and collects most of the Dragon Balls in Goku's possession, he where Goku challenges him again with his newfound power from Korin. He gets caught in the explosion of his own grenade and is assumed dead. His brother Master Shen later enters his disciples Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu in the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament, and attempts to avenge him by ordering his disciples to hurt and kill Goku and Master Roshi's other students. It is later revealed that Mercenary Tao survived and was modified into a cyborg using all the money he gained from his previous assassination jobs. He enters the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament with the support of his brother, but is easily defeated by his former student Tien Shinhan. In the anime he appears once again, in filler episodes of Dragon Ball Z during the Cell arc. In Japanese, he is voiced by Chikao ≈åtsuka in Dragon Ball and Yukimasa Kishino in Dragon Ball Z. In the Ocean dub, he is voiced by Scott McNeil, while in the Funimation dub, he is voiced by Kent Williams. Mercenary Tao was the model for the character Uonuma Usui in Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin manga. Watsuki stated that as the first villain to defeat Goku, Mercenary Tao made \\"a strong impression\\" on him.Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \\"The Secret Life of Characters (35) Uonuma Usui,\\" Rurouni Kenshin Volume 14. Viz Media. 66. =King Piccolo= is the evil half of the Namekian who removed his evil in order to become the god of the Earth; this negative energy took on a physical form, becoming a cast-off being. He and the good half, Kami, are linked, so if one dies, the other will as well. After being formed, he designates himself as the Great Demon King and begins to terrorize the world. He is eventually imprisoned by Mutaito, the master of Master Roshi and Master Shen, in a rice cooker by the suicidal technique. After being released by Pilaf, he attempts to kill anyone that could possibly seal him again (including Master Roshi and Chiaotzu) and uses the Dragon Balls to restore his youth before destroying Shenron, rendering them useless. He then takes over the King of the World's palace and has the King announce him as his successor, before being confronted by Goku, who, in their second battle, punches a large hole through his abdomen. Before dying, he regurgitates the egg containing his reincarnation, Piccolo Jr., in order to pursue his revenge. He is voiced by Takeshi Aono in Japanese, Scott McNeil in the Ocean dub, and Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub. King Piccolo also appears in the American live-action film Dragonball Evolution, where he is portrayed by James Marsters; his voiced was dubbed over by H≈çch≈´ ≈åtsuka in the Japanese version of the film. Prior to Piccolo Jr., King Piccolo created several offspring in order to help him with his plans. His first shown offspring, , helps him formulate his plan until he is killed when Goku knocks King Piccolo into him. He also creates to hunt down the contenders of the World Martial Arts Tournament to keep the sealing technique from resurfacing. Tambourine kills Krillin and beats a weakened Goku, but Goku's Kamehameha vaporizes him in a rematch. The third, , is created to find Dragon Balls, but he is killed and eaten by Yajirobe. The fourth, , is created to battle Tien Shinhan, who he easily defeats until Goku appears and crushes his head in one blow. Piano is voiced by Masato Hirano in Japan and Sonny Strait in the Funimation dub; Tambourine is voiced by Ry≈´sei Nakao in Japan and Dameon Clarke in the Funimation dub; Cymbal is voiced by Daisuke G≈çri in Japan and Mark Orvik in the Funimation dub; and Drum is voiced by Daisuke G≈çri in Japan and Bob Carter in the Funimation dub. =Frieza's Army= , known as \\"Freeza's Gang\\" in the Viz Media localization and \\"Frieza Force\\" in the Funimation anime dub, is the organization run by , or Frieza in the English anime dub. The organisation controlled a majority of Universe 7 at the peak of its power and serves as the primary antagonistic force of the first half of the Dragon Ball Z series. Frieza's father, was the leader of the organisation prior to passing control over to his son. The organisation employs and enslaves powerful races, such as the Saiyans, to take over suitable planets so that they can be sold to the highest bidders, or alternatively to destroy planets which are determined to be not financially viable. Frieza's forces are equipped with scouters, portable computers mainly used to measure power levels, and wear standard-issue battle armor which usually have dual shoulder guards, matching gloves and boots, and some form of skirt armor or crotch guard. Frieza himself does not really consider his soldiers as an army, looking at them more as a convenient group of followers. In reality, the soldiers follow him and his relatives out of fear, though some soldiers are known to be fiercely loyal to Frieza such as the Ginyu Force. Frieza The self-styled emperor of Universe 7, Frieza first appears on Planet Namek, where he systematically eradicates most of the entire native Namekian population in his quest to obtain the Dragon Balls so that he can wish for eternal life. It is eventually revealed that Frieza was responsible for destroying the Saiyan planet Vegeta, killing all but a few Saiyans, as he had feared their power. However, he retains three of them, Vegeta, Nappa and Raditz, as his underlings. Frieza later engages Goku and his associates in a protracted battle, with Goku transforming into a Super Saiyan after Frieza murders Krillin. Out of anger and frustration at his inability to counter Goku's newfound power, Frieza blasted a hole into Namek's core in order to destroy the planet. Frieza is then sliced in half by his own attack and begs for mercy, with Goku giving him some of his surplus energy. After he uses that energy to attack, Goku then seemingly kills Frieza. He is later rebuilt with cybernetic body parts and travels to Earth with his father King Cold and their forces to seek revenge, but all of them are eliminated with ease by Trunks who traveled back in time from the future. After the deaths of Frieza and Cold, the army soon fell into shambles and split into several factions. In Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' and Dragon Ball Super series, one of Frieza's loyal officers named travels to Earth along with his subordinate to resurrect their master by using Earth's Dragon Balls to summon Shenron. Frieza takes his time to recuperate and train, and is later accompanied by Sorbet and a thousand- strong military force for his journey back to Earth to once again exact revenge on Goku and his family and friends. Sorbet was killed by his own master's ki blast towards the end of the battle, which was intended for Krillin but was deflected by Vegeta. Even though Frieza utilizes a powerful new form developed as a result of intensive training, Goku defeats him once again and sends him back to Hell. A deceased Frieza is later recruited by Goku to participate in the as a member of Team Universe 7. Raditz is a Saiyan warrior and the older brother of Goku. Raditz is one of the few remaining Saiyans following the destruction of their homeworld, planet Vegeta. He arrives on Earth, searching for his long-lost brother in order to recruit him in conquering other planets. When Goku refuses, Raditz kidnaps his nephew, Gohan, and orders Goku to kill 100 Earthlings within a day if he wants his son back. Instead, Goku and Piccolo team up to defeat Raditz, though not even their combined powers are enough. However, Goku makes the ultimate sacrifice by grappling with Raditz and allowing Piccolo to kill them both with his Makankosappo technique. Before Raditz dies, Piccolo taunts him by explaining that Goku will be revived by the Dragon Balls, though Raditz manages to send one final transmission to inform Vegeta and Nappa of this, believing that his Saiyan comrades will come to Earth and use the Dragon Balls to revive him. However, Vegeta and Nappa travel to Earth to use the Dragon Balls for their own purposes instead. In the anime, Raditz later makes a minor appearance in Dragon Ball GT along with many of the other villains who escaped Hell. He also makes a single panel appearance in Toriyama's 2014 Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child special. He is voiced by Shigeru Chiba in Japanese, Jason Gray-Stanford in the Ocean dub, and Justin Cook in the Funimation dub. Nappa is one of the few remaining Saiyans that were known to survive the destruction of their homeworld, Planet Vegeta. An elite Saiyan warrior, Nappa uses as grunts to root out weaker opponents or to assess an opponent's power and skill level; known as Cultivars in the Viz translation of the manga, the Saibamen are green humanoid creatures that grow from a planted seed placed in the ground, which are stored in a special liquid prior to their use. Nappa encounters the Dragon Team after he traveled to Earth with the Saiyan prince Vegeta in search of the Dragon Balls. He survives Chiaotzu's self-destructing attack, causes Tien Shinhan to die of exhaustion and kills Piccolo. He eventually meets his match against Goku, who had returned to Earth after receiving intensive training from King Kai. Upon discovering that Goku's new power level is well over 8000, Vegeta orders Nappa to stop fighting due to Goku's clear dominance over him, but he refuses and is incapacitated by Goku. Seeing that Nappa has been defeated, Vegeta mercilessly kills him himself. In Dragon Ball GT, Nappa briefly returned as one of the escapees from Hell, only to be killed by Vegeta once more. In Japanese he is voiced by Sh≈çz≈ç Iizuka in Dragon Ball Z, Kiyoyuki Yanada in Dragon Ball GT, and Tetsu Inada in Dragon Ball Kai.

Zarbon and Dodoria and are two of Frieza's top ranking henchmen, first seen alongside their master on Planet Namek collecting the planet's Dragon Balls. Dodoria's demeanour is brutish and vulgar, while Zarbon appears to be a handsome, long- haired humanoid alien with a refined temperament. Bulma is blinded by her attraction to Zarbon's uncommon physical beauty during their initial encounter, and initially mistakes him for an ally. While their former cohort Vegeta have little difficulty dispatching Dodoria, who inadvertably revealed to Vegeta that Frieza was ultimately responsible for the destruction of the Saiyan homeworld, Zarbon manages to defeat and capture him after transforming into a powerful reptilian beast following their initial encounter. After Zarbon retrieves Vegeta's battered body and brings him to Frieza's ship in order to heal him for interrogation, Vegeta manages to escape and steal Frieza's Dragon Balls. Zarbon sets out to find him once again, but Vegeta, having become stronger after experiencing the effects of a Saiyan genetic trait which increases his power level substantially following recovery from a near death experience, kills Zarbon in his beastly form. The duo have been referenced in Dragon Ball Super and make cameo appearances in flashbacks. They also appear in Bardock - The Father of Goku, where Zarbon advises Frieza to destroy the Saiyan homeworld, and Dodoria massacred Bardock's teammates.

Dabura proved to be a formidable foe for the group, and is compared to Cell in his perfect form in terms of power level; he obliterates Kibito single-handedly, turns Piccolo and Krillin to stone by spitting at them, and aids Babidi in corrupting Vegeta with a spell. Not long after his successful awakening by Babidi, Buu would turn on Dabura by transmuting him into a large cookie and consumed him.

After Buu kills Babidi, he becomes close friends with Mr. Satan, which eventually causes him to expel his evil side. This evil manifests into a taller and much skinnier, almost frail, form that absorbs the fat Buu, becoming yet another new form that is muscular and much stronger. This Majin Buu is interested in a challenge, and later goes on to absorb Goten and Trunks (as Gotenks), Piccolo, and Gohan. It is revealed by the Supreme Kai that the fat form of Buu is actually the result of the original Majin Buu, known as \\"\\" or Kid Buu in English dubs, absorbing the Dai Supreme Kai into his body. The original Majin Buu is a sleek, child-sized being who is obsessed with chaos and destruction; Buu reverts to this form after Goku and Vegeta remove his benevolent aspect from his body, who then sides with the Saiyans against his original incarnation.

Baby is able to defeat Goku, then he begins using the Black Star Dragon Balls to restore the planet Tuffle and transport the Earth population to it. During this time, Baby evolves into an even more powerful form and defeats Goku again. This causes Goku to transform into a Golden Great Ape and then into a Super Saiyan 4. In this new form, Goku is able to defeat \\"Baby-Vegeta\\". He has Bulma, also under his control, fire a radiation beam at him from her Blutz Wave Generator which enables him to transform into a Golden Great Ape as well. After a lengthy battle, Baby separates from Vegeta and attempts to escape in a spaceship, vowing to return to destroy the Saiyans. Goku blasts the spaceship with a 10x Kamehameha attack, sending it into the sun and obliterates Baby.

He splits out the tainted Dragon Balls before fading away, each manifesting into one of the seven dragons as they proceed to cause chaos across the world. Goku, Pan and Giru manage to defeat the other dragons before encountering Eis and Nuova Shenron. Being much more honorable than his brethren, Nuova helps Goku and turns on Eis. Syn Shenron, the most powerful of the Shadow Dragons, kills Nuova before absorbing both his Dragon Ball and the others as well to increase his power and become Omega Sheron, in Japanese, with access to all of the abilities of his brethren.

Sabat respectively voice Syn Shenron and Omega Shenron in the Funimation dub, while Victor Atelevich voices them both in the Blue Water dub. =Goku Black / Zamasu = , or simply Black, is an entity who is identical to Son Goku in appearance. Black travels to and wreaks havoc on many worlds, eventually destroying them \\"for the sake of justice\\" whilst calling himself Son Goku. He eventually arrives on an alternate future earth, encounters that timeline's version of Trunks, and brings the remaining human population to the brink of extinction. Trunks later manages to travel into the present timeline using the Time Machine; however, Goku Black also finds a way to follow Trunks into the same timeline using the Time Ring. In the present timeline, Black meets Son Goku, but also recognizes Vegeta and Beerus. Wanting to get rid of him, Black challenges Son Goku to a duel.

He trained Master Roshi at one point back in the past for three years and gave him the and the (\\"Nimbus\\" and \\"Power Pole\\" in the English anime dub respectively), both of which are later passed on to Goku. Korin trains Goku after his defeat by Mercenary Tao and, later, gives him a poisoned water from the gods to make him strong enough to beat King Piccolo. He is also the one in charge of deeming people worthy of meeting Kami; Goku being the first human he has ever deemed worthy. He continues to help Goku and his friends by growing , which can fully heal any injuries and fatigue instantly, and is often accompanied by Yajirobe. Korin was modeled after the pet cat that Toriyama had at the time. Japanese fans voted Korin the twelfth most popular character of the Dragon Ball series in a 2004 poll. He is voiced by Ichir≈ç Nagai and Naoki Tatsuta in Japanese, Paul Dobson and Ted Cole in the Ocean dub, and Mark Britten and Chris Sabat in the Funimation dub. =Yajirobe= is an overweight samurai that is often considered to be rude, unmannered, timid, lazy, and cowardly. During their first meeting, Yajirobe gets mad at Goku for stealing his fish, and hates him. However, he has a change of heart and helps Goku after he is defeated by King Piccolo, taking him to Korin's to be healed. Yajirobe continues to support Goku and his companions from then on, though often from the sidelines.

When Krillin died, Toriyama requested that Yajirobe be voiced by his voice actress Mayumi Tanaka. When Yajirobe and Krillin later appeared in the same scene together, Tanaka gave the former a Nagoya dialect in order to distinguish them. Japanese fans voted Yajirobe the nineteenth most popular character of the Dragon Ball series in a 2004 poll. He is voiced by Brian Drummond in the Ocean dub, Lucas Gilbertson in the Blue Water dub, and by Mike McFarland in the Funimation dub. =Mr. Popo= is a genie-like entity who serves as the attendant of Earth's guardian deity. When he first appears, he easily gets the best of Goku in a skirmish. He then assists Kami in training Goku for three years in preparation for his battle against Piccolo at the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament as well as later training Krillin, Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu and Yajirobe during their preparation against the Saiyans. Mr. Popo serves Dende as his attendant upon the latter's ascension as Earth's new guardian. Mr. Popo is voiced by Toku Nishio in the original series and Yasuhiko Kawazu in Kai. In English, he is voiced by Alvin Sanders and French Tickner in the Ocean dubs, and by Chris Cason and Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dubs. Mr. Popo's appearance has been considered an offensive racist stereotype related to Sambo or blackface by some, such as Carole Boston Weatherford in an article she wrote in The Christian Science Monitor in May 2000. While discussing the controversy, IGN suggested it is easy to see why by describing the character as \\"the black-skinned, red-lipped, turban-wearing servant of Kami\\", but noted that Japan does not have \\"the kinds of racial sensitivities that the Western world has.\\" The Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University listed Mr. Popo as an example of racism in modern material. The North American English releases of the manga by Viz Media censor Mr. Popo's lips by shading them in completely. In the US airing of Dragon Ball Z Kai on the CW4kids/Toonzai block, Mr. Popo's skin was changed from black to blue. =Namekians= The , also known as Nameks, are indigenous to Planet Namek. Drawing inspiration from the Japanese word namekuji, which means \\"slug\\" in Japanese, the Namekians are a humanoid species with plant and slug-like characteristics. They possess green skin and antennae on their bald heads, and are able to make their own set of Dragon Balls. During the era of the Dragon Ball series, there were just over a hundred Namekians alive on their home planet, as most of their kind had died off a generation prior from a great calamity. While extraterrestrial in origin, the first Namekian characters encountered by Goku, King Piccolo and his mutated offspring, were known as the Demon Clan and thought of more earthly origin by the rest of the world. Namekians are hermaphrodites that possess physiques similar to those of human males and are seen reproducing asexually using a mode of reproduction similar to the parthenogenesis, by spitting an egg out from their mouths. Despite this asexual reproductive system, there is still diversity in the species as each offspring is usually not an exact copy of their parent, like with King Piccolo, or the who is the progenitor of every remaining Namekian on the planet prior to the events of Dragon Ball. The Great Elder, known as Guru in the English anime, abdicates his position as leader of the Namekian people in favor of prior to his passing later in the series. During sixth volume of the Dragon Ball Z manga or Nama Saga arc of the anime, Planet Namek is terrorized by Frieza and his army. The Namekian homeworld is ultimately destroyed by Frieza as a last-ditch effort to kill Goku. All surviving Namekians are temporarily transported to Earth, where they reside for nearly a year before being resettled on another planet called New Namek. Later in the series, the young Namekian named Dende becomes the guardian deity of Planet Earth and its Dragon Balls. The Namekians exist in both Universe 6 and Universe 7. Champa claims the Namekians of Universe 6 originally found the Super Dragon Balls and broke off pieces to create their own set of Dragon Balls. Kami is the creator of the Earth's Dragon Balls, and served as its guardian deity until the second half of the Dragon Ball Z series. The word \\"kami\\" is a generic term used by various characters throughout the series when referring to gods and deities in the original Japanese dialogue; this character is simply referred to as , and his actual name is never revealed. He and King Piccolo were once one being, later revealed to be a Namekian, who expelled the evil inside him order to assume the mantle of Earth's guardian deity. The evil incarnation, King Piccolo, then went on to terrorize Earth until being sealed away by Master Roshi's master, Mutaito. Because they are one, if either Kami or King Piccolo dies, then the other will as well and the Dragon Balls cease to exist. Shortly before King Piccolo dies at the hands of Goku, he spawns a much stronger incarnation, Piccolo, who takes over these same traits and retains his memories. Kami later attempts to attempt to seal away the new Piccolo himself using the same technique as Mutaito, and enters the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, possessing a human named as a guise. But Piccolo has learned to reverse the technique and traps Kami in a water jug instead and swallows it, later being released thanks to Goku. During the fight against the Saiyans, Kami dies when Piccolo is killed by Nappa, but through the power of the Namekian Dragon Balls they both are wished back to life. During the Android Saga, Kami agrees to fuse with Piccolo, with Piccolo absorbing his energy, strength, memories, intelligence and thought pattern. A young Namekian named Dende later succeeds him as the new Kami. He is voiced by Takeshi Aono in Japanese, who would do so up until the Frieza arc in Dragon Ball Kai. After Aono suffered a stroke, Bin Shimada voiced the character for his final appearance during the Cell saga. In English he is voiced by Michael Dobson and Dale Wilson in the Ocean dub, and Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub. Dende is a child of the Great Elder of Planet Namek. He was saved from Frieza's henchman Dodoria („Éâ„Éâ„É™„Ç¢) by Gohan and Krillin as a youth and taken into their care. Dende then guides Krillin to the Great Elder to tap into vast-hidden reserves of his power. He also interprets the Earthlings' wishes when utilizing the Namekian Dragon Balls, as the wish must be said in the native language of the Namekians. Dende later gains the power to heal injuries after having his own power unlocked by the Great Elder, which he uses to aid the warriors fighting Frieza until he is killed by the tyrant for being disruptive and helping the Earthlings. After being resurrected, Dende resides on New Namek until he is asked by Goku to become Earth's guardian deity. He accepts the position, revives Earth's inert Dragon Balls, and continues to serve as Earth's guardian deity throughout the rest of the series. Dende develops a close working relationship with Piccolo, as the latter had fused with fellow Namekians , whom Dende was friends with, and his predecessor. He is voiced by Tomiko Suzuki in the original Japanese series up to episode 288 of Dragon Ball Z, by Hiro Yuuki in episodes 290-291 of Z and Dragon Ball GT, and by Aya Hirano in Dragon Ball Kai and all media since. In the Funimation dubs of the series, he is voiced by Ceyli Delgadillo as a child, Justin Cook as an adult, Laura Bailey in the redub, and by Maxey Whitehead in Kai. =Android 17= is a human turned into a cyborg by Doctor Gero. His real name is . He has jet-black hair, unlike his sister, Android 18, who has blonde hair. 17 and 18 are released by Doctor Gero as a last resort to fend off Goku's associates, but they turn on their creator and quickly kill him instead. With nothing better to do, they begin to travel in order to find and kill Goku, coming into contact with the main characters several times. 17 is eventually absorbed by Cell, but is brought back to life when those killed by Cell are revived with the Dragon Ball. He makes a cameo appearance at the end of the series giving energy for Goku's Genki-Dama to destroy Majin Buu. In Dragon Ball Super, 17 participates in the as a member of Team Universe 7. In an alternate future timeline, Android 17 is a mass murdering android who is eventually killed by Trunks. In the anime-only sequel Dragon Ball GT, 17 is manipulated into fusing with his machine mutant replica, created by Doctor Gero and Doctor Myuu, and become the villainous . =Mr. Satan= , known as Hercule in some of Funimation's dub and in Viz's English manga, is a flamboyant martial artist who becomes a world-renowned hero after the Cell Games. After Goku and his companions stop attending the World Martial Arts Tournament, Mr. Satan starts winning them and becomes the reigning champion for many years. During the Cell Games, he attempts to fight Cell, but even after being swatted away, he is given credit for Cell's death by the media. He is soon called a world hero, gaining great wealth and a city named after him. Though Goku and his companions find his inflated ego and arrogance very annoying, he becomes their trusted friend after befriending Majin Buu. He helped defeat the evil version of Buu by using his celebrity to rally the people of Earth to contribute their energy to Goku's Genki-Dama. The benevolent incarnation of Buu later moves in and lives with Mr. Satan and his pet labrador retriever . In their initial dub of the series, Funimation changed his name to \\"Hercule\\". However, when they recorded a new dub for uncut home video releases, they switched to using the original Mr. Satan. In 2009, Toriyama revealed his real name to be , a pun on the Japanese word akuma, which means devil or demon. Japanese fans voted Mr. Satan the eleventh most popular character of the Dragon Ball series in a 2004 poll.The character has received some criticism; Theron Martin stating that he may be the most obnoxious major character in the entire series, although his antics later in the series were more amusing compared to his earlier appearance. He was voiced by Daisuke G≈çri in Japan until his death, with Unshou Ishizuka taking over the role afterward, while in English he is voiced by Don Brown in the Ocean dub, and Chris Rager in the Funimation dub. In Filipino dub, in order to censor his name, he was given the name Master Pogi. =Videl= is the daughter of Mr. Satan. Her name is an anagram of \\"Devil\\", a play on words with her father's name. Like her father, she trains in martial arts, even surpassing him in strength. She uses her abilities to fight crime in the city, and after Gohan appears as the Great Saiyaman, she quickly figures out his identity. She uses that to blackmail him into teaching her how to fly. After Buu is defeated, the two form a relationship, eventually having a daughter named Pan. When the two fight crime together afterwards, she takes on the role of the \\"Great Saiyaman 2\\" or \\"Great Saiyawoman\\". In the fourteenth Dragon Ball Z film and Dragon Ball Super , Videl participated in a ritual while pregnant with her unborn daughter to enable Goku to transform into a Super Saiyan God, her hair briefly becoming golden like that of a Super Saiyan. Japanese fans voted Videl the twentieth most popular character of the Dragon Ball series in a 2004 poll. She is voiced by Y≈´ko Minaguchi in Japanese, with the exception of Kai where she is voiced by Shino Kakinuma, by Moneca Stori in the Ocean dub, Kara Edwards in the Funimation dub, and Erika Harlacher in the Bang Zoom! Entertainment dub. =Marron= Marron („Éû„Éº„É≠„É≥ MƒÅron) is the daughter of Krillin and Android 18, and appears as a recurring supporting character in the Dragon Ball media series where she is usually in her mother's care. As a toddler and later young child, she resembles her father: she has his eye shape and apparent lack of a nose. However, she does indeed have a nose, though small, and as she grows older, Marron begins to resemble her mother. Unlike her parents, Marron is not a martial artist and does not appear to possess any fighting ability or special powers. In Japanese media she was initially voiced by Tomiko Suzuki, by Naoko Watanabe in the TV special Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!! and the Battle of Gods film, and by Hiroko Ushida in Dragon Ball Z Kai and Dragon Ball Super. She is voiced by Melodee Lentz in the Funimation dub of Dragon Ball Z, by Meredith McCoy in the Funimation dub of Dragon Ball GT, by Lori Barnes Smith in the Blue Water dub, and by Tia Ballard in the Funimation dub of Resurrection ‚ÄòF‚Äô, Dragon Ball Z Kai, and Dragon Ball Super. =Mr. Buu= , also referred to as , lit. \\"Demon Person Buu (Good)\\", came into being after Majin Buu split himself into benevolent and malevolent forms using fission. After befriending Mr. Satan who convinced him of the error of his murderous ways, the Dai Supreme Kai's influence within Buu moved the creature to reform, leading him to expel his evil tendencies which become a different lifeform altogether. This aspect of Buu is identical in appearance to his chubby progenitor, although any malevolent behaviour previously displayed are gone; he is now a chidlike entity of good who is kind, caring, and is less likely to throw tantrums of anger. He is also much weaker in power, and lacks some of the original Majin Buu's unique capabilities. For example, he no longer needs to hibernate for incredibly long periods of time - instead entering an unwaking sleep for a brief period of time. Mr. Buu moves in with his best friend Mr. Satan after the original Majin Buu's demise, and continues to appear as a supporting character in subsequent Dragon Ball media. =Uub = , known as Uub in the English anime dub, is the human reincarnation of the evil Majin Buu. After Buu was destroyed, Goku asked for him to be reincarnated as a good person, so they may battle again. Goku eventually senses Uub's hidden power and seeks him out ten years later, when Uub attends the tournament to gain money for his village. Goku ends up deciding to train him to be a future defender of Earth and as an opponent that he can battle. A major supporting character in the Dragon Ball GT anime series, he would eventually be reunited and reintegrated with the good Majin Buu, transforming him into \\"MajUub\\" (\\"Majuub\\" in the English dub) or to face threats such as Baby, Super 17, and Omega Shenron. After fusing with Buu, he experiences a slight alteration of his physical appearance, and gains a massive boost in power as well as new abilities such as Buu's signature ability to turn enemies into candy. He is voiced by Megumi Urawa in Dragon Ball Z and Atsushi Kisaichi in GT, and by Kara Edwards and Sean Teague in the Funimation dub. =Jaco= is an alien galactic patrolman who is the main character of Jaco the Galactic Patrolman, a manga by Akira Toriyama set before the events of Dragon Ball. A member of the Galactic Patrol, a cosmic police force that is led by the and tasked with keeping order throughout the Milky Way Galaxy, Jaco arrives on Earth to prevent it from being threatened by an evil alien. He fails to track down the alien, who turns out to be Son Goku, but befriends Bulma's older sister and returns to space. He appears in the fifteenth Dragon Ball Z film, and becomes a recurring character in Dragon Ball Super. Jaco is voiced by Natsuki Hanae in Japanese and by Todd Haberkorn in English. Other characters =Android 16= is a large fully mechanical android developed by Dr. Gero. He is deemed a failure, and is deactivated until Android 18 reactivates and releases him. While the other Androids enjoy fighting, 16 refrains from battle, only showing interest in following his orders to search for and kill Goku, who, along with Cell, is the only character he shows animosity towards. Unlike the other two, 16 processes a sophisticated mechanism to sense and track power levels in real time. While trying to protect Android 17 and 18 from Cell, he is greatly damaged, though Bulma and her father later repair him. After he is repaired, he temporarily ignores his orders to kill Goku to focus on the fight against Cell. Like 17 and 18, 16 was designed with the ability to self-destruct, but the device was removed during his repairs. This is made known only when 16 tries to self-destruct and destroy Cell, with Cell retaliating and destroying him. However, his head and consciousness survive, but later is destroyed by Cell, which pushes Gohan over the edge to Super Saiyan 2. He is voiced Hikaru Midorikawa in Japanese media, Scott McNeil in the Ocean dub, and Jeremy Inman in the Funimation dub. =Arale Norimaki= is a little girl android built by the scientist Senbei Norimaki in from Toriyama's previous manga Dr. Slump. She is very naive and fights as if she is simply playing around possessing the ability to run at mach speed and unbelievable strength. Arale is often accompanied by two cherubs known as the Gatchans that are capable of eating almost anything and shooting lasers from their antennas. Goku meets her during his final encounter against General Blue of the Red Ribbon Army and easily does away with him when Goku was unable to defeat him. Arale also appears in the third Dragon Ball film where she defeats Mercenary Tao. In Dragon Ball Super, she easily defeats Vegeta when being controlled by her creators archenemy Dr. Mashirito and has a seemingly even match against Goku. =Fortuneteller Baba = , Fortuneteller Baba in the English anime dub, is an old witch and Master Roshi's older sister. She possesses a magic floating crystal ball that she rides on top of, which she can use to see the location of any lost item, and to have a limited view of the future. She is also able to travel to the afterlife, where she recruits deceased individuals and brings them back to the living world to fight for her, albeit only for one day. She lives in a big palace located over an oasis in the desert. She normally charges a very high price for her services unless her team of fighters are defeated. Her regular fighters are , a boxing vampire; , an invisible man who is weak with his only advantage being that he can not be seen; , a mummy with brute strength; and , a humanoid devil who can destroy people using the evil in their hearts. During the time Goku and his friends visit in order for her to find the last Dragon Ball after the defeat of the Red Ribbon Army, his adoptive grandfather Son Gohan was the last of her fighters, temporarily brought back to the real world to see his grandson. She later makes many recurring appearances from time to time, including bringing Goku back to life for one day for the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament. In Japanese she is voiced by Junpei Takiguchi in Dragon Ball and early Dragon Ball Z, and by Mayumi Tanaka during the later half of Dragon Ball Z and during Dragon Ball Kai. In English she is voiced by Ellen Kennedy in the Ocean dub, and by Linda Chambers-Young in the Funimation dub. =Fusion characters = A recurring theme in the Dragon Ball series are characters created through the process of merging (Âêà‰Ωì gattai, lit. \\"union\\") two or more separate beings into one. The idea to have two characters \\"fuse\\" together was suggested by Akira Toriyama's long-time friend and fellow manga artist Masakazu Katsura, leading to the introduction of amalgamations of characters formed through various techniques. In the anime, the resulting fused characters tend to be depicted as speaking with a dual voice consisting of both fusees' voices. The technique, first introduced when the threat of Majin Buu emerged, is a ritual dance developed by an alien species called the Metamorans which Goku learned in the Other World. The purpose of this technique is to temporarily merge two or more bodies into a single, superior entity with characteristics from both fusees. The newly fused body is dressed in Metamoran attire; a dark colored vest lined with light colored linen, white pants with a cloth belt and boots. When the ritual dance is performed properly, the single being created possesses an astounding level of power, far beyond what either fusee would have had individually by combining each other's attributes from strength and speed to reflexes, intelligence and wisdom. The resulting fusion only lasts up to 30 minutes, after which the fusees revert to their normal selves. Notable examples of composite characters created with this technique include , the fusion of Goten and Trunks; and , the fusion of Goku and Vegeta. Two individuals wearing a single matching earring but on opposite ears may trigger a . These earrings, usually worn by the Supreme Kai and their aides, combine both users into a new body with complete attributes in the final product, as well as an increase in power and personality which is greater than the sum of the two individuals. However, there are alternate methods of dissolving the fusion regardless of whoever the participants are, usually by forcing the fusees apart (such as being magically split through a wish granted by Shenron). Notable examples of composite characters created by wearing a matching pair of Potara earrings include Kibito Kai, a fusion of Kibito and the East Supreme Kai of Universe 7; Vegito („Éô„Ç∏„ÉÉ„Éà Bejitto), a fusion of Goku and Vegeta also known as Vegerot in the Viz English manga; and Kefla („Ç±„Éï„É© Kefura), a fusion of Kale and Caulifla. Mortals have a one-hour time limit before the fusees de-fuse, but if a deity is one of the fusees, then the fusion will become permanent; the deity known as the is in fact created from the fusion of the original and an old witch who stole one of his Potara earrings and put it on without being aware of the consequences. The Namekians demonstrate a related technique early in the Dragon Ball Z series, where one Namekian absorbs the energy, strength, memories, and intelligence or thought patterns of another through a process akin to . Each participant must willingly consent to fuse in this manner and usually the pair agrees to the stronger of the two to serve their body as the host. The agreed host places his hand over the chest of the other one and through unknown means, they merge with a blinding flash. Only the body of the host remains in the aftermath, and the non-host is assimilated and ceases to exist as a body. The current incarnation of Piccolo is a notable example, having assimilated two other Namekian individuals into his very being. Villainous characters like Cell and Majin Buu are also capable of forcibly absorbing other characters in order to acquire greater power by taking advantage of their unique physiology. =Grandpa Gohan= is the adoptive grandfather of Goku, whom he found in a crashed spaceship. He teaches Goku martial arts, having originally studied under Master Roshi with Ox-King and also knows the Kamehameha technique. He warns Goku not to look at the full moon, but Goku disobeys him and accidentally kills him while on a rampage in his giant ape form. Goku does not learn this until Vegeta turns into an ape and tells Goku about the transformations. He is brought back to life for one day by Baba Uranai in order to fight Goku and see his growth as a martial artist. In the anime only, he later appears as an assistant to , the ruler of the \\"magical furnace\\". He is voiced by Osamu Saka in the Japanese version of the original series, by Kinpei Azusa in Bardock: The Father of Goku and by Shigeru Chiba in Dragon Ball Kai. In the Funimation dub of the series, he is voiced by Christopher Sabat. He is portrayed by Randall Duk Kim in the American live-action film Dragonball Evolution; his voice was dubbed by Hiroya Ishimaru in the Japanese version. Grandpa Son Gohan briefly appears in the final chapter of Toriyama's 2013 manga series Jaco the Galactic Patrolman, which is set before Dragon Ball. =Kai= The , referred to as Lords of Worlds in Viz's English manga and the Kai in the English anime dub, are upper-level gods of the Dragon Ball multiverse. There are five at a time; one presiding over each of the four quadrants of the universe and the last, the , overseeing them all. The Kai reside in the heavens and are responsible for the lower-level deities who rule over individual planets. Later in the series it is revealed that Supreme Kai exist; they are themselves in charge of the Kai., and that all Kai and Supreme Kai hail from the same race of beings. It is possible for an individual Kai to be promoted to the rank of the Supreme Kai after a period of training as an apprentice. For example, Zamasu was the former of Universe 10 prior to being chosen by the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10 as his apprentice and eventual successor. The North Kai of Universe 7, named King Kai in the English anime dub and as the Lord of the Northern Worlds in the Viz Media localization, trains Goku after his self-sacrifice to defeat Raditz, and eventually trains Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu and Piccolo. He is the only other Kai to appear in the original manga, besides a brief appearance of the , and as such is usually simply referred to as or Northern King Kai. King Kai trains dead fighters that were allowed to keep their bodies, if they manage to reach his small planet at the end of . Before training any students, he forces them to appeal to his strange sense of humor and catch his pet monkey . In the anime, they must also hit the flying cricket with a mallet. King Kai provides Goku with martial arts training and two of his own techniques, the and the , which he himself was never able to master. He continues to help Goku and his friends throughout the series, lending his planet locating and telecommunicating abilities for their use. When Goku brings a self-destructing Cell to his planet, the explosion kills King Kai and Bubbles and destroys his planet. As he is already in the afterlife, he only gains a halo, and in the anime appears to settle down on the Dai Kai's planet. He is voiced by J≈çji Yanami in Japanese media until episode twelve of Dragon Ball Super, where Naoki Tatsuta took over the role, Don Brown and Dave Ward in the Ocean dub, Sean Schemmel in the Funimation dub, and Michael McConnohie in the Bang Zoom! Entertainment dub. =King Vegeta= , more specifically , is the last King of the . He is the strongest Saiyan warrior in his time, as well as the father of the Saiyan princes Vegeta and Tarble („Çø„Éº„Éñ„É´). While he is referred to throughout the series' media, he did not appear in the original manga. He led the Saiyan people, who have historically lived a violent and barbaric lifestyle where they attack numerous planets to build up wealth and goods, to victory in the ten-year war against the , after which the Tuffles' home planet was renamed in his honor. Similar to his son Vegeta in nature and appearance, he is ruthless in dealing with his subordinates and delights in the death of others. After the Saiyans were annexed by Frieza as a vassal state, he had no choice but to pledge allegiance to him, while at the same time retaining power over his own people as a vassal. King Vegeta is killed by Frieza when he leads a rebellion against him and boards his spaceship to retrieve his son. After his death, Frieza destroys his home planet and commits genocide of the entire Saiyan race. In Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and in both the anime and manga versions of Dragon Ball Super, King Vegeta is seen in flashbacks depicting his encounter with Beerus during the latter's visit to Planet Vegeta. In Japanese, he is voiced by Banj≈ç Ginga in episode 78 of Dragon Ball Z, Yukimasa Kishino in episode 124 and Masaharu Sat≈ç in the eighth Dragon Ball Z film. Terry Klassen voices him in the Ocean dub, while Christopher Sabat voices him in the Funimation dub. =Monaka= is a short and slender red-skinned extraterrestrial humanoid from the planet Wagashi. He is a deliveryman whom the God of Destruction Beerus recruits for the Tournament of Destroyers and is used as motivation for Goku to get stronger. At the conclusion of the storyline, he inadvertently won the tournament on behalf of Universe 7 after Universe 6's Hit threw their fight. He is voiced by Masami Kikuchi in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by Daman Mills. =Pilaf Gang= , Emperor Pilaf in the English anime dub, is a small impish blue creature who is the leader of the and dreams of ruling the world. Together with his two minions, Mai and , a humanoid dog in a ninja outfit, he seeks out the Dragon Balls to wish for world domination. Shu was originally named when he first appeared, however, when the series was being adapted into an anime, the staff asked Toriyama what his name was and he instead replied with Shu, forgetting that he had already named him. By the time he realized the mistake, the anime had already aired, so he decided to use Shu in the manga when the character reappeared. After initially succeeding in obtaining the Dragon Balls, he is foiled by Goku and his companions after Oolong's wish is granted by Shenron just before he can speak his fully. The Pilaf Gang returns to antagonize Goku a few more times throughout the series; while attempting to obtain the Dragon Balls again and when they release King Piccolo from his confinement. In the first case, their attempt is quickly cut short when they are defeated by Goku again, and in the second, King Piccolo betrays them after they have outlived their usefulness to him. Prior to the events of the fourteenth Dragon Ball Z film and Dragon Ball Super, the Pilaf Gang used the Dragon Balls to wish for the restoration of their youth, only for the wish to backfire and they are transformed into young children by Shenron. They later attempted to infiltrate Bulma's birthday party in order to claim the Dragon Balls again, with Pilaf being mistaken for a monkey while Trunks proclaim Mai to be his girlfriend. During the course of the Dragon Ball Super series the Pilaf Gang would gradually reform, much like several of Goku's past adversaries, and they even become Trunks' classmates at school. The Pilaf Gang appear in the first episode of Dragon Ball GT, where they obtain the Black Star Dragon Balls and Pilaf accidentally wish Goku to be a child again, setting in motion the events of the entire series. Pilaf is voiced by Shigeru Chiba in Japanese, Don Brown in the Ocean dub, Mike McFarland in the third Dragon Ball film, and by Chuck Huber in the Funimation dub. Shu is voiced by Tessh≈ç Genda in Japanese, Doug Parker in the Ocean dub, Justin Cook in the third film, and by Chris Cason in the Funimation dub. Mai is one of Pilaf's subordinates along with Shu. She is initially depicted as a beautiful, calculating enemy of Goku and his friends who always resorts to weaponry and technology; her serious tone is a foil to the comic personalities of her colleagues. At some point in time prior to the Cell Games, Mai and her colleagues had used the Dragon Balls to wish for their youth, resulting in them being turned into children. During the Trunks Saga arc of Dragon Ball Super, a once again adult Mai is revealed to be leader of the resistance forces on Earth against the evil Goku Black in an alternate future timeline. This alternate is depicted as a close friend and potential love interest of her timeline's Trunks, and works closely with him and their allies from the main timeline in an effort to defeat Goku Black and foil his so-called Zero Mortal Plan, which involve the complete annihilation of all mortal life in the multiverse. This version of Mai also appears as a supporting character in Super Dragon Ball Heroes, an original net animation based on the arcade game of the same name. Mai is voiced by Eiko Yamada in Japanese, Teryl Rothery in the Ocean dub, Cynthia Cranz in Mystical Adventure, Colleen Clinkenbeard in the Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F', and by Julie Franklin in the Funimation dub. She was portrayed by Eriko Tamura in the American live-action film Dragonball Evolution; her voice was dubbed over by Y≈´ko Kaida in the Japanese version. =Shenron = , Shenron in Funimation's anime dub, also known as the Eternal Dragon in the Ocean and Funimation dubs and as the Dragon God in the Harmony Gold dub, is the wish-granting dragon summoned when all seven of Earth's Dragon Balls are gathered together. Throughout the series, several rules on the Dragon Balls' use and limitations on Shenron's power are explained. After the wish is granted the balls scatter across the planet, turn to stone and are useless for a year, meaning, during this year they can not be detected by Bulma's Dragon Radar. The Dragon Balls also become useless if Shenron is destroyed, in this case they must be recreated by their creator, or if their creator is killed. Shenron can not bestow a wish that exceeds the power of his creator, this is why Shenron couldn't destroy the Saiyans before they came to earth. Midway through the series, it is learned that the Dragon Balls are created by the extraterrestrials named Namekians, Earth's Kami being one of them. A person can only be brought back to life once, and only if that person did not die of natural causes. Earth is without Dragon Balls for a period, when Kami re- merges with Piccolo, until Dende takes over the position of God. When Dende recreates Earth's Dragon Balls, he makes them so that one can now have two wishes, but each wish is still capable of resurrecting multiple individuals at once. Shenron is voiced by Kenji Utsumi in the Japanese version of the series until his death in 2013 with the exclusion of episodes 192 and 193 in the series and the films, in which he is voiced by Masaharu Sat≈ç; he is voiced by Daisuke G≈çri in Dragon Ball GT, by K≈çji Yada in the Dr. Slump remake and by Ry≈´zabur≈ç ≈åtomo since episode 97 of Kai. In the English versions of the series, he is voiced by Don Brown in the Ocean dub, and by Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub. Shenron's Namekian counterpart is . Porunga has a large, muscular humanoid upper body and something similar to a dorsal fin down his back and the Dragon Balls are much larger than Earth's. Unlike Shenron, he can only bring a single person back to life at a time, but he can bring that person back multiple times which Shenron can not. He can also grant three wishes instead of one, additionally the user must speak in the Namekian language. Porunga and the Namekian Dragon Balls were created by the planet's Great Elder, who kept one ball and gave each of the other six to a different elder. When the Namekian Dragon Balls are used again during the fight with Majin Buu, Porunga had been upgraded to be able to wish back multiple people at once and still grant three wishes. Porunga is voiced by Junpei Takiguchi in the Japanese version of the series with the exclusion of episode 283, in which he is voiced by Daisuke G≈çri; he is voiced by Masaharu Sat≈ç in the video games. In Dragon Ball Kai Daisuke G≈çri originally performed the role; after his death, Ry≈´zabur≈ç ≈åtomo took over. He is voiced by Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub of the series. Dragon Ball GT introduces , a much larger red Shenron made by Kami when he and King Piccolo were still one entity. He is summoned when the Dark Dragon Balls, Black Star Dragon Balls in the Funimation dub, are gathered, and can grant any single wish, regardless of any restrictions placed on the other dragons. Ultimate Shenron is voiced by Kenji Utsumi in Japanese, and by Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub. GT also introduces , named Black Smoke Shenron in the Funimation dub, a cigar-smoking dragon who forms from all the negative energy accumulated from the selfish wishes granted throughout the series using the Dragon Balls. Summoned from the same Earth Dragon Balls, he splits into the seven Evil Dragons and they spread out over the Earth, causing the heroes to defeat each one. Daisuke G≈çri voices Evil Shenron in Japanese, and Christopher Sabat voices him in the Funimation dub. Dragon Ball Super introduces and the Super Dragon Balls which are spread throughout Universes 6 and 7. The Super Dragon Balls were created by the Dragon God , are the size of planets and have no restrictions on their wishes, although they only grant one and it must be spoken in the language of the gods. It is revealed that the Namekians took fragments of the Super Dragon Balls to create their own on Planet Namek. Super Shenron is voiced by Ry≈´zabur≈ç ≈åtomo in Japanese and by Christopher Sabat in English. =Supreme Kai = The , referred to as Lords of Lords in Viz's English manga and the Supreme Kai in the English anime dub, are the highest-level deities in the Dragon Ball universe. Like the Kai whom they govern, all Supreme Kai hail from a race of naturally divine beingsDragon Ball: Super Exciting Guides, 2009 While the Kai watch over the living world, the Supreme Kai watch over both the \\"Other World\\" (the afterlife in the Dragon Ball series) and the living world.'Daizenshuu 7, 1996 The Supreme Kai are known for recruiting mortal beings to become their ; Gohan and Trunks trained under their universe's Supreme Kai to prepare for threats like Majin Buu and Dabura, and gained access to healing powers in the process. The Supreme Kai and their followers wear a pair of earrings known as the Potara („Éù„Çø„É©), which allow two individuals to fuse into an amalgamation and permits the wearer to use a Time Ring. In Dragon Ball Super, it is revealed that Gods of Destruction exist and are equal in status to the Supreme Kai. Supreme Kai act as , by providing the energy for the creation of new planets and species, while the Gods of Destruction serve a contrasting purpose by destroying planets or entire civilizations when appropriate to maintain the balance of the universe they oversee. Universe 7 There were originally five Supreme Kai in the Seventh Universe, and much like the Kai, four of them ruled over each of the four quadrants of the universe and a fifth, the , ruled over them in turn. Prior to the events depicted in Dragon Ball, all but one met their fate at the hands of Majin Buu. The Dai Supreme Kai in particular was absorbed by Buu, who then takes a chubby form with an uncanny resemblance to the deity. The Dai Supreme Kai's spirit would continue to manifest within Buu, his benign influence dulling the creature's destructive nature to an extent. The , originally the ruler of the eastern quadrant of Universe 7, became the de facto ruler of the entire universe as a result of the demise of his peers. He has purple skin and a white mohawk and is always accompanied by his larger, reddish-pink skinned, loyal attendant . In the Dragon Ball manga he came to Earth, under the alias , to meet Goku and his friends and recruit them to stop Babidi from reviving Buu. After failing to prevent to Buu's return, Gohan is then taken to the where he is given the (\\"Z Sword\\" in the English anime dub) and put to training. The sword is accidentally broken during Gohan's training, releasing an ancestor of the East Supreme Kai. He uses his power to increase Gohan's and his own life force to resurrect Goku, who made the decision to remain in the afterlife after his death by a self-destructing Cell. The elder Supreme Kai, referred to as the , remains by his descendant's side as an advisor following Majin Buu's defeat, and makes recurring appearances in subsequent Dragon Ball media. Kibito and the East Supreme Kai later gets permanently fused into one being, known as in the manga and as Kibito Kai in the anime, via their use of Potara earrings. Kibito Kai later assists in the final battle with Buu by teleporting Goku and the last survivors on Earth onto his planet and helps take Dende to New Namek to use its Dragon Balls to revive Earth and its people. In Dragon Ball Super, Kibito Kai uses a wish granted by the Namekian Dragon Balls to defuse himself back into the two original component entities. The East Supreme Kai is voiced by Y≈´ji Mitsuya, and by Shinichir≈ç ≈åta in Dragon Ball Super and Battle of Gods. In English the Supreme Kai is voiced by Kent Williams in Funimation's English dub, and by Michael Dobson in the Ocean Group dub. Kibito is voiced by Shin Aomori, by Don Brown in the Ocean Group dub and by Chuck Huber in the Funimation dub. The Elder Kai is voiced by Reiz≈ç Nomoto in Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT, and by Ry≈çichi Tanaka in Dragon Ball Super and Battle of Gods. Tetsuya Iwanaga provides the voice for the Elder Kai's younger self in flashbacks. In English he is voiced by Scott McNeil in the Ocean dub, by Steve Olson in the Blue Water dub, and by Kent Williams in the Funimation dubs. Universe 10 Gowasu („Ç¥„ÉØ„Çπ), known as Gowas in the manga, is the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10. At some point in time in the past, Gowasu chose Zamasu, the North Kai of Universe 10, to be his successor based on his battle talent, a decision he would later regret as he chose an apprentice without noticing the potential for evil within him. Unlike many of his peers from the other Universes, he does not resent Goku or view him as being disrespectful, as he is the only deity outside of Universe 6 and Universe 7 who actually knows him on a personal level. Gowasu, along with his counterpart from Universe 7, traveled to an alternate future world where Zamasu has ravaged the world to assist Goku and his associates in dealing with his former apprentice. During the Tournament of Power arc, Gowasu is shown recruiting team members to fight on behalf of Universe 10, as well as recording and uploading their exploits on a channel known as \\"GodTube\\". In an alternate future timeline, Zamasu succeeds Gowasu as the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10 after he successfully assassinates the latter. Gowasu is voiced by Tetsuo Goto in the Japanese version and by Garrett Schenck in the Funimation dub. =Universe 6 inhabitants= , also known as the , is the sixth of the twelve parallel universes introduced in Dragon Ball Super; the God of Destruction is Champa, the Supreme Kai is , and the Angel is Vados. Universe 6 is linked with Universe 7 as twin universes, and that any planets or species that have existed and/or exist in Universe 7 will exist or are likely have existed in Universe 6, and vice versa. For example, the Saiyan people also exist in Universe 6, but their fates are completely different compared to their Universe 7 counterparts; they live relatively peaceful lives on their homeworld , and were never enslaved or wiped out by their enemies. Instead of conquering other planets, the Saiyans of Universe 6 tamed their desire to battle for good, and use their skills to protect the civilizations of their universe from danger and unrest. Characters from this universe were the first outside of Universe 7 to be introduced upon the reveal of there being multiple other universes. Auta Magetta is a Metalman from Universe 6. In the Tournament of Destroyers, Auta Magetta competed in a tournament against Universe 7. He fought Vegeta where his lava-spewing abilities started to heat up the ring. After breaking the barrier, Vegeta recovered from the overheating and knocked Auta Megetta out of the ring. In the Tournament of Power, Auta Magetta assisted Frost in attacking Vegeta and Master Roshi. Vegeta managed to knock him out of the ring after insulting him. Auta Magetta is voiced by Naoki Tatsuta in the Japanese version. Botamo is a tall yellow humanoid bear from Universe 6 with rubber skin that can withstand any punch. In the Tournament of Destroyers, he faced off against Goku in the tournament against Universe 7. Goku had a hard time landing a blow on Botamo until he grabbed him by the arm and threw him out of the ring. In the Tournament of Power, Botamo faced off against Gohan. The punches from Gohan started to lift Botamo off the ground until it was enough for Gohan to use the Kamehameha to blast Botamo out of the ring. Botamo is voiced by Yasuhiro Takato in the Japanese version and by Cris George in the Funimation dub. Cabba is a Saiyan hailing from Planet Sadala and an elite member of the Sadala Defense Forces, first introduced in Dragon Ball Super. Planet Sadala is also the original homeworld of the Saiyans of Universe 7, but according to Vegeta, it has been destroyed by internal discord long ago and no longer exists. Unlike the arrogant and savage nature exhibited by the vast majority of Saiyans from Universe 7, Cabba is presented as a good-natured and humble individual who speaks respectfully to everyone and sees himself as a protector of the weak. As one of Universe 6's strongest warriors, he is recruited to join Champa's team during the Tournament of Destroyers. Cabba bonds with Vegeta following the events of the tournament and looks up to him as a mentor, in spite of the fact that they fight for opposing teams. He is voiced by Daisuke Kishio in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by Clifford Chapin. Caulifla is a Saiyan from Universe 6 and a member of Team Universe 6 who participates in the Tournament of Power. Brash and headstrong, she is the leader of a group of Saiyan punks. She shows a strong contrast to the rest of her people, acting more akin to the Universe 7 Saiyans who are known for being naturally aggressive and prideful. She also displays a love for getting stronger, which is evident after she heard from her Universe 7 counterparts about various advanced, more powerful forms a Saiyan could attain. Caulifla is voiced by Yuka Komatsu in the Japanese version and by Elizabeth Maxwell in the Funimation dub. Champa is Beerus' twin brother and the God of Destruction of Universe 6, which is linked with the Seventh Universe as its \\"twin universe\\". He looks like an overweight version of Beerus and wears a variation of the traditional Egyptian clothing and ornaments Beerus is wearing and his name also derives from an alcoholic drink, . He has a long-running rivalry with Beerus, and the brothers often bicker or engage in acts of one-upmanship like food contests and proxy wars. During the Universe 6 Saga, Champa holds a fighting tournament known as the Tournament of Destroyers; he forms a team by gathering the strongest warriors from Universe 6 to challenge Universe 7, which consists of Hit, Cabba, Frost, Botamo, and Auta Magetta. Champa is voiced by Mitsuo Iwata in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation bub, his voice is supplied by Jason Liebrecht. Frost is the ruler of an empire based in Universe 6, and hails from the same race of beings as Universe 7's Frieza. He is first introduced in Dragon Ball Super as a competitor for his universe during the Tournament of Destroyers. Unlike Frieza, he is apparently perceived in a positive light by the majority of his subjects in Universe 6. Frost's characterization differs between the manga and anime adaptions of Dragon Ball Super, being a malevolent being not unlike Frieza in the anime, while on the other hand the manga version of the character is simply amoral and unsportsmanlike. In the anime, Frost faces off against Goku, Piccolo and Vegeta in successive rounds in the tournament and defeats Goku and Piccolo by cheating and using his secret poison; Goku is allowed to return to the tournament after this is revealed and Frost is defeated by Vegeta. He is eventually exposed as a devious manipulator who feigns benevolence as a facade, and is in fact a space pirate and planet broker who discreetly profits from warmongering activities in his universe. In the Tournament of Power, Frost meets Frieza before the tournament begins. He accompanied Auta Magetta in fighting Vegeta and Master Roshi. After a failed attempt to use the Evil Containment Wave on Vegeta, Frost fled. Then he met up with Frieza where they fought Gohan. Frieza then double-crosses Frost and blasts him out of the ring. When Frost tries to attack Frieza for double- crossing him, both Zenos erase Frost for violating the rules. This served as a warning to Champa to not let something like this happen again or else their entire universe will be erased. Frost is later restored when Android 17 uses the Super Dragon Balls to restore the erased universes. In the manga, there is no mention of Frost being involved in criminal activities nor any indication of him being evil, and he appears to have a genuinely pleasant personality. He is indifferent to accusations of being a dirty fighter for using his poisonous stingers, as the tournament offers no prize money and the battles are ultimately pointless according to his perspective. Frost is voiced by Ry≈´sei Nakao in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by Greg Ayres. Hit , also known as and as the , is an assassin from Universe 6 introduced in Dragon Ball Super. He is known for using his signature ability to manipulate time and for his capability to eliminate his assassination targets with a single strike. Over a millennium old, he is the strongest member of his universe's team during the Tournament of Destroyers. Hit eventually rebels against Champa and throws his fight against Monaka („É¢„Éä„Ç´), easily the weakest participating member of the opposing Universe 7 team, by eliminating himself in the final match of the tournament. In Japanese, Hit is voiced by Kazuhiro Yamaji. In the English dub, he is voiced Aaron Roberts in Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 and by Matthew Mercer in all subsequent appearances. Kale is a Saiyan from Universe 6 and a member of Team Universe 6 who participates in the Tournament of Power. Kale is Caulifla's best friend, sister-figure, and prot√©g√©. Unlike most Saiyans who are assertive or at least strong-willed, Kale is by nature a very meek and timid individual. Her greatest desire is to fight alongside Caulifla as equals; her devotion to Caulifla have also become a strong trigger for her in battle. Much like Broly from Universe 7, she is the latest Legendary Saiyan of her universe, a demonic warrior who appears once every 1000 years. When accessing her Super Saiyan powers, Kale's personality becomes a polar opposite; shifting through emotions while in her berserker state, she would become excessively violent and savage, showing no mercy to anyone who stands in her way. Kale is voiced by Yukana in the Japanese version and by Dawn M. Bennett in the English dub. Vados , the sister of Whis, is an Angel from Universe 6 who is the attendant and martial arts teacher of Champa. Like Whis, her name is also derived from an alcoholic drink, . In Dragon Ball Super, she is first seen accompanying Champa while searching for the Super Dragon Balls; they are successful in obtaining six of the seven Super Dragon Balls prior to the Tournament of Destroyers. Vados openly displays concern with Champa's physique and health problems and often teases him for being overweight, blaming his weight issues as the cause of his low stamina and his difficulty in keeping up with her training. She is also shown to be polite and respectful, even when addressing lesser beings or those who are not from her universe such as Goku. Vados is voiced by Yuriko Yamaguchi in the Japanese version. In the English version, Vados is voiced by Caitlin Glass in the Funimation English dub and by Wendee Lee in the Bang Zoom! dub. =Universe 11 inhabitants= , also known as the , is the eleventh of the twelve parallel universes introduced in Dragon Ball Super; the God of Destruction is Vermoud (known as Belmod in the anime), the Supreme Kai is , and the Angel is . Universe 11 is linked with Universe 2 as twin universes. The Pride Troopers („Éó„É©„Ç§„Éâ„Éà„É´„Éº„Éë„Éº„Ç∫ Puraido Tor≈´pƒÅsu) are a powerful superhero team who operate in this universe; they work under their God of Destruction, and the most elite Pride Troopers made up the entirety of Team Universe 11 participating in the Tournament of Power, where their combined strength is portrayed as the biggest threat faced by Team Universe 7. Belmod , known as known as \\"Vermoud\\" in the Viz Media localization, is a scrawny humanoid in clown makeup and the God of Destruction of Universe 11. He dislikes evil and is proud of the Pride Troopers' work. Top is his candidate for God of Destruction when Belmod retires. He is usually accompanied by his attendant and martial arts teacher Marcarita. Belmod is voiced by Masami Kikuchi in the Japanese version and by Markus Lloyd in the Funimation dub. Dyspo is the Sphynx cat-like blitz captain of the Pride Troopers. In the Tournament of Power, he used his own super-speed when fighting Hit before retreating. During his fight with Frieza, Dyspo also fought against Gohan who sacrificed himself to get Dyspo out of the ring. Dyspo is voiced by Bin Shimada in the Japanese version and by Christopher Dontrell Piper in the Funimation dub. Jiren , also referred to as , is a gray alien-styled member of the Pride Troopers who served as a major contestant in the Tournament of Power. His quiet, stoic demeanor is but a glimpse of his solitary nature; he is haunted by his past losses and desperately tries to undo it all by forging his own path of justice. While fighting for justice, he has no loyalty to anyone beyond himself, believing that trusting in others will ultimately backfire. Jiren is very proud of his strength and refuses to accept the help of his comrades even in dire moments where he is under severe pressured from his opponents. Jiren is voiced by Eiji Hanawa in the Japanese version and by Patrick Seitz in the Funimation dub. Toppo , known as Top in the anime, is the tall and burly leader of the Pride Troopers, who act as guardians of peace within Universe 11 and formed the majority of participants representing Universe 11 in the Tournament of Power. A hot-blooded yet humble fighter who passionately believes in the concept of justice, Toppo is a candidate to become Universe 11's next God of Destruction, being the second most powerful mortal within his home universe after his comrade Jiren. His commitment to pursuing justice is further seen from his tendency to name his techniques as an extension of justice, such as the Justice Flash. Top is voiced by Kenji Nomura in the Japanese version and by Ray Hurd in the Funimation dub. =Zeno = Grand Zeno (, lit. \\"King of All\\"), also known as the Omni-King and as the Lord of Everything in Viz's English manga, is the supreme deity of the whole Dragon Ball multiverse. Depicted as a childlike humanoid figure, Zeno ranks above all other mortals and gods in the series and has the power to erase entire universes from existence at will. He is served by a pair of identical-looking attendants and is advised by Grand Minister. First appearing during the aftermath of the Tournament of Destroyers between Universes 6 and 7, Zeno is treated with utmost reverence and fear by the other gods and mortals. He is addressed by his subjects as in original Japanese media, and Grand Zeno or the Omni-King in the English dub. Goku is a notable exception; he befriends and addresses Zeno in a casual manner () in the original Japanese, \\"Zenny\\" in the English dub), which is considered disrespectful and lacking in etiquette by most characters in the series. Part of the caution others have around Zeno comes from the fact that he acts and behaves like a child, destroying entire planets and universes out of amusement or dismay. Since the \\"Future\\" Trunks Saga, there are two coequal Zenos. Zeno is voiced by Satomi K≈çrogi in Japanese and by Sarah Wiedenheft in English. Grand Minister The , also known as the Grand Priest in Viz's English manga is an angelic being who serves as a close adviser and guiding figure to Zeno. He is the father of all twelve Angels in the multiverse. The Grand Minister's principal tasks are to implement Zeno's decrees and welcome guests to his palace. During the Zeno Expo and the Tournament of Power, the Grand Minister served as the referee. The character is voiced by Masaya Takatsuka in the Japanese version and by Josh Grelle in the Funimation dub. Anime-exclusive characters The manga's anime and film adaptations feature some original characters not created by Toriyama but by Toei Animation staff; the vast majority of the film adaptations in particular exist in their own unique continuities which branch off from the anime television series at various points, hence original characters introduced in the films are usually unknown to the characters in either or both of the official anime and manga series continuities. Toriyama personally designed certain characters which made their debut appearances in the animated films,Production Guide Toriyama's Contributions to the Anime such as Slug, Cooler, Android 13, Broly, Bojack, and Tapion. =Garlic Jr.= is a character that first appears in Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone. His father was imprisoned by Kami in the realm of darkness, leaving Garlic Jr. with a deep feeling of resentment and desire for revenge. He manages to obtain the seven Dragon Balls, wish for immortality, and begin his quest for revenge. He is defeated when faced with an angry Gohan, who pushes Garlic Jr. into the , an alternate dimension he can freely open. Garlic Jr. is one of the few original characters from the films to appear in the TV series. In the TV series, he breaks free using the as a power source, leading to the events of the Garlic Jr. arc. After brainwashing and transforming all living creatures of the world with the , he is once again trapped in the Dead Zone after the destruction of the Makyo Star. In the original Japanese versions, Garlic Jr. is voiced by Akira Kamiya in the film and by Shigeru Chiba in the anime.

They accompany him to kidnap Gohan, and attack and defeat Piccolo before fighting him again alongside Goku. Nicky and Ginger are killed together by Goku's Kamehamaha, while Sansho is killed by Piccolo.

They help Garlic Jr. take over Kami's, and fight Krillin and Gohan, but in the end, all four are killed by Gohan. =Pikkon= , known as Pikkon in the English anime dub, is a character who is a resident of the Other World (the afterlife in the Dragon Ball series), and first appears in the one hundred ninety-fifth episode of Dragon Ball Z and the first episode of the Other World arc, where he first encounters Son Goku and his mentor the . While his mentor the is a bitter rival of his northern quadrant counterpart due to a sense of competition among the Kai over whose quadrant has the best fighters, he develops a friendly rivalry with Goku after competing against each other in the Other World Tournament held in honor of the recently deceased North Kai. The character later appears in Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn as a major supporting character, and in various Dragon Ball video games. Akira Toriyama had purposely designed the character to be similar to Piccolo in terms of appearance, role, and personality; there are even memos left for the anime's production staff which specifically instructs using Piccolo as a reference for facial expressions.TV Anime Guide: Dragon Ball Z Son Goku Densetsu, October 3, 2003. His popularity with the Dragon Ball fandom is noted by Screenrant's Craig Elvy; in a V-Jump survey conducted in 2017 prior to the airing of the anime adaptation of the Tournament of Power storyline, he is voted by Japanese fans as the favourite choice to replace Mr. Buu as a participant from Universe 7.Animedia, September 2017 issue. The character is voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa in Japanese media, by Brian Drummond in the Ocean Dub, and by Kyle Hebert in the Funimation anime dub. =Giru= is a character that first appears in the 3rd episode of Dragon Ball GT. Originally known as T2006 or DB4649T2006RS, Giru is a Machine Mutant, fully mechanical beings with organic properties: they can mold, contort, and reshape themselves like organic lifeforms, absorb and integrate metallic and mechanical materials into their own being, as well as restructuring themselves. He is encountered by Goku, Pan and Trunks on Imecka. Giru consumes their Dragon Radar for energy in an act of desperation for survival, inadvertably integrating the Dragon Radar's functionality into his software. Giru joins Goku's group and accompanies them to various planets in the galaxy on their quest to find the Black Star Dragon Balls. Giru would become good friends with Pan in the series; however, he is frequently the recipient of abuse, both verbal and physical, at the hands of Pan, which makes him somewhat fearful of her. Giru plays a pivotal role during the group's encounter with his creator Doctor Myuu as well as the parasitic Baby on the planet M-2, and aids them in their subsequent struggle against the villains. During the Shadow Dragons arc, Giru accompanies Goku and Pan to search for the seven Shadow Dragons using his built-in Dragon Radar functionality to track the creatures. He is voiced by Shinobu Satouchi in Japanese media and by Sonny Strait in the Funimation anime dub. =Doctor Myuu= is a recurring antagonistic character that first appears in the 13th episode of Dragon Ball GT. A brilliant but mad Machine Mutant scientist, he is assisted by his enforcer and intends to gather the Black Star Dragon Balls to complete what appears to be his ultimate creation, Baby. His plans are eventually foiled by Goku, Pan and Trunks after they arrive on the planet M-2 and defeat most of his minions. Myuu escapes and evades Goku and his companions after Baby's apparent defeat, only to be killed when Baby suddenly emerges from his body. It is then revealed that Baby was the one who created and programmed Dr. Myuu, and not the other way around. He later joins forces with Doctor Gero while in Hell to create a duplicate of Android 17 using Myuu's machine mutant technology, who then manipulates the original Android 17 into converging their power together to open a rift between Earth and Hell, enabling him and his co-creators to escape. Android 17 and his machine mutant duplicate eventually fuse together to become Super 17, who subsequently turns on and murders both Gero and Myuu. He is voiced by Kazuyuki Sogabe in Japanese media and Duncan Brannan in the Funimation anime dub. Merchandise Several pieces of merchandise were released based on the characters from the series. These include key chains, action-figures and plush. Other merchandise featuring characters includes T-shirts, tumblers and trading card games. Characters are also featured in video games from the series. While initial games were role-playing games (RPG), the following became fighting games. Reception Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network (ANN) stated, \\"Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way Dragon Ball Z has. To a certain generation of television consumers its characters are as well known as any in the animated realm, and for many it was the first step into the wilderness of anime fandom.\\" His colleague Allen Divers praised the story and humor of the manga for being very good at conveying all of the characters' personalities. Carlo Santos, also of ANN, commented that the Dragon Ball cast \\"may not be as stylish-looking as today's shonen adventure protagonists, but every character has a distinctive set of physical features, making them identifiable at any moment.\\" DVD Talk's Todd Douglass had strong praise for the \\"deep, insightful, and well-developed\\" characters, writing \\"Few shows can claim to have a cast quite like Dragon Ball's, and that's a testament to the creative genius of Toriyama.\\" However, he felt the Red Ribbon Army was \\"hit or miss.\\" Tim Jones of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews praised the series for having good characterization, saying \\"You do care about them, and want to get to know more about them.\\" He considered them to be different from stereotypical stock characters, but noted that they have much more development early on than when compared to later in the series. Theron Martin, also of ANN, wrote that while the characters are not complicated, they are \\"easy to love, hate, and respect\\" and are a major reason for the series popularity. \\"The immense pride of Vegeta, and how that can be a fatal flaw, especially shines through, as do the freewheeling spirits of Goten and Trunks, the naivet√© of Buu and Mr. Satan's attention-loving, glory-hound nature, while Number 18 shows an unexpectedly cunning side.\\", \\"On the downside, Videl is entirely too under-used to make much of an impact and Bulma loses something just sitting around acting like a worried mother/wife.\\" He also praised the themes from the warriors, saying they speak to \\"basic yet powerful themes like faith, confidence, heroism, sacrifice, love, and understanding what is truly worth fighting for\\", and the ways they react while fighting, although the fights can sometimes become very long with little plot development. He criticized how the series overused the plot device of having characters \\"grow seemingly untouchably powerful, only to be put out when eventually upstaged.\\" In a review of Dragon Ball GT, Jeffrey Harris of IGN commented that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun, and also criticized the character designs of Trunks and Vegeta as being goofy.

A Democrat like his father Harvey Magee Watterson, Henry Watterson for five decades after the American Civil War was a part-owner and editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal, which founded by Walter Newman Haldeman and would be purchased by Robert Worth Bingham in 1919, who would end the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist's association with the paper. Early and family life Born in Washington, D.C. on February 16, 1840, to the former Tilithacumi (Talitha) Black of Spring Hill, Tennessee and her husband, Harvey Magee Watterson, a Shelbyville, Tennessee lawyer and U.S. Congressman. His father was close to President Andrew Jackson, also from Tennessee, and in 1843 would become the publisher of the Washington Union, the main newspaper of the Democratic party of that era. His uncle in Ohio would also become a newspaper editor, lawyer, Union soldier during the Civil War and ultimately Republican U.S. Supreme Court justice Stanley Matthews. Henry was an only child, with neither brothers nor sisters. He was sickly, with very poor eyesight and that only in one eye, so that his mother home-schooled him in Washington, D.C. and their home in Nashville, Tennessee.1850 U.S. Federal Census for Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee family 528 in dwelling 429 also included two male boarders, a 28 year old clerk and an 18 year old trainee barrister until he was twelve years old. She then sent him to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he received his only formal education, at an academy run by an Episcopal priest, and he also ran the school paper, the New Era, on a press his father donated. After the American Civil War as discussed below, in September 1865, Watterson returned to Nashville to marry Rebecca Ewing (1842-1929), with whom he would have six sons and two daughters. They were able to hire live-in Irish servants, and by 1880 his parents also lived with them.1880 U.S. Federal Census for district 124, Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky family 79 Their sons were Ewing (1868- ),1870 U.S. Federal Census for Louisville Ward 6, Jefferson County, Kentucky family 459 Henry Jr. (1877-) and Harvey W. Watterson (1879‚Äì1908) and their daughters were Lady (1871-) and Ethel Watterson Gilmour (1880‚Äì1907; who died in childbirth). Career Watterson became a newspaper reporter early in his life. In 1856 he moved to New York to work on various publication, and in 1858 he moved to Washington to work on other publications. When his father returned to Tennessee in 1861 after the outbreak of the American Civil War, Henry Watterson did too. He volunteered for the Confederate States Army, and was attached at various times to the staffs of Generals Joseph E. Johnston, Leonidas Polk and Nathan B. Forrest. His main contribution to the Confederate war effort, however, was editorial, with the Chattanooga Rebel and the Nashville Banner. After the Confederacy lost, Watterson edited the Cincinnati Evening Post for six months. By September 1865 Watterson returned to Nashville, married, become editor and part owner of the Nashville Banner, where he began his ‚ÄúNew Departure‚Äù campaign urging national reconciliation. Watterson ultimately settled down in Louisville, Kentucky, having met Walter Newman Haldeman during the war, and began editing the Louisville Journal. That paper merged with the Louisville Courier in 1868, forming the Courier-Journal. This paper soon gained national attention for its excellent reporting. Watterson was a leader of the Liberal Republican movement in 1872. By 1876 he was a Democrat; his proposal for hundreds of thousands of Democrats to march on Washington to force the election of Tilden angered President Ulysses S. Grant, who noted that nobody threatened Grant. Watterson was elected to fill the rest of Edward Y. Parsons' term in the U.S. House when Parsons died in office. Watterson was called \\"the last of the great personal journalists\\", writing colorful and controversial editorials on many topics under the pen name \\"Marse Henry\\". Hundreds of American papers republished them; they were an early exemplar of the syndicated column which played a significant role creating public support for U.S. intervention in the First World War. Watterson won the Pulitzer Prize in 1918 for two editorials supporting U.S. entry into World War I (\\"Vae Victis!\\" and \\"War Has Its Compensations\\"), and he remained the paper's editor until 1919, retiring after conflicts with Robert Worth Bingham, who purchased the paper in 1918. During his tenure as editor, Watterson was a Democratic representative in Congress from 1876 to 1877. He was also a five-time delegate to the National Democratic Convention, where, in 1892, Watterson received a smattering of votes for the vice presidential nomination. He became widely known as a lecturer and orator. His publications include History of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1899) and The Compromises of Life (1902). Death and legacy Watterson died in Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida in 1921, survived for several years by his widow as well as many grandchildren. He was interred the Louisville's Cave Hill cemetery. The portion of I-264 from the junction with US 31W to its northeastern terminus at I-71 is known as the Watterson Expressway. A Jefferson County Public School in eastern Louisville is named Watterson Elementary School. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

It breeds in central Asia-Afghanistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia; Russian Federation (European Russia, Central Asian Russia), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan. It is migratory, wintering in India and Bangladesh. Its status in western Europe, where it is a potential vagrant, is confused by escapes, especially as this species is more commonly recorded than the closely related black-headed bunting, despite the latter having a more westerly breeding range. Reports in Britain have declined dramatically over recent years, coinciding with the decline in Asiatic imports for the cage-bird trade. The red-headed bunting breeds in open scrubby areas including agricultural land. It lays three to five eggs in a nest in a tree or bush. Its natural food consists of seeds, or when feeding young, insects. This bird is 17 cm long, larger than reed bunting, and long-tailed. The breeding male has bright yellow underparts, green upperparts and a brownish-red face and breast. The female is a washed-out version of the male, with paler underparts, a grey-brown back and a greyish head.

It was directed by Tim Whelan and produced by Alexander Korda from a screenplay by Ian Dalrymple and Arthur Wimperis, adapted by Lajos B√≠r√≥ from the play Counsel's Opinion by Gilbert Wakefield. The music score was by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa and Lionel Salter and the cinematography by Harry Stradling. The film was made in early three-strip Technicolor and is a remake of the 1933 film Counsel's Opinion, also from London Films and in which Binnie Barnes appeared in the role played by Merle Oberon. Plot Stranded by a thick London fog late one evening and desperate for a place to stay, Leslie Steele (Merle Oberon), a young, pretty but madcap socialite, quietly barges her way into a hotel suite occupied by Everard Logan (Laurence Olivier), a handsome but distant lawyer who specializes in divorce cases. He promptly registers one objection after another, but all of his efforts to evict Leslie are to no avail. He thus agrees to a compromise, allowing her use of the bedroom, while he takes another room in the same suite. However, at breakfast the next morning, Logan changes his tune regarding Ms. Steele and insists they must meet again. But while he's out of the room, dressing, she mysteriously bolts for home, which she shares with her grandfather/judge (Morton Selten). The zany, impulsive Ms. Steele tells her grandfather she intends to marry Lawyer Logan. To her surprise, she learns that Logan will be presenting a case in her grandfather's court that day, so she attends the proceeding to observe Logan in action -- and to her further surprise, sees him mercilessly rip to shreds a woman accused of adultery. As Leslie and Everard spend the rest of the film struggling to adjust to each other's whims and differences, a subplot involving Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson), one of Logan's clients, is interwoven into the complicated plot-line. A confusion of identities ensues, as at one point, Logan is led to mistakenly believe that Leslie is actually Lord Mere's wife (played by Binnie Barnes). But after a weekend fox hunt at the lord's manor, all conflicts are satisfactorily explained away, and the two lovers are reconciled. In fact, by the story's end, Leslie has successfully transformed Everard from the inhumane, hostile, woman-browbeating counselor she witnessed earlier in the film into a more empathetic, understanding, sensitive courtroom-interrogator of \\"the gentle sex\\".

Features The requirements for Nestopia were considered higher than some of its contemporaries such as Stella. In order to run an optimal emulation, the program requires a minimum 800 MHz processor. Its high requirement is due to its accurate emulation of the NES hardware. The emulator will play most ROMs and has a strong port for the Apple Macintosh. Nestopia allows customization of colors, sounds, and graphics. It includes special features such as Power Glove. Brandon Widdler of Digital Trends considers the emulator one of the best for the NES, though he admits that it has fewer features than its rival FCEUX.

The most common form of Jaffa cakes are circular, in diameter and have three layers: a Genoise sponge base, a layer of orange flavoured jam and a coating of chocolate. Jaffa cakes are also available as bars or in small packs, and in larger and smaller sizes. The original Jaffa Cakes now come in packs of 10, 20, 30, or 40, having been downsized in 2017 from 12 or 24 per pack. Because McVitie's did not register the name \\"Jaffa Cakes\\" as a trademark, other biscuit manufacturers and supermarkets have made similar products under the same name. The product's classification as a cake or biscuit was part of a VAT tribunal in 1991, with the court finding in McVitie's favour that the Jaffa cake should be considered a cake for tax purposes. In 2012 they were ranked the best selling cake or biscuit in the United Kingdom.\\"Jaffa Cakes - definitely not biscuits - prepare to take on imitators\\" . The Daily Telegraph. Retrieved 28 December 2014 Manufacture McVitie's entire line of Jaffa cakes are produced in the United Kingdom at the McVitie's factory in Stockport. The Jaffa cake production area covers an acre () and includes a production line over a mile () long which sits on the Stockport side of the site's boundary with Manchester. Because of the nature of the product ‚Äì having multiple components of cake, chocolate covering and jam ‚Äì special hardware accelerators were devised to allow rapid computer inspection of 20 products per second, taking place under four symmetrically placed lights. Flavour variants Although Jaffa cakes are usually orange flavour, limited edition flavours have been available, such as lemon-and-lime, strawberry and blackcurrant. McVities launched limited-edition pineapple flavour Jaffa cakes in early 2020. Taxation In the United Kingdom, value added tax is payable on chocolate- covered biscuits, but not on chocolate-covered cakes. McVities defended its classification of Jaffa Cakes as cakes at a VAT tribunal in 1991, against the ruling that Jaffa cakes were biscuits due to their size and shape, and the fact that they were often eaten in place of biscuits. McVities insisted that the product was a cake, and allegedly produced a giant Jaffa cake in court to illustrate its point. The product was assessed on the following criteria: * The product's name was regarded as a minor consideration. * The ingredients were regarded as similar to those of a cake, producing a thin cake-like batter rather than the thick dough of a biscuit. * The product's texture was regarded as being that of a sponge cake. * The product hardens when stale, in the manner of a cake. * A substantial part of the Jaffa cake, in terms of bulk and texture, is sponge. * In size, the Jaffa cake is more like a biscuit than a cake. * The product was generally displayed for sale alongside other biscuits, rather than with cakes. * The product is presented as a snack and eaten with the fingers, like a biscuit, rather than with a fork as a cake might be. The tribunal also considered that children would eat them in \\"a few mouthfuls\\", in the manner of a sweet. The court found in favour of McVitie's and ruled that the product should be considered a cake, meaning that VAT is not paid on Jaffa cakes in the United Kingdom. The Irish Revenue Commissioners also regard Jaffa cakes as cakes, since their moisture content is greater than 12%. As a result, they are charged the reduced rate of VAT (13.5% ).

It is a comedy of mistaken identity, with Hay acting as a German spy and also an Englishman who is his double. It was the film debut of Peter Ustinov. Plot summary Set during the Second World War, the film recounts the adventures of William Potts (Will Hay) after it is discovered that he is an exact double of a German spy who the British have just captured. Potts is flown into Nazi Germany to impersonate the spy and instructed to seek out and bring back details of a new German secret weapon. On arrival, however, Potts is placed in charge of a group of apparently rabidly-fascist young students who are being trained to work as spies in Britain. Potts attempts to undermine this by convincing the youngsters that the proper British way of saluting a great leader is to apply the V-sign, which they therefore do repeatedly and enthusiastically in the direction of a portrait of the F√ºhrer. At a function where he hopes to gather information about the weapon (a gasfire bomb), Potts succeeds only in getting blind drunk and admitting that he is a British agent. Luckily, some members of his class of Nazi youths turn out to be sympathetic Austrians and they help him obtain the secret he seeks. Potts and his new friends eventually commandeer a plane and fly back to Britain, crashing in a tree outside the War Office in London. Direction Will Hay shared directorial credit with Basil Dearden following on from their previous collaboration, The Black Sheep of Whitehall. Art Director, Michael Relph described Dearden and Hay's input as directors 'Basil was very expert at directing comedy, and that is what he contributed when working with Will Hay. Hay was important as a star, and he could more or less dictate what he wanted to direct, but really he did not direct. Basil directed and supplied all the expertise that Hay probably lacked.'Liberal Directions: Basil Dearden and Post War British Film Culture by Alan Burton, Tim O'Sullivan and Paul Wells Barry Morse who played Kurt had a slightly different take on the directorial responsibilities. 'Basil Dearden was largely concerned with purely technical things, angles, lenses, lighting details. He didn't have a very active part, it seemed to me, in the actual performance directing. That was something which Will Hay had a certain amount to do with.'Will Hay by Graham Rinaldi p313The Goose Steps Out is also noted as the film debut of a young Peter Ustinov.

An auxiliary route of I-64, it is signed as the Shawnee Expressway for its first eight miles from its western terminus at I-64/US-150 to US-31W/US-60; and as the Watterson Expressway for the remainder of its length from US-31W/US-60 to its northeastern terminus at I-71. It is 22.93 miles (36.90 km) in length, and runs an open circle around central Louisville, Kentucky. The highway begins four miles (6 km) west of downtown at I-64 just east of the Sherman Minton Bridge which links Southern Indiana with Kentucky as it crosses the Ohio River. The interstate ends approximately six miles northeast of downtown Louisville, where it connects to I-71. I-264 is Louisville's inner beltway (in conjunction with I-64 and I-71) and the later constructed I-265, the Gene Snyder Freeway, is Louisville's outer beltway. I-264 is currently used as the primary detour route when Interstate 64 is closed through Downtown Louisville. However, in late 2016 with the completion of the East End Bridge, the formerly separate segments of I-265 in Kentucky and Indiana have been connected to provide another detour route. In discussions about the city, Interstate 264 is often used as a rough line dividing the older areas of Louisville from its suburbs. History East- bound I-264 on the approach to I-64 and Shelbyville Road exits In 1948, a two- lane bypass was built between Shelbyville Road and U.S. Route 31W (Dixie Highway) in Louisville, as a relocation of US 60. It was named the \\"Watterson Expressway\\" after local journalist and editor Henry Watterson. In the late '50s, the original two-lane road was upgraded to a four-lane controlled access highway while simultaneously extended to US 42. In the late '60s, it would be extended further to its eastern terminus at I-71 when that interstate was built around the same time. Between 1970 and 1974, the western segment from Dixie Highway to I-64 northwest of downtown Louisville was opened in segments when the entire expressway became part of the Interstate Highway System and designated as I-264. The original section from Dixie Highway to I-71 still retained the \\"Watterson Expressway\\" moniker and was co-signed, along with the original US 60 designation, as I-264, while the western segment was originally named the \\"Shawnee Expressway\\", even though signage referred to it simply as \\"I-264\\", with no mention of the \\"Shawnee Expressway\\" name. The interstate was completed in 1974. The designation US 60 was dropped in 1984 when the original surface roads through Louisville were restored to their original US 60 designations. On April 1, 2010, the Kentucky General Assembly designated the western portion to be renamed as the Georgia Davis Powers Expressway. The original Dixie Highway to I-71 segment signage reads as \\"I-264 Watterson Expressway\\", while the western segment signage still only reads as \\"I-264\\", with a small sign at both the western I-64 terminus, and the Dixie interchange reading \\"Georgia Davis Powers Expressway\\". =Watterson Expressway Reconstruction (1985‚Äì1995)= U.S. Route 31E and Interstate 264 The Watterson Expressway underwent a major reconstruction effort that began in 1985. The vintage freeway had outlived its useful purpose and had numerous characteristics that defined it as a blight on Louisville: deteriorating overpasses, buckling pavement, deficient and too closely spaced interchanges, and rampant congestion. Dozens of bridges were reconstructed and widened, and the majority of the interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt from the ground up from Dixie Highway east to Shelbyville Road. The entire highway reconstruction project was completed in 1995. A typical deficient interchange along I-264 was the I-65, Kentucky Exposition Center and Louisville International Airport exit. Before the reconstruction, two cloverleafs with no collector and distributor lanes existed and posed serious weaving issues. The interchange today has been rebuilt and features numerous flyovers and collector and distributor lanes, making it safer, though not necessarily easier to navigate. =Shawnee Expressway Reconstruction (2003‚Äì2004)= The segment of I-264 from Dixie Highway to the northwest I-64 interchange opened in segments from 1970 to August 1974 and received no more than emergency or spot patching. After several years of planning, in early 2003, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet began a rehabilitation project on this segment of Interstate Highway stretching from the Dixie Highway interchange northwest to just east of Bank Street. A concrete surface several inches thick was constructed on the mainline and access ramps, a new median barrier was formed, new lighting fixtures were installed, 37 bridges were rehabilitated, and 380 new roadway signage was posted and all guardrails were replaced as part of the project. In addition, the segment from River Park Drive to I-64, which was only two lanes, was widened to three lanes. No major ramp or interchange modifications were needed. The highway reconstruction project cost approximately $66 million and required 18 months of labor. About 70,000 vehicles a day use the portion of Interstate 264 near Dixie Highway and about 40,000 daily use the segment near its western terminus with I-64. =Westport Road interchange (2008-2010)= Although the Kentucky General Assembly considered plans for an interchange with Westport Road (Kentucky Route 1447) as early as 1992, work did not begin until October 2008 and was completed in May 2010.Courier-Journal article dated 10/1/08 Exit list See also *Roads in Louisville, Kentucky References Further reading * External links *Interstate-Guide.com - Interstate 264 (KY) page 64-2 64-2 Kentucky 0264 264 2 (Kentucky) U.S. Route 60 Transportation in Jefferson County, Kentucky ","title":"Interstate 264 (Kentucky)"},{"id":"1001763","text":"Shawnee Expressway may refer to: *Shawnee Expressway (Kentucky) *Shawnee Expressway (West Virginia) ","title":"Shawnee Expressway"},{"id":"1001771","text":"Watterson can refer to several different things.

They are trained to operate in mountainous terrain and in urban warfare. History Chasseurs alpins during the Occupation of the Ruhr in Buer (now Gelsenkirchen), 1923. France created its own mountain corps in the late 19th century in order to oppose any Italian invasion through the Alps. In 1859‚Äì70 Italy became unified, forming a powerful state. The French army saw this geopolitical change as a potential threat to their Alpine border, especially as the Italian army was already creating troops specialized in mountain warfare (the Alpini). On December 24, 1888, the first troupes de montagne (\\"mountain troops\\") corps were created from 12 of the 31 existing Chasseurs √† pied (\\"Hunters on Foot'\\"/\\"Foot Rifles'\\") battalions. Initially these units were named bataillons alpins de chasseurs √† pied (\\"Alpine Battalions of Hunters on Foot\\"/\\"Alpine Foot Rifle Battalions\\"). Later this was shortened to bataillons de chasseurs alpins (\\"Alpine Hunter Battalions\\"/\\"Alpine Rifle Battalions\\"). From their establishment the chasseurs Alpins wore a plain and practical uniform designed to be suitable for mountain service. This comprised a loose-fitting dark blue jacket and blue-grey breeches, together with a large beret carrying the yellow (daffodil) hunting horn insignia of the Chasseur branch. They are believed to have been the first regular military unit to have worn this form of headdress. Modern unit Training of chasseurs alpins on the Mont Blanc massif. 13th Battalion in Chamb√©ry (Savoie) Since 1999 they have been (with other units) part of the 27th Mountain Infantry Brigade (Brigade d'Infanterie de Montagne), and are currently organised into three battalions: * 7th Battalion, Varces (Grenoble) * 13th Battalion, Chamb√©ry * 27th Battalion, Cran-Gevrier (Annecy) All three battalions are based in cities in the French Alps, thus the name of the units. Training includes climbing, cross-country skiing, plus winter and summer mountain leadership and mountain guiding skills completed at the High Mountain Military School. Traditional training included mountain survival skills such as to build an igloo shelter and to sleep in temperatures around 0 ¬∞C. Modern troops may be transported in all-terrain VMBs, VACs, (Bandvagn 206) or untracked VAB personnel carriers. Personal weaponry includes the FAMAS assault rifle, Minimi machine gun, FRF-2 sniper rifle, PGM H√©cate II heavy sniper rifle, and LGI light mortar, while group weapons included the M2 machine gun, LLR 81mm mortar, and vehicle- mounted 20 mm autocannon, plus AT4, ERYX and MILAN anti-tank missiles. The chasseurs are easily recognised by their wide beret (when not in battle uniform), named the tarte des Alpes (after a type traditional alpine hat). Note though that this is also worn by other mountain troops, such as the Alpine infantry, cavalry, artillery, and signals. However the mountain troops of the Foreign Legion engineers wear the legion green beret. The 16th battalion of chasseurs are not mountain troops and wear the standard French Army blue beret with the chasseur cap badge. Tundra Camouflage French Tundra Camouflage Current winter uniform consists of 'Tundra' camouflage made in 50/50 ripstop. It was specifically created for the Chasseurs & has later been adopted by other French units such as the GCM for winter exercises. Various traditions Military band of the chasseurs alpins Chasseurs do not say rouge (red) but bleu-cerise (cherry blue - The color of blood on their blue uniforms), except when speaking of the color of the lips of a beloved, the red in the Legion of Honour's insignia (including its fourrag√®re which is called la rouge), and the red of the French flag. This stems from the days when Napoleon III tried to impose the wearing of the scarlet pantalons garance. The mountain troops objected, and no longer use the word 'red' as a result. The chasseurs have a few other typicalities in what they say: * not jaune (yellow), but jonquille (daffodil); * not uniforme (uniform), but tenue (outfit, or dress), like in the Royale; * not la musique (the music), but la fanfare (the band); * the band does not joue (play), but sonne (the band sounds); * not tambour (drum), but caisse claire (snare drum); * and not caserne (barracks), but quartier (neighborhood, barracks, or quarters). The chasseurs are said to have green blood, after the pun: \\"Le sang vert, c'est pour la France; Le sang vers√© pour la France\\" (\\"Green blood is for France'; Blood shed, 'poured out', for France\\"). Note that these traditions are also shared by the 16th battalion of chasseurs, who are not chasseurs alpins. When marching with the band and horns, the marching pace is 140 steps a minute - faster than most other armed forces units, with the exception of the Italian Bersaglieri, whose pace is 180 steps per minute. The chasseurs alpins are informally known as Les diables bleus (Eng: The Blue Devils). Monuments and memorials to the unit, such as Memorial to the Chasseur Alpins are marked Aux Diables Bleus (Eng: To the Blue Devils). Choruses and Ringin A chasseur salutes when he hears the chorus of his battalion, or Les Allobroges (the anthem of Savoie). Each battalion has a different chorus, and a chasseur must learn all of them: * 1 bataillon ¬´ Si l'septi√®me de ligne a des couilles au cul, C'est qu'le Premier Chasseurs les lui a foutues ! ¬ª * 2 bataillon ¬´ Le Commandant a mal aux dents, mes enfants ! ¬ª (bis) * 3 bataillon ¬´ V'la l'troisi√®me, v'la l'troisi√®me, qui rapplique au galop, V'la l'troisi√®me, v'la l'troisi√®me, qui rapplique sac au dos ! ¬ª * 4 bataillon ¬´ Quatri√®me bataillon, Commandant Clinchant, Toujours en avant ! ¬ª * 5 bataillon ¬´ Cinqui√®me Bataillon ventre √† terre, Command√© par Certain Canrobert, en avant ! ¬ª * 6 bataillon ¬´ Le sixi√®me est l√†, il est un peu l√† ! ¬ª * 7 bataillon ¬´ Bataillon, Bataillon, Bataillon de fer, Bataillon, Bataillon, Bataillon d'acier ¬ª. * 8 bataillon ¬´ T'as beau courir, tu ne m'rattraperas pas ! ¬ª (bis) * 9 bataillon ¬´ Marie, j'ai vu ton cul tout nu, Cochon, pourquoi le regardes-tu ? ¬ª * 10 bataillon ¬´ Dixi√®me Bataillon, Commandant Mac-Mahon, N'a pas peur du canon nom de nom ¬ª * 11 bataillon ¬´ Onzi√®me Bataillon de Chasseurs Alpins, Onzi√®me Bataillon d'lapins ¬ª * 12 bataillon ¬´ Ah c'qu'il est con, c'qu‚Äôil est con l'Douzi√®me, Ah c'qu‚Äôil est con, c'qu‚Äôil est con c'con l√† ! ¬ª * 13 bataillon ¬´ Sans pain, sans fricot, au treizi√®me on n'boit que d'l'eau ! ¬ª * 14 bataillon ¬´ La peau de mes roulettes pour une casquette, La peau de mes rouleaux pour un shako ! ¬ª * 15 bataillon ¬´ Je fumerais bien une pipe, Mais je n‚Äôai pas de tabac ! ¬ª * 16 bataillon ¬´ Seizi√®me Bataillon d'Chasseurs √† pied, Seizi√®me Bataillon d'Acier ! ¬ª * 17 bataillon ¬´ Cr√© nom d'un chien, nous voil√† bien partis, Cr√© nom d'un chien, nous voil√† bien ! ¬ª * 18 bataillon ¬´ Encore un biffin d'enfil√©, rompez, Encore un biffin d'enfil√© ! ¬ª * 19 bataillon ¬´ Trou du cul, trou du cul plein de poils sales, Trou du cul, trou du cul poilu ! ¬ª * 20 bataillon ¬´ Vingti√®me Bataillon, Commandant Cambriels, Les Chasseurs √† pied ont des ailes ! ¬ª * 21 bataillon ¬´ En voulez-vous des kilom√®tres ?

Other ranges nearby include RAF Holbeach, also on The Wash, and RAF Donna Nook. It was also known as The Wash (North side) Bombing Range. It was only a few miles south-west of Gibraltar Point. History The range opened to aerial operations in August 1938; but had previously been used as a range from 1890 by the 1st Lincolnshire Artillery. However, there is evidence that the area was in use for military practice as far back as Napoleonic times when the River Steeping was navigable and Wainfleet itself was an important harbour. During the 1920s and 1930s it was also used by the RAF and Royal Artillery. The range was administered by RAF Coningsby as an Air Weapons Range within RAF Strike Command. During the Second World War, it was used by 617 Squadron to test the Stabilizing Automatic Bomb Sight. Postwar, it was used by both fixed wing and rotary aircraft from NATO. On 1 April 2006 control was transferred to Defence Estates and the range was then administered by Defence Training Estates (East) from their headquarters at West Tofts Camp near Thetford. Due to funding cuts the range was closed for operations on 2 December 2009 and finally closed in July 2010. The tower and some surrounding buildings reopened as holiday accommodation in 2017. Operation The site was controlled from the Control Tower. Targets included old ships. There were two smaller wooden observation towers to the east nearer the shore but these were demolished in 2009. Access was via a narrow road called Sea Lane via the junction with the A52 at the Barley Mow at Friskney Eaudyke. =Weapons clearance= The site was cleared daily by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team from RAF Coningsby. Although the range has finally closed unrecovered ordnance and unexploded ordnance will remain for many years. =SSSI= The range area is a Site of Special Scientific Interest thanks to the large number of resident and migrating birds found there. The location is a major stopping point for flocks of brent geese on their way from the Arctic coast. There is also the red-legged partridge.

Cambodian-English Dictionary. Bureau of Special Research in Modern Languages. The Catholic University of America Press. Washington, D.C. (27 December 1875 ‚Äì 24 April 1941) was the King of Cambodia from 9 August 1927 until his death in 1941. During his reign, Cambodia was a French protectorate. Monivong was the grandson of the poet-king Ang Duong, grandfather of Norodom Sihanouk and the great-grandfather of the current king, Norodom Sihamoni. His full regnal title and style was (Preah Bat Samdach Preah Serei Monivarman Krom Luang Chao Chakarbangsa Sisowath Monivong Nai Preah Reacheanachak Kampuchea) which can be literally translated from Khmerized Sanskrit as \\"His majesty, glorious lord scholar-protector; His highness, lord of land and sea, Sisowath Monivong of the Kingdom of Kampuchea\\". Life King Monivong with Alexandre Varenne, the Governor-General of French Indochina. Born in Phnom Penh in 1875, Sisowath Monivong was the sixth child and the second son of King Sisowath.Jeldres, Julio A., 2003, The Royal House Of Cambodia, Monument Books, Phnom Penh His mother was Neak Moneang Van, later titled Samdeach Preah Voreachini, the fifth child-bearing wife of Sisowath. At that time his uncle King Norodom ruled from Odong, the capital of Cambodia. Norodom was a puppet king for the French colonial protectorate. In 1884, after the French conquered Laos and occupied Vietnam, Cambodia became a direct colonial possession. The royal family then moved from Odong to the new capital of Phnom Penh, where Sisowath Monivong resided. In 1904, both of his uncles and his elder brother Essaravong died, resulting in Sisowath Monivong becoming the Crown Prince of Cambodia. In 1906, he traveled with his father, King Sisowath, to France. There he was admitted to the Military School of Saint- Maixent. He graduated two years later with the rank Sous Lieutenant in the Foreign Legion. He was then posted to Brive and later to Paris. In 1909, he returned to Cambodia. In 1910, he was promoted to Lieutenant, in 1916 to Captain, and finally, in 1922, to Chief of Battalion. The same year he was released from military service. During the First World War, he actively recruited volunteer military personnel and workers. These services were recognized with the Cross of Commander of the Foreign Legion and the Cambodian title of Samdech Preah Keofea. He was then appointed Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers and President of the Council of the Royal Family. Monivong had many consorts, at least six of whom were granted official recognition, having borne children to him. One of these was a woman named Meak, a member of the Royal Ballet, who was given the title Khun Preah Moneang Bopha Norleak Meak. Meak bore Monivong's son, Prince Sisowath Kusarak, in 1926. Around 1934‚Äì1935, two of her young cousins came to live with her, a common Cambodian custom.Chandler, David P., 1992, Brother Number One: A political biography of Pol Pot, Silkworm Books, Thailand: 8 The youngest, 6‚Äì7 years old, had been given the name Saloth Sar at birth, but would later adopt the name Pol Pot. Monivong died on 23 April 1941 at the age of 65 at Bokor Mountain which was renamed Preah Monivong National Park in his honour. Reign In 1927, Sisowath Monivong's father died, so at age 52 Sisowath Monivong ascended to the throne. Like his father and his uncle, Monivong was simply a figurehead for the French administration and, in the words of one author, Monivong \\"caused the French no trouble\\". The real power was in the hands of the French Resident General. The King was surrounded by his Royal Council composed of his cousins: Sisowath Rathary (father of Sisowath Sirik Matak), Sisowath Watchayavong, Norodom Phanouvong, Norodom Suramarit and Norodom Singhara. It was during Monivong's rule that Cambodia became open to outside communist influences. In 1930, the Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh founded the Indochina Communist Party which subsequently obtained popularity in Cambodia. The Cambodian communists' primary objective was to overthrow the French. In 1940, when France fell to Nazi Germany, the \\"Vichy France\\" regime took power in the unoccupied parts of France in its overseas colonies, including Cambodia. In the late 1930s, a powerless Monivong noticed that Japan was making inroads in Vietnam. Japan then invaded and occupied Cambodia in early 1941. The Japanese allowed Cambodian Vichy French officials to administer, but only under Japanese protection. The Cambodian king was beholden to the Vichy French, who were in turn beholden to the Japanese. In western Cambodia, Thailand, now an ally of the Japanese, occupied territory. As the Japanese and Thai oppression of Cambodians became evident, Sisowath Monivong retired to Kampot in late 1941 and died at Bokor the same year. He died taking the posthumous title of Preah Karuna Preah Sisowath Monivong Preah Khatiyakot His son Sisowath Monireth was the heir to the throne, but the French authorities chose Sisowath Kosamak's nineteen-year-old son Norodom Sihanouk to succeed him instead, mistakenly believing that he would be more pliable than Monireth. Two of his children, Sisowath Monireth and Sisowath Monipong, would go on to serve as prime minister.

Its status grew with its inclusion in the \\"counter magnets\\" list of the National Capital Region (NCR), a list also including Hissar, Patiala, Kota and Gwalior. History Ahichchhatra (or Ahi-Kshetra) was the ancient capital of Northern Panchala. The remains of this city have been discovered in Bareilly According to the epic MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, the Bareilly region (Panchala) is said to be the birthplace of Draupadi, who was also referred to as 'Panchali' (one from the kingdom of PanchƒÅla) by K·πõ·π£·πáƒÅ (Lord Krishna). When Yudhishthira becomes the king of Hastinapur at the end of the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, Draupadi becomes his queen. The folklore says that Gautama Buddha had once visited the ancient fortress city of Ahichchhatra in Bareilly. The Jain Tirthankara Parshva is said to have attained Kaivalya at Ahichchhatra. In a Historic book (Sikar Ka Itihaas) written by Pt. Jhabarmall Sharma It is believed that the descendants of Lord Shriram's son Kusha went from Ayodhya to Rohtas, Narwar, Gwalior and Bareilly respectively their capital. In the 21st generation, Maharaja Nala, Soddevji made Gopachal (Gwalior) the capital. The time of going to Gwalior to Bareilly looks like Vikrama 933. In the 12th century, the kingdom was under the rule by different clans of Kshatriya Rajputs. Then the region became part of the Muslim Turkic Delhi Sultanate for 325 years before getting absorbed in the emerging Mughal Empire. The foundation of the modern City of Bareilly foundation was laid by Mughal governor Mukrand Rai in 1657 during the rule of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Later the region became the capital of Rohilkhand region before getting handed over to Nawab Vazir of Awadh and then to East India Company (transferred to the British India) and later becoming an integral part of India. The region has, also, acted as a mint for a major part of its history. From archaeological point of view the district of Bareilly is very rich. The extensive remains of Ahichchhatra, the Capital town of Northern Panchala have been discovered near Ramnagar village of Aonla Tehsil in the district. It was during the first excavations at Ahichchhatra (1940‚Äì44) that the painted grey ware, associated with the advent of the Aryans in the Ganges‚ÄìYamuna Valley, was recognised for the first time in the earliest levels of the site. Nearly five thousand coins belonging to periods earlier than that of Guptas have been yielded from Ahichchhatra. It has also been one of the richest sites in India from the point of view of the total yield of terracotta. Some of the masterpieces of Indian terracotta art are from Ahichchhatra. In fact the classification made of the terracotta human figurines from Ahichchhatra on grounds of style and to some extent stratigraphy became a model for determining the stratigraphy of subsequent excavations at other sites in the Ganges Valley. On the basis of the existing material, the archaeology of the region helps us to get an idea of the cultural sequence from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC up to the 11th century AD. Some ancient mounds in the district have also been discovered by the Deptt. of Ancient History and culture, Rohilkhand University, at Tihar- Khera (Fatehganj West), Pachaumi, Rahtuia, Kadarganj and Sainthal. Apart from this, artefacts of painted grey ware culture of the Iron Age have also been discovered near the city. =Establishment = Bareilly was founded in 1537 by Jagat Singh Katehriya, a Rajput who named it Bareilly after his two sons Bansaldev and Baraldev. The city was mentioned by the historian Budayuni, who wrote that Husain Quli Khan was appointed the governor of \\"Bareilly and Sambhal\\" in 1568. The divisions and revenue of the district \\"being fixed by Todar Mal\\" were recorded by Abul Fazl in 1596. The foundation of the modern city of Bareilly was laid by Mughal governor Mukrand Rai in 1657. In 1658, Bareilly became the headquarters of the province of Budaun. The Mughals encouraged the settlements of loyal Afghans (Pathans) in the Bareilly region to control the rebellious Katehriya Rajputs. After the death of Emperor Aurangzeb, the Afghans began to settle in the villages and assimilated with the local Muslims. These descendants of the these assimilated Afghans are known as Pathans. Regions of Uttar Pradesh, including Rohilkhand (capital Bareilly) After the fall of the Mughal Empire, created anarchy and many Pathans migrated from the Rohilkhand region. Bareilly (like other cities in Uttar Pradesh) experienced economic stagnation and poverty due to the breakdown of trade and security, leading to the migration of Rohilla Muslim Pathans to Suriname and Guyana as indentured labour. =British East India Company= Under Barech at the 1761 Third Battle of Panipat, Rohilkhand blocked the expansion of the Maratha Empire into northern India. In 1772 it was invaded by the Marathas, repulsing the invasion with the aid of the Nawab of Awadh. After the war, Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula demanded payment for the nawabs' help from Barech. When his demand was refused, the nawab joined the British (under Governor Warren Hastings and his Commander-in-Chief, Alexander Champion) to invade Rohilkhand. The combined forces of Daula and the Company defeated Barech (who was killed in battle at Miranpur Katra, ending Rohilla rule) in 1774. Rohilkhand was handed over to Daula, and from 1774 to 1800 the province was ruled by the Nawab of Awadh. By 1801, subsidies due under the treaties to support a British force had fallen into arrears. To pay the debt, Nawab Saadat Ali Khan surrendered Rohilkhand to the East India Company in a treaty signed on 10 November 1801. During the reign of Shah Alam II, Bareilly was the headquarters of Rohilla Sardar Hafiz Rehmat Khan and many coins were minted. The city was later in the possession of Awadh Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah, and his coins had Bareilly, Bareilly Aasfabad and the Bareilly kite and fish as identification marks. Coins were then minted by the East India Company. =Modern period= A 1912 map of northern India, showing the principal centres of the 1857‚Äì1859 rebellion: Meerut, Delhi, Bareilly, (Kanpur), Lucknow, Jhansi and Gwalior After the Rohilla War, the change in the power structure increased discontent throughout the district. Increased taxation from 1812 to 1814 increased resentment of the British: \\"Business stood still, shops were shut and multitudes assembled near the courthouse to petition for the abolition of the tax.\\" The Magistrate Dembleton, already unpopular, ordered the assessment to be made by a Kotwal. A skirmish between rebels and the sepoys (under Captain Cunningham) cost 300‚Äì400 lives. In 1818, Robert Glyn was posted as Acting Judge and Magistrate of Bareilly and the Joint Magistrate of Bulundshahr. Robert Glyn asked Ghulam Yahya to write an account of \\"craftsmen, the names of tools of manufacture and production and their dress and manners\\". The most popular trades in and around Bareilly during the 1820s were manufacturing glass, jewellery, glass and lac bangles and gold and silver thread, crimping, bean drying, wire drawing, charpoy weaving, keeping a grocer's shop and selling kebabs. Rebellion of 1857  Bareilly was a centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The rebellion began as a mutiny of native soldiers (sepoys), employed by the British East India Company's army, against race- and religion-based injustices and inequities on 10 May 1857 in Meerut. It expanded into other mutinies and civilian rebellions, primarily in the major north-central Indian river valleys; local episodes extended northwest to Peshawar (on the northwest frontier with Afghanistan) and southeast (beyond Delhi). There were riots in many parts of Uttar Pradesh, and Muslims in Bareilly, Bijnor and Moradabad called for the revival of a Muslim kingdom.R. C. Majumdar: Sepoy Mutiny and Revolt of 1857, Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1963, pp. 2303‚Äì31 Bareilly was made part of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. The Rohillas actively opposed the British, but were disarmed. Khan Bahadur Khan Rohilla, grandson of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, formed his own government in Bareilly in 1857 and a widespread popular revolt in Awadh, Bundelkhand and Rohilkhand took place. In 1857, Khan Bhadur Khan issued silver coins from Bareilly as an independent ruler. When the rebellion failed, Bareilly was subjugated. Khan Bahadur Khan was sentenced to death, and hanged in the police station on 24 February 1860. =Independence = Bareilly Central Jail housed a number of political prisoners during the British Raj, including Yashpal (who married while imprisoned on 7 August 1936 was the first such ceremony in an Indian jail).

It is also known as mycose or tremalose. Some bacteria, fungi, plants and invertebrate animals synthesize it as a source of energy, and to survive freezing and lack of water. Extracting trehalose was once a difficult and costly process, but around 2000, the Hayashibara company (Okayama, Japan) discovered an inexpensive extraction technology from starch. Trehalose has high water retention capabilities, and is used in food, cosmetics and as a drug. A procedure developed in 2017 and using trehalose allows sperm storage at room temperatures.  Structure  Trehalose is a disaccharide formed by a bond between two Œ±-glucose units. Two other isomers are not found in nature. It is found in nature as a disaccharide and also as a monomer in some polymers. Synthesis At least three biological pathways support trehalose biosynthesis. An industrial process can derive trehalose from corn starch.  Properties  = Chemical = Trehalose is a nonreducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1‚Äì1 alpha bond, giving it the name The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore is stable in solution at high temperatures, even under acidic conditions. The bonding keeps nonreducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation). Trehalose is less soluble than sucrose, except at high temperatures (>80 ¬∞C). Trehalose forms a rhomboid crystal as the dihydrate, and has 90% of the calorific content of sucrose in that form. Anhydrous forms of trehalose readily regain moisture to form the dihydrate. Anhydrous forms of trehalose can show interesting physical properties when heat-treated. Trehalose aqueous solutions show a concentration-dependent clustering tendency. Owing to their ability to form hydrogen bonds, they self-associate in water to form clusters of various sizes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that concentration of 1.5‚Äì2.2 molar, allow trehalose molecular clusters to percolate and form large, continuous aggregates. Trehalose directly interacts with nucleic acids, facilitates melting of double stranded DNA and stabilizes single-stranded nucleic acids. = Biological = Organisms ranging from bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, invertebrates, and lower and higher plants have enzymes that can make trehalose. In nature, trehalose can be found in plants, and microorganisms. In animals, trehalose is prevalent in shrimp, and also in insects, including grasshoppers, locusts, butterflies, and bees, in which trehalose serves as blood-sugar. Trehalose is then broken down into glucose by the catabolic enzyme trehalase for use. Trehalose is the major carbohydrate energy storage molecule used by insects for flight. One possible reason for this is that the glycosidic linkage of trehalose, when acted upon by an insect trehalase, releases two molecules of glucose, which is required for the rapid energy requirements of flight. This is double the efficiency of glucose release from the storage polymer starch, for which cleavage of one glycosidic linkage releases only one glucose molecule. In plants, trehalose is seen in sunflower seeds, moonwort, Selaginella plants, and sea algae. Within the fungi, it is prevalent in some mushrooms, such as shiitake (Lentinula edodes), oyster, king oyster, and golden needle. Even within the plant kingdom, Selaginella (sometimes called the resurrection plant), which grows in desert and mountainous areas, may be cracked and dried out, but will turn green again and revive after rain because of the function of trehalose. The two prevalent theories as to how trehalose works within the organism in the state of cryptobiosis are the vitrification theory, a state that prevents ice formation, or the water displacement theory, whereby water is replaced by trehalose.  Nutritional and dietary properties  Trehalose is rapidly broken down into glucose by the enzyme trehalase, which is present in the brush border of the intestinal mucosa of omnivores (including humans) and herbivores. It causes less of a spike in blood sugar than glucose. Trehalose has about 45% the sweetness of sucrose at concentrations above 22%, but when the concentration is reduced, its sweetness decreases more quickly than that of sucrose, so that a 2.3% solution tastes 6.5 times less sweet as the equivalent sugar solution. It is commonly used in prepared frozen foods, like ice cream, because it lowers the freezing point of foods. The Cargill corporation promotes the use of its brand of trehalose, \\"Treha,\\" as a substance that \\"enhances and intensifies certain flavors to bring out the best in your products.\\" Deficiency of trehalase enzyme is unusual in humans, except in the Greenlandic Inuit, where it occurs in 10‚Äì15% of the population.  Medical use  Trehalose is an ingredient, along with hyaluronic acid, in an artificial tears product used to treat dry eye. Outbreaks of Clostridium difficile were initially associated with trehalose, although this finding was disputed in 2019. History In 1832, H.A.L. Wiggers discovered trehalose in an ergot of rye, and in 1859 Marcellin Berthelot isolated it from Trehala manna, a substance made by weevils and named it trehalose. Trehalose has long been known as an autophagy inducer that acts independently of mTOR. In 2017 research was published showing that trehalose induces autophagy by activating TFEB, a protein that acts as a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway.

Background Animosity towards African students began in the 1960s, when scholarships provided by the Chinese government allowed many students from China-friendly African countries to study in Beijing. This policy was originally based on the idea of third world solidarity and Mao Zedong's linking of the fight against American and Soviet imperialism with Marxist class war. Many of these African students were given larger educational grants than native Chinese students, and hostility towards the Africans was a regular occurrence. Most of these students returned to their home countries before reaching the end of their courses due to poor living conditions and the political uncertainties of the Mao era. From the mid-1970s, China allowed African students to study outside of Beijing. As well as resentment about the larger stipends given to African students, hostility from Chinese students towards Africans also flared up when there was contact between African men and Chinese women. In an incident in Shanghai in 1979, African students were attacked after playing loud music and making sexual remarks to Chinese women. These clashes became more common during the 1980s and sometimes led to arrests and deportations of African students. Cultural differences in dating habits added to the tensions. Nanjing protests On December 24, 1988 two male African students were entering their campus at Hohai University in Nanjing with two Chinese women. The occasion was a Christmas Eve party. A quarrel between one of the Africans and a Chinese security guard, who had suspected that the women the African students tried to bring into the campus were prostitutes and refused their entry, led to a brawl between the African and Chinese students on the campus which lasted till the morning, leaving 13 students injured. 300 Chinese students, spurred by false rumors that a Chinese man had been killed by the Africans, broke into and set about destroying the Africans' dormitories, shouting slogans. Part of the destruction involved setting fire to the Africans' dormitory and locking them in. The President of the University had to order the fire department to take action. After the police had dispersed the Chinese students, many Africans fled to the railway station in order to gain safety at various African embassies in Beijing. The authorities prevented the Africans from boarding the trains so as to question those involved in the brawl. Soon their numbers increased to 140, as other African and non-African foreign students, fearing violence or simply by sympathy, arrived at the first-class waiting room at the station asking to be allowed to go to Beijing. By this time, Chinese students from HoHai University had joined up with students from other Nanjing universities to make up a 3000-strong demonstration that called on government officials to prosecute the African students and reform the system which gave foreigners more rights than the Chinese. On the evening of December 26, the marchers converged on the railway station while holding banners calling for human rights and political reform. Chinese police managed to isolate the non- Chinese students from the marchers and moved them by force to a military guest house in Yizheng outside Nanjing. The protests were declared illegal, and riot police were brought in from surrounding provinces to pacify the demonstrators, which took several more days. The African students and their sympathisers were removed from Yizheng to another military guesthouse closer to Nanjing on New Year's Eve, and were returned to their universities the following day. Aftermath In January, three of the African students were deported for starting the brawl. The other students returned to Hohai University and were required to follow new regulations, including a night-time curfew, having to report to university authorities before leaving the campus, and having no more than one Chinese girlfriend whose visits would be limited to the lounge area. Guests were still required to be registered. Anti-African demonstrations spread to other cities, including Shanghai and Beijing. Tiananmen Square protests The Nanjing protests were groundbreaking dissidence for China and went from solely expressing concern about alleged improprieties by African men to increasingly calling for democracy or human rights.Construction of Racial Identities in China by Frank Dik√∂tter 1997 p86 They were paralleled by burgeoning demonstrations in other cities during the period between the Nanjing and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, with some elements of the original protests that started in Nanjing still evident in Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, such as banners proclaiming \\"Stop Taking Advantage of Chinese Women\\" even though the vast majority of African students had left the country by that point.Huff Post, 07/13/2009 The Stain on China‚Äôs Pro-Democracy Movement: A Final Word About Tiananmen By Phillip MartinThe road to Tienanmen Square, p105  See also  * Africans in Guangzhou * Controversy over study buddy of international students in China References Further reading *China as a Third World State: Foreign Policy and Official National Identity, Van Ness, Peter, Cornell University Press, 1993 *Collective Identity, Symbolic Mobilization, and Student Protest in Nanjing, China, 1988-1989, Crane, George T *The Discourse of Race in Modern China, Dik√∂tter, Frank, Stanford University Press, 1992 *Racial Identities in China: Context and Meaning, Dik√∂tter, Frank, 1994 *An African Student in China, Hevi, Emmanuel, Pall Mall, 1963 *Anti-Black Racism in Post-Mao China, Sautman, Barry, 1994 *Racial Nationalism or National Racism?, Sullivan, Michael J, 1994 1988 in China 1988 riots 1988 protests 1989 in China 1989 riots Anti-black racism in Asia Anti-immigration politics in China Anti-national sentiment History of Nanjing Race riots Racism in China Riots and civil disorder in China Student protests in China 1989 Tiananmen Square protests Africa‚ÄìChina relations December 1988 events in Asia January 1989 events in Asia ","title":"Nanjing anti-African protests"},{"id":"1001868","title":"North of 60"},{"id":"1001880","text":"Octavia Hill by John Singer Sargent, 1898 Octavia Hill (3 December 1838 ‚Äì 13 August 1912) was an English social reformer, whose main concern was the welfare of the inhabitants of cities, especially London, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Born into a family with a strong commitment to alleviating poverty, she herself grew up in straitened circumstances owing to the financial failure of her father's businesses. With no formal schooling, she worked from the age of 14 for the welfare of working people. Hill was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with John Ruskin enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal. Another of Hill's concerns was the availability of open spaces for poor people. She campaigned against development on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save London's Hampstead Heath and Parliament Hill Fields from being built on. She was one of the three founders of the National Trust, set up to preserve places of historic interest or natural beauty for the enjoyment of the British public. She was a founder member of the Charity Organisation Society (now the charity Family Action) which organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work. She was a member of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws in 1905. Hill's legacy includes the large holdings of the modern National Trust, several housing projects still run on her lines, a tradition of training for housing managers, and the Octavia Hill Birthplace House established by the Octavia Hill Society at her birthplace in Wisbech. Biography =Early years= Octavia Hill was born in Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, the daughter of James Hill, a corn merchant, former banker and follower of Robert Owen, and his third wife, Caroline Southwood Smith. He had been widowed twice, and had six children (five daughters and a son) from his previous marriages; Octavia was her father's eighth daughter and ninth child.Smith, Mark K., \\"Octavia Hill: Housing, Space and Social Reform\\", The Encyclopaedia of Informal Education, 2008, accessed 14 November 2010. He had been impressed by the writings on education of his future wife, the daughter of Dr Thomas Southwood Smith, a pioneer of sanitary reform.Darley, Gillian, \\"Hill, Octavia (1838‚Äì1912)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010 He had engaged Caroline as a governess to his children in 1832, and they were married in 1835. The family's comfortably prosperous life was disrupted by James Hill's financial problems and his mental collapse. In 1840 he was declared bankrupt. Caroline Hill's father gave the family financial support, and took on some of Hill's paternal role. Southwood Smith was a health and welfare reformer concerned with a range of social issues including child labour in mines and the housing of the urban poor. Caroline Hill held similar views on social reform, and her interest in progressive education, influenced by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, and Southwood Smith's daily experience in his work at the London Hospital in the East End inspired Octavia Hill's concern for the poorest in early Victorian London. She received no formal schooling: her mother educated the family at home. Early influences on Octavia Hill ‚Äì top: John Ruskin and Thomas Southwood Smith; below: F.D. Maurice and Henry Mayhew The family settled in a small cottage in Finchley, now a north London suburb, but then a village. Octavia Hill was impressed and moved by Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor, a book that portrayed the daily lives of slum dwellers. She was also strongly influenced by the theologian, Anglican priest and social reformer F. D. Maurice, who was a family friend. She began her work on behalf of London's poor by helping to make toys for Ragged school children, and serving as secretary of the women's classes at the Working Men's College in Bloomsbury in central London.Wohl, A. S., \\"Octavia Hill and the Homes of the London Poor\\", The Journal of British Studies, University of Chicago Press, Vol. 10, No. 2 (May 1971), pp. 105‚Äì31 A co-operative guild providing employment for \\"distressed gentlewomen\\" accepted Hill for training in glass-painting when she was 13. When the work of the guild was expanded to provide work in toy-making for Ragged school children, she was invited, at the age of 14, to take charge of the workroom.Mann, Peter H., \\"Octavia Hill: An Appraisal\\", The Town Planning Review, Vol. 23, No. 3 (October 1952), pp. 223‚Äì37 The following year she began working in her spare time from the guild as a copyist for John Ruskin in Dulwich Art Gallery and the National Gallery. She was deeply aware of the dreadful living conditions of the children in her charge at the guild. Her views on encouraging self-reliance led to her association with the Charity Organisation Society (COS), described by Hill's biographer Gillian Darley as \\"a contentious body which deplored dependence fostered by kindly but unrigorous philanthropy ‚Ä¶ support to the poor had to be carefully targeted and efficiently supervised. Later in life, however, she began to think the COS line ‚Ä¶ was over-harsh.\\" Hill was short, like all her family, and indifferent to fashion. Her friend Henrietta Barnett wrote: \\"She was small in stature with a long body and short legs. She did not dress, she only wore clothes, which were often unnecessarily unbecoming; she had soft and abundant hair and regular features, but the beauty of her face lay in brown and very luminous eyes, which quite unconsciously she lifted upwards as she spoke on any matter for which she cared. Her mouth was large and mobile, but not improved by laughter. Indeed, Miss Octavia was nicest when she was made passionate by her earnestness.\\" Barnett also spoke of Hill's streak of ruthlessness. Gertrude Bell called Hill despotic. Later in Hill's life, the Bishop of London, Frederick Temple, encountered her at a meeting of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and wrote, \\"She spoke for half an hour ‚Ä¶ I never had such a beating in all my life.\\"Leak, Adrian, \\"For houses and green space\\" The Church Times, 10 August 2010, accessed 14 November 2010 =Housing for the poor= A Marylebone slum in the nineteenth century Parliament and many concerned reformers had been attempting to improve the housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been in existence for twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban well-being, and the first of many tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed. From Hill's point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. She found that their landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that the tenants were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves. She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself. John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her. As an aesthete and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of the slums.Wyatt, pp. 1‚Äì2 In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for ¬£750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, Marylebone. Ruskin placed these houses, which were \\"in a dreadful state of dirt and neglect\\", under Hill's management. He told her that investors might be attracted to such schemes if a five percent annual return could be secured. In 1866 Ruskin acquired the freehold of five more houses for Hill to manage in Freshwater Place, Marylebone.Wyatt, p. 2 The Times recorded, \\"The houses faced a bit of desolate ground occupied by dilapidated cowsheds and manure heaps. The needful repairs and cleaning were carried out, the waste land was turned into a playground where Mr. Ruskin had some trees planted.\\"The Times obituary, 15 August 1912, p. 7 After being improved the properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. A return of five per cent on capital was obtained as promised to Ruskin; any excess over the five per cent was reinvested within the properties for the benefit of the tenants. Rent arrears were not tolerated, and bad debts were minimal. As Hill said, \\"Extreme punctuality, and diligence in collecting rents, and a strict determination that they shall be paid regularly, have accomplished this.\\" In consequence of her prudent management, Hill was able to attract new backers, and by 1874 she had 15 housing schemes with around 3,000 tenants. Hill's system was based on closely managing not only the buildings but the tenants; she insisted, \\"you cannot deal with the people and their houses separately.\\" She maintained close personal contact with all her tenants, and was strongly opposed to impersonal bureaucratic organisations and to governmental intervention in housing.Morrell, Caroline, \\"Octavia Hill\\", The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 52, No. 1 (February 1999), p. 158 In her view, \\"municipal socialism and subsidized housing\\" led to indiscriminate demolition, re-housing schemes, and the destruction of communities. =Housing management= At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants (who included Emma Cons and Eva McLaren) combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers. At first Hill believed, \\"Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers.\\" Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce. Her system required a large staff. Rent was collected on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Rent accounts were balanced in the afternoons and arrangements were made with contractors for repairs. On Thursdays and Fridays arrears were pursued, contractors' invoices paid, new tenancy lettings and tenants' moves organised. If any of Hill's assistants had spare time, whether during normal working hours or in frequent voluntary after-hours working, it was used to promote tenants' associations and after- work and children's after-school clubs and societies.Wyatt, p. 3 In 1859, Hill created the Southwark detachment of the Army Cadet Force, its first independent unit, which gave training along military lines for local boys. Hill considered that such an organisation would be more like the \\"real thing\\" than such existing outfits as the Church Lads' Brigade and therefore more attractive to young men \\"who had passed the age of make-believe\\". She invited a serving officer of the Derbyshire Regiment to set up the company, and such was its popularity that its numbers had to be capped at 160 cadets. Hill's principles were summed up in an article of 1869: \\"Where a man persistently refuses to exert himself, external help is worse than useless.\\" She was an outspoken critic of the principles of \\"outdoor relief\\" or the Speenhamland system of poor relief as operated by various Poor Law Boards. Because these systems did not encourage recipients to work, she regarded them as \\"a profligate use of public funds.\\" Under her methods, personal responsibility was encouraged. She insisted on dealing with arrears promptly; she appointed reliable caretakers; she took up on references of prospective tenants, and visited them in their homes; she paid careful attention to allocations and the placing of tenants, with regard to size of families and the size and location of the accommodation to be offered; and she made no rules that could not be properly enforced. In 1884, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners recognised her enlightened approach and turned to her to manage and reform their slum properties in South London, which were notorious for poverty and petty crime. Hill turned these estates into model properties, which still paid a return on investment. An American admirer described her as \\"ruling over a little kingdom of three thousand loving subjects with an iron scepter twined with roses.\\"Bremner, Robert H. \\"'An Iron Scepter Twined with Roses': The Octavia Hill System of Housing Management\\", The Social Service Review, Vol. 39, No. 2 (June 1965), The University of Chicago Press, pp. 222‚Äì31 Although Hill drove her associates hard, she drove herself harder. In 1877, she collapsed and had to take a break of several months from her work. Darley ascribes a number of contributory causes: \\"chronic overwork, a lack of delegation, the death of her close friend Jane Senior, the failure of a brief engagement\\", as well as an attack on her by John Ruskin. The Hill family found a companion for her, Harriot Yorke (1843‚Äì1930). Yorke took on a great amount of the everyday work that had contributed to Hill's collapse. She remained her companion until Hill's death. A further palliative was the building of a cottage, at Crockham Hill near Sevenoaks in Kent, where they could take breaks from their work in London. =Open spaces= Wicken Fen acquired by the National Trust in 1899 Hampstead Heath ‚Äì saved by Octavia Hill and others Among Hill's concerns was that her tenants, and all urban workers, should have access to open spaces. She believed in \\"the life-enhancing virtues of pure earth, clean air and blue sky.\\"\\"Conservation\\" The Octavia Hill Society, accessed 14 November 2010 In 1883 she wrote: She campaigned hard against building on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save Hampstead Heath and Parliament Hill Fields from development. She was the first to use the term \\"Green Belt\\" for the protected rural areas surrounding London. Three hills in Kent (Mariners Hill, Toys Hill and Ide Hill) which she helped to protect from development form part of the belt.\\"Who Was Octavia Hill?\\" The Octavia Hill Society, accessed 15 November 2010 In 1876 Hill became the treasurer of the Kyrle Society, founded in that year by her eldest sister, Miranda, as a \\"Society for the Diffusion of Beauty\\". Under the slogan \\"Bring Beauty Home to the Poor\\" it aimed to bring art, books, music and open spaces into the lives of the urban poor.Hill, Octavia, \\"Oratorios for the People\\", The Musical Times, December 1884, p. 717 For a short period it flourished and expanded, and although it declined after a few years, it was a template for the National Trust, 20 years later. Before that, however, Hill was engaged in a campaign in 1883 to stop the construction of railways from the quarries in the fells overlooking Buttermere, in the English Lake District, with damaging effect on the unspoilt scenery. The campaign was led by Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, who secured the support of Ruskin, Hill, and Sir Robert Hunter, solicitor to the Commons Preservation Society.Murphy, Graham. \\"Rawnsley, Hardwicke Drummond (1851‚Äì1920)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 15 November 2010 From 1875 onwards, Hunter had been Hill's legal adviser on the protection of open spaces in London. Both he and Rawnsley, building on an idea put forward by Ruskin, conceived of a trust that could buy and preserve places of natural beauty and historic interest for the nation.Chubb L.W., rev. Graham Murphy, \\"Hunter, Sir Robert (1844‚Äì1913)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 16 November 2010 On 16 November 1893, Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley met in the offices of the Commons Preservation Society and agreed to launch such a trust. Hill suggested that it should be called \\"The Commons and Gardens Trust\\", but the three agreed to adopt Hunter's suggested title, the \\"National Trust\\". Under its full formal title, the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty was inaugurated the following year. The trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and endangered buildings of historic interest; its first property was Alfriston Clergy House and its first nature reserve was Wicken Fen.\\"Timeline\\" , The National Trust, accessed 16 November 2010 =Later years= The number of homes managed by Hill continued to grow. Although Ruskin had turned against her in a bout of mental instability, she found a new supporter, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who handed over to her the management of their housing estates in several poor areas of south London. By the end of the nineteenth century, Hill's women workers were no longer unpaid volunteers but trained professionals. Hill's influence spread beyond the properties under her own control. Her ideas were taken up and copied, with her enthusiastic support, in continental Europe and the United States of America. Beatrice Webb said that she \\"first became aware of the meaning of the poverty of the poor,\\" while staying with her sister, who was a rent collector for Octavia Hill in the East End. Queen Victoria's daughter, Princess Alice of Hesse-Darmstadt, was taken incognito on a tour of some of Hill's properties, and she translated Hill's Homes of the London Poor into German. (free access) Among those whom Hill trained was her assistant and secretary, Maud Jeffery, who was later engaged by the Commissioners of Crown Lands to run new housing estates in London on Octavia Hill's lines.\\"The Housing Business Group\\", Housing News, Autumn 2004, The Crown Estate, 2004. Even some local authorities, despite Hill's distrust, followed her model: some of the earliest examples of municipal council housing, at Kensington and Camberwell, were run on her lines, with the acquisition of working-class houses, and their gradual improvement, without evictions or demolitions. Hill in 1881 Despite her opposition to interference by national or local government in the provision of housing, Hill had to cope with the newly created London County Council and the involvement of the council and other local authorities in providing housing for the poor. In 1884 a Royal commission on the housing of the working classes was set up, but the prime minister, W.E. Gladstone, and his ministerial colleagues vetoed a proposal to include Hill among the members of the commission. The municipal authorities quickly surpassed her in the number of properties under their management. A.S. Wohl notes that in the 1880s Hill had about ¬£70,000 worth of property under her management, and at the end of her career she was managing the dwellings of \\"perhaps three or four thousand people at the most.\\" The London County Council, by contrast, had a budget of ¬£1,500,000 for its programme of rehousing London's poor in 1901‚Äì02.Hill, Octavia, \\"Housing of the Poor\\", The Times, 4 March 1901, p. 11 Hill was opposed to other reforms that came about in the early part of the twentieth century. She was against female suffrage on the grounds that \\"men and women help one another because they are different, have different gifts and different spheres.\\"The Times, 15 July 1910, p. 9 She also believed that provision of social services and old-age pensions by the government did more harm than good, sapping people's self-reliance. Hill died from cancer on 13 August 1912 at her home in Marylebone, at the age of 73. Legacy and memorials Plaque at Redcross Way in South London When John Singer Sargent's portrait of her was presented by her fellow-workers in 1898, Hill made a speech in which she said, \\"When I am gone, I hope my friends will not try to carry out any special system, or to follow blindly in the track which I have trodden. New circumstances require various efforts, and it is the spirit, not the dead form, that should be perpetuated. ... We shall leave them a few houses, purified and improved, a few new and better ones built, a certain amount of thoughtful and loving management, a few open spaces...\\" But, she said, more important would be \\"the quick eye to see, the true soul to measure, the large hope to grasp the mighty issues of the new and better days to come ‚Äì greater ideals, greater hope, and patience to realize both.\\"Cockerell, Sir Sydney, \\"Octavia Hill\\", The Times, 28 February 1935, p. 13 The Horace Street Trust, founded by Hill, became a model for many subsequent housing associations and developed into the present trust that bears her name, Octavia Housing. Today it owns several of the homes, including Gable Cottages, designed by Elijah Hoole, who worked with Hill for many years. \\"Legacy\\" , Octavia Hill Society, accessed 14 November 2010 Hill's determination to provide community space can still be seen in the shape of the Red Cross site in Southwark (1888), among others. The Octavia Hill Society website states that with a community hall, and soundly maintained attractive houses, Hill here anticipated the fundamental ingredients of town planning by some 15 years. The Settlement Movement (creating integrated mixed communities of rich and poor) grew directly out of Hill's work. Her colleagues Samuel and Henrietta Barnett, founded Toynbee Hall, the first university-sponsored settlement, which together with the Women's University Settlement (later called the Blackfriars Settlement) continues to serve local communities. Overseas, Hill's name is perpetuated in the Octavia Hill Association in Philadelphia, a small property company founded in 1896 to provide affordable housing to low and middle-income city residents. Women who had trained under Hill formed the Association of Women Housing Workers in 1916. This later changed its name to the Society of Housing Managers in 1948. After merging with the Institute of Housing Managers in 1965, the society became the present day Chartered Institute of Housing in 1994. The CIH is a professional body for those working in the housing profession in the UK and overseas.\\"History\\" , Chartered Institute of Housing, accessed 15 November 2010 The training that Hill gave to Charity Organisation Society volunteers contributed to the development of modern social work, and COS continued to be instrumental in developing social work as a profession during the twentieth century. COS is still in operation today as the charity Family Action.\\"1880s\\" , Family Action, accessed 15 November 2010 In 1907, Parliament passed the first National Trust Act, enshrining the trust's permanent purpose and giving it powers to protect property for the benefit of the nation. The trust now looks after a wide range of coast, countryside and historic buildings. According to the trust's website, \\"Staff, volunteers and tenants are engaged daily in providing access to open spaces for people's enjoyment, providing habitats for wildlife and in improving our environment ‚Äì 'for ever, for everyone'.\\"\\"For ever for everyone\\" , The National Trust, accessed 16 November 2010 A single grave marker for Miranda Hill, Octavia Hill and Harriet Yorke was placed in Holy Trinity churchyard, Crockham Hill, Kent. Commemorations of Octavia Hill include a monument to her at a Surrey beauty spot, on the summit of a hill called Hydon Ball (now owned by the National Trust). Shortly after her death, the family erected a stone seat there, from which walkers can enjoy views over the Surrey countryside. The Octavia Hill Society was set up in 1992 \\"to promote awareness of the ideas and ideals of Octavia Hill, her family, fellow workers and their relevance in today's society nationally and internationally\\".\\"Octavia Hill Society\\" , The Octavia Hill Society, accessed 16 November 2010 Under the society's auspices her birthplace at Wisbech has been turned into the Octavia Hill Birthplace Museum.\\"Octavia Hill\\", The Wisbech Society and Preservation Trust.

Simon and M. Lincoln Schuster. As of 2016, Simon & Schuster was the third largest publisher in the United States, publishing 2,000 titles annually under 35 different imprints. History Middle 20th century HQ, Broadway =Early years= In 1924, Richard Simon's aunt, a crossword puzzle enthusiast, asked whether there was a book of New York World crossword puzzles, which were very popular at the time. After discovering that none had been published, Simon and Max Schuster decided to launch a company to exploit the opportunity.Frederick Lewis Allen, Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s, p. 165. . At the time, Simon was a piano salesman and Schuster was editor of an automotive trade magazine. They pooled , equivalent to $ today, to start a company that published crossword puzzles. The new publishing house used \\"fad\\" publishing to publish books that exploited current fads and trends. Simon called this \\"planned publishing\\". Instead of signing authors with a planned manuscript, they came up with their own ideas, and then hired writers to carry them out. In the 1930s, the publisher moved to what has been referred to as \\"Publisher's Row\\" on Park Avenue in Manhattan, New York. =Expansion= In 1939, Simon & Schuster financially backed Robert Fair de Graff to found Pocket Books, America's first paperback publisher. In 1942, Simon & Schuster and Western Printing launched the Little Golden Books series in cooperation with the Artists and Writers Guild.\\"Announcing Little Golden Books\\". Publishers Weekly. September 19, 1942, pp. 991‚Äì94. In 1944, Marshall Field III, owner of the Chicago Sun, purchased Simon & Schuster and Pocket Books. The company was sold back to Simon and Schuster following his death for $1 million. In the 1950s and 1960s, many publishers including Simon & Schuster turned toward educational publishing due to the baby boom market. Pocket Books focused on paperbacks for the educational market instead of textbooks and started the Washington Square Press imprint in 1959. By 1964 it had published over 200 titles and was expected to put out another 400 by the end of that year. Books published under the imprint included classic reprints such as Lorna Doone, Ivanhoe, Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, and Robinson Crusoe. In 1960, Richard Simon died of a heart attack; six years later, Max Schuster retired and sold his half of Simon & Schuster to Leon Shimkin. Shimkin then merged Simon & Schuster with Pocket Books under the name of Simon & Schuster. In 1968, editor-in-chief Robert Gottlieb, who worked at Simon & Schuster since 1955 and edited several bestsellers including Joseph Heller's Catch-22, left abruptly to work at competitor Knopf, taking other influential S&S; employees, Nina Bourne, and Tony Schulte. In 1979, Richard Snyder was named CEO of the company. Over the next several years he would help grow the company substantially. Simon & Schuster headquarters at 1230 Avenue of the Americas, Rockefeller Center, New York City =1980s= After the 1983 death of Charles Bluhdorn, head of Gulf+Western who acquired Simon & Schuster in 1976, the company made the decision to diversify. Bluhdorn's successor Martin Davis told The New York Times, \\"Society was undergoing dramatic changes so that there was a greater need for textbooks, maps, and educational information. We saw the opportunity to diversify into those areas, which are more stable and more profitable than trade publishing.\\" In 1984, Simon & Schuster with CEO Richard E. Snyder acquired educational publisher Esquire Corporation, owner of companies including Allyn & Bacon (and former owner of the magazine), for $180 million. Prentice Hall was brought into the company fold in 1985 for over $700 million and was viewed by some executives to be a catalyst for change for the company as a whole. This acquisition was followed by Silver Burdett in 1986, mapmaker Gousha in 1987 and Charles E. Simon in 1988. Part of the acquisition included educational publisher Allyn & Bacon which, according to then editor and chief Michael Korda, became the \\"nucleus of S&S;'s educational and informational business.\\" Three California educational companies were also purchased between 1988 and 1990‚ÄîQuercus, Fearon Education and Janus Book Publishers. In all, Simon & Schuster spent more than $1 billion in acquisitions between 1983 and 1991. In the 1980s, Snyder also made an unsuccessful bid toward video publishing which was believed to have led to the company's success in the audiobook business. Snyder was dismayed to realize that Simon & Schuster did not own the video rights to Jane Fonda's Workout Book, a huge bestseller at the time and that the video company producing the VHS was making more money on the video. This prompted Snyder to ask editors to obtain video rights for every new book. Agents were often reluctant to give these up‚Äîwhich meant the S&S; Video division never took off. According to Korda, the audio rights expanded into the audio division which by the 1990s would be a major business for Simon & Schuster. In 1989, Gulf and Western Inc., owner of Simon & Schuster, changed its name to Paramount Communications Inc. =1990s= In 1990, The New York Times described Simon & Schuster as the largest book publisher in the United States with sales of $1.3 billion the previous year. That same year, Simon & Schuster acquired the children's publisher Green Tiger Press. In 1993, Simon & Schuster bought Macmillan, and changed its name to Paramount. Viacom then bought Paramount in 1994 and changed the name back to Simon & Schuster. Macmillan was acquired for US $552.8 million. Later that year, Snyder, was suddenly fired from S&S; and was replaced by the company's president and chief operating officer Jonathan Newcomb. Simon & Schuster then sold several peripheral assets, such as selling Charles E. Simon Co. to CDB Infotek. Gousha was sold to Rand McNally in 1996. In 1998, Viacom sold Simon & Schuster's educational operations, including Prentice Hall and Macmillan, to Pearson PLC, the global publisher and then owner of Penguin and the Financial Times; Pearson then merged the operations with Addison-Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education. The professional and reference operations were sold to Hicks Muse Tate & Furst. =2000s= In 2002, Simon & Schuster acquired its Canadian distributor Distican. Simon & Schuster began publishing in Canada in 2013. At the end of 2005, Viacom split into two companies: CBS Corporation (which inherited S&S;), and the other retaining the Viacom name. Also in 2005, Simon & Schuster acquired Strebor Books International, which was founded in 1999 by author Kristina Laferne Roberts, who has written under the pseudonym \\"Zane.\\" A year later, in 2006, Simon & Schuster launched the conservative imprint Threshold Editions. In 2009, Simon & Schuster signed a multi-book and co-publishing deal with Glenn Beck which fell over many of their imprints and included adult non-fiction, fiction, children and YA literature as well as e-book and audiobook originals. As part of CBS, Simon & Schuster has been the primary publisher for books related to various media franchises owned by and/or aired on CBS such as CSI. The company has also held a license to publish books in the Star Trek franchise under Pocket Books. =2010s= In 2011, Simon & Schuster signed a number of co-publishing deals. Glenn Beck signed a new co-publishing deal with Simon & Schuster for his own imprint, Mercury Ink. Under Atria, Simon & Schuster also launched a publishing venture with Cash Money Records called Cash Money Content. In April 2012, the United States Department of Justice filed United States v. Apple Inc., naming Apple, Simon & Schuster, and four other major publishers as defendants. The suit alleged that they conspired to fix prices for e-books, and weaken Amazon.com's position in the market, in violation of antitrust law. Simon & Schuster reorganized all of their imprints under four main groups in 2012. The four groups included the Atria Publishing Group, the Scribner Publishing Group, the Simon & Schuster Publishing Group and the Gallery Publishing Group. According to CEO Carolyn Reidy, the divisions were created to align imprints that complement one another and that the structure would \\"lead to a sharper editorial focus for our imprints even as it takes consideration of the natural affinities among them.\\" In 2012, Simon & Schuster launched a self-publishing arm of the company, Archway Publishing. In November 2013, Simon & Schuster signed a co-publishing agreement with former New York Yankees shortstop, Derek Jeter, to launch Jeter Publishing. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which Simon & Schuster and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing. In 2014, Simon & Schuster signed a partnership deal with Amazon over ebooks and also launched a new speculative fiction imprint. In October 2014, Simon & Schuster signed a multi-year partnership deal with Amazon.com in negotiations concerning the price of e-books.Amazon signs multi-year deal with Simon & Schuster. Reuters, October 21, 2014 Simon & Schuster also launched a new science fiction imprint called Simon451 that would publish titles across science fiction and fantasy with an emphasis on ebooks and online communities. The name of the imprint was inspired by Ray Bradbury's book Fahrenheit 451 (the temperature at which books burn). Bradbury's classic is also published by Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster expanded beyond book publishing in 2015 by offering a new business model and additional services for authors. In 2015, Simon & Schuster announced the creation of a new publishing unit and imprint called North Star Way. The imprint would publish non-fiction titles such as self-improvement, inspirational and mind-body-spirit titles. In addition, the group would also serve as a platform and set of services for authors that go beyond what a traditional book publisher offers to find their audience. The services include helping authors expand their reach through online courses, seminars, workshops, mobile applications, video and audiobooks, sponsorships and business partnerships, and podcasts. North Star Way sits within the Gallery Publishing Group division. According to Michele Martin, publisher and founder, the name North Star reflects their mission, \\"to publish books that will help readers find the path to a better life, and to be a guide for our authors, not only through publication of their books but also in the many other activities that can help their message find the widest possible audience.\\" In an interview with Kirkus Reviews, Michele Martin expanded that North Star Way, \\"aims to meet consumers where they are, in whatever form of media they consume. We expand the ideas in the books into a variety of platforms.\\" The name prompted Marvel Comics to attempt to register the name of their superhero Northstar in February 2015. The application was denied as Simon & Schuster had already made a trademark application for North Star Way in January. Simon & Schuster launched SimonSays.com a portal for online video courses in 2016, along with Scout Press, a new literary fiction imprint under Gallery Books Group. They also launched North Star Way, a platform-based program to provide authors with services beyond publishing including brand management, online courses, sponsorship, and business partnerships. Also as of 2016, Simon & Schuster had more than 18k e-books available for sale and signed a deal to distribute Start Publishing LLC, a catalog of 7,000 e-book titles. In 2019, CBS and Viacom reunited to form ViacomCBS. As a result, Simon & Schuster became part of the newly formed ViacomCBS. =2020s= In March 2020, ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish announced the company's intention to sell the Simon & Schuster division, as it \\"does not have significant connection for our broader business.\\" Bakish expected a sale to close in 2020, though the COVID-19 pandemic may delay that process.https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/03/04/business/bc-us-viacomcbs- simon-schuster-possible-sale.html In September 2020, German media group Bertelsmann announced that they were interested in acquiring Simon & Schuster. According to Bertelsmann chief executive and chairman, \\"We've been the most active player on the consolidation of the book publishing market in the last 10 years. We combined Penguin and Random House very successfully to create by far the largest book publisher in the world, actually the only global book publisher. Given this position we would, of course, be interested in Simon & Schuster.\\" Notable people =Notable editors and publishers= *Clifton Fadiman, Jr., editor-in-chief *Jack Goodman, editor-in-chief *Jerome Weidman, editor-in-chief *Joe Barnes, editor-in-chief *Justin Kaplan *Max Schuster (editor-in-chief) *Michael Korda (editor-in-chief) *Quincy Howe (editor-in- chief) *Robert Gottlieb *Peter Schwed *Wallace Brockway (editor-in-chief) *William Cole =Notable authors= Simon & Schuster has published thousands of books from thousands of authors.

The position is typically crewed by a dual-licensed Pilot-Flight Engineer in the present day.Stringman, D.C. (Flt. Lt.).

Retrieved February 21, 2016 * Navigator (archaic), also called 'Air Navigators' or 'Flight Navigators'. A position on older aircraft, typically between the late-1910s and the 1970s, where separate crew members (sometimes two navigation crew members) were often responsible for the flight navigation, including its dead reckoning and celestial navigation, especially when flown over oceans or other featureless areas where radio navigation aids were not originally available. As sophisticated electronic air navigation aids and universal space-based GPS navigation systems came online, the dedicated Navigator's position was discontinued and its function was assumed by dual-licensed Pilot-Navigators, and still later by the aircraft's primary pilots (Captain and FO), resulting in a continued downsizing in the number of aircrew positions on commercial flights. Modern electronic navigation systems made the navigator redundant by the early 1980s.Grierson, Mike. Aviation History‚ÄîDemise of the Flight Navigator, FrancoFlyers.org website, October 14, 2008. Retrieved August 31, 2014. * Radio Operator (archaic). A position on much older aircraft, typically between the mid-1910s and the 1940s, where a separate crew member was often responsible for handling telegraphic and voice radio communications between the aircraft and ground stations. As radio sets became increasingly sophisticated and easier to operate, the function was taken over directly by a FO or SO, and still later by the pilot-in-command and co-pilot, making the radio operator's position redundant.Ennis, E.E. Wireless Telegraphy from an Aeroplane, Journal of Electricity, Power and Gas, April 1, 1911, pp. 279‚Äì280 = Cabin positions = Aircraft cabin crew members can consist of: * Purser or In-flight Service Manager or Cabin Services Director, is responsible for the cabin crew as a team leader. * Flight attendant or Cabin Crew, is the crew member responsible for the safety of passengers. Historically during the early era of commercial aviation, the position was staffed by young 'cabin boys' who assisted passengers. Cabin boys were replaced by female nurses, originally called 'stewardesses'. The medical background requirement for the flight attendant position was later dropped.Harris 2001, p. 4. * Flight medic, is a specialized paramedic employed on air ambulance aircraft or flights. * Loadmaster, is a crew member on a cargo aircraft responsible for loading freight and personnel, and for calculating the aircraft's weight and balance prior to flight, which must be within the aircraft manufacturer's prescribed limits, for safe flight. On non-cargo aircraft, weight and balance tasks are performed by the flight crew.  Military  C-17s From the start of military aviation, additional crew members have flown on military aircraft. Over time these duties have expanded: * Pilot * Co-pilot * Air gunner, crew member responsible for the operation of defensive weapons, for example gun turrets. Specific positions include nose gunner, door gunner and tail gunner * Bombardier or Bomb Aimer is a crew member for the release of ordnance, particularly bombs. * Boom operator, in the USAF the crew member on tanker aircraft responsible for operating the flying boom and the transfer of fuel. * Combat systems officer * Airborne Mission Systems Specialist, an aircrew member who operates some form of electronic or other type equipment such as computers, radars, or intelligence gathering equipment to assist or complete the aircraft's mission. * Airborne Sensor Operator, An airborne sensor operator (Aerial Sensor Operator, Tactical Coordinator, EWO etc.) is the functional profession of gathering information from an airborne platform (Manned or Unmanned) and/or oversee mission management systems for tactical, operational and strategic remote sensing purposes. * Crew chief, an enlisted aircraft mechanic with many various responsibilities. Primary among those are aircraft maintenance, pre- flight/postflight inspections, passenger management, acting as a doorgunner, in-air fire fighting, airspace surveillance, assisting the pilots to land the aircraft in difficult landing zones, assisting pilots with engine start up and shutdown safety, fuel checks, monitoring \\"hot\\" refuels (refueling with engines running). * Flight attendant, a crew member who tends to passengers on military aircraft. This position is similar to the duties performed by commercial flight attendants. * Flight engineer, a crew member responsible for engines, systems and fuel management. * Flight officer * Flight surgeon or Flight Nurse, aerial medical staff not involved in the operation of the aircraft but is considered by some militaries to be aircrew. * Loadmaster, crew member responsible for loading freight and personnel and the weight and balance of the aircraft. * Navigator, a crew member responsible for air navigation.

Am Mineral 26:405‚Äì421 In most substances which are not dichromatic, only the brightness and saturation of the colour depend on their concentration and layer thickness. A drop of pumpkin seed oil on a white plate, showing dichromatism Examples of dichromatic substances are pumpkin seed oil, bromophenol blue, and resazurin. When the layer of pumpkin seed oil is less than 0.7 mm thick, the oil appears bright green, and in layer thicker than this, it appears bright red. The phenomenon is related to both the physical chemistry properties of the substance and the physiological response of the human visual system to colour. This combined physicochemical‚Äìphysiological basis was first explained in 2007.Kreft S and Kreft M (2007) Physicochemical and physiological basis of dichromatic colour, Naturwissenschaften 94, 935-939. On-line PDF Physical explanation Dichromatic properties can be explained by the Beer-Lambert law and by the excitation characteristics of the three types of cone photoreceptors in the human retina. Dichromatism is potentially observable in any substance that has an absorption spectrum with one wide but shallow local minimum and one narrow but deep local minimum. The apparent width of the deep minimum may also be limited by the end of the visible range of human eye; in this case, the true full width may not necessarily be narrow. As the thickness of the substance increases, the perceived hue changes from that defined by the position of the wide-but-shallow minimum (in thin layers) to the hue of the deep-but-narrow minimum (in thick layers). The absorbance spectrum of pumpkin seed oil has the wide-but-shallow minimum in the green region of the spectrum and deep local minimum in the red region. In thin layers, the absorption at any specific green wavelength is not as low as it is for the red minimum, but a broader band of greenish wavelengths are transmitted, and hence the overall appearance is green. The effect is enhanced by the greater sensitivity to green of the photoreceptors in the human eye, and the narrowing of the red transmittance band by the long-wavelength limit of cone photoreceptor sensitivity. According to the Beer-Lambert law, when viewing through the coloured substance (and thus ignoring reflection), the proportion of light transmitted at a given wavelength, T, decreases exponentially with thickness t, T = e‚àíat, where a is the absorbance at that wavelength. Let G = e‚àíaGt be the green transmittance and R = e‚àíaRt be the red transmittance. The ratio of the two transmitted intensities is then (G/R) = e(aR-aG)t. If the red absorbance is less than the green, then as the thickness t increases, so does the ratio of red to green transmitted light, which causes the apparent hue of the colour to switch from green to red. 800px Quantification The extent of dichromatism of material can be quantified by the Kreft's dichromaticity index (DI). It is defined as the difference in hue angle (Œîhab) between the colour of the sample at the dilution, where the chroma (colour saturation) is maximal and the colour of four times more diluted (or thinner) and four times more concentrated (or thicker) sample. The two hue angle differences are called dichromaticity index towards lighter (Kreft's DIL) and dichromaticity index towards darker (Kreft's DID) respectively. Kreft's dichromaticity index DIL and DID for pumpkin oil, which is one of the most dichromatic substances, are ‚àí9 and ‚àí44, respectively. This means that pumpkin oil changes its colour from green-yellow to orange-red (for 44 degrees in Lab colour space) when the thickness of the observed layer is increased from cca 0.5 mm to 2 mm; and it changes slightly towards green (for 9 degrees) if its thickness is reduced for 4-fold. History A record by William Herschel (1738‚Äì1822), shows he observed dichromatism with a solution of ferrous sulphate and tincture of nutgall in 1801 when working on an early solar telescope, but he did not recognise the effect.The History of the Telescope - By Henry C. King - Page 141 Weblinks * Kreft Samo & Kreft Marko (2007). Physiochemical and physiological basis of dichromatic colour.

He is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin and South Texas College of Law. Bell served five years on the Houston City Council from 1997 to 2001, followed by one term in the United States House of Representatives from Texas's 25th Congressional District in Houston from 2003 to 2005. He was then the Democratic nominee in the 2006 election for the office of Governor of Texas, losing to Republican incumbent Gov. Rick Perry by 406,450 votes (Perry 39% versus Bell 30%) in a fractured general election campaign that also drew in two significant independent challengers. Bell, a member of the Democratic Party, is currently an attorney specializing in personal injury and commercial litigation. Prior to practicing law, Bell had been a prominent radio journalist in Texas. Personal history Chris Bell was born in Abilene, the seat of Taylor County in West Texas. He was reared in Dallas and moved to Austin when he was accepted to the University of Texas at Austin. As a student, Bell was a member of Phi Delta Theta, and served as president of the Interfraternity Council, and also spearheaded a successful effort to reinstate student government. In 1982, he graduated with a journalism degree and began work as a television and radio journalist, first in Ardmore, Oklahoma and later in Amarillo. He then moved to Houston, working as a Harris County court radio reporter while taking night classes at South Texas College of Law. Despite his success in journalism (he was named ‚Äúbest radio reporter in the state‚Äù in 1990 by the Texas Associated Press), he left journalism and began what would become a successful litigation practice after receiving his J.D. degree and being licensed as an attorney in Texas in 1992. Bell's public service career began in 1997, after being elected to the Houston City Council. After his campaign for State Senate in 2008, Bell returned to the private practice of law. He currently lives in the Heights area of Houston.Nazerian, Tina. \\"Mayoral candidate calls for investigation of Meyerland flooding.\\" Houston Chronicle. June 21, 2015. Retrieved on May 2, 2016. Political career =Texas House of Representatives campaign (1984)= In 1984, Bell ran for Amarillo-based District 87 for the Texas House of Representatives after friends assured him they could get him a job as a legal assistant if he won. Bell was defeated by a large margin by incumbent Charles J. \\"Chip\\" Staniswalis. =Houston City Council (1997‚Äì2002)= Bell ran for Houston City Council in 1995. He received third place, behind David Ballard and eventual winner Orlando Sanchez. He ran again in a 1997 special election, called to fill the seat vacated by the resignation of John Peavy. He placed second in the election after African American minister James W.E. Dixon II. However, since no candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote, the election went to a runoff. Bell defeated Dixon by 6,000 votes. Bell served as at large Position 4 councilman for the Houston City Council for five years. During this time, he served as chairman of both the Council Committee on Customer Service and Initiatives and the Ethics Committee. Throughout his service, he focused on ethics reform, passing laws that limited the use of soft money in city elections. He also championed what he called ‚Äúcustomer- driven government,‚Äù featuring innovative ideas to make government more accessible to the public. He also helped pass the largest tax cut in the city's history and worked to pass sweeping ethics reform that significantly cleaned up what was a corrupt local government. =Mayoral campaign (2001)= In 2001, Bell ran against incumbent mayor Lee P. Brown. Brown and Bell's first disagreement was previously in 2000, when Bell joined with conservatives to pass a 2-cent property tax rollback, causing Brown to replace Bell as chairman. Bell finished third behind Brown and Republican candidate Orlando Sanchez. Bell and Mayor Brown reconciled after the election ‚Äî Bell endorsed Brown during the resulting runoff election and Brown was a vocal supporter for Bell's 2002 congressional bid. =US Congress (2003‚Äì2005)= Bell's Congressional District In 2002, Bell successfully ran for the United States House of Representatives for Texas District 25. He represented most of southwestern Houston, including most of the city's share of Fort Bend County. He was made assistant whip by House Democratic whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland. Bell also served on four standing committees, and was responsible for founding the Port Security Caucus, a group dedicated to improving seaport security. In October 2003, Bell became a target in U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay‚Äôs 2003 congressional redistricting effort. One proposal would have thrown Bell into the heavily Republican 7th District of John Culberson. The final plan was somewhat less ambitious, but still put Bell in political jeopardy. His 25th District was renumbered as the 9th District, and absorbed a larger number of blacks and Latinos than he had previously represented. The old 25th was approximately 65 percent white; the new 9th was only 17 percent white. On March 9, 2004, Bell was handily defeated in the Democratic primary for District 9 by Al Green, the former president of the Houston NAACP, with Bell receiving only 31 percent of the vote. Three months after losing his primary election, on June 15, 2004, Bell filed an ethics complaint against DeLay, alleging abuse of power and illegal solicitation of money, among other things. Bell's charges ended a seven-year \\"truce\\" on such official accusations between the parties. Four months later, the House Ethics Committee unanimously \\"admonished\\" DeLay ‚Äì a disciplinary measure less harsh than (in increasing order of severity) a fine, reprimand, censure, or expulsion ‚Äì on two of Bell's charges.Joel Hefley, Chairman; Alan B. Mollohan, ranking minority member. ; undated, retrieved November 5, 2014. In response to Bell's first complaint, it was found that \\"(1) neither Representative DeLay nor anyone acting on his behalf improperly solicited contributions from [the energy company] Westar, and (2) Representative DeLay took no action with regard to Westar that would constitute an impermissible special favor\\"; but that DeLay's involvement in a Westar fundraiser was \\"objectionable\\" in that it raised \\"an appearance of impropriety under House standards.\\" Bell's second complaint was \\"resolved by a letter of admonition\\" indicating that \\"the contacts of Representative DeLay‚Äôs staff with the Federal Aviation Administration\\" (regarding absentee Texas legislators) raised \\"serious concerns ... under House standards of conduct that preclude using governmental resources for a political undertaking.\\" The committee ultimately concluded that, for these two of Bell's three complaints, \\"formal investigation\\" was \\"not warranted.\\" Bell's third complaint, alleging \\"violation of provisions of the Texas election code,\\" was deferred by the committee for investigation by authorities in the state of Texas. In 2005, after two unsuccessful attempts, Democratic District Attorney Ronnie Earle obtained an indictment from a Travis County grand jury against DeLay on criminal charges that he had violated state campaign-finance laws. The indictments effectively ended DeLay's political career; he resigned from office the following year. Tried by an Austin jury, DeLay was convicted in November 2010 on two charges of conspiracy and money laundering. On September 19, 2013, the Texas Court of Appeals for the Third District overturned both convictions and entered an acquittal for DeLay. Subsequently, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, affirmed the district court's reversal of the jury verdict in an 8-1 ruling, concluding that \\"what prosecutors proved in DeLay's case did not constitute either offense.\\"Graczyk, Michael. \\"Texas appeals court upholds DeLay reversal\\", Tallahassee News (Associated Press), October 1, 2014; retrieved November 5, 2014. DeLay termed his decade-long legal ordeal, originally instigated by Bell's complaints, \\"an outrageous criminalization of politics,\\" and indicated that said he would \\"probably not\\" seek any return to elected office.Camia, Catalina; Davis, Susan. \\"Texas court overturns Tom DeLay conviction\\", USA Today, September 19, 2013; retrieved November 5, 2014. =Gubernatorial campaign (2006)= Bell campaigning for Governor Bell was the Democratic candidate in the 2006 election for the office of Governor of Texas. He ran against Republican incumbent Rick Perry and independents Carole Strayhorn and Kinky Friedman. Bell ultimately received 1,310,353 votes, or 29.79%, in the four-way race. Following the loss, Chris Bell and the political action committee (PAC) \\"Clean Government Advocates for Chris Bell\\" sued Gov. Perry and the Republican Governors Association, claiming they illegally hid $1 million in donations from Houston homebuilder Bob Perry (no relation to the governor) in the final days of the 2006 gubernatorial campaign. Rick Perry chose to settle his part of the lawsuit out of court, but the Republican Governors Association did not. An initial court ruling in 2010 (by Travis County judge John Dietz) favored Bell, but that verdict was subsequently reversed on appeal in 2013, and the appellate court panel sent the case back to District Court to determine how much Bell should reimburse the governors association for associated legal fees. =State Senate District 17 campaign (2008)= On July 18, 2008, Bell announced on his campaign website that he would run in the special election for Texas Senate, District 17. The election was made necessary by the resignation of Republican Senator Kyle Janek. While Bell emerged with a plurality in the November 4, 2008 election, he did not garner enough votes to avoid a special election runoff with Republican Joan Huffman, a former judge and prosecutor. Despite heavy support from Democratic volunteers and officials, he ultimately lost the runoff to Huffman on December 16 with 43.7 percent of the vote to Huffman's 56.3 percent. =Mayoral campaign (2015)= Bell ran for Houston Mayor in 2015 but finished fifth during the general elections. Bell then endorsed Bill King raising eyebrows. Bell had received only 7 percent of the general vote, concentrated in the district C precincts. It was not dispersed throughout the entire city. = Senate campaign (2020) = Bell ran for Senate in Texas in the 2020 election. He lost the March 2020 Democratic primary, coming in sixth place with 8.5% of the vote and failing to advance to the runoff. Bell finished behind former congressional candidate M.J. Hegar, State Senator Royce West, labor organizer Cristina Tzintz√∫n Ramirez, businesswoman Annie \\"Mam√°\\" Garcia, and Houston City Councilor Amanda Edwards. Issues and positions =Abortion= Bell voted no on banning partial birth abortion except to save the mother's life and had a 100 percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America.http://house.ontheissues.org/TX/Chris_Bell_Abortion.htm =Immigration= Bell supports the use of United States National Guard troops along the U.S.-Mexico border, \\"as long as we are very careful not to turn the border into a militarized zone.\\" He also supports the McCain-Kennedy bill that would provide a so-called \\"pathway\\" to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants already in the country, provided they had jobs, learned English, paid fines and met certain other requirements. \\"I don't want to see anybody cutting in line, but I do think that people should be able to earn their citizenship if they're productive and law-abiding citizens.\\" =Education= Bell supports increased spending for the Texas public education system. He wants to focus on acquiring and retaining quality teachers, stopping textbook censorship, and taking the focus away from standardized tests like Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS). He wants to create a bipartisan committee on public education and give school districts more local control. Finally, he wants to make Texas higher education affordable. He wants to end the tuition deregulation which caused a 23% average increase in tuition at Texas state schools. He also wants to give public universities state funding and help students by making textbooks tax free. =Gay rights= Bell is a lifelong proponent of gay rights. In 2002, the Houston Chapter of the Human Rights Campaign awarded him with their first ever John Walzel Political Equality Award. He cosponsored the Permanent Partners Immigration Act with Houston Congress member Sheila Jackson-Lee. The bill sought to offer residency to immigrant same-sex partners of U.S. citizens, much as citizens of other countries who marry Americans are allowed to stay in the country.http://www.houstonvoice.com/print.cfm?content_id=421 =Healthcare= Bell is a passionate supporter of stem cell research. After losing his mother to Parkinson's disease, and nearly losing his wife to cancer, he believes that using science to cure disease is a moral imperative. Bell is on the board of StemPAC, a leading stem cell advocacy group, and often speaks at national stem cell conferences. While a member of the 108th United States Congress, he consistently voted pro stem cell research. Bell is also a strong proponent of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a program that has been the target of budget cuts by Governor Rick Perry. =Trans-Texas Corridor= Bell has opposed the Trans-Texas Corridor, a proposed toll road, on the grounds that it would consume 1.5 million acres (6000 km¬≤) of farmland and of privately owned property.

Along with Alex Chilton, he led the power pop band Big Star through its first album #1 Record (1972). He also pursued a solo career throughout the mid-1970s, resulting in the posthumous I Am the Cosmos LP. AllMusic Guide praised Bell as \\"one of the unsung heroes of American pop music\\" and noted his lasting impression, saying: \\"Despite a life marked by tragedy and a career crippled by commercial indifference, the singer/songwriter's slim body of recorded work proved massively influential on the generations of indie rockers who emerged in his wake.\\" Bell's catalog of proto-alternative rock has inspired the likes of Beck, R.E.M., Teenage Fanclub, Pixies, Primal Scream, Afghan Whigs, Pete Yorn, Wilco, The Posies, and The Replacements, all of whom have covered his music or expressed their admiration for Big Star in the press. His life was documented in the acclaimed documentary Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me, released in 2013 by Magnolia Pictures. Bell's life, and the career of Big Star, was documented in the 2018 book There Was a Light: The Cosmic History of Chris Bell and the Rise of Big Star. The 400-page oral-history style bio contains rare interviews with Bell, his bandmates, friends, family and notable fans. Early career Before his more famous work in the 1970s with Alex Chilton, Bell played in a number of Memphis garage bands beginning in the 1960s. He had started playing music at age 12, influenced heavily by The Beatles and other British Invasion groups like The Yardbirds and The Who. One of Bell's early groups included Memphis natives Richard Rosebrough and Terry Manning, with whom he continued to work for the rest of his music career. Rosebrough, born on September 16, 1949, died on October 18, 2015 after a period of ill health. In 1964 and 1965, Bell played lead guitar in a British Invasion-influenced group called the Jynx (the name is a takeoff on The Kinks) with local musicians, including lead vocalist Mike Harris, rhythm guitarist David Hoback, drummer DeWitt Shy, and bassist Bill Cunningham, and later, bassist Leo Goff. Other lead vocalists at some of the group's shows and rehearsals (though not present on their recordings) included local teens Ames Yates, Vance Alexander, and Alex Chilton. Chilton, who attended many Jynx shows and sang lead vocals at a couple of gigs, soon joined the Box Tops with Cunningham, as the Jynx split up in 1966. Bell continued to perform and record in Memphis throughout the rest of the decade, including a stint in the heavier psych-rock band Christmas Future with Terry Manning and Steve Rhea. By the late 1960s, after attending UT in Knoxville, he had turned his focus toward writing original songs, and Manning brought Bell into the studio for his first professional recordings as a session guitarist. Big Star The group later known as Big Star stemmed from two Bell band projects that began in the late 1960s while he recorded and performed live in groups named Icewater and Rock City. These groups featured a revolving set of musicians including Jody Stephens, Terry Manning, Tom Eubanks, Andy Hummel, Richard Rosebrough, Vance Alexander, and Steve Rhea. Recordings by these groups appear on the various artists collection Rockin' Memphis 1960's‚Äì1970's Vol. 1, Rock City (2003), and Looking Forward: The Roots of Big Star (2017). Bell asked Chilton to join several months after the group had started performing. Eventually, during a period of recording demos and tracks for their first album, the group settled on the name 'Big Star'. The lineup for Big Star's first album was composed of Bell (guitars/vocals), Chilton (guitars, vocals), Hummel (bass, vocals), and Stephens (drums, vocals). Bell and Chilton wrote most of the group's songs, with occasional writing contributions from Hummel and Stephens. Manning played the keyboards and several session horn players were employed. Bell was even more influenced by the music of the British Invasion than Chilton, and he steadfastly retained his Beatles-oriented pop influences throughout his career. Along with Ardent Studios founder John Fry and engineer Terry Manning, Bell is credited with much of the mixing and engineering work done on the first Big Star album #1 Record. After this album failed to achieve commercial success (partially due to confusion by its soul-oriented distributor Stax in marketing the album), Bell left the band in 1972. He struggled with depression for the rest of his life. He also had problems with alcohol and other drugs while also becoming immersed in Christianity. According to his brother David, Bell may have left Big Star due to a belief that he was overshadowed by the more famous Chilton. Solo work Bell concentrated on solo work after leaving Big Star, recording demos at Ardent Studios and Shoe Recording in Memphis with old friends including Rosebrough, Manning, Cunningham, Ken Woodley, and occasionally Chilton and Jim Dickinson. One of Bell's better known solo songs from this period is \\"You and Your Sister\\", featuring Bell's guitar work and vocals, Chilton's backing vocal, and Cunningham's string arrangements and bass work. From 1975 to 1976, Bell co-produced recording sessions for the power pop group Prix, and contributed guitar and backing vocals. Bell also played in groups with local songwriter Keith Sykes, as well as the Baker Street Regulars with Van Duren and Jody Stephens in 1976. During the late 1970s, a few of Bell's pop song lyrics began to reflect the influence of his interest in Christian spirituality. Although he released \\"I Am the Cosmos\\" backed with \\"You and Your Sister\\" as a single in 1978 on Chris Stamey's Car Records label, none of his solo material was released on a full-length album during his lifetime. At this time, Bell worked at his father's restaurant and continued to grapple with clinical depression. Almost 14 years after his death, the songs from his Car Records single and several of his other 1970s recordings were released on 1992's I Am the Cosmos full-length CD on Rykodisc. As with his work with Big Star, the album received highly favorable critical reviews. Giving the album an \\"A-\\", Robert Christgau wrote that it was \\"clear from Bell's very posthumous solo album . . . that Big Star was his idea.\\" In 2009, I Am the Cosmos was re- released in as a deluxe two-CD version by Rhino Handmade with lengthy liner notes, alternate versions, and additional tracks. Death Bell died on December 27, 1978 when he lost control of his Triumph TR7 sports car, sometime after 1:00a.m. He was on his way home from a band rehearsal. The car struck a wooden light pole on the side of the road. The pole fell and killed him instantly. He was 27. His funeral was held the next day, December 28, the birthday of former bandmate Alex Chilton. Influence Bell's music and that of Big Star became popular with alternative rock musicians in the 1980s through word of mouth. Eventually, well known artists including R.E.M., Ian Moore, Teenage Fanclub, and The Replacements began touting the recordings of Big Star as significant works. This Mortal Coil, which had earlier recorded versions of post-Chris Bell Big Star songs, recorded versions of \\"I Am the Cosmos\\" and \\"You and Your Sister\\" on their 1991 album Blood. In 1992, The Posies released a 7\\" single featuring \\"Feel\\"/\\"I Am the Cosmos\\" on Pop Llama. Big Star's pop song \\"In the Street\\", which had featured the tight harmonies of Bell and Chilton, was chosen as a representative song of the 1970s decade by the producers of the television show That '70s Show in 1998; though the Big Star recording of the song was never featured, two different covers of the song were used over the series' run as the theme song to the opening credits. The second, recorded by Cheap Trick in 1999, with revised lyrics, was also included on That '70s Show Presents That '70s Album: Rockin'. Later, Bell's song \\"Speed of Sound\\" appeared on the Flaming Lips album Late Night Tales: The Flaming Lips. Bell's version of \\"Speed of Sound\\" is heard over the opening credits to the film Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. Beck covers \\"I Am the Cosmos\\" in concert.

It is flammable, corrosive, colorless, viscous liquid.Matthias Frauenkron, Johann- Peter Melder, G√ºnther Ruider, Roland Rossbacher, Hartmut H√∂ke \\"Ethanolamines and Propanolamines\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of choline. With both an amine and a hydroxyl functional groups, it is a useful intermediate in the chemical synthesis of various products including polymers and pharmaceuticals. It is also used as a solvent, for example in the processing of natural gas, where it is used together with its analogs ethanolamine and dimethylethanolamine.  Production  N-Methylethanolamine is produced industrially by reacting ethylene oxide with excess methylamine in aqueous solution. This reaction yields a mixture of the 1:1 addition product NMEA (1) and - by a further addition of another ethylene oxide - the 1:2 addition product methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) (2): 315x315px In order to obtain high yields of the desired target product, the reactants are continuously fed to a flow reactor and reacted with a more than two-fold excess of methylamine.Miura Trading & Finvest Pvt. Ltd.: Methyl Ethanolamines Technology (PDF; 152 kB). In the downstream process steps, the excess methylamine and the water is removed and NMEA (bp. 160 ¬∞C) and MDEA (bp. 243 ¬∞C) are isolated from the product mixture by fractional distillation. The poly(methyl-ethanolamine) formed by further addition of ethylene oxide to methylethanolamine remains in the distillation bottoms.  Properties  N-Methylethanolamine is a clear, colorless, hygroscopic, amine-like smelling liquid which is miscible with water and ethanol in any ratio. Aqueous solutions react strongly basic and are therefore corrosive. The substance is easily biodegradable and has no potential of bioaccumulation due to its water miscibility. NMEA is not mutagenic, but in the presence of nitrite, carcinogenic nitrosamines can be formed from the compound, as it is a secondary amine.Product Safety Assessment, DOW N-Methylethanolamine, The Dow Chemical Company, Version vom 24. M√§rz 2010.  Use  Like other alkylalkanolamines, N-methylethanolamine is used in water- and solvent-based paints and coatings as a solubilizer for other components, such as pigments and as a stabilizer. In cathodic dip-coating, N-methylaminoethanol serves as cation neutralizer for the partial neutralization of the epoxy resin. It also serves as a chain extender in the reaction of high molecular weight polyepoxides with polyols. Being a base, N-methylaminoethanol forms neutral salts with fatty acids, which are used as surfactants (soaps) with good emulsifying properties and find applications in textile and personal care cleansing products. When bleaching cotton-polyester blends, NMEA is used as a brightener.The Dow Chemical Company: Alkyl Alkanolamines , March 2003. By methylation of N-methylaminoethanol, dimethylaminoethanol and choline [(2-hydroxyethyl)-trimethyl-ammonium chloride] can be prepared. In the reaction of N-methylaminoethanol with fatty acids, long-chain N-methyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)amides are formed upon elimination of water. These are used as neutral surfactants. Such amides also act as flow improvers and pour point depressants in heavy oils and middle distillates. By catalytic oxidation of N-methylaminoethanol, the non-proteinogenic amino acid sarcosine is obtained.US-Patent US 8,227,638, Process for preparing creatine, creatine monohydrate and guanidinoacetic acid, Inventor: F. Thalhammer, T. Gastner, Anmelder: Alzchem Trostberg GmbH, 24. July 2012. N-methylaminoethanol plays a role as a building block for the synthesis of crop protection compounds and pharmaceuticals, such as in the first stage of the reaction sequence to the antihistamine and antidepressant mianserin (Tolvin) and to the non-analgesic Nefopam (Ajan).A. Kleemann u. J. Engel, Pharmazeutische Wirkstoffe: Synthese, Patente, Anwendungen, 2. √ºberarb. u. erw. Aufl., Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, New York, 1982, . In analogy to other aziridines, N-methylaziridine can be obtained by a Wenker synthesis from N-methylaminoethanol. This is done either via the sulfuric acid ester or after replacement of the hydroxy group by a chlorine atom (for example by thionyl chloride or chlorosulfuric acidJ.H. Drese, The design, synthesis, and characterization of aminosilica adsorbants for CO2 capture from dilute sources (PDF; 5,3 MB), Ph.D. Thesis, Georgia Institute of Technology, Dezember 2010, S. 175.) to N-methyl-2-chloroethylamine and then by using a strong base (cleavage of HCl) in an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution: 394x394px It reacts with carbon disulfide to give N-methyl-2-thiazolidinethione.

Management-, and/or leverage (finance)d buyout became noted phenomena of 1980s business economics. These so-called MBOs originated in the US, spreading first to the UK and then throughout the rest of Europe. The venture capital industry has played a crucial role in the development of buyouts in Europe, especially in smaller deals in the UK, the Netherlands, and France.Wright, Mike, Steve Thompson, and Ken Robbie. \\"Venture capital and management-led, leveraged buyouts: a European perspective.\\" Journal of Business venturing 7.1 (1992): 47-71.  Overview  Management buyouts are similar in all major legal aspects to any other acquisition of a company. The particular nature of the MBO lies in the position of the buyers as managers of the company and the practical consequences that follow from that. In particular, the due diligence process is likely to be limited as the buyers already have full knowledge of the company available to them. The seller is also unlikely to give any but the most basic warranties to the management, on the basis that the management know more about the company than the sellers do and therefore the sellers should not have to warrant the state of the company. Some concerns about management buyouts are that the asymmetric information possessed by management may offer them unfair advantage relative to current owners. The impending possibility of an MBO may lead to principal‚Äìagent problems, moral hazard, and perhaps even the subtle downward manipulation of the stock price prior to sale via adverse information disclosure, including accelerated and aggressive loss recognition, public launching of questionable projects, and adverse earning surprises. These issues make recovery by shareholders who bring suit challenging the MBO more likely than challenges to other kinds of mergers and acquisitions. Naturally, these corporate governance concerns also exist whenever current senior management is able to benefit personally from the sale of their company or its assets. This would include, for example, large parting bonuses for CEOs after a takeover or management buyout. Since corporate valuation is often subject to considerable uncertainty and ambiguity, and since it can be heavily influenced by asymmetric or inside information, some question the validity of MBOs and consider them to potentially represent a form of insider trading. The mere possibility of an MBO or a substantial parting bonus on sale may create perverse incentives that can reduce the efficiency of a wide range of firms-- even if they remain as public companies. This represents a substantial potential negative externality. The managers of the target company may at times also set up a holding company for the purpose of purchasing the shares of the target company. Purpose Management buyouts are conducted by management teams as they want to get the financial reward for the future development of the company more directly than they would do as employees only. A management buyout can also be attractive for the seller as they can be assured that the future stand-alone company will have a dedicated management team thus providing a substantial downside protection against failure and hence negative press. Additionally, in the case the management buyout is supported by a private equity fund (see below), the private equity will, given that there is a dedicated management team in place, likely pay an attractive price for the asset. Financing =Debt financing= The management of a company will not usually have the money available to buy the company outright themselves. They would first seek to borrow from a bank, provided the bank was willing to accept the risk. Management buyouts are frequently seen as too risky for a bank to finance the purchase through a loan. Management teams are typically asked to invest an amount of capital that is significant to them personally, depending on the funding source/banks determination of the personal wealth of the management team. The bank then loans the company the remaining portion of the amount paid to the owner. Companies that proactively shop aggressive funding sources should qualify for total debt financing of at least four times (4X) cash flow. =Private equity financing= If a bank is unwilling to lend, the management will commonly look to private equity investors to fund the majority of buyout. A high proportion of management buyouts are financed in this way. The private equity investors will invest money in return for a proportion of the shares in the company, though they may also grant a loan to the management. The exact financial structuring will depend on the backer's desire to balance the risk with its return, with debt being less risky but less profitable than capital investment. Although the management may not have resources to buy the company, private equity houses will require that the managers each make as large an investment as they can afford in order to ensure that the management are locked in by an overwhelming vested interest in the success of the company. It is common for the management to re-mortgage their houses in order to acquire a small percentage of the company. Private equity backers are likely to have somewhat different goals to the management. They generally aim to maximise their return and make an exit after 3-5 years while minimising risk to themselves, whereas the management rarely look beyond their careers at the company and will take a long-term view. While certain aims do coincide--in particular the primary aim of profitability--certain tensions can arise. The backers will invariably impose the same warranties on the management in relation to the company that the sellers will have refused to give the management. This \\"warranty gap\\" means that the management will bear all the risk of any defects in the company that affect its value. As a condition of their investment, the backers will also impose numerous terms on the management concerning the way that the company is run. The purpose is to ensure that the management run the company in a way that will maximise the returns during the term of the backers' investment, whereas the management might have hoped to build the company for long-term gains. Though the two aims are not always incompatible, the management may feel restricted. The European buyout market was worth ‚Ç¨43.9bn in 2008, a 60% fall on the ‚Ç¨108.2bn of deals in 2007. The last time the buyout market was at this level was in 2001 when it reached just ‚Ç¨34bn. =Seller financing= In certain circumstances, it may be possible for the management and the original owner of the company to agree a deal whereby the seller finances the buyout. The price paid at the time of sale will be nominal, with the real price being paid over the following years out of the profits of the company. The timescale for the payment is typically 3-7 years. This represents a disadvantage for the selling party, which must wait to receive its money after it has lost control of the company. It is also dependent, if an earn-out is used, on the returned profits being increased significantly following the acquisition, in order for the deal to represent a gain to the seller in comparison to the situation pre- sale. This will usually only happen in very particular circumstances. The optimum structure would be to convert the earn-out to contracted deferred consideration which has compelling benefits for the seller as it legally fixes the total future amount paid to them. It's paid like a quarterly annuity, and then the seller needs to secure the annuity by taking out a deferred consideration surety guarantee from an independent surety institution. The direct beneficiary of the surety is the seller and should the sold firm become insolvent, following its sale, with any outstanding deferred payments due the seller, then the surety will pay the money to the vendor on the purchaser's behalf. The vendor agrees to vendor financing for tax reasons, as the consideration will be classified as capital gain rather than as income. It may also receive some other benefit such as a higher overall purchase price than would be obtained by a normal purchase. The advantage for the management is that they do not need to become involved with private equity or a bank and will be left in control of the company once the consideration has been paid. Examples A classic example of an MBO involved Springfield Remanufacturing Corporation, a former plant in Springfield, Missouri owned by Navistar (at that time, International Harvester) which was in danger of being closed or sold to outside parties until its managers purchased the company. https://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/01/prweb12461383.htm#! In the UK, New Look was the subject of a management buyout in 2004 by Tom Singh, the founder of the company who had floated it in 1998. He was backed by private equity houses Apax and Permira, who now own 60% of the company. An earlier example of this in the UK was the management buyout of Virgin Interactive from Viacom which was led by Mark Dyne. The Virgin Group has undergone several management buyouts in recent years. On September 17, 2007, Richard Branson announced that the UK arm of Virgin Megastores was to be sold off as part of a management buyout, and from November 2007, will be known by a new name, Zavvi. On September 24, 2008, another part of the Virgin group, Virgin Comics underwent a management buyout and changed its name to Liquid Comics. In the UK, Virgin Radio also underwent a similar process and became Absolute Radio. In Australia, another group of music and entertainment stores were subject to a management buyout in September 2009, when Sanity's owner and founder, Brett Blundy, sold BB Retail Capital's Entertainment Division (including Sanity, and the Australian franchises of Virgin Entertainment and HMV) to the company's Head of Entertainment, Ray Itaoui. This was for an undisclosed sum, leaving Sanity Entertainment to become a private company in its own right. Hitman is a stealth video game series developed by the Danish company IO Interactive, which was previously published by Eidos Interactive and Square Enix. IO Interactive remained a subsidiary of Square Enix until 2017, when Square Enix started seeking sellers for the studio, IO Interactive completed a management buyout, regaining their independent status and retaining the rights for Hitman, in June 2017.

It is primarily a commuter village for people working in Limerick, particularly the nearby industrial suburb of Raheen. Etymology The name refers to Saint Patrick and there is a small hand pump/well in the main street; Microsoft mappoint and some other programs call the village St. Patrick's Well or St. Patrickswell. Overview Patrickswell has a main street, with shops, garages, ATMs and a post office. The town is located only 10 km from Limerick city, and as a result relies on the city and its suburbs for secondary schools, shops, banks and other facilities. There are several housing estates (Marian Park, Lisheen Park, Belgard Grove Sycamore Heights and Laurel Park) off the main street and road to Clarina. The latter road has strip development north from Patrickswell all the way to Clarina and the N69 road. As a dormitory town with only one major street, Patrickswell retains the appearance of a village, despite its population of over 3000. Location and transport The town is located near to the N20/N21 road, which until Patrickswell was bypassed in 2001, ran through the town centre. This road is now the R526 from west of the town to Limerick city. The town can be accessed at either end from the N20 junction for Limerick Racecourse, or the N20/N21 junction further west (where the R526 commences). A railway line to Adare and Foynes passes alongside the town to the south, although Patrickswell station is long closed. The station was at one time Patrickswell Junction, with direct Limerick-Cork trains diverging here from the route of trains bound for Foynes, Newcastle West and Tralee. Freight trains from Limerick to/from Foynes ran until 2000, and technically the line is still open - though not passable all the way to Foynes (a bridge is in need of replacement). The last train was when the weedspray train visited the line on 7 May 2002. An inspection car was the last movement on the line, which travelled the line in January 2003. Passenger trains ceased in 1963, though passenger services to Croom, Bruree and Charleville on the Cork direct line ceased in 1934 finally closing in March 1967 and lifted soon afterwards. In November 1975 the Ballingrane-Tralee (North Kerry) line closed (see Irish railway history). Patrickswell railway station opened on 12 July 1856, closed for passenger traffic on 4 February 1963 and finally closed altogether on 2 December 1974. The signal cabin remained opened until 1982. Patrickswell Railway station is now in private ownership, it is home to Hutch Hollywood Engineers. A contemporary extension to the original railway station building was designed by Rob Shanahan architects and won OPUS Building of the year award in 2004. Media Despite the size, Patrickswell exchange was not DSL-enabled till 2007,List of Exchanges to be enabled in 2007 though this means it is ADSL2+. Some parts can get Digiweb Metro Broadband on 10.5 GHz wireless (needs Line of sight Woodcock Hill). Most homes have good reception of Saorview DTT (much better than analogue TV was), DAB (RTE only) and VHF-FM from Woodcock Hill. MMDS (UPC's Wireless cable TV for Rural areas) is either from Woodcock Hill or a transmitter in Limerick City direction. MMDS is likely to end in 2016. Patrickswell is on Eircom's Fibre Rollout for 2016-17, but this is likely just VDSL from exchange and perhaps a cabinet near Marian Park. History The town played a role in the Battle of Killmallock. According to Mainch√≠n Seoighe, the present day parish of Patrickswell-Ballybrown is made up parts of the pre-Reformation parishes of Kilkeedy, Killonahan, Mungret, Croom, and Adare. Until the middle of the 18th century, the parishes of Kilkeedy and Clounanna were joined with Adare. When the parish of Patrickswell was formed Kilkeedy and Clounanna became part of the new parish. The first parish priest of the new parish was Fr Nicholas Molony. The present population of the parish is roughly 3,400 people.

It operates 29 daily newspapers in fourteen states and has an average weekday circulation of 1.6 million and Sunday circulation of 2.4 million. In 2006, it purchased Knight Ridder, which at the time was the second-largest newspaper company in the United States (Gannett was, and remains, the largest). In addition to its daily newspapers, McClatchy also operates several websites and community papers, as well as a news agency, McClatchyDC, focused on political news from Washington, D.C. In February 2020, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, intending to reorganize and complete the bankruptcy process within a few months. In July 2020, Chatham Asset Management won the auction to buy McClatchy for US$ 312 million.Hedge fund to pay $312M for McClatchy newspaper chain - Washington Post / Associated Press, 25 July 2020 History The company originated with The Daily Bee, first published in Sacramento, California, on February 3, 1857, by Native American writer Rollin Ridge. James McClatchy joined Ridge as a partner and took over as editor. Known as a supporter of the people's interests against corporations and corrupt politicians, McClatchy made The Bee a bastion of progressive reformism. Upon McClatchy's death in 1883, the paper's leadership passed to James' son, Charles Kenny McClatchy, who with his brother Valentine Stuart, bought out the Ridge family's interests. The two modernized the paper with the formation of McClatchy Newspapers through the founding of the Fresno Bee in 1922 and acquisition of the Modesto Bee in 1924. C.K. McClatchy's legacy to the region has been memorialized in the C.K. McClatchy High School in Sacramento, which opened in 1937, about a year after his death. For most of its history, the company was focused on the newspaper business in California's Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley. In 1978, the 4th generation Charles K. McClatchy took over the company and guided the media company toward the modern publicly owned The McClatchy Company through further acquisitions of out-of-state newspapers, Anchorage Daily News in Anchorage, Alaska, and the Tri-City Herald in Kennewick, Washington. McClatchy also acquired then-ABC affiliate KOVR from Metromedia in 1965. The company's own Modesto Bee reported the sale of the station. It was sold to The Outlet Company in 1978 and today exists as a CBS owned-and-operated station. In 1990, McClatchy acquired three dailies in South Carolina: The Herald in Rock Hill, The Island Packet in Hilton Head, and The Beaufort Gazette of Beaufort. In 1995, it acquired The News & Observer of Raleigh, North Carolina, and in 1998, it bought the Star Tribune of Minneapolis. In January 2004, McClatchy bought the Merced Sun-Star of Merced, and five affiliated non-dailies in California's San Joaquin Valley. The company's biggest acquisition occurred on June 27, 2006, when McClatchy purchased Knight Ridder. Because McClatchy was so much smaller than Knight Ridder at the time, one observer equated the deal as \\"a dolphin swallowing a small whale.\\"\\"Newspaper Chain Agrees to a Sale for $4.5 Billion\\", The New York Times The purchase price of $40 and 0.5118 shares of McClatchy Class A stock per share was valued in total at about $4 billion in cash and stock. The company also assumed $2 billion in debt. This purchase added 20 newspapers to the company stable and the immediate sale (over the next five weeks) of 12 publications including the St. Paul Pioneer Press, San Jose Mercury News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Those sales were completed on August 2, 2006. This acquisition would be cited as the major cause of McClatchy's later troubles - McClatchy overpaid for Knight Ridder by buying at the \\"top of the market\\", and the immense debt took on to fuel the purchase would be a millstone around the neck of the combined company. Additionally, McClatchy did not keep on any of Knight Ridder's digital division or corporate staff, despite the growing prominence of the Internet and Knight Ridder having a well-respected effort in the space at the time.Newspaper giant McClatchy files for bankruptcy, hobbled by debt and declining print revenue The Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune, acquired in 1998 and sold in 2007 to private-equity firm Avista Capital Partners for $555 million, had the highest circulation of all McClatchy newspapers. The company also owns a portfolio of digital assets, including 15.0% of CareerBuilder, LLC, which operates CareerBuilder.com; 25.6% of Classified Ventures, LLC, a company that offers classified websites, such as the auto website Cars.com; and 33.3% of HomeFinder, LLC, which operates the online real estate website HomeFinder.com. McClatchy also owns 49.5% of the voting stock and 70.6% of the nonvoting stock of The Seattle Times Company. In January 2017, former Yahoo! and EarthLink executive Craig Forman was appointed as its new president and chief executive officer (CEO). Forman, a private investor and McClatchy board member, succeeded Patrick Talamantes, who was CEO the previous four years. The descendants of C.K. McClatchy still own a controlling interest in the McClatchy Company and are represented by the 6th generation Kevin McClatchy as chairman of the Board of Directors. In February 2019, Forman emailed all staff to say about 10 percent of the newspaper chain's employees would be offered voluntary buyouts. On February 13, 2020, McClatchy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company cited pension obligations and excessive debt as the primary reasons for the filing. The McClatchy Company and 54 affiliated companies filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Company infrastructure As of 2015, McClatchy had approximately 5,600 full and part-time employees. The company has two classes of stock, allowing the founding McClatchy family to retain control. In the Knight Ridder purchase, for example, McClatchy shareholders did not need to act in approving the purchase because the family had already voted their shares in favor. Editor & Publisher reported in October 2006 that McClatchy revenue ending August 2006 was down over one percent from August 2005. Between the announced purchase of Knight Ridder in March 2006 and late 2009, the stock value of McClatchy (MNI) declined significantly. On December 18, 2008, McClatchy common stock fell below $1 per share. The market capitalization of the company fell below $100 million, down over 98% since the purchase of Knight Ridder in early 2006. In 2010‚Äì2011, the stock had recovered off of its low, but was still down over 90% from the peak. In 2016, McClatchy approved a 1 for 10 reverse stock split that boosted the price of its shares to over $11.McClatchy Company (MNI) Board Approves Reverse Stock Split, Expanded Buyback Authorization 18 May 2016. Retrieved 1 August 2016. McClatchy has an Internet subsidiary, McClatchy Interactive (formerly known as Nando Media), which provides business support and material for Internet media (part of the News & Observer purchase). Other operations include Newsprint Ventures Inc., a consortium that operates the Ponderay newsprint mill near Spokane, Washington. McClatchy also inherited a partnership with the Tribune Company in the news service Knight Ridder-Tribune Information Services, now McClatchy-Tribune Information Services (MCT), when it acquired Knight Ridder. In 2014, Tribune bought out McClatchy's share of the company and its headquarters moved to Chicago. =McClatchy DC Bureau= McClatchyDC is a news agency that distributes original reporting from McClatchy's Washington, D.C. bureau, which was acquired from Knight Ridder. It is the largest client of the McClatchy-Tribune Information Services. In 2008, McClatchy's bureau chief in D.C., John Walcott, was the first recipient of the I. F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence, awarded by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism. In accepting the award, Walcott commented on McClatchy's reporting during the period preceding the Iraq War: \\"Why, in a nutshell, was our reporting different from so much other reporting? One important reason was that we sought out the dissidents, and we listened to them, instead of serving as stenographers to high-ranking [Bush administration] officials and Iraqi exiles.\\" McClatchy journalists have also won nine Pulitzer prizes in their 159-year history, most recently in 2017 for an article on the Panama Papers. They were also finalists in 2015 for articles on government efforts to hide Bush-era CIA torture. Criticism On August 4, 2013, McClatchy Newspapers, citing anonymous sources, reported on conversations between Ayman al-Zawahiri, who succeeded Osama bin Laden as the head of Al Qaeda, and Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the head of the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, discussing an alleged imminent terrorist attack. Two days previously, The New York Times had agreed to withhold the identities of the Al Qaeda leaders after US intelligence officials claimed the information could jeopardize their operations. Government analysts and officials interviewed by the Times said the impact of this disclosure caused more immediate damage to American counter-terrorism efforts than the thousands of classified documents disclosed by Edward Snowden; after the McClatchy publication, there was a sharp drop in the terrorists' use of a major communications channel that the authorities were monitoring. Subsequently, officials have been searching for new ways to monitor communications among Al Qaeda's leaders and operatives.

It is a sister paper to The Jersey Journal of Jersey City, The Times of Trenton and the Staten Island Advance, all of which are owned by Advance Publications. In 2007, The Star-Ledgers daily circulation was reportedly more than the next two largest New Jersey newspapers combined, and its Sunday circulation was larger than the next three papers combined.Member Newspapers - Dailies, New Jersey Press Association; Star-Ledger data from Editor & Publisher April 2007 article. It has suffered great declines in print circulation in recent years, to 180,000 daily in 2013, then to 114,000 \\"individually paid print circulation,\\" which is the number of copies being bought by subscription or at newsstands, in 2015. In July 2013, the paper announced that it would sell its headquarters building in Newark. In the same year, Advance Publications announced it was exploring cost-saving changes among its New Jersey properties, but was not considering mergers or changes in publication frequency at any of the newspapers, nor the elimination of home delivery. History The Newark Daily Advertiser, founded in 1832, was Newark's first daily newspaper. It subsequently evolved into the Newark Star-Eagle, owned by what eventually became Block Communications. S. I. Newhouse bought the Star-Eagle from Block in 1939 and merged it with the Newark Ledger to become the Newark Star-Ledger. The paper dropped Newark from its masthead sometime in the 1970s, but is still popularly called the Newark Star-Ledger by many New Jersey residents. During the 1960s The Star-Ledgers chief competitor was the Newark Evening News, once the most popular newspaper in New Jersey. In March 1971, the Star-Ledger surpassed the Evening News in daily circulation, because the Newark News was on strike. The Evening News shut down in 1972. After the Newark Evening News moved to a high-traffic area (with the potential of trapping its delivery trucks in inner-city traffic) the Star-Ledger opened a satellite plant in Piscataway. The Piscataway location offered quick access to Union, Monmouth, Somerset, and Middlesex counties. The Star-Ledger was the recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting in 2005 for its comprehensive and clear-headed coverage of the resignation of New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey, after he confessed to adultery with a male lover. The paper awards the Star-Ledger Trophy each year to the number one high school teams in their respective sport in New Jersey. =21st century: financial troubles= In 2005, George Arwady became the publisher of The Star-Ledger. A graduate of Columbia University, Arwady had previously been the publisher of the Kalamazoo Gazette in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Having worked closely with the Newhouse family for years, Arwady was asked to move to Newark to financially revamp the paper. Due to financial losses, the paper's parent company Advance Publications announced on July 31, 2008, that it would sell the Star-Ledger unless 200 non-union staff voluntarily left under a buyout offer, and its unionized truck drivers and mailers agreed to concessions. On September 16, publisher George Arwady sent employees an email saying that management felt progress had been made on the buyout and concessions from the mailers, but that management is \\"far from an agreement with the Drivers' union.\\". The email continued: :Since it is doubtful that the Drivers will ratify an agreement by October 8, 2008, we will be sending formal notices to all employees this week, as required by both federal and New Jersey law, advising you that the Company will be sold, or, failing that, that it will close operations on January 5, 2009. On October 24, 2008, the newspaper announced that 168 newsroom employees had offered to take the company's buyout offer, and that the company had accepted 151 of them, which resulted in a 40% reduction in newsroom staff. On January 16, 2013, the newspaper announced the layoffs of 34 employees including 18 newsroom staff. The Newark headquarters of the Star-Ledger, home to the state's largest newspaper for nearly 50 years, was sold to a New York developer in July 2014, according to a news article released by the paper. The Star-Ledger, which Vezza said will continue to be published seven days a week, will retain a presence in Newark in leased office space located within the downtown Gateway Center complex, where the publisher, the newspaper's editorial board, its columnists, its magazine staff and a handful of other jobs will be based. Advance Publications, the owner of the newspaper, launched a new media company ‚Äî NJ Advance Media ‚Äî in 2014 to provide content, advertising and marketing services for its online presence at NJ.com, and many of its New Jersey newspapers out of the offices in Woodbridge. The sales and marketing staffs moved to Woodbridge in June 2014. Management =Presidents= * Amzi Armstrong (1832‚Äì?) * William Burnet Kinney (?‚Äì1851) * Thomas T.

Prior to accepting the Ledgers editorship, Willse headed the review of electronic information options for all Newhouse newspapers. He also expanded the Ledger use of color and encouraged a more aggressive editorial team. The National Press Foundation named Willse its 1999 recipient of the George Beveridge Editor of the Year Award in recognition of Ledgers coverage of racial profiling by the New Jersey State Police.

The 40 species of Tasmannia are native to Australia, New Guinea, Sulawesi, Borneo, and the Philippines. The Winteraceae are magnoliids, and are associated with the humid Antarctic flora of the Southern Hemisphere. The members of the family generally have aromatic bark and leaves, and some are used to extract essential oils. The peppery-flavored fruits and leaves (especially dried) of this genus are increasingly used as a condiment in Australia. The peppery flavour can be attributed to polygodial. Taxonomy The first description of the genus was published by Robert Brown.in a contribution to Augustin-Pyramus de Candolle, Regni Vegetabilis Systema Naturale, Vol. 1, Paris (1818): 445. The species of Tasmannia were formerly classified in genus Drimys, a related group of Winteraceae native to the Neotropics. Recent studies have led to an increasing consensus among botanists to split the genus into two, with the Neotropical species remaining in genus Drimys, and the Australasian species classified in genus Tasmannia.Doust, A.N., Drinnan, A.N., Floral development and molecular phylogeny support the generic status of Tasmannia (Winteraceae), American Journal of Botany, Vol. 91, pp321-331., 2004 =List of Tasmannia species= Distribution and habitat In Australia, the genus Tasmannia ranges from Tasmania and eastern Victoria and New South Wales to southeastern Queensland, and in the mountains of northeastern Queensland, where it grows in moist mountain forests and in wet areas in the drier forest and along watercourses to an elevation of 1500 m (5000 ft). Culinary use 'Tasmanian pepper' or 'mountain pepper' (T. lanceolata, often referred to as Drimys lanceolata or T. aromatica) was the original pepperbush used by colonial Australians, and was introduced into cultivation in Cornwall, UK, to become the 'Cornish pepperleaf' associated with Cornish cuisine. It has large, peppery berries which are also high in antioxidants. Safrole is the biggest limitation with using wild strains of mountain pepper, and safrole-free strains of mountain pepper have been selected for the spice trade. Tasmannia stipitata, Dorrigo pepper, is also sold as a spice and was the original pepperbush used in specialty native food restaurants in the 1980s. Dorrigo pepper is safrole free and has a strong peppery flavour.  See also  * Bushtucker  References  = Notes = = Bibliography = * Doust, Andrew N. and Drinnan, Andrew N., 2004.

Thus the evolution of such a pattern repeats itself indefinitely. Depending on context, the term may also include spaceships as well. The smallest number of generations it takes before the pattern returns to its initial condition is called the period of the oscillator. An oscillator with a period of 1 is usually called a still life, as such a pattern never changes. Sometimes, still lifes are not taken to be oscillators. Another common stipulation is that an oscillator must be finite. Examples In Conway's Game of Life, finite oscillators are known to exist for all periods except 19, 38 and 41. Additionally, while oscillators exist for period 34, the only known examples are considered trivial because they consist of essentially separate components that oscillate at smaller periods. For instance, one can create a period 34 oscillator by placing period 2 and period 17 oscillators so that they do not interact. An oscillator is considered non-trivial if it contains at least one cell that oscillates at the necessary period.

Seeds is a cellular automaton in the same family as the Game of Life, initially investigated by Brian Silverman. and named by Mirek W√≥jtowicz.. It consists of infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which may be in one of two states: on or off. Each cell is considered to have eight neighbors (Moore neighborhood), as in Life. In each time step, a cell turns on or is \\"born\\" if it was off or \\"dead\\" but had exactly two neighbors that were on; all other cells turn off. Thus, in the notation describing the family of cellular automata containing Life, it is described by the rule B2/S. In Game of Life terminology, a pattern in which all cells that were on turn off at each step is called a phoenix. All patterns in Seeds have this form. Even though all live cells are constantly dying, the small birth requirement of two cells means that nearly every pattern in Seeds explodes into a chaotic mess that grows to cover the entire universe. Thus, in Wolfram's classification of cellular automata, it is a Class III automaton, in which nearly all patterns evolve chaotically.. However, some patterns are known to behave in a more controlled fashion, repeating the same shape either in the same position of the grid (an oscillator) or translated some number of grid units after several steps (a spaceship). More complex rake and puffer patterns are known which move like spaceships leaving trails of oscillators or other spaceships behind them. Most of these patterns move at a speed of 1 cell per time step (the so- called speed of light, or c/1) including three commonly seen spaceships with four on cells each, but slower-moving patterns are also known.

As well as her novels, she produces non-fiction and is best known for her work in women's literature. Much of her writing deals with family life. Abroad she became known for Watermelon, Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married, Rachel's Holiday, Last Chance Saloon, Anybody Out There, and This Charming Man, with themes including alcoholism, depression, addiction, cancer, bereavement, and domestic violence. By March 2017 more than 35 million copies of her 12 novels preceding The Break (2017) had been sold, and her works had been translated into 33 languages. Her writing has won both the Irish Popular Fiction Book and the Popular Non-Fiction Book of the Year, each on one occasion, at the Irish Book Awards. Biography Keyes comes from a large family, with many siblings. Born in Limerick and raised in Monkstown, Dublin, she graduated from University College Dublin with a law degree. After completing her studies, Keyes took an administrative job before moving to London in 1986. During this period she became an alcoholic and was affected by clinical depression, culminating in a suicide attempt and subsequent rehabilitation in 1995 at the Rutland Centre in Dublin. In an article for The Daily Telegraph, Keyes details how her struggles with anxiety, depression, and alcoholism began at an early age. Keyes began writing short stories while suffering from alcoholism. After her treatment at the Rutland Centre she returned to her job in London and submitted her short stories to Poolbeg Press. The publisher encouraged her to submit a full-length novel and Keyes began work on her first book, Watermelon. The novel was published the same year. Since 1995 she has published 13 novels and four works of non-fiction. Keyes has written frankly about her clinical depression, which left her unable to sleep, read, write, or talk. After a long hiatus due to severe depression, a food title, Saved by Cake, was published in February 2012. This period lasted about four years. During this time Keyes also wrote The Mystery of Mercy Close, a novel in which the heroine experiences similar battles with depression and suicide attempts as those Keyes herself battled. As Keyes further describes this period of her life: \\"It was like being in an altered reality . . . I was always melancholic and prone to sadness and hopelessness but this was catastrophic and unimaginable.\\" In March 2017, Keyes was a guest castaway for BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Her favourite track was \\"You Have Been Loved\\" by George Michael. She revealed that she had battled constant suicidal urges at the height of her mental illness. During her appearance on the show, Keyes also told host Kirsty Young that in spite of all her efforts to treat her depression, ranging from CBT, medication, mindfulness, hospitalisation, diets, among other things, what finally healed her was time: \\"It was an illness and it ran its course.\\" Keyes lives in D√∫n Laoghaire with her husband Tony Baines, after returning to Ireland from London in 1997. Style Although many of her novels are known as comedies, they revolve around dark themes often drawn from Keyes's own experiences, including domestic violence, drug abuse, mental illness, divorce and alcoholism. Keyes considers herself a feminist, and has chosen to reflect feminist issues in many of her books. She is regarded as a pioneer of the chick lit genre; her stories usually revolve around a strong female character who overcomes numerous obstacles to achieve lasting happiness. Regarding her decision to use an optimistic tone and hopeful ending, Keyes has said: \\"I'm very bleak, really melancholic. But I've always used humour as a survival mechanism. I write for me and I need to feel hopeful about the human condition. So no way I'm going to write a downbeat ending. And it isn't entirely ludicrous to suggest that sometimes things might work out for the best.\\" During an author Q & A in 2014 with Canada's Chatelaine magazine, when asked how she feels about the term \\"chick lit\\" Keyes claimed that \\"it‚Äôs meant to be belittling. It‚Äôs as if it‚Äôs saying, 'Oh you silly girls, with your pinkness and shoes, how will you ever run the world?' But as I‚Äôve matured (haha) I‚Äôve realised that I'm very proud of what I write about and I know that the books I write bring happiness and comfort to people\\". Yet even her admirers, women themselves, regard her writing as chick lit. At a subsequent event at the Edinburgh Book Festival in August 2020, Keyes rejected the term chick lit as dismissive and sexist, as men writing similar fiction are not described as \\"dick lit\\". Keyes's gift for tackling difficult subjects and making them relatable to women all over, without sacrificing quality or tact, has been recognised by her peers. As told to The Irish Times by another Irish author: \\"It‚Äôs a rare gift....The only other writer I can think of who writes so hilariously and movingly about serious subjects was the late, great Sue Townsend.\\" Views In 2014, after Keyes appeared on Marian Finucane's RT√â One show to talk about her new book, she told her Twitter followers that Finucane had the \\"compassion and empathy of a cardboard box. Even my mammy called her a bad word\\". In 2015, Keyes herself was accused of a lack of empathy after offending the people of two counties ‚Äî Leitrim and Roscommon ‚Äî by insulting them on the night of the election count in the marriage referendum. She deleted her original comment, which she admitted was made for \\"a cheap laugh\\". During her appearance on Desert Island Discs in March 2017, Keyes told the host her view that by \\"conditioning women to think that what they find empowering or valuable is worth less than what men consider to be worthwhile, women are prevented from reaching for parity and the gender gap in power and money between men and women is kept in the favour of men\\". In an interview with The Irish Times in 2017, Keyes announced that she suspected \\"gender bias\\" to be at play when it comes to the recognition of women writers. She claimed that, despite her perceived success and acclaim, male writers with less commercial success were held in higher regard, indicating her idea that the writing which sells the most is the most well written. \\"Do you remember in the early noughties when a lot of Irish women writers like Cathy Kelly, Sheila O‚ÄôFlanagan, Cecelia Ahern were selling all over the world? I don‚Äôt feel that was celebrated enough.\\" She went on to \\"wonder\\" (her word) that \\"if a group of young Irish men around the same age had been selling in huge numbers\\", before directly turning the question she had posed into her view: \\"I really think it would not have passed unremarked.\\" She does not believe genes play a part in determining the make up of the individual or their behaviour, telling an interviewer in 2020 that \\"no one is born a certain way, people learn it\\". Keyes is self-confessed sexist, explaining that she will only accept books written by women to sit on her shelves, and never reads the work of men, whom she claims are \\"not worth reading\\".

The term was created by John Taylor, the Director General of the United Kingdom's Office of Science and Technology in 1999 and was used to describe a large funding initiative starting in November 2000. E-science has been more broadly interpreted since then, as \\"the application of computer technology to the undertaking of modern scientific investigation, including the preparation, experimentation, data collection, results dissemination, and long-term storage and accessibility of all materials generated through the scientific process.

These ideas were reflected by The White House's Office and Science Technology Policy in February 2013, which slated many of the aforementioned e-Science output products for preservation and access requirements under the memorandum's directive.Executive Office of the President, Office of Science and Technology Policy, \\"Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies: Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research.\\" February 22, 2013, accessed July 7, 2013, http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf. E-sciences include particle physics, earth sciences and social simulations.  Characteristics and examples Most of the research activities into e-Science have focused on the development of new computational tools and infrastructures to support scientific discovery. Due to the complexity of the software and the backend infrastructural requirements, e-Science projects usually involve large teams managed and developed by research laboratories, large universities or governments. Currently there is a large focus in e-Science in the United Kingdom, where the UK e-Science programme provides significant funding. In Europe the development of computing capabilities to support the CERN Large Hadron Collider has led to the development of e-Science and Grid infrastructures which are also used by other disciplines. = Consortiums = Example e-Science infrastructures include the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid, a federation with various partners including the European Grid Infrastructure, the Open Science Grid and the Nordic DataGrid Facility. To support e-Science applications, Open Science Grid combines interfaces to more than 100 nationwide clusters, 50 interfaces to geographically distributed storage caches, and 8 campus grids (Purdue, Wisconsin-Madison, Clemson, Nebraska- Lincoln, FermiGrid at FNAL, SUNY-Buffalo, and Oklahoma in the United States; and UNESP in Brazil). Areas of science benefiting from Open Science Grid include: * astrophysics, gravitational physics, high-energy physics, neutrino physics, nuclear physics * molecular dynamics, materials science, materials engineering, computer science, computer engineering, nanotechnology * structural biology, computational biology, genomics, proteomics, medicine = UK programme = After his appointment as Director General of the Research Councils in 1999 John Taylor, with the support of the Science Minister David Sainsbury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, bid to HM Treasury to fund a programme of e-infrastructure development for science which would provide the foundation for UK science and industry to be a world leader in the knowledge economy which motivated the Lisbon Strategy for sustainable economic growth that the UK government committed to in March 2000. In November 2000 John Taylor announced ¬£98 million for a national UK e-Science programme. An additional ¬£20 million contribution was planned from UK industry in matching funds to projects that they participated in. From this budget of ¬£120 million over three years, ¬£75 million was to be spent on grid application pilots in all areas of science, administered by the Research Council responsible for each area, while ¬£35 million was to be administered by the EPSRC as a Core Programme to develop \\"industrial strength\\" Grid middleware. Phase 2 of the programme for 2004-2006 was supported by a further ¬£96 million for application projects, and ¬£27 million for the EPSRC core programme. Phase 3 of the programme for 2007-2009 was supported by a further ¬£14 million for the EPSRC core programme and a further sum for applications. Additional funding for UK e-Science activities was provided from European Union funding, from university funding council SRIF funding for hardware, and from Jisc for networking and other infrastructure. The UK e-Science programme comprised a wide range of resources, centres and people including the National e-Science Centre (NeSC) which is managed by the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, with facilities in both cities. Tony Hey led the core programme from 2001 to 2005. Full transcript updated 15 December 2006. Within the UK regional e-Science centres support their local universities and projects, including: * White Rose Grid e-Science Centre (WRGeSC) * Belfast e-Science Centre (BeSC) * Centre for eResearch Bristol (CeRB) * Cambridge e-Science Centre (CeSC) * STFC e-Science Centre (STFCeSC) * e-Science North West (eSNW) * National Grid Service (NGS) * OMII-UK * Lancaster University Centre for e-Science * London e-Science Centre (LeSC) * North East Regional e-Science Centre (NEReSC) * Oxford e-Science Centre (OeSC) * Southampton e-Science Centre (SeSC) * Welsh e-Science Centre (WeSC) * Midlands e-Science Centre (MeSC) There are also various centres of excellence and research centres. In addition to centres, the grid application pilot projects were funded by the Research Council responsible for each area of UK science funding. The EPSRC funded 11 pilot e-Science projects in three phases (for about ¬£3 million each in the first phase): * First Phase (2001‚Äì2005) were CombEchem, DAME, Discovery Net, GEODISE, myGrid and RealityGrid. * Second phase (2004‚Äì2008) were GOLD and Integrative biology * Third phase (2005‚Äì2010) were PMSEG (MESSAGE), CARMEN and NanoCMOS The PPARC/STFC funded two projects: GridPP (phase 1 for ¬£17 million, phase 2 for ¬£5.9 million, phase 3 for ¬£30 million and a 4th phase running from 2011 to 2014) and Astrogrid (¬£14 million over 3 phases). The remaining ¬£23 million of phase one funding was divided between the application projects funded by BBSRC, MRC and NERC: * BBSRC: Biomolecular Grid, Proteome Annotation Pipeline, High-Throughput Structural Biology, Global Biodiversity * MRC: Biology of Ageing, Sequence and Structure Data, Molecular Genetics, Cancer Management, Clinical e-Science Framework, Neuroinformatics Modeling Tools * NERC: Climateprediction.com, Oceanographic Grid, Molecular Environmental Grid, NERC DataGrid The funded UK e-Science programme was reviewed on its completion in 2009 by an international panel led by Daniel E. Atkins, director of the Office of Cyberinfrastructure of the US NSF. The report concluded that the programme had developed a skilled pool of expertise, some services, and had led to cooperation between academia and industry, but that these achievements were at a project level rather than by generating infrastructure or transforming disciplines to adopt e-Science as a normal method of work, and that they were not self-sustainable without further investment. = United States= United States-based initiatives, where the term cyberinfrastructure is typically used to define e-Science projects, are primarily funded by the National Science Foundation office of cyberinfrastructure (NSF OCI) and Department of Energy (in particular the Office of Science). = The Netherlands = Dutch eScience research is coordinated by the Netherlands eScience Center in Amsterdam, an initiative founded by NWO and SURF. =Europe = Plan-Europe is a Platform of National e-Science/Data Research Centers in Europe, as established during the constituting meeting 29‚Äì30 October 2014 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and which is based on agreed Terms of Reference. PLAN-E has a kernel group of active members and convenes twice annually. More can be found on PLAN-E. =Sweden = Two academic research projects have been carried out in Sweden by two different groups of universities, to help researches share and access scientific computing resources and knowledge: * Swedish e-Science Research Center (SeRC): Kungliga Tekniska h√∂gskolan (KTH), Stockholm University (SU), Karolinska institutet (KI) and Link√∂ping University (LiU) * eSSENCE, The e-Science Collaboration (eSSENCE): Uppsala University, Lund University and Ume√• University  Comparison with traditional science  Traditional science is representative of two distinct philosophical traditions within the history of science, but e-Science, it is being argued, requires a paradigm shift, and the addition of a third branch of the sciences. \\"The idea of open data is not a new one; indeed, when studying the history and philosophy of science, Robert Boyle is credited with stressing the concepts of skepticism, transparency, and reproducibility for independent verification in scholarly publishing in the 1660s. The scientific method later was divided into two major branches, deductive and empirical approaches. Today, a theoretical revision in the scientific method should include a new branch, Victoria Stodden advocate[s], that of the computational approach, where like the other two methods, all of the computational steps by which scientists draw conclusions are revealed. This is because within the last 20 years, people have been grappling with how to handle changes in high performance computing and simulation.\\" As such, e-science aims at combining both empirical and theoretical traditions, while computer simulations can create artificial data, and real-time big data can be used to calibrate theoretical simulation models. Conceptually, e-Science revolves around developing new methods to support scientists in conducting scientific research with the aim of making new scientific discoveries by analyzing vast amounts of data accessible over the internet using vast amounts of computational resources. However, discoveries of value cannot be made simply by providing computational tools, a cyberinfrastructure or by performing a pre-defined set of steps to produce a result. Rather, there needs to be an original, creative aspect to the activity that by its nature cannot be automated. This has led to various research that attempts to define the properties that e-Science platforms should provide in order to support a new paradigm of doing science, and new rules to fulfill the requirements of preserving and making computational data results available in a manner such that they are reproducible in traceable, logical steps, as an intrinsic requirement for the maintenance of modern scientific integrity that allows an extenuation of \\"Boyle's tradition in the computational age\\". = Modelling e-Science processes = One view argues that since a modern discovery process instance serves a similar purpose to a mathematical proof it should have similar properties, namely it allows results to be deterministically reproduced when re-executed and that intermediate results can be viewed to aid examination and comprehension. In this case, simply modelling the provenance of data is not sufficient. One has to model the provenance of the hypotheses and results generated from analyzing the data as well so as to provide evidence that support new discoveries. Scientific workflows have thus been proposed and developed to assist scientists to track the evolution of their data, intermediate results and final results as a means to document and track the evolution of discoveries within a piece of scientific research. = Science 2.0 = Other views include Science 2.0 where e-Science is considered to be a shift from the publication of final results by well-defined collaborative groups towards a more open approach, which includes the public sharing of raw data, preliminary experimental results, and related information. To facilitate this shift, the Science 2.0 view is on providing tools that simplify communication, cooperation and collaboration between interested parties. Such an approach has the potential to: speed up the process of scientific discovery; overcome problems associated with academic publishing and peer review; and remove time and cost barriers, limiting the process of generating new knowledge.

The United States government claims that he was fighting with the Taliban against U.S. and Afghan Northern Alliance forces. He was declared an \\"illegal enemy combatant\\" by the Bush administration and detained for almost three years without charge. On October 9, 2004, on the condition that he renounce his U.S. citizenship and commit to travel prohibitions and other conditions, the government released him and deported him to Saudi Arabia, where he had been raised. Hamdi was initially detained at Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, along with eventually hundreds of other detainees. After officials learned that he was a U.S. citizen, Hamdi was transferred to military jails in Virginia and South Carolina. He continued to be detained without trial or legal representation. Critics of his imprisonment claimed his civil rights were violated and that he was denied due process of law under the U.S. Constitution. They said his imprisonment without formal charges and denial of right to counsel was illegal. On June 28, 2004, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the United States Supreme Court upheld the U.S. government's ability to detain him indefinitely as an enemy combatant, but granted him some due process rights and the ability to contest his enemy combatant status. It said he had the right as a U.S. citizen to due process under habeas corpus: to confront his accusers and contest the grounds of detention in an impartial forum. Early years According to his birth certificate, Hamdi was born to immigrant parents from Saudi Arabia in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on September 26, 1980. As a child, he moved with his parents from the United States back to Saudi Arabia, where he grew up. The Charleston Post and Courier reported that Hamdi ran away from home during the summer of 2001, when he was 20 years old, and trained at a Taliban camp. His family said that he spent only a few weeks at the camp, \\"where he quickly became disillusioned\\". He was caught up in the fighting and chaos after the United States invaded Afghanistan. Afghanistan In late November 2001, after the United States invasion of Afghanistan, Hamdi was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in Kunduz, Afghanistan, along with hundreds of surrendering Taliban fighters. All the men were sent to the Qala-e-Jangi prison complex near Mazar-i-Sharif. Among the surrendering Taliban forces, Afghan Arabs instigated a prison riot by detonating grenades they had concealed in their clothing, attacking Northern Alliance guards and seizing weapons. The prison uprising (known as the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi) was quashed after a three-day battle, which included heavy air support from U.S. AC-130 gunships and Black Hawk helicopters. One American (Johnny Micheal Spann) was killed and nine were injured, along with about 50 Northern Alliance soldiers. Between 200 and 400 Taliban prisoners were killed during the prison uprising. Two prisoners who were American citizens, Hamdi and John Walker Lindh, were among the survivors. Hamdi surrendered on the second day of fighting with a group of 73 surviving prisoners, after Coalition forces began flooding the underground basements where the remaining prisoners had hidden themselves. The United States officer Matthew Campbell approached him, demanding to know his origin, to which Hamdi replied \\"I was born in America... Baton Rouge, Louisiana, you know it, yeah?\\"Worthington, Andy, The Guantanamo Files: The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America's Illegal Prison, Pluto Press. , 2007 The United States transported Hamdi to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and detained him there starting February 11, 2002. On April 5, the government transferred Hamdi to a jail at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. Armed with a federal appeals court finding, the Bush administration refused Hamdi a lawyer until December 2003. The Pentagon announced then that Hamdi would be allowed access to legal counsel because his \\"intelligence value\\" had been exhausted and that giving him a lawyer would not harm national security. The announcement said the decision \\"should not be treated as a precedent\\" for other cases in which the government had designated U.S. citizens as \\"illegal enemy combatants\\". (Jos√© Padilla was then the only other U.S. citizen known to be imprisoned by the U.S. government as an \\"illegal enemy combatant\\"). After the decision, Frank Dunham, Hamdi‚Äôs lawyer, was finally able to meet with him in February 2004, more than two years after he was incarcerated. Under Pentagon guidelines, military observers attended and recorded their meetings. Dunham was not allowed to discuss with Hamdi the conditions of his confinement. By this time, he had been transferred to the Navy Brig in Charleston, South Carolina. After the initial meeting, Hamdi was allowed to have confidential discussions with his attorneys without military observers, or video or audio taping in the room. Hamdi's father petitioned a federal court for Hamdi's rights to know the crime(s) he is accused of, and to receive a fair trial before imprisonment. In January 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Hamdi's case (Hamdi v. Rumsfeld). It ruled that U.S. citizens were entitled to the basic rights of due process protections, and rejected the administration's claim that its war- making powers overrode constitutional liberties. 2002 memos United States Navy Brig, Norfolk Virginia. On August 1, 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice issued a memo signed by Jay S. Bybee to John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency regarding authorized interrogation and detention techniques for the detainees in the war on terror. It approved ten \\"enhanced interrogation\\" techniques including waterboarding. Shortly after September 26, 2002, numerous senior government political appointees of the Bush Administration flew to see the conditions of detention for Mohammed al-Kahtani and two United States citizens then held as enemy combatants: Jose Padilla and Hamdi, as a result of legal challenges to the government's detention policy. The officials included the following: *David Addington, legal counsel to Vice-President Dick Cheney; *Alberto Gonzales, White House Counsel and later U.S. Attorney General; *John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel of the CIA; *William Haynes II, General Counsel of the Department of Defense; *Jack Goldsmith, legal adviser to Haynes in the Office of General Counsel, DOD; *Alice S. Fisher, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division, Department of Justice (DOJ), with responsibility for counter-terrorism efforts;Eric Lichtblau, \\"Tension Builds Between F.B.I. and Congress,\\" New York Times (christusrex.org), August 15, 2005Personnel Announcement, White House, March 29, 2005. and *Patrick F. Philbin, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, DOJ, who had helped develop policy related to Bush's use of military commissions to review detainees' cases; They first flew to Camp Delta at Guantanamo to see the detainee al-Kahtani. They traveled next to Charleston, South Carolina, to view Padilla, held at the Naval Brig, and finally to Norfolk, Virginia, to view Hamdi, who was still being detained at that Naval brig.Mayer, Jane, The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals, 2008. p. 199 Upon seeing Hamdi curled up in fetal position in his cell, Goldsmith wrote, \\"it seemed unnecessary to hold a twenty-two year old foot soldier in a remote wing of a run-down prison in a tiny cell, isolated from almost all human contact, and with no access to a lawyer\\". In 2008, 91 pages of memos drafted in 2002 by officers at the Naval Consolidated Brig, Charleston, were made public under an FOIA petition. As reported by news outlets, the emails and memos described the officers' concerns for the sanity of the detainees due to the conditions of their confinements at the time, which included extended solitary confinement. The memos indicate that officers were concerned at the time that the isolation and lack of stimuli was severely affecting the mental health of Hamdi, Padilla and Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, another U.S. detainee. U.S. Supreme Court amici curi√¶ briefs Twelve U.S. Supreme Court amici curi√¶ briefs were filed in the Hamdi case, including nine on behalf of Hamdi and three in support of the government. Supporters of the U.S. government's position included the American Center for Law and Justice; Citizens for the Common Defence; filing jointly, the Washington Legal Foundation, U.S. Representatives Joe Barton (R‚ÄìTex.), Walter Jones (R‚ÄìN.C.), and Lamar Smith (R‚ÄìTex.), and Allied Educational Foundation ; and, also filing jointly, the Center for American Unity, Friends of Immigration Law Enforcement, National Center on Citizenship and Immigration, and U.S. Representatives Dana Rohrabacher (R‚ÄìCalif.), Lamar Smith, Tom Tancredo (R‚ÄìColo.), Roscoe Bartlett (R‚ÄìMd.), Mac Collins (R‚ÄìGa.), Joe Barton, and Jimmy Duncan (R‚ÄìTenn.). Some government supporters argued that he had renounced his citizenship by virtue of enlisting in a foreign army. The Center for American Unity's brief argued that Hamdi was never a United States citizen, despite his birth in the United States. They argued that the policy of birthright citizenship is based on a flawed interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. On the other side, the American Bar Association; American Civil Liberties Union, American Jewish Committee, Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, and Union for Reform Judaism filing jointly; the Cato Institute; Experts on the Law of War; Certain Former Prisoners of War; Global Rights; Hon. Nathaniel R. Jones, Hon. Abner J. Mikva, Hon. William A. Norris, Hon. H. Lee Sarokin, Hon. Herbert J. Stern, Hon. Harold R. Tyler, Jr., Scott Greathead, Robert M. Pennoyer, and Barbara Paul Robinson filing jointly; International Humanitarian Organizations and Associations of International Journalists filing jointly; and a group of international law professors filing jointly submitted amici curi√¶ briefs to the court on behalf of Hamdi. Opponents of the U.S. government's detention without trial of U.S. citizens argued that the practice violated numerous constitutional safeguards and protections, as well as international conventions to which the United States is a signatory.  U.S. Supreme Court decision  On June 28, 2004, the Supreme Court issued a decision repudiating the U.S. government's unilateral assertion of executive authority to suspend constitutional protections of individual liberty. \\"An interrogation by one's captor, however effective an intelligence-gathering tool, hardly constitutes a constitutionally adequate fact-finding before a neutral decision-maker\\", wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The U.S. Supreme Court opinion reasserted the rule of law in American society: \\"It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments that our nation's commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which we fight abroad.\\" She added that the Court had \\"long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the nation's citizens\\". The Supreme Court decision in Hamdi did not say that the government could not detain enemy combatants; it can detain enemy combatants for the length of hostilities. However, they must be given some sort of due process to determine their status as an enemy combatant. Although the United States Congress has recognized the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, the Pentagon's administrative procedure, the Supreme Court did not recognize it as due process.  Legal significance  The Hamdi decision reaffirmed the importance of separation of powers among the branches of the government, and, in particular, the role of the judiciary in reviewing actions of the executive branch infringing the rights of citizens even in emergencies. After the American Civil War, the Supreme Court prohibited military detention of noncombatant Americans without appeal or writ of habeas corpus as long as courts were functioning; the difference with this case being that the Supreme Court waited until the war was over to decide the case. A 1948 federal law condemned the detention of Japanese-Americans without legal recourse during World War II; it prohibited the imprisonment of American citizens except pursuant to an act of Congress.https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/4001 The Bush administration claimed that U.S. law does not apply to \\"illegal enemy combatants\\" and that it asserted the right to decide which U.S. citizens are \\"enemy combatants\\", ineligible for protection of their rights as enshrined in the United States Constitution. Some legal scholars hailed the Supreme Court decision as the most important civil rights opinion in a half-century. They said that it was a dramatic reversal of the sweeping authority asserted by President Bush since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Other scholars, however, believe the Supreme Court imprudently enhanced the Executive's power. The Supreme Court allowed the Executive to unilaterally determine that Hamdi was an enemy combatant. Further, the Supreme Court determined that the Executive was not required to provide any process when making the enemy combatant classification. The Supreme Court's only requirement was that a person classified as an enemy combatant must be provided with minimal due process. In effect, this allowed the Executive branch to lower the due process requirements on an American citizen, solely because the Executive branch claimed he was an enemy combatant. Assessing the Hamdi decision, Habeas Corpus scholar Jared Perkins noted \\"By ratifying in part and ‚Äòfixing‚Äô (as Justice Scalia put it) in part the executive's action against Hamdi, the plurality participated with the executive in the usurpation of Congress's power to define the curtailment of the public's liberties. Removing this power (and, more importantly, this responsibility) from the representatives of the people seriously undermines those structural protections that Madison and others saw as the fundamental barrier to tyranny. \\"Habeas Corpus in the War Against Terrorism: Hamdi v. Rumsfeld and Citizen Enemy Combatants, 19 BYU J. Pub. L. 437, 460 (2005).  Release  After agreeing to renounce his U.S. citizenship, Hamdi was released on October 9, 2004, without being charged and was deported to Saudi Arabia. He had to promise to comply with strict travel restrictions, which prohibited him from traveling to the United States, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Hamdi was required to notify Saudi Arabian officials if he ever plans to leave the kingdom. He had to promise not to sue the U.S. government over his captivity. Although Hamdi renounced his U.S. citizenship, it is unclear whether the renunciation counts as \\"voluntary\\", as required by the Supreme Court's decisions in Afroyim v. Rusk and Vance v. Terrazas.

An example of ODRL policy follows, which can be interpreted as \\"John can play mysong.mp3\\". { \\"@context\\": \\"http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld\\", \\"uid\\": \\"http://example.com/policy:001\\", \\"permission\\": [{ \\"target\\": \\"http://example.com/mysong.mp3\\", \\"assignee\\": \\"John\\", \\"action\\": \\"play\\" }] } ODRL History ODRL was initially created in 2000, to address the burgeoning needs of the DRM-sector when media players were first introduced to the marketplace. Version 1.1 of the ODRL language was quickly adopted by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) as their core standard for mobile media content protections and for managing digital objects. To date, ODRL is arguably the largest mobile implementation of a rights language, currently operating on over a billion compatible devices. ODRL was managed by an independent Initiative, hosted by IPR Systems and led by Renato Iannella, before becoming a W3C Community Group in 2011. This move has provided long-term stability of the specifications and a transparent governance model. In 2013, two new media sectors adopted ODRL: the eBook publishing and news industries. The International Press and Telecommunication Council (IPTC) news consortium adopted ODRL for the communication of usage policies, primarily in association with the licensed distribution and use of news content in the online news marketplace. In the current virtual goods environment, content assets purchased or permissioned by a consumer are often locked into the same platform where content was initially consumed due to interoperability of rights expressions across platforms. ODRL Version 2.0 recognized it is equally important to state Permissions and Prohibitions in an expression language representing both DRM and non-DRM digital objects, broad adoption of this advanced model can reduce friction across digital devices and enable transparent transactions between machines in accordance with the specified policy language. ODRL policy model framework currently supports traditional rights expressions for commercial transactions, open access expressions, and privacy expressions for social media. ODRL Specifications and Profiles ODRL is a specified in two World Wide Web (W3C) Recommendations published in February 2018: * ODRL Information Model 2.2 * ODRL Vocabulary & Expression 2.2 Included within the ODRL documentation are a number of basic use cases demonstrating how to implement policy expressions using the Core Model with terms from the Common Vocabulary. ODRL is fully extensible and provides a mechanism for new communities to extend and/or deprecate the ODRL Common Vocabulary used in conjunction with the Core Model. An example of how the ODRL Profile and Vocabulary may be extended is found in the IPTC RightsML profile. The robust framework of ODRL allows for a wide variety of business models to be expressed and to address the requirements of multiple communities, such as social networks, publishers, image libraries, and education. Other profiles, such as the ODRL profile of Creative Commons were been developed. The ODRL Community Group is a World Wide Web (W3C) Community and Business Group still supports the promotion and future development of the W3C ODRL recommendations. ODRL Core Model In the ODRL Core Model, the Policy is the central entity that holds an ODRL policy together. In its encoded form, e.g. in an XML document, it makes the policy addressable from the outside world via its unique uid attribute. A Policy can refer to multiple Permissions and Prohibitions. A Permission allows a particular Action to be executed on a related Asset, e.g. ‚Äúplay the audio file abc.mp3‚Ä≥. A Constraint like ‚Äúat most 10 times‚Äù might be added to specify the Permission more precisely. The Party that grants this Permission is linked to it with the Role assigner, the Party that is granted the Permission is linked to it with the Role assignee, e.g. ‚Äúassigner VirtualMusicShop grants the Permission to assignee Alice‚Äù. Additionally, a Permission may be linked to Duty entities. Similar to Permissions, a Duty states that a certain Action may be executed by the Party with the Role assignee for the Permission to be valid, e.g. ‚ÄúAlice must pay 5 EUR in order to get the Permission to play abc.mp3‚Ä≥. The Prohibition entity is used in the same way as Permission, with the two differences that it does not refer to Duties and that it forbids the Action, e.g. ‚ÄúAlice is forbidden to use abc.mp3 commercially‚Äù. ODRL encodings ODRL can be implemented in three serializations: XML, RDF/OWL Ontology, and JSON. Communities adopting ODRL can use standardized actions for Permissions, Prohibitions, and Duties that are expressed in policy statements.

It was an independent town from 1980 to 1996. Bedford is on the northwestern end of Bedford Basin, an extension of the Halifax Harbour, which ends just before Nova Scotia Highway 102 and the Bedford Bypass, next to Lower Sackville. Bedford is at the junctions of Trunks 1, 2, and 7. History The area of Bedford has evidence of Indigenous peoples dating back thousands of years. Petroglyphs are found at Bedford Petroglyphs National Historic Site. The Bedford area is known as Kwipek to the Mi'kmaq First Nation. =18th century= Scott Manor House (built 1770) Father Le Loutre's War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on June 21, 1749.Grenier, John. The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. Norman: U of Oklahoma P, 2008; Thomas Beamish Akins. History of Halifax, Brookhouse Press. 1895. (2002 edition). p 7 By unilaterally establishing Halifax the British were violating earlier treaties with the Mi'kmaq (1726), which were signed after Father Rale's War.; ; The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against Mi'kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax (1749), Bedford (Fort Sackville) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), Lunenburg (1753) and Lawrencetown (1754). The history of Bedford began when Governor Edward Cornwallis organised his men and began the construction of a road leading to Minas Basin on the Bay of Fundy after establishing the garrison at Halifax. To protect it, he hired John Gorham and his Rangers to erect a fort on the shore of Bedford Basin. It was named Fort Sackville after Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset.Cutherbertson and Architects, p. 48 The area around the fort became known as Sackville until the mid-1850s, when it became Bedford. In 1752, among the first to receive a large land grant was military officer George Scott in the Fort Sackville area. Scott later participated in the Expulsion of the Acadians, specifically the St. John River Campaign (1758). His brother, Joseph, was paymaster at the Halifax Garrison in the 1760s, received two grants in 1759 and 1765. And built Scott Manor House in 1770. =19th century= Anthony Holland established the Acadian Paper Mill on the Basin around 1819 to provide paper to produce the Halifax newspaper Acadian Recorder. When the railway went through the station named Millview, the Moirs, Son and Co. moved a part of the Moirs Mill factory to Bedford. The Moirs Mill generating station built in the early 1930s to supply the necessary electricity required to run the factory. The village adopted the name Bedford around 1850. The name is in honour of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, Secretary of State for the colonies in 1749. In 1896, the name became official by an Act of Legislation. =20th century= A map of the Bedford area of HRM. Bedford was incorporated as a town on July 1, 1980. On April 1, 1996, Bedford was amalgamated with Halifax, Dartmouth, and Halifax County Municipality to form the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) for the municipal level of government. The place name still exists, however, for 911, mail, legal, and other services. The mayor of Bedford at the time of amalgamation, Peter J. Kelly, would later serve as mayor of HRM, from 2000 to 2012. The first mayor of Bedford was Francene Cosman. The March 23, 1997 issue of Maclean's magazine rated Bedford as being the \\"Best Community to Live in Canada.\\" Geography Bedford is approximately from Downtown Halifax. Demographics *Median household income in 2000 was $64,963. *Unemployment rate in 2001 was 6.7. *Average house value in 2001 was $179,881. Sports and recreation There is a popular walkway along much of the Bedford Basin waterfront that begins at DeWolf park, and continues as the Bedford-Sackville Connector Greenway, a crushed gravel covered trail that meanders along the Sackville River. There is an outdoor 25m pool and smaller splash pool located at the Lions Park on Shore Drive. In the summer there are numerous lakes suitable for swimming. The topography of the area limits the possible locations for soccer and football fields. However, there are fields at Basinview Drive Community School, Sunnyside Elementary (Eaglewood location), Rocky Lake Junior High, Charles P. Allen High School, Bedford South School, and Range Park. The community is currently home to six ice surfaces, at the Lebrun Centre, the Gary Martin Dome and the BMO Centre. Bedford is a well-established sailing community, and is home to the Bedford Basin Yacht Club and Marina. Traditions Bedford Days has occurred annually at the end of June and beginning of July for over 30 years. Currently, most of the events take place at DeWolf Park. There is an Opening Celebration, Rubber Duck Dash, Free pancake breakfast, Dog show, Scott Manor House Tea Party, Kids' Extravaganza, Kids' Triathlon, Movies in the Park, and a Canada Day Celebration. The Light Up Bedford Parade is an annual parade that runs along the Bedford Highway from Bedford Place Mall and ends at DeWolf Park. At the park there is a hot chocolate stand, Christmas carol singing, contests, and prizes. At the conclusion of the parade, a Christmas Tree is lit. In addition to bringing the community together to celebrate the beginning of the Christmas season, the parade serves as a fundraiser for the Turkey Club Society, which raises funds to ensure all residents of HRM are able to provide a Christmas dinner for their families. The parade takes place on the Sunday following the Light Up Halifax Parade, which is usually mid- November.

Routes 8, 87, 90, 91 and 93 directly serve Bedford while many more routes serve the nearby Cobequid terminal in Lower Sackville. There is a fast ferry service planned for the Mill Cove area that would connect to the Ferry Terminal in Downtown Halifax. However, this proposed service is controversial due to disputes over projected costs and ridership levels. Bedford is well serviced by taxis, buses, roads, highways, and sidewalks/walking paths.

From its source to its mouth on the North Coast of Norfolk it is . The river has a fall of 36 metres to the sea. Course The source is one mile south of the village of South Creake, in a small copse west of a bend in London Lane. From the source it runs northeast towards the village of South Creake, where at Fakenham road it turns northwest and run through the village. Gradually the river turns north and runs along the western side of the Burnham road heading towards North Creake. The river runs through the village of North Creake, crosses under the Burnham Road and heads north across the open countryside towards the ruins of Creake Abbey. This abbey is on the southern edge of the Burnham‚Äôs, a mile or so from Burnham Thorpe. It was built towards the end of the 14th century for an Augustinian priory which had inhabited this spot since the 1220s, becoming an abbey shortly afterwards. Creake Abbey is unusual, because although it survived into the 16th century, it never suffered the effects of the Reformation or the dissolution of the monasteries. In 1508, an outbreak of plague killed virtually all the inhabitants, and it was abandoned. The river runs through a small pool in what were the grounds on the west side of the abbey, and then passes under the lane and out northwards across countryside towards Burnham Thorpe. At Burnham Thorpe the river runs through another pool very close to the site of the Burnham Thorpe Parsonage. That parsonage was the birthplace of Admiral Horatio Nelson. Burnham Thorpe was originally one of a group of seven villages all prefixed with \\"Burnham\\" taking their name from the river. It is approximately three miles from the North Norfolk coast, a low, flat coastline of muted colour, of sand and salt-marsh. From the high ground above the village one can see the sea, and it is said that from there you can hear the sound of surf on the sand of the shore. The river now curves northwest through the village towards Thorpe common. The Manor House on Thorpe common has a moat all around supplied with water from the river. Further on the river passes under the route of the dismantled West Norfolk Junction Railway to the east of Burnham Market. From here the river widens a little and flows into the mill pond at Burnham Overy.Burnham Overy Union Mill. Burnham Overy Union mill is one of only two mills in Norfolk to use both water and wind power from the same site. The watermill section had 3 pairs of stones, and the windmill had a further 2 pairs. Both mills were built in 1737, being constructed of brick, the watermill having two storeys under a Norfolk pan tiled roof, with a third storey being added later. The windmill was originally built with five floors, but a sixth was subsequently added. In 1825 the sails had copper vanes. The Lower Mill at Burnham Overy Just a very short distance on the river reaches a second watermill. The lower mill at Burnham Overy is the second of two watermills on the river Burn. This mill consists of a long row of buildings in four sections, three storeys high, built from local red brick with pantile roofs; it was originally three stories high, but after it burnt down in the 1940s Christopher Curtis Green (son of William Curtis Green who lives in the Mill House re-drew it for it to be re-built with a less overbearing two stories, as it stands today. The mill dates from 1795. The inlet water bridge is in between the second and third building. The A149 coast road passes over the river at the mill site. From here the river enters Overy marshes and Overy Creek. The river spreads out into multiple tidal creeks through the salt marshes that fringe the coast thereabouts, and finally leaves land and enters the sea between the eastern point of Scolt Head Island and Overy Marshes, the gap locally known as Burnham Harbour. Small boats can reach Burnham Overy Staithe through this gap and creek.

He was formerly a member of the Indian National Congress. He was a member of parliament from Pune till May 2014. He is alleged to have been involved in corrupt practices in relation to the 2010 Commonwealth Games during his tenure as president of Indian Olympic Association and chairman of Common Wealth Games 2010. He was charged with conspiracy, forgery, misconduct and under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and later arrested for the same in April 2014, but as has yet not faced trial. In December 2016, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) named Suresh Kalmadi as its lifetime patron. However, he refused to accept the post until he was able to clear his name.  Early life  Kalmadi was born to Mangalore based Dr. K. Shamrao Kalmadi and Shanta Rao Kalmadi. He was educated at St. Vincent's High School and Fergusson College, Pune. Kalmadi joined the National Defence Academy in 1960 and was commissioned as a pilot in the Indian Air Force, serving between 1964 and 1972. He then became an instructor with the Air Force Training Team of the NDA from 1972 to 1974 before retiring from the IAF as a squadron leader. He is married to Meera Kalmadi. The couple have two daughters and one son. Political career In 1977, Kalmadi became the President of the Indian Youth Congress, Pune, and the next year took over President-ship of the Youth Congress, Maharashtra, a post he held from 1978 to 1980. In 1980, as the President of the Maharashtra Athletics Association, Kalmadi undertook the selection trials for the Marathon team to represent the country at the Moscow Olympics. This soon led to the establishment of the Pune International Marathon. Kalmadi served as president of the Indian Youth Congress (Socialist) 19811986.india.gov.in.

Suresh Kalmadi at the inauguration of the First World Konkani Convention in 1995. He is dressed in a black coat, to the right. Controversies =Corruption related to Formula One 2011= Kalmadi, as the Indian Olympic Association, signed an agreement to bring the Formula One Grand Prix to India in 2007. Later that year, the UK-based organizers Formula One Administration Limited signed a contract in this regard with India-based JPSK Sports Private Limited. Records obtained by The Indian Express showed that Pune-based Sulba Realty Private Limited was a 13% shareholder in JPSK, along with Jaypee Group (74%). Kalmadi's son Sumeer was a director in Sulba Realty at the time, which would have implied a conflict of interest. While the JP in JPSK stood for Jaypee Group, it was alleged that the SK was a reference to Suresh/Sumeer Kalmadi. Records from the Registrar of Companies, India showed that a year after the company was floated, Kalmadi's daughter, Payal Aditya Bhartia, and his son-in- law, Aditya Bhartia, joined JPSK as independent directors. =Commonwealth Games 2010= Kalmadi's conduct around the 2010 Commonwealth Games came under scrutiny, with the Central Vigilance Commission (India's anti-corruption organisation) asking the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe certain aspects of the games' organisation. For this, the opposition demanded Kalmadi's resignation. On 25 April 2011, CBI arrested former CWG Organising Committee (OC) chairman Suresh Kalmadi in the Timing-Scoring-Result (TSR) case. He was arrested under Sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. On 20 May 2011, CBI filed the first chargesheet in a special CBI court against Kalmadi. The CBI alleged that he was the main accused in awarding TSR system contract to a Swiss firm. The charge sheet said, \\"Kalmadi is the main accused as he was the person with all supreme powers. He had the supreme over-riding powers in the Organising Committee of the CWG, 2010.\\" In addition to Kalmadi, the CBI named two companies and eight persons including OC former Secretary General Lalit Bhanot and former Director General VK Verma as accused. Kalmadi's membership of the Indian National Congress Party was suspended after being arrested and charged with corruption. On 26 April 2011 he was sacked from the post of president of the Indian Olympic Association. On 1 July 2013 he lost the election for the post of President of the Asian Athletics Association, a post which he had held for 13 consecutive years, losing to Qatar's Dahlan Jumaan Al-Hamad. Suresh Kalmadi was in jail for 10 months and the court asked him to pay a surety amount of . Kalmadi was allowed by a Delhi court on 13 July 2012 to go to London for 2012 Olympics. He was, however, restrained on 25 July 2012 by the Delhi High court from participating in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics, saying his participation can cause \\"embarrassment\\" to the nation.

Day and Night is a cellular automaton rule in the same family as Game of Life. It is defined by rule notation B3678/S34678, meaning that a dead cell becomes live (is born) if it has 3, 6, 7, or 8 live neighbors, and a live cell remains alive (survives) if it has 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8 live neighbors, out of the eight neighbors in the Moore neighborhood. It was invented and named by Nathan Thompson in 1997, and investigated extensively by David I. Bell. The rule is given the name \\"Day & Night\\" because its on and off states are symmetric: if all the cells in the Universe are inverted, the future states are the inversions of the future states of the original pattern. A pattern in which the entire universe consists of off cells except for finitely many on cells can equivalently be represented by a pattern in which the whole universe is covered in on cells except for finitely many off cells in congruent locations. Although the detailed evolution of this cellular automaton is very different from Conway's Game of Life, it exhibits complex behavior similar to that rule: there are many known small oscillators and spaceships, and guns formed by combining oscillators in such a way that they periodically emit spaceships of various types.

In Mediaeval Britain, grazing rights within the boundaries of the Forest of Dartmoor were strictly limited. However a few settlers were permitted to build farms there, and to release their livestock on surrounding land. These farms became known as the Ancient Tenements, and many still survive today, such as Babeny, Bellever, Brimpts, Brownberry, Dunnabridge, Dury, Hartyland, Hexworthy, Huccaby, Lakehead, Merripit, Pizwell, Prince Hall, Riddon, Runnage, and Sherberton. Many still feature buildings that are of mediaeval origins, including elements of their original longhouses: *Bellever's medieval longhouse was demolished only last century when today's farmhouse was built. *Dunnabridge grew to become a cluster of small farms. Several of today's barns show signs of chimneys - evidence that they were once inhabited. *Dury Farm has an ancient fireplace and a flight of granite stairs winding around the chimney stack. *Pizwell features a 16th-century door and fireplace. *Prince Hall (once known as Prynse Hall), is now a hotel and restaurant which stands on the site of the original farm. *Riddon (originally Riddam) no longer has its original longhouse, although it does feature an ancient granite barn. *Sherrill (often recorded as Sherwell) is a small hamlet containing a number of farm buildings and cottages. The farm still features its original longhouse, virtually intact, but now used as a barn, with a large porch constructed from slabs of granite. The majority are Grade II listed and some are Grade II* (particularly important buildings of special interest). For centuries, these settlements were isolated from 'civilisation' - many miles from the nearest villages. And yet the inhabitants were still expected to travel many miles to church each Sunday, over hills and rough terrain. To make matters worse, the parish boundaries often bore little or no relation to the natural geography. However, in 1260, the Bishop decreed that the dead from Pizwell and neighbouring Babeny, could be taken to Widecombe-in-the-Moor, which was much closer and more accessible.

They have adapted this nickname for themselves in Breton as ar Johniged or ar Johnniged. Declining since the 1950s to only a few, the Onion Johnny was once very common. With renewed interest since the late 1990s by farmers and the public in small-scale agriculture, their numbers have recently made a small recovery. Dressed in striped Breton shirt and beret, riding a bicycle hung with onions, the Onion Johnny became the stereotypical image of the Frenchman and was possibly in many cases the only contact that ordinary British people had with France and French people. History Stringing onions in Porthmadog, Wales (1958) The trade may have begun in 1828 when the first successful trip is said to have been made by Henri Ollivier. From the area around Roscoff in Brittany known as Bro Rosko, Johnnies found a more profitable market in Britain than in France, and typically brought their harvest across the English Channel in July to store in rented barns, returning home in December or January. They could have sold their produce in Paris, but the roads and the railways were bad in the 19th century and going there was a long and difficult trip; crossing the channel was shorter and easier. As the early Johnnies were all Breton- speakers, Wales was a favoured destination. Breton is a Brythonic language related to Welsh and Cornish, and the Johnnies would have found Welsh a far easier language to learn than English. The Johnnies who regularly visited Wales in the nineteenth century became known as ' and subsequently as Onion Johnnies in English. ‚Äì Review of The golden age for Johnnies across the UK was during the 1920s; in 1929 nearly 1,400 Johnnies imported over 9,000 tonnes of onions to the UK. The Great Depression, followed by the devaluation of the Pound in the early 1930s, ended the era as trade suddenly fell, reaching a low in 1934, when fewer than 400 people imported under 3,000 tonnes. In the aftermath of World War II, onions in common with other goods were subject to import restrictions, and were obliged to be traded through a single company. By 1973 the number of Johnnies had dropped to 160, trading 1,100 tonnes, and had fallen again to around 20 by the end of the 20th century. The legend of their transporting their produce to Britain inspired farmers in Brittany to set up Brittany Ferries in the 1970s. Journeys are now made by ferry but small sailing ships and steamers were used previously, and the crossing could be hazardous. Seventy Johnnies died when the steamer SS Hilda sank at Saint-Malo in 1905.passenger list In culture The Onion Johnny museum opened in Roscoff in 2004, with a two-day F√™te de l'Oignon (Onion Festival) held every summer. Since 2009 the ' has been protected under the French Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e designation.

He was director of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office from 1965 through 1969, founder and later manager of Xerox PARC's Computer Science Laboratory from 1970 through 1983, and founder and manager of Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center until 1996. Uniquely, Taylor had no formal academic training or research experience in computer science; Severo Ornstein likened Taylor to a \\"concert pianist without fingers,\\" a perception reaffirmed by historian Leslie Berlin: \\"Taylor could hear a faint melody in the distance, but he could not play it himself. He knew whether to move up or down the scale to approximate the sound, he could recognize when a note was wrong, but he needed someone else to make the music.\\" His awards include the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and the Draper Prize. Taylor was known for his high-level vision: \\"The Internet is not about technology; it's about communication. The Internet connects people who have shared interests, ideas and needs, regardless of geography.\\" Early life Robert W. Taylor was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1932. His adoptive father, Rev. Raymond Taylor, was a Methodist minister who held degrees from Southern Methodist University, the University of Texas at Austin and Yale Divinity School. The family (including Taylor's adoptive mother, Audrey) was highly itinerant during Taylor's childhood, moving from parish to parish. Having skipped several grades as a result of his enrollment in an experimental school, he began his higher education at Southern Methodist University at the age of 16 in 1948; while there, he was \\"not a serious student\\" but \\"had a good time.\\"http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Taylor_Robert/102702015.05.01.acc.pdf Taylor then served a stint in the United States Naval Reserve during the Korean War (1952‚Äì1954) at Naval Air Station Dallas before returning to his studies at the University of Texas at Austin under the GI Bill. At UT he was a \\"professional student,\\" taking courses for pleasure. In 1957, he earned an undergraduate degree in experimental psychology from the institution with minors in mathematics, philosophy, English and religion. He subsequently earned a master's degree in psychology from Texas in 1959 before electing not to pursue a PhD in the field. Reflecting his background in experimental psychology and mathematics, he completed research in neuroscience, psychoacoustics and the auditory nervous system as a graduate student. According to Taylor, \\"I had a teaching assistantship in the department, and they were urging me to get a PhD, but to get a PhD in psychology in those days, maybe still today, you have to qualify and take courses in abnormal psychology, social psychology, clinical psychology, child psychology, none of which I was interested in. Those are all sort of in the softer regions of psychology. They're not very scientific, they're not very rigorous. I was interested in physiological psychology, in psychoacoustics or the portion of psychology which deals with science, the nervous system, things that are more like applied physics and biology, really, than they are what normally people think of when they think of psychology. So I didn't want to waste time taking courses in those other areas and so I said I'm not going to get a PhD.\\" After leaving Texas, Taylor taught math and coached basketball for a year at Howey Academy, a co-ed prep school in Florida. \\"I had a wonderful time but was very poor, with a second child ‚Äî who turned out to be twins ‚Äî on the way,\\" he recalled. Taylor took engineering jobs with aircraft companies at better salaries. He helped to design the MGM-31 Pershing as a senior systems engineer for defense contractor Martin Marietta (1960‚Äì1961) in Orlando, Florida. In 1962, he was invited to join NASA's Office of Advanced Research and Technology as a program manager assigned to the manned flight control and display division after submitting a research proposal for a flight control simulation display. Computer career Taylor worked for NASA in Washington, D.C. while the Kennedy administration was backing research and development projects such as the Apollo program for a manned moon landing. In late 1962 Taylor met J. C. R. Licklider, who was heading the new Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense. Like Taylor, Licklider had specialized in psychoacoustics during his graduate studies. In March 1960, he published \\"Man- Computer Symbiosis,\\" an article that envisioned new ways to use computers. This work was an influential roadmap in the history of the internet and the personal computer, and greatly influenced Taylor.Markoff, John, Innovator who helped create PC, Internet and mouse, New York Times, April 15, 2017, pA14 During this period, Taylor also became acquainted with Douglas Engelbart at the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California. He directed NASA funding to Engelbart's studies of computer-display technology at SRI that led to the computer mouse. The public demonstration of a mouse-based user interface was later called \\"the Mother of All Demos.\\" At the Fall 1968 Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco, Engelbart, Bill English, Jeff Rulifson and the rest of the Human Augmentation Research Center team at SRI showed on a big screen how he could manipulate a computer remotely located in Menlo Park, while sitting on a San Francisco stage, using his mouse. =ARPA= In 1965, Taylor moved from NASA to IPTO, first as a deputy to Ivan Sutherland (who returned to academia shortly thereafter) to fund large programs in advanced research in computing at major universities and corporate research centers throughout the United States. Among the computer projects that ARPA supported was time-sharing, in which many users could work at terminals to share a single large computer. Users could work interactively instead of using punched cards or punched tape in a batch processing style. Taylor's office in the Pentagon had a terminal connected to time-sharing at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a terminal connected to the Berkeley Timesharing System at the University of California, Berkeley, and a third terminal to the System Development Corporation in Santa Monica, California. He noticed each system developed a community of users, but was isolated from the other communities. Taylor hoped to build a computer network to connect the ARPA-sponsored projects together, if nothing else, to let him communicate to all of them through one terminal. By June 1966, Taylor had been named director of IPTO; in this capacity, he shepherded the ARPANET project until 1969.Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet (p. 12). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition \\"1965 to 1969\\" Taylor had convinced ARPA director Charles M. Herzfeld to fund a network project earlier in February 1966, and Herzfeld transferred a million dollars from a ballistic missile defense program to Taylor's budget.Markoff, John, Innovator who helped create PC, Internet and the mouse, New York Times, April 15, 2017, p.A1 Taylor hired Larry Roberts from MIT Lincoln Laboratory to be its first program manager. Roberts first resisted moving to Washington DC, until Herzfeld reminded the director of Lincoln Laboratory that ARPA dominated its funding. Licklider continued to provide guidance, and Wesley A. Clark suggested the use of a dedicated computer, called the Interface Message Processor at each node of the network instead of centralized control. At the 1967 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, a member of Donald Davies' team (Roger Scantlebury) presented their research on packet switching and suggested it for use in the ARPANET. ARPA issued a request for quotation (RFQ) to build the system, which was awarded to Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN). ATT Bell Labs and IBM Research were invited to join, but were not interested. At a pivotal meeting in 1967 most participants resisted testing the new network; they thought it would slow down their research. In 1968, Licklider and Taylor published \\"The Computer as a Communication Device\\". The article laid out the future of what the Internet would eventually become. It began with a prophetic statement: \\"In a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face.\\" Beginning in 1967, Taylor was sent by ARPA to investigate inconsistent reports coming from the Vietnam War. Only 35 years old, he was given an identification card with the military rank equivalent to his civilian position (brigadier general), thus ensuring protection under the Geneva convention if he were captured. Over the course of several trips to the area, he established a computer center at the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam base in Saigon. In his words: \\"After that the White House got a single report rather than several. That pleased them; whether the data was any more correct or not, I don't know, but at least it was more consistent.\\" The Vietnam project took him away from directing research, and \\"by 1969 I knew ARPANET would work. So I wanted to leave.\\" The election of Richard Nixon to the presidency and ongoing tensions with Roberts (who, despite maintaining a putatively cordial relationship with Taylor, resented his lack of research experience and appointment to the IPTO directorship) also factored in his decision to leave ARPA. For about a year, he joined Sutherland and David C. Evans at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, where he had funded a center for research on computer graphics while at ARPA. Unable to acclimate to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints- dominated milieu, Taylor moved to Palo Alto, California in 1970 to become associate manager of the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL) at Xerox Corporation's new Palo Alto Research Center. =Xerox= Although Taylor played an integral role in recruiting scientists for the laboratory from the ARPA network, physicist and Xerox PARC director George Pake felt that he was an unsuitable candidate to manage the group because he lacked a relevant doctorate and subsequent experience in academic research. While Taylor eschewed a Pake-proposed research program in computer graphics in favor of largely administering the day-to-day operations of the laboratory from its inception, he acquiesced to the appointment of BBN scientist and ARPA network acquaintance Jerome I. Elkind as titular CSL manager in 1971. Technologies developed at PARC under Taylor's aegis focused on reaching beyond ARPANET to develop what has become the Internet, and the systems that support today's personal computers. They included: *Powerful personal computers (including the Xerox Alto and later \\"D-machines\\") with windowed displays and graphical user interfaces that inspired the Apple Lisa and Macintosh. The Computer Science Laboratory built the Alto, which was conceived by Butler Lampson and designed mostly by Charles P. Thacker, Edward M. McCreight, Bob Sproull and David Boggs. The Learning Research Group of PARC's Systems Science Laboratory (led by Alan Kay) added the software-based \\"desktop\\" metaphor.Markoff, John, Innovator who helped create PC, Internet and mouse, New York Times, April 15, 2017, p.A14 *Ethernet, which networks local computers within a building or campus; and the first Internet, a network that connected the Ethernet to the ARPANET utilizing PUP (PARC Universal Protocol), forerunner to TCP/IP. It was primarily designed by Robert Metcalfe, Boggs, Thacker and Lampson. *The electronics and software that led to the laser printer (spearheaded by optical engineer Gary Starkweather, who transferred from Xerox's Webster, New York laboratory to work with CSL) and the Interpress page description language that allowed John Warnock and Chuck Geschke to found Adobe Systems. *\\"What-you-see- is-what-you-get\\" (WYSIWYG) word-processing programs, as exemplified by Bravo, which Charles Simonyi took to Microsoft to serve as the basis for Microsoft Word. *SuperPaint, a pioneering graphics program and framebuffer computer system developed by Richard Shoup. The software was written in consultation with future Pixar co-founder Alvy Ray Smith, who could not secure an appointment at PARC and was retained as an independent contractor. Although Shoup received a special Emmy Award (shared with Xerox) in 1983 and an Academy Scientific Engineering Award (shared with Smith and Thomas Porter) in 1998 for his achievement, program development continued to be marginalized by PARC, ultimately precipitating Shoup's departure in 1979. Belying his lack of programming and engineering experience, Taylor was noted for his strident advocacy of Licklider-inspired distributed personal computing and his ability to maintain collegial and productive relationships between what was widely perceived as the foremost array of the epoch's leading computer scientists. This was exemplified by a weekly staff meeting at PARC (colloquially known as \\"Dealer\\" after Edward O. Thorp's Beat the Dealer) in which staff members would lead a discussion about myriad topics. They would sit in a circle of beanbag chairs and open debate was encouraged. According to Kay, the meeting \\"was part of the larger ARPA community to learn how to argue to illuminate rather than merely to win. ... The main purposes of Dealer -- as invented and implemented by Bob Taylor -- were to deal with how to make things work and make progress without having a formal manager structure. The presentations and argumentation were a small part of a deal session (they did quite bother visiting Xeroids). It was quite rare for anything like a personal attack to happen (because people for the most part came into PARC having been blessed by everyone there -- another Taylor rule -- and already knowing how 'to argue reasonably').\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14111999 Throughout his tenure at PARC, Taylor frequently clashed with Elkind (who held budgetary responsibility for new projects but found his managerial authority undercut by Taylor's intimate relationships with the research staff) and Pake (who did not countenance Taylor's outsized influence in the laboratory and deprecatory attitude toward Xerox's physics research program, then directly overseen by Pake); as a result, he was not officially invited to the company's \\"Futures Day\\" demo (marking the public premiere of the Alto) in Boca Raton, Florida in 1977. However, after one of Elkind's extended absences (stemming from his ongoing involvement in other corporate and government projects), Taylor became the manager of the laboratory in early 1978. In 1983, physicist and integrated circuit specialist William J. Spencer became director of PARC. Spencer and Taylor disagreed about budget allocations for CSL (exemplified by the ongoing institutional divide between computer science and physics) and CSL's frustration with Xerox's inability to recognize and use what they had developed. By the end of the year, Taylor and most of the researchers at CSL left Xerox. A coterie of leading computer scientists (including Licklider, Donald Knuth and Dana Scott) expressed their displeasure with Xerox's decision not to retain Taylor in a letter-writing campaign to CEO David Kearns. =DEC SRC= Taylor was hired by Ken Olsen of Digital Equipment Corporation, and formed the Systems Research Center in Palo Alto. Many of the former CSL researchers came to work at SRC. Among the projects at SRC were the Modula-3 programming language; the snoopy cache, used in the Firefly multiprocessor workstation; the first multi-threaded Unix system; the first User Interface editor; the AltaVista search engineMarkoff, John, Innovator who helped create the PC, Internet and the mouse, New York Times, April 15, 2017, p.A14 and a networked Window System. Retirement and death Taylor retired from DEC in 1996. Following his divorce (coinciding with his departure from Xerox), he lived in a secluded house in Woodside, California. In 2000, he voiced two concerns about the future of the Internet: control and access. In his words: > There are many worse ways of endangering a larger number of people on the > Internet than on the highway. It's possible for people to generate networks > that reproduce themselves and are very difficult or impossible to kill off. > I want everyone to have the right to use it, but there's got to be some way > to insure responsibility. > > Will it be freely available to everyone? If not, it will be a big > disappointment. On April 13, 2017, he died at his home in Woodside, California. His son said he had suffered from Parkinson's disease and other health problems. Awards In 1984, Taylor, Butler Lampson, and Charles P. Thacker received the ACM Software Systems Award \\"for conceiving and guiding the development of the Xerox Alto System demonstrating that a distributed personal computer system can provide a desirable and practical alternative to time-sharing.\\" In 1994, all three were named ACM Fellows in recognition of the same work. In 1999, Taylor received a National Medal of Technology and Innovation. The citation read \\"For visionary leadership in the development of modern computing technology, including computer networks, the personal computer and the graphical user interface.\\" In 2004, the National Academy of Engineering awarded him along with Lampson, Thacker and Alan Kay their highest award, the Draper Prize. The citation reads: \\"for the vision, conception, and development of the first practical networked personal computers.\\" In 2013, the Computer History Museum named him a Museum Fellow, \\"for his leadership in the development of computer networking, online information and communications systems, and modern personal computing.\\" See also * Internet pioneers References Further reading  * Reprints of early papers with preface by Taylor External links * The New Old Boys From the ARPAnet Extract from 'Tools for Thought' by Howard Rheingold * 1984 ACM Software Systems Award citation * 1994 ACM Fellow citation * 2004 Draper Prize citation * 1932 births 2017 deaths American computer scientists Digital Equipment Corporation people Xerox people Internet pioneers Scientists at PARC (company) National Medal of Technology recipients Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery Draper Prize winners University of Texas at Austin alumni American naval personnel of the Korean War People from Dallas People from Woodside, California Deaths from Parkinson's disease ","title":"Robert Taylor (computer scientist)"},{"id":"1002039","text":"Music box by Polyphon-Musikwerke in Leipzig, Germany A music box Music box by Diego Evans, London, now at the Museu de la M√∫sica de Barcelona in Catalonia Interior of the music box by Diego Evans A musical box (UK usage; music box in US English) is an automatic musical instrument in a box which produces musical notes by using a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc to pluck the tuned teeth (or lamellae) of a steel comb. The earliest known mechanical musical instruments date back to 9th-century Baghdad. In Flanders, in the early 13th century, a bell ringer invented a cylinder with pins which operate cams, which then hit the bells. (See below.) The popular device best known today as a \\"music box\\" developed from musical snuff boxes of the 18th century and were originally called carillons √† musique (French for \\"chimes of music\\"). Some of the more complex boxes also contain a tiny drum and/or bells in addition to the metal comb. History Typical table music box, with six interchangeable cylinders The original snuff boxes were tiny containers which could fit into a gentleman's waistcoat pocket. The music boxes could have any size from that of a hat box to a large piece of furniture, but most were tabletop specimens. They were usually powered by clockwork and originally produced by artisan watchmakers. For most of the 19th century, the bulk of music box production was concentrated in Switzerland, building upon a strong watchmaking tradition. The first music box factory was opened there in 1815 by J√©r√©mie Recordon and Samuel Junod. There were also a few manufacturers in Bohemia and Germany. By the end of the 19th century, some of the European makers had opened factories in the United States. The cylinders were normally made of metal and powered by a spring. In some of the costlier models, the cylinders could be removed to change melodies, thanks to an invention by Paillard in 1862, which was perfected by Metert of Geneva in 1879. In some exceptional models, there were four springs, to provide continuous play for up to three hours. Music box using the metal disk system The very first boxes at the end of the 18th century made use of metal disks. The switchover to cylinders seems to have been completed after the Napoleonic wars. In the last decades of the 19th century, however, mass-produced models such as the Polyphon and others all made use of interchangeable metal disks instead of cylinders. The cylinder-based machines rapidly became a minority. Mechanical piano combined with strings. There are three violins each with only one string. Thus, only tunes that do not require the missing fourth string can be played. Orchestrion The term \\"music box\\" is also applied to clockwork devices where a removable metal disk or cylinder was used only in a \\"programming\\" function without producing the sounds directly by means of pins and a comb. Instead, the cylinder (or disk) worked by actuating bellows and levers which fed and opened pneumatic valves which activated a modified wind instrument or plucked the chords on a modified string instrument. Some devices could do both at the same time and were often combinations of player pianos and music boxes, such as the Orchestrion. There were many variations of large music machines, usually built for the affluent of the pre-phonograph 19th century. The Symphonium company started business in 1885 as the first manufacturers of disc-playing music boxes. Two of the founders of the company, Gustave Brachhausen and Paul Riessner, left to set up a new firm, Polyphon, in direct competition with their original business and their third partner, Oscar Paul Lochmann. Following the establishment of the Original Musikwerke Paul Lochmann in 1900, the founding Symphonion business continued until 1909. According to the Victoria Museums in Australia, \\"The Symphonion is notable for the enormous diversity of types, styles, and models produced... No other disc-playing musical box exists in so many varieties. The company also pioneered the use of electric motors... the first model fitted with an electric motor being advertised in 1900. The company moved into the piano-orchestrion business and made both disc-operated and barrel-playing models, player-pianos, and phonographs.\\" Meanwhile, Polyphon expanded to America, where Brachhausen established the Regina Company. Regina was a spectacular success (see Wikipedia article). It eventually reinvented itself as a maker of vacuums and steam cleaners. In the heyday of the music box, some variations were as tall as a grandfather clock and all used interchangeable large disks to play different sets of tunes. These were spring-wound and driven and both had a bell-like sound. The machines were often made in England, Italy, and the US, with additional disks made in Switzerland, Austria, and Prussia. Early \\"juke- box\\" pay versions of them existed in public places. Marsh's free Museum and curio shop in Long Beach, Washington (US) has several still-working versions of them on public display. The Musical Museum, Brentford, London has a number of machines. The Morris Museum in Morristown, New Jersey, USA has a notable collection, including interactive exhibits. In addition to video and audio footage of each piece, the actual instruments are demonstrated for the public daily on a rotational basis.morrismuseum.org At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, most music boxes were gradually replaced by player pianos, which were louder and more versatile and melodious, when kept tuned, and by the smaller gramophones which had the advantage of playing back voices. Regina produced combinations of these devices. Escalating labour costs increased the price and further reduced volume. Now modern automation is helping to bring music box prices back down. Collectors prize surviving music boxes from the 19th century and the early 20th century as well as new music boxes being made today in several countries (see \\"Evolving Box Production\\", below). Inexpensive, small windup music box movements (including the cylinder and comb and the spring) that add a bit of music to mass-produced jewellery boxes and novelty items are now produced in countries with low labour costs. Many kinds of music box movements are available to the home craft person, locally or through online retailers. A wide range of recordings and videos of historic music boxes is available on the web. =Timeline= 9th century: In Baghdad, Iraq, the Ban≈´ M≈´sƒÅ brothers, a trio of Persian inventors, produced \\"the earliest known mechanical musical instrument\\", in this case a hydropowered organ which played interchangeable cylinders automatically, which they described in their Book of Ingenious Devices. According to Charles B. Fowler, this \\"cylinder with raised pins on the surface remained the basic device to produce and reproduce music mechanically until the second half of the nineteenth century.\\". Citation on p. 45. Early 13th century: In Flanders, an ingenious bell ringer invents a cylinder with pins which operates cams, which then hit the bells. 1598: Flemish clockmaker Nicholas Vallin produces a wall-mounted clock which has a pinned barrel playing on multiple tuned bells mounted in the superstructure. The barrel can be programmed, as the pins can be separately placed in the holes provided on the surface of the barrel.In the Collections of the British Museum (M.L. Antiquities Dept. Ilbert collection) 1665: Ahasuerus Fromanteel in London makes a table clock which has quarter striking and musical work on multiple bells operated by a pinned barrel. These barrels can be changed for those playing different tunes.Horological Masterworks Exhibition AHS 2003 Catalogue No.14 1760s: Watches are made in London by makers such as James Cox which have a pinned drum playing popular tunes on several small bells arranged in a stack. 1772: A watch is made by one Ransonet at Nancy, France which has a pinned drum playing music not on bells but on tuned steel prongs arranged vertically.Sotheby's Auction Masterpieces from the Time Museum June 19, 2002 Lot 73 1780: The mechanical singing bird is invented by the Jaquet-Droz brothers, clockmakers from La Chaux-de-Fonds. In 1848, the manufacturing of the singing birds is improved by Blaise Bontems in his Parisian workshop, to the point where it has remained unchanged to this day. Barrel organs become more popular. 1796: Antoine Favre-Salomon, a clockmaker from Geneva replaces the stack of bells by a comb with multiple pre-tuned metallic notes in order to reduce space. Together with a horizontally placed pinned barrel, this produces more varied and complex sounds. One of these first music boxes is now displayed at the Shanghai Gallery of Antique Music Boxes and Automata in Pudong's Oriental Art Center.en.shoac.com.cn, \\"Antique Music Box Gallery\\", accessed 18 Dec 2014. Numerous musical objects are produced in greater quantities in Geneva by several makers. 1800: Isaac Daniel Piguet in Geneva produces repeating musical watches with a pinned horizontal disc operating radially arranged tuned steel teeth. 1811: The first music boxes are produced in Sainte-Croix; an industry which surpasses the watchmaking and lace industries, and rapidly brings renown to the town. At this time, the musical-box industry represents 10% of Switzerland's export. Pocket watch with musical movements 1865: Charles Reuge, a watchmaker from the Val-de-Travers, settles in Sainte-Croix. He is one of many artisans making pocket watches with musical movements of the traditional calibre. 1870: A German inventor creates a music box with discs, therefore allowing an easier and more frequent change of tunes. It is also the golden years of automata. Already known in Egypt, they will be improved to become real works of art. 1877: Thomas Edison invents the phonograph, which has important consequences for the musical-box industry, especially around the end of the century. 1892: Gustave Brachhausen, who had been involved with the manufacturer of Polyphon disk music boxes in Germany, sails for America to establish the Regina Music Box Company in New Jersey. Regina, whose boxes are renowned among collectors for their tone, becomes a success and some 100,000 are sold before sales cease in 1921. Early 20th century: The invention of the phonograph, the First World War and the economic crisis in the '20s bring down Sainte-Croix's main industry and make the luxury music box completely disappear. Music box with dancing ballerina Between the two world wars most of the Swiss companies converted to the manufacture of other products requiring precise mechanical parts. Some went back to making watches, others were eventually responsible for the famous Bolex movie cameras and the Hermes typewriters. Some simply sold out to Reuge. Located near Lake Neuch√¢tel, Reuge is one of the last of the Swiss survivors making music boxes of all sizes and shapes, with or without automatons in a modern style with clear acrylic sides to see the mechanical operation. They have in a sense branched out widely from their original cylinder offerings since they also offered traditional-looking music boxes with removable metal disks for around 1,000 euros, with each disk costing in the neighborhood of 14 euros. The higher range boxes with removable cylinders and small assorted tables made of fine woods can cost up to 34,000 euros and about an equivalent number of US dollars. They also sell several models of clear acrylic paperweights with a music box movement inside, for a minimum of about 250 euros. They have, however, discontinued the smaller movements. Old Reuge music boxes are worth thousands of dollars but even so, cannot be compared to the fabulously large and highly complex music boxes which were produced in nineteenth-century Switzerland by legendary makers such as Nicole Fr√®res or Paillard. Since approximatively 2007 Reuge developed a strong business in the world of \\"bespoke\\" customized pieces for leaders in business and politics. Nidec Sankyo in Japan started up in the aftermath of World War II, using the latest in automation. Modern production methods resulted in reasonable prices, producing company growth. Sankyo started with small movements, introduced 50-note movements by the late 1970s, and in 2006 is producing disc boxes playing discs as large as 16\\" (with two 80-note combs and reminiscent of the \\"Mira\\") and are also working on a dual-cylinder 100-note movement. Sankyo now offers a wide variety of music boxes in Japan, and supplies movements to many other manufacturers and distributors. Some of these sell them retail (even online) to hobbyists for as low as 3 euros each. Sankyo Seiki bills itself as the biggest manufacturer of music boxes in the world and advertises that it controls 50% of the market. Recently, it has started selling licences for its musical-box tunes to cellular phone companies, for use as ring tones. The company is an industrial concern which also makes magnetic and hologram card readers, appliance components, industrial robots and miniature motors of all kinds. The Porter Music Box company of Vermont produces steel disc music boxes in several formats. They offer clockwork, spring-wound models as well as electric ones. They stand out by their continuing production of discs, with a selection of about a thousand tunes. The discs can also be played on many antique music boxes bearing the Polyphon and Regina brand names. The small 18-note musical movements are now being made almost exclusively in countries with low labour costs such as China and Taiwan. Many of these productions are used in mobiles, children's musical toys, and jewellery boxes. In March 2016, the band Wintergatan released a video of their homemade Marble Machine which took 14 months to make and played in any key using a 3,000-piece wooden construction fueled by 2,000 marbles. Band member Martin Molin used a hand crank to mobilize the marbles, which then created various noises on a vibraphone and other installed musical elements.\\"Wintergatan Marble Machine ‚Äì A Feat of Both Music and Engineering\\", indiebandguru.com, Retrieved March 3, 2016 In 2019, Tevofy Technology Ltd., based in Taiwan, released the first app-controlled mechanical music box called Muro Box, which stands for Music Robot in a Box. Unlike traditional music box, people do not need to punch holes to compose songs on a paper-strip music box. Also, there is no minimum order for making customized music box movement to play a selected song. Muro Box gives more freedom in composing songs and choosing songs to play on a music box.Muro Box Story. Muro Box, 26 June 2019, https://murobox.com/en/story/index.html. Muro Box, the first app-controlled music box. Coin-operated models In Switzerland, coin-operated music boxes, usually capable of playing several tunes, were installed in places such as train stations and amusement parks. Some of the models had a mechanism for automatically changing the metal disks. These were, in a sense, the precursors to jukebox. However, they soon disappeared from their intended venues and were displaced by the jukebox, which could produce a greater variety of sounds and full songs rather than warped fragments. Because most of the coin-operated music boxes were built for rough treatment (such as slapping and kicking by a customer), many of these large models have survived into the 21st century, despite their relatively low production quantities. They are sought by collectors who have the space for their large or very large cabinets. Parts The ratchet lever [1] rotates the cylinder [2], the pins pluck the comb teeth [3] which produces the music. The whole thing rests on the bedplate [4]. Small fifty-tone musical box with detachable handle, possibly circa 1900 Explainer video *The bedplate is the relatively heavy metal foundation on which all the other pieces are fastened, usually by screws. *The ratchet lever or the windup key is used to put the spring motor under tension, which is to wind it up. *The spring motor or motors (two or more can be used to make playing times longer) give anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more of playing time. *The comb is a flat piece of metal with dozens or even hundreds of tuned teeth, or 'reeds', of different lengths. *The cylinder is the programming object, a metallic version of a punched card which instead of having holes to express a program, is studded with tiny pins at the correct spacing to produce music by displacing the teeth of the comb at the correct time. The tines of the comb 'ring', or sound, as they slip off the pins. The disc in a disc music box plays this function, with pins perpendicular to the plane surface. *Multiple-tune cylinders have more than one set of pins intertwined on the same cylinder, with, for example, the B pins for a second song lying halfway between the B and C pins of the first song, etc. Offsetting the cylinder slightly relative to the comb brings the different set of pins into contact with the teeth, thereby playing an alternate piece of music. Many modern music boxes will have as many as four sets of pins intertwined, with a mechanism automatically shifting the cylinder from one song or movement to the next.

Her most recognized achievement is her translation of and commentary on Isaac Newton's 1687 book Principia containing basic laws of physics. The translation, published posthumously in 1756, is still considered the standard French translation today. Her commentary includes a profound contribution to Newtonian mechanics‚Äîthe postulate of an additional conservation law for total energy, of which kinetic energy of motion is one element. This led to her conceptualization of energy as such, and to derive its quantitative relationships to the mass and velocity of an object. Her philosophical magnum opus, Institutions de Physique (Paris, 1740, first edition), or Foundations of Physics, circulated widely, generated heated debates, and was republished and translated into several other languages within two years of its original publication. She participated in the famous vis viva debate, concerning the best way to measure the force of a body and the best means of thinking about conservation principles. Posthumously, her ideas were heavily represented in the most famous text of the French Enlightenment, the Encyclop√©die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, first published shortly after du Ch√¢telet's death. Numerous biographies, books and plays have been written about her life and work in the two centuries since her death. In the early 21st century, her life and ideas have generated renewed interest.  Contribution to philosophy  In addition to producing famous translations of works by authors such as Bernard Mandeville and Isaac Newton, Du Ch√¢telet wrote a number of significant philosophical essays, letters and books that were well known in her time. Because of her well-known collaboration and romantic involvement with Voltaire, which spanned much of her adult life, for generations Du Ch√¢telet has been known as mistress and collaborator to her much better known intellectual companion. Her accomplishments and achievements have often been subsumed under his, and as a result, even today she is often mentioned only within the context of Voltaire's life and work during the period of the early French Enlightenment. The ideals of her works spread from the ideals of individual empowerment to issues of the social contract. Recently, however, professional philosophers and historians have transformed the reception of Du Ch√¢telet. Historical evidence indicates that Du Ch√¢telet's work had a very significant influence on the philosophical and scientific conversations of the 1730s and 1740s ‚Äì in fact, she was famous and respected by the greatest thinkers of her time. Du Ch√¢telet corresponded with renowned mathematicians such as Johann II Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler, early developers of calculus. She was also tutored by Bernoulli's prodigy students, Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis and Alexis Claude Clairaut. Frederick the Great of Prussia, who re-founded the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, was her great admirer, and corresponded with both Voltaire and Du Ch√¢telet regularly. He introduced Du Ch√¢telet to Leibniz's philosophy by sending her the works of Christian Wolff, and Du Ch√¢telet sent him a copy of her Institutions. Her works were published and republished in Paris, London, and Amsterdam; they were translated into German and Italian; and, they were discussed in the most important scholarly journals of the era, including the Memoires des Tr√©voux, the Journal des S√ßavans, the G√∂ttingische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen, and others. Perhaps most intriguingly, many of her ideas were represented in various sections of the Encyclop√©die of Diderot and D'Alembert, and some of the articles in the Encyclop√©die are a direct copy of her work (this is an active area of current academic research - the latest research can be found at Project Vox, a Duke University research initiative). Biography =Early life= √âmilie du Ch√¢telet was born on 17 December 1706 in Paris, the only girl amongst six children. Three brothers lived to adulthood: Ren√©-Alexandre (b. 1698), Charles-Auguste (b. 1701), and Elisabeth- Th√©odore (b. 1710). Her eldest brother, Ren√©-Alexandre, died in 1720, and the next brother, Charles-Auguste, died in 1731. However, her younger brother, Elisabeth-Th√©odore, lived to a successful old age, becoming an abb√© and eventually a bishop. Two other brothers died very young.Zinsser, pp. 19, 21, 22. Du Ch√¢telet also had an illegitimate half-sister, Michelle, who was born of her father and Anne Bellinzani, an intelligent woman who was interested in astronomy and married to an important Parisian official.Zinsser, pp. 16‚Äì17; for a quite different account, see Bodanis, pp. 131‚Äì134. Her father was Louis Nicolas le Tonnelier de Breteuil, a member of the lesser nobility. At the time of Du Ch√¢telet's birth, her father held the position of the Principal Secretary and Introducer of Ambassadors to King Louis XIV. He held a weekly salon on Thursdays, to which well-respected writers and scientists were invited. Her mother was Gabrielle Anne de Froullay, Baronne de Breteuil. =Early education= Du Ch√¢telet's education has been the subject of much speculation, but nothing is known with certainty.Zinsser. Among their acquaintances was Fontenelle, the perpetual secretary of the French Acad√©mie des Sciences. Du Ch√¢telet's father Louis-Nicolas, recognizing her early brilliance, arranged for Fontenelle to visit and talk about astronomy with her when she was 10 years old. Du Ch√¢telet's mother, Gabrielle-Anne de Froulay, was brought up in a convent, at the time the predominant educational institution available to French girls and women. While some sources believe her mother did not approve of her intelligent daughter, or of her husband's encouragement of √âmilie's intellectual curiosity, there are also other indications that her mother not only approved of Du Ch√¢telet's early education, but actually encouraged her to vigorously question stated fact.Zinsser (2006: 26‚Äì29) In either case, such encouragement would have been seen as unusual for parents of their time and status. When she was small, her father arranged training for her in physical activities such as fencing and riding, and as she grew older, he brought tutors to the house for her. As a result, by the age of twelve she was fluent in Latin, Italian, Greek and German; she was later to publish translations into French of Greek and Latin plays and philosophy. She received education in mathematics, literature, and science. Du Ch√¢telet also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the harpsichord, sang opera, and was an amateur actress. As a teenager, short of money for books, she used her mathematical skills to devise highly successful strategies for gambling. =Marriage= On 12 June 1725, she married the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont.Hamel (1910: 5).The Lomont suffix indicates the branch of the du Chastellet family; another such branch was the du Chastellet-Clemont. Her marriage conferred the title of Marquise du Chastellet.The spelling Ch√¢telet (replacing the s by a circumflex over the a) was introduced by Voltaire, and has now become standard. () Like many marriages among the nobility, theirs was arranged. As a wedding gift, the husband was made governor of Semur-en-Auxois in Burgundy by his father; the recently married couple moved there at the end of September 1725. Du Ch√¢telet was eighteen at the time, her husband thirty-four. =Children= The Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet and √âmilie du Ch√¢telet had three children: Fran√ßoise Gabriel Pauline (born 30 June 1726), Louis Marie Florent (born 20 November 1727), and Victor-Esprit (born 11 April 1733).Zinsser, pp. 39 and 58. Victor-Esprit died as an infant in late summer 1734, likely the last Sunday in August.Zinsser, pp. 40 and 93. On 4 September 1749 √âmilie du Ch√¢telet gave birth to Stanislas-Ad√©la√Øde du Ch√¢telet (daughter of Jean Fran√ßois de Saint- Lambert). She died as an infant in Lun√©ville on 6 May 1751.D. W. Smith, \\"Nouveaux regards sur la br√®ve rencontre entre Mme Du Ch√¢telet et Saint- Lambert.\\" In The Enterprise of Enlightenment. A Tribute to David Williams from his friends. Ed. Terry Pratt and David McCallam. Oxford, Berne, etc.: Peter Lang, 2004, p. 329-343. See also Anne Soprani, ed., Mme Du Ch√¢telet, Lettres d'amour au marquis de Saint-Lambert, Paris, 1997. =Resumption of studies= In 1733, aged 26, Du Ch√¢telet resumed her mathematical studies. Initially, she was tutored in algebra and calculus by Moreau de Maupertuis, a member of the Academy of Sciences; although mathematics was not his forte, he had received a solid education from Johann Bernoulli, who also taught Leonhard Euler. However by 1735 Du Ch√¢telet had turned for her mathematical training to Alexis Clairaut, a mathematical prodigy known best for Clairaut's equation and Clairaut's theorem. Du Ch√¢telet resourcefully sought some of France's best tutors and scholars to mentor her in mathematics. On one occasion at the Caf√© Gradot, a place where men frequently gathered for intellectual discussion, she was politely ejected when she attempted to join one of her teachers. Undeterred, she simply had some men's clothing made for herself and strolled back in. =Relationship with Voltaire= In the frontispiece to Voltaire's book on Newton's philosophy, du Ch√¢telet appears as Voltaire's muse, reflecting Newton's heavenly insights down to Voltaire. Du Ch√¢telet may have met Voltaire in her childhood at one of her father's salons; Voltaire himself dates their meeting to 1729, when he returned from his exile in London. However, their friendship developed from May 1733 when she re-entered society after the birth of her third child. Du Ch√¢telet invited Voltaire to live at her country house at Cirey in Haute-Marne, northeastern France, and he became her long-time companion. There she studied physics and mathematics and published scientific articles and translations. To judge from Voltaire's letters to friends and their commentaries on each other's work, they lived together with great mutual liking and respect. As a literary rather than scientific person, Voltaire implicitly acknowledged her contributions to his 1738 Elements of the Philosophy of Newton, where the chapters on optics show strong similarities with her own Essai sur l'optique. She was able to contribute further to the campaign by a laudatory review in the Journal des savants. Sharing a passion for science, Voltaire and Du Ch√¢telet collaborated scientifically. They set up a laboratory in Du Ch√¢telet's home. In a healthy competition, they both entered the 1738 Paris Academy prize contest on the nature of fire, since Du Ch√¢telet disagreed with Voltaire's essay. Although neither of them won, both essays received honourable mention and were published. She thus became the first woman to have a scientific paper published by the Academy. Social life after living with Voltaire The chateau of Cirey Du Ch√¢telet's relationship with Voltaire caused her to give up most of her social life to become more involved with her study in mathematics with the teacher of Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis. He introduced the ideas of Isaac Newton to her. Letters written by Du Ch√¢telet explain how she felt during the transition from Parisian socialite to rural scholar, from \\"one life to the next.\\" =Final pregnancy and death= The chateau of Lun√©ville In May 1748, Du Ch√¢telet began an affair with the poet Jean Fran√ßois de Saint-Lambert and became pregnant. In a letter to a friend she confided her fears that she would not survive her pregnancy. On the night of 4 September 1749 she gave birth to a daughter, Stanislas-Ad√©la√Øde. Du Ch√¢telet died on 10 September 1749, at Lun√©ville, from a pulmonary embolism. She was 42. Her daughter died 20 months later.Zinsser (2006: 278) Scientific research and publications =Criticizing Locke and the debate on thinking matter= In her writing, Du Ch√¢telet criticizes John Locke's philosophy. She emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience: \\"Locke's idea of the possibility of thinking matter is [‚Ä¶] abstruse.\\"quoted in Ruth Hagengruber, \\"Emilie du Ch√¢telet Between Leibniz and Newton: The Transformation of Metaphysics\\", in Emilie du Ch√¢telet between Leibniz and Newton (ed. Ruth Hagengruber), Springer. p. 12 Her critique on Locke originates in her Bernard de Mandeville commentary [on the Fable of the Bees]. She confronts us with her resolute statement in favor of universal principles which precondition human knowledge and action, and maintains that this kind of law is innate. [‚Ä¶] Du Ch√¢telet claims the necessity of a universal presupposition, because if there is no such beginning, all our knowledge is relative. In that way, Du Ch√¢telet rejects John Locke's aversion of innate ideas and prior principles. She also reverses Locke's negation of the principle of contradiction, which would constitute the basis of her methodic reflections in the Institutions. On the contrary, she affirms her arguments in favor of the necessity of prior and universal principles. \\"Two and two could then make as well 4 as 6 if prior principles did not exist.\\" Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis' and Julien Offray de La Mettrie's reference to Du Ch√¢telet's deliberations on motion and free will, on thinking matter and numbers and on the way to do metaphysics indicate the importance of her reflections. She rebuts the claim to finding truth by using mathematical laws, [‚Ä¶] and argues against Maupertuis.Hagengruber (2011: 8‚Äì12,24,53,54) =Warmth and brightness= Dissertation Sur La Nature et La Propagation du feu, 1744 In 1737 Ch√¢telet published a paper entitled Dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu, based upon her research into the science of fire, that predicted what is today known as infrared radiation and the nature of light. =Institutions de Physique= Her book Institutions de Physique (\\"Lessons in Physics\\") was published in 1740; it was presented as a review of new ideas in science and philosophy to be studied by her 13 year old son, but it incorporated and sought to reconcile complex ideas from the leading thinkers of the time. The book and subsequent debate contributed to her becoming a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in 1746. =Forces Vives= R√©ponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet, 1741 In 1741 du Ch√¢telet published a book titled R√©ponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet, a la lettre que M. de Mairan. Dortous de Mairan, secretary of the Academy of Sciences, had published a set of arguments addressed to her regarding the appropriate mathematical expression for forces vives. Du Ch√¢telet presented a spirited point by point rebuttal of de Mairan's arguments, causing him to withdraw from the controversy. Immanuel Kant's first publication in 1747 'Gedanken zur wahren Sch√§tzung der lebendigen Kr√§fte' focuses on Du Ch√¢telet's pamphlet against the secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, Mairan. Kant's opponent, Johann Augustus Eberhard accused Kant of taking ideas from Du Ch√¢telet.Ruth Hagengruber: \\"√âmilie du Ch√¢telet between Leibniz and Newton: The Transformation of Metaphysics\\", in: Hagengruber, Ruth 2011: √âmilie du Ch√¢telet between Leibniz and Newton, Springer 1-59, p. 1 and 23, footnote 4 and 113. =Advocacy of kinetic energy= Although in the early 18th century the concepts of force and momentum had been long understood, the idea of energy as transferable between different systems was still in its infancy, and would not be fully resolved until the 19th Century. It is now accepted that the total mechanical momentum of a system is conserved and none is lost to friction. Simply put, there is no 'momentum friction' and momentum can not transfer between different forms, and particularly there is no potential momentum. Emmy Noether later proved this to be true for all problems where the initial state is symmetric in generalized coordinates. Mechanical energy, kinetic and potential, may be lost to another form, but the total is conserved in time. The Du Ch√¢telet contribution was the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. In doing so, she became the first person in history to elucidate the concept of energy as such, and to quantify its relationship to mass and velocity based on her own empirical studies. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by Willem 's Gravesande in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from, equal to the initial potential energy. With the exception of Leibniz, earlier workers like Newton believed that \\"energy\\" was indistinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped. In classical physics the correct formula is E = \\\\frac{1}{2} mv^2, where E is the kinetic energy of an object, m its mass and v its speed. Energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat . . .). Newton's work assumed the exact conservation of only mechanical momentum. A broad range of mechanical problems are soluble only if energy conservation is included. The collision and scattering of two point masses is one of them. Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange established a more formal framework for mechanics using the results of du Ch√¢telet.Hagengruber (2011)Arianrhod (2012) =Translation and commentary on Newton's Principia= In 1749, the year of Du Ch√¢telet's death, she completed the work regarded as her outstanding achievement: her translation into French, with her commentary, of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (often referred to as simply the Principia), including her derivation of the notion of conservation of energy from its principles of mechanics. Published ten years after her death, today Du Ch√¢telet's translation of the Principia is still the standard translation of the work into French. Her translation and commentary of the Principia contributed to the completion of the scientific revolution in France and to its acceptance in Europe. Other contributions =Development of financial derivatives= She lost the considerable sum for the time of 84,000 francs‚Äîsome of it borrowed‚Äîin one evening at the table at the Court of Fontainebleau, to card cheats.Bodanis.Hamel (1910: 286) To raise the money to pay back her debts she devised an ingenious financing arrangement similar to modern derivatives, whereby she paid tax collectors a fairly low sum for the right to their future earnings (they were allowed to keep a portion of the taxes they collected for the King), and promised to pay the court gamblers part of these future earnings. =Biblical scholarship= Du Ch√¢telet wrote a critical analysis of the entire Bible. A synthesis of her remarks on the book of Genesis was published in English in 1967 by Ira O. Wade of Princeton in his book Voltaire and Madame du Ch√¢telet: An Essay on Intellectual Activity at Cirey and a book of her complete notes was published in 2011, in the original French, edited and annotated by Bertram Eugene Schwarzbach. =Discourse on happiness= Du Ch√¢telet wrote a monograph, Discours sur le bonheur, on the nature of happiness both in general and specialised to women. =Translation of the Fable of the Bees, and other works= Du Ch√¢telet translated The Fable of the Bees in a free adaptation. She also wrote works on optics, rational linguistics, and the nature of free will. =Support of women's education= In her first independent work, the preface to her translation of the Fable of the Bees, du Ch√¢telet argues strongly for women's education, particularly a strong secondary education as was available for young men in the French coll√®ges. By denying women a good education, she argues, society prevents women from becoming eminent in the arts and sciences.Zinsser, pp. 25‚Äì26. Legacy Portrait by Marianne Loir. Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux Du Ch√¢telet made a crucial scientific contribution in making Newton's historic work more accessible in a timely, accurate and insightful French translation, augmented by her own original concept of energy conservation. A main-belt minor planet and a crater on Venus have been named in her honor, and she is the subject of three plays: Legacy of Light by Karen Zacar√≠as; √âmilie: La Marquise Du Ch√¢telet Defends Her Life Tonight by Lauren Gunderson and Urania: the Life of √âmilie du Ch√¢telet by Jyl Bonaguro.Urania, Historical Play by Local Artist, Debuts with Free Gallery Shows The opera √âmilie of Kaija Saariaho is about the last moments of her life.Libretto of √âmilie Du Ch√¢telet is often represented in portraits with mathematical iconography, such as holding a pair of dividers or a page of geometrical calculations. In the early nineteenth century, a French pamphlet of celebrated women (Femmes c√©l√®bres) introduced a possibly apocryphal story of Du Ch√¢telet's childhood.Zinsser, p. 13.

The Seal of Solomon (or Ring of Solomon; ') is the signet ring attributed to King Solomon in medieval Jewish tradition and in Islamic and Western occultism. It was often depicted in either a pentagram or hexagram shape; the latter also known as the Star of David in Jewish tradition. This ring variously gave Solomon the power to command demons, jinn (genies) and spirits, or to speak with animals. Due to the proverbial wisdom of Solomon, his signet ring, or its supposed design, it came to be seen as an amulet or talisman, or a symbol or character in medieval and Renaissance-era magic, occultism, and alchemy. The legend of the Seal of Solomon was developed primarily by medieval Arabic writers, who related that the ring was engraved by God and was given to the king directly from heaven. The ring was made from brass and iron, and the two parts were used to seal written commands to good and evil spirits, respectively. In one tale, a demon‚Äîeither Asmodeus or Sakhr‚Äîobtained possession of the ring and ruled in Solomon's stead for forty days. In a variant of the tale of the ring of Polycrates from Herodotus, the demon eventually threw the ring into the sea, where it was swallowed by a fish, caught by a fisherman, and served to Solomon.\\"Solomon\\" , Jewish Encyclopedia: \\"Solomon is represented as having authority over spirits, animals, wind, and water, all of which obeyed his orders by virtue of a magic ring set with the four jewels given him by the angels that had power over these four realms. [...] It was Solomon's custom to take off the ring when he was about to wash, and to give it to one of his wives, Amina, to hold. On one occasion, when the ring was in Amina's keeping, the rebellious spirit Sakhr took on Solomon's form and obtained the ring. He then seated himself on the throne and ruled for forty days, during which time the real king wandered about the country, poor and forlorn. On the fortieth day, Sakhr dropped the ring into the sea; there it was swallowed by a fish, which was caught by a poor fisherman and given to Solomon for his supper. Solomon cut open the fish, found the ring, and returned to power. His forty days' exile had been sent in punishment for the idolatry practiced in his house for forty days, although unknown to him, by one of his wives\\" Bai·∏çawi, ii. 187; ·π¨abri, \\"Annales,\\" ed. De Goeje, i. 592 et seq.).\\" In Islamic eschatology, the Beast of the Earth is equipped with both the Staff of Moses and the Seal of Solomon and uses the latter to stamp the nose of the unbelievers.Sean Anthony, The Caliph and the Heretic: Ibn Saba' and the Origins of Shi\`ism, 2011, p. 220. The date of origin legends surrounding the Seal of Solomon is difficult to establish. It is known that a legend of a magic ring with which the possessor could command demons was already current in the 1st century (Josephus 8.2 telling of one Eleazar who used such a ring in the presence of Vespasian), but the association of the name of Solomon with such a ring is medieval notwithstanding the 2nd century apocryphal text the Testament of Solomon. The Tractate Gittin (fol. 68) of the Talmud has a story involving Solomon, Asmodeus, and a ring with the divine name engraved. The story involves Solomon giving a ring and a chain to one Benaiahu son of Jehoiada to catch the demon Ashmedai, using the demon's help to build the temple; Ashmedai later tricks Solomon into giving him the ring and swallows it. \\"Solomon thereupon sent thither Benaiahu son of Jehoiada, giving him a chain on which was graven the [Divine] Name and a ring on which was graven the Name and fleeces of wool and bottles of wine. Benaiahu went and dug a pit lower down the hill and let the water flow into it13 and stopped [the hollow] With the fleeces of wool, and he then dug a pit higher up and poured the wine into it14 and then filled up the pits. He then went and sat on a tree. When Ashmedai came he examined the seal, then opened the pit and found it full of wine. He said, it is written, Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, and whosoever erreth thereby is not wise,15 and it is also written, Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.16 I will not drink it. Growing thirsty, however, he could not resist, and he drank till he became drunk, and fell asleep. Benaiahu then came down and threw the chain over him and fastened it. When he awoke he began to struggle, whereupon he [Benaiahu] said, The Name of thy Master is upon thee, the Name of thy Master is upon thee. [...] Solomon kept him [Ashmedai] with him until he had built the Temple. One day when he was alone with him, he said, it is written, He hath as it were to'afoth and re'em [\\"the strength of a wild ox\\"], and we explain that to'afoth means the ministering angels and re'em means the demons. What is your superiority over us? He said to him, Take the chain off me and give me your ring, and I will show you. So he took the chain off him and gave him the ring. He then swallowed him, [viz. \\"it\\", the ring] and placing one wing on the earth and one on the sky he hurled him four hundred parasangs. In reference to that incident, Solomon said, What profit is there to a man in all his labor wherein he laboureth under the sun.\\" trans. M. Simon. The specification of the design of the seal as a [hexagram] seems to arise from a medieval Arab tradition. The name \\"Solomon's seal\\" was given to the hexagram engraved on the bottom of drinking-cups in Arab tradition. In the Arabian Nights (chapter 20), Sindbad presented Harun al-Rashid with such a cup, on which the \\"Table of Solomon\\" was engraved.Lane, \\"Arabian Nights\\" (1859; 1883), note 93 to chapter 20. Hexagrams feature prominently in Jewish esoteric literature from the early medieval period, and some authors have hypothesized that the tradition of Solomon's Seal may possibly predate Islam and date to early Rabbinical esoteric tradition, or to early alchemy in Hellenistic Judaism in 3rd-century Egypt, but there is no positive evidence for this, and most scholars assume that the symbol entered the Kabbalistic tradition of medieval Spain from Arabic literature.Leonora Leet, \\"The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science\\" in, The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah, 1999, 212-217. The representation as a pentagram, by contrast, seems to arise in the Western tradition of Renaissance magic (which was in turn strongly influenced by medieval Arab and Jewish occultism); White Kennett (1660‚Äì1728) makes reference to a \\"pentangle of Solomon\\" with the power of exorcising demons.\\"Solomon, Seal of\\", Jewish Encyclopedia The hexagram or \\"Star of David\\", which became a symbol of Judaism in the modern period and was placed on the flag of Israel in 1948, has its origins in 14th-century depictions of the Seal of Solomon. In 1354, King of Bohemia Charles IV prescribed for the Jews of Prague a red flag with both David's shield and Solomon's seal, while the red flag with which the Jews met King Matthias of Hungary in the 15th century showed two pentagrams with two golden stars.Schwandtner, Scriptores Rerum Hungaricarum, ii. 148. Facsimile in M. Friedmann, Seder Eliyahu Rabbah ve-Seder Eliyahu Zt·π≠a, Vienna, 1901 Peter de Abano's Heptameron (1496) makes reference to the \\"Pentacle of Solomon\\" (actually a hexagram is drawn on the floor in which the magician has to stand) to invoke various demons.Per vocationem ad pentacle Salomonis et hoc responsum mihi dare ; Heptameron, ed.

Lippmann Moses B√ºschenthal (d. 1818) wrote a tragedy with the title Der Siegelring Salomonis (\\"the signet-ring of Solomon\\"). An \\"Order of the Seal of Solomon\\" was established in 1874 in Ethiopia, where the ruling house claimed descent from Solomon. What distinguishes a Seal of Solomon from a Star of David is the two triangles are interlaced giving the appearance of a 3-dimensional figure. This was said in the Testament of Solomon to make demons confused and dizzy, unable to do Solomon any harm.

Murakami defines Superflat in broad terms, so the subject matter is very diverse. Some works explore the consumerism and sexual fetishism that is prevalent in post-war Japanese culture. This often includes lolicon art, which is parodied by works such as those by Henmaru Machino. These works are an exploration of otaku sexuality through grotesque and/or distorted images. Other works are more concerned with a fear of growing up. For example, Yoshitomo Nara's work often features playful graffiti on old Japanese ukiyo-e executed in a childish manner. And some works focus on the structure and underlying desires that comprise otaku and overall post-war Japanese culture. Murakami is influenced by directors such as Hideaki Anno.Frenchy Lunning, Emerging Worlds of Anime and Manga, University of Minnesota Press, 2006, p. 133. .

Biography Morat√≠n was born in Madrid the son of Nicol√°s Fern√°ndez de Morat√≠n, a major literary reformer in Spain from 1762 until his death in 1828. Distrusting the teaching offered in Spain's universities at the time, Leandro grew up in the rich literary environment of his father and became an admirer of Enlightenment thought. In addition to translating works of Moli√®re and William Shakespeare into Spanish, he himself was a major poet, dramatist and man of letters whose writings promoted the reformist ideas associated with the Spanish Enlightenment. Early in his career, he was supported by statesman and author Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, who, in 1787, arranged for him to study for a year in Paris. In 1792, the Spanish government provided the funds for him to travel to England in order to extend his education. In 1790 he published his first comedy El viejo y la ni√±a (The Old Man and the Young Girl), a sombre work which attacked the consequences of arranged marriages between people of differing ages. Two years later, in 1792, he wrote the play La comedia nueva (The New Comedy), a dramatic attack on the extravagant plots used by other contemporary playwrights. A supporter of Joseph Bonaparte, whose rule had allowed far more expression of liberal thinking than Spain's Bourbon monarch Carlos IV was willing to tolerate, Morat√≠n was given the post of royal librarian. However, his 1805 comedy El s√≠ de las ni√±as (The Maidens' Consent) was denounced upon the reinstatement of the Inquisition when Ferdinand VII regained the throne after the fall of the Bonapartes, and he had to abandon playwriting and was forced into exile in France.

It is part of the Metropolitan Region of S√£o Paulo. The population is 392,294 (2015 est.) in an area of .Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in the state of S√£o Paulo.  History  Before the first white man arrived, the region which today is Carapicu√≠ba was inhabited by indigenous people. The hamlet was founded by Jos√© de Anchieta. Afonso Sardinha settled there with his farm with the will to use the indigenous people as a workforce. He then built a chapel. The indigenous people soon reacted to the European occupation, and rushed into the jungle. By the 17th century, it was part of the recently created municipality of Santana do Parna√≠ba. Nothing much has changed in the hamlet during this century and the most of the 18th one. From 1770 on, however, the city and its surroundings started to change noticeably, as new villages were settled, like Embu and Cotia. Houses were built around the main chapel, in which several \\"entrepreneur\\" (actually, people who arranged the parties with folklore- related themes) lived. Until the Sorocabana Railway was implemented, in 1870, little was developed in the village. However, when a station was opened near the section of the tracks that run through the city, many people started to live in the city. During the first half of the 20th century, agriculture started to play a role in the economy of the village, because of the climate and quality of the land. A bus line starting in Barueri, running through Carapicu√≠ba, Osasco and ending in Pinheiros was created to take people to S√£o Paulo in alternate itineraries. In 1948, Carapicu√≠ba became a district of Cotia, when it became independent from S√£o Paulo. A year later, it became part of Barueri, also as a district. In 1952 the Parish Nossa Senhora Aparecida was built, and is now known as \\"Igreja Amarela\\" (Yellow Church), and the city population kept on increasing. The post-war times saw the vertiginous decrease of the prospecting in Minas Gerais, which led a large number of people to go to S√£o Paulo state, a number of them settling in the city. In the early 1960s, a movement in favor of the independence of Carapicu√≠ba was led by the mayor of Barueri, Carlos Capriotti, and the district earned its city status in March 1965 In 2007-2008, the city gained national attention due to the Paturis Park murders. = Origin of the name = According to Professor Eduardo de Almeida Navarro, titular professor at the Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ci√™ncias Humanas of University of S√£o Paulo, the name has a controversial origin and may come from the Tupi language or Lingua Geral of S√£o Paulo and may have different significations: * \\"peziza (a fungus that is) inappropriate (to be eaten)\\" (karapuku, peziza + a√≠b, inappropriate + a, suffix) * \\"carapicus (a fish) rotten (inappropriate to be eaten)\\" (akar√°, acar√° + puku, long + a√≠b, rotten + a, suffix) * \\"carapicu tree (a kind of shrub)\\" (carapicu, carapicu + ' yba, tree) Some people say that it may also come from Quar-I-Picui-Bae, name given by Indians to a small river delimiting a border between the city with Osasco and Cotia.  Geography  The border with Barueri is a large plain formed by the side of the Rio Tiet√™. The exploration of sand in the area was so intensive that a large crater was formed. However, during the 1960s, the government of S√£o Paulo state started a series of works to alter the route of the river, and the destruction of the wall between the river and the crater led to the flooding of it. Now, the place has become an artificial lake called \\"Lagoa de Carapicu√≠ba\\" (Carapicu√≠ba Lake). 8 thousand litres of sewage from the central, western and southern portions of the city of S√£o Paulo pass through the lake towards Barueri. The average altitude is 717 meters and the climate is in general a humid subtropical climate.  Economy  As of 2005, the city has a GDP of R$1,915,285,000.00 and a GDP per capita of R$5,004IBGE ‚Äì GDP and GDP per capita of the municipalities (2002‚Äì2005)  Transportation  Carapicu√≠ba Bus Terminal under construction as of October 2018. The city is served by the Line 8 of S√£o Paulo commuter rail, having two stations within the area of the municipality and a third one just after the border with Osasco. Three Bus services serve the city: ETT Carapicu√≠ba and Via√ß√£o Del Rey, with municipal and inter municipal lines, and Via√ß√£o Osasco, with intermunicipal lines only. = Highways = There are no highways crossing Carapicu√≠ba, though the Rodoanel M√°rio Covas marks most of the border with Osasco and provides some accesses to the city, as well as serving as the main connection to the other highways and the city of S√£o Paulo itself.

An English translation by Philip Gabriel was then published in 2001. Plot summary Sumire is an aspiring writer who survives on a family stipend and the creative input of her only friend, the novel's male narrator and protagonist, known in the text only as 'K'. K is an elementary school teacher, 25 years old, and in love with Sumire, though she does not quite share his feelings. At a wedding, Sumire meets an ethnic Korean woman, Miu, who is 17 years her senior. The two strike up a conversation, and Sumire finds herself attracted to the older woman. This is the first time she has ever been sexually drawn to anybody. Miu soon asks Sumire to come work for her. This meeting and the ensuing relationship between the women leads to Sumire changing: she starts wearing nicer clothes, gets a better apartment, and quits smoking; however, she also develops a writer's block. K suddenly begins to receive letters from Europe written by Sumire. With them, he is able to track Sumire's and Miu's business travels across the continent. In her last letter, Sumire mentions that instead of coming home as originally planned, she and Miu are to spend some extra time on a Greek island vacationing. After a short while, K begins to call Sumire's house wondering when she will return. The only answer he gets, however, is from her answering machine. He soon gets a surprising call from Miu, who asks him to fly to Greece and mentions that something has happened to Sumire. Miu doesn't explain much, but it's clear the matter is urgent. The connection is shabby, and their phone connection is soon lost. K's new school year is starting the week after Miu's call, but finding Sumire's well-being more important, he leaves for Greece the next day. He meets Miu for the first time, and she tells him that Sumire has vanished without a trace. She tells him about the string of events that led to the point of Sumire's disappearance, in which Miu was unable to reciprocate physically when Sumire initiated a sexual encounter. Miu is very pleased to have K around, but worries that Sumire may have committed suicide; K reassures her that Sumire isn't that sort of person. Miu leaves the island for Athens in order to get help from the Japanese embassy and to call Sumire's parents. K spends a day on the island thinking about Sumire and her fate, coming to the a realization that there might be some clue in Sumire's writing that Miu mentioned. He finds Sumire's computer and a floppy disk that contains two documents, named simply \\"Document 1\\" and \\"Document 2\\". One contains Sumire's writing about a dream of hers in which she tries and fails to reach a version of her mother, who died when Sumire was young. The other is a story that Miu told her about an event that transformed her 14 years ago. She was trapped in a Ferris wheel overnight and, using her binoculars to see inside her nearby apartment, witnessed another version of herself having a disturbing sexual encounter with a man. The event caused her hair to turn white and divested her of sexual urges. Miu says that she feels that she was split in two on that night, and has lost that other part of herself forever. Trying hard to connect the dots, K concludes that both the stories suggest the existence of multiple worlds, and Sumire has left this world and entered a parallel one, perhaps to be with the other version of Miu. He then has a mystical experience during the night. Miu returns after a couple of days. K feels his time there is up, even though he feels a connection to Miu. Going back to Japan, he returns to his everyday life. In Sumire's absence, however, he feels he has lost the only precious thing in his life. He receives another distressed call, this time from his girlfriend who is also a married mother of one of his students. She tells him that her son ‚Äì a boy nicknamed \\"Carrot\\" ‚Äì has been caught stealing in a supermarket, and she needs his help in order to convince the security guard to let him go without contacting the police. The security guard is unhappy with both Carrot's lack of regret for his crime and K's outward appearance and manner, which he perceives to be one of an easy lifestyle. After a tedious conversation wherein the guard chastises K for his attitude toward him, he lets Carrot go. K sends the mother home and takes Carrot to a coffee shop. Carrot doesn't say anything the whole time. Even so, feeling a sort of connection to him, K tells him the story about Sumire. After dropping Carrot at his mother's house, K tells her that he cannot see her anymore. He continues with his solitary life. Despite their promises to the contrary, he never sees Miu again except for one chance encounter: Miu drives past him in her Jaguar but doesn't seem to acknowledge he is there. She has stopped dying her hair, and it is now pure white. K senses she is now an \\"empty shell,\\" lacking what both Sumire and K were once drawn to about her. As with other Murakami works, Sputnik Sweetheart lacks a clear, concise ending. Without warning, K receives a phone call from Sumire, who tells him that she is in the same phone booth near her apartment that she had always called him from. She seems to finally be able to return K's affection toward her, and asks him to come get her from the phone booth. Themes Murakami explores familiar themes such as the effects of unrequited love, growing up emotionally stunted in an overwhelmingly conformist society, and the conflict between following one's dreams and clamping down on them in order to assimilate into society. While Sumire is an emotional and spontaneous individual who often appears to be a misfit in society, \\"K\\", the narrator, is a person who has through sheer force of will moulded himself into another person, one who integrates seamlessly into the wider society and culture around him, and the transition leaves him emotionally stunted and unable to express his feelings. When Sumire is also, through her interaction with Miu, forcibly shaped into a person other than she is, the transformation is neither permanent nor successful. As in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Dance Dance Dance, Murakami uses (or rather, suggests) alternate worlds as a plot device. \\"K\\", the narrator, is a markedly different protagonist from those of Murakami's other novels. He is considerably less given to or adept at wisecracks, maintains a respectable and stable profession as a schoolteacher, and is less self-confident and much more introverted and conflicted than any other Murakami protagonist. Many elements of the plot remain deliberately unresolved, contributing to the idea that true knowledge is elusive, and actual events of the story are obscured in favour of the characters' perceptions. The book ends with the theme of The Telephone, which appears in numerous books by Murakami, usually when telephoning from a far-away place, whose location is unclear. In popular culture The book is mentioned in the movie Paris, Je T'aime, while a passage of the book was used in Channel 4's TV drama Nearly Famous in the UK. Weatherday's song \\"My Sputnik Sweetheart\\" is a reference to the novel.

She founded her own newspaper, stood for election, had a pet lion and now has the Biblioth√®que Marguerite Durand named for her. Biography Born to an unmarried mother into a middle-class family, Marguerite Durand was sent to study at a Roman Catholic convent. After finishing her primary education, she entered the Conservatoire de Paris before joining the Com√©die Fran√ßaise in 1881. In 1888, she gave up her career in the theatre to marry an up-and-coming young lawyer, Georges Laguerre. A friend and follower of the politically ambitious army general Georges Boulanger, her husband introduced her to the world of radical populist politics and involved her in writing pamphlets for the \\"Boulangists\\" movement. However, the marriage was short-lived and in 1891 the couple separated after which Durand took a job writing for Le Figaro, the leading newspaper of the day. In 1896, the paper sent her to cover the Congr√®s F√©ministe International (International Feminist Congress) ostensibly to write a humorous article. She came away from the event a greatly changed person, so much so that the following year on December 9, 1897 she founded a feminist daily newspaper, La Fronde to pick up where Hubertine Auclert's La Citoyenne left off. A poster supporting her election and featuring \\"Tiger\\" Durand's newspaper, run exclusively by women, advocated for women's rights, including admission to the Bar association and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. As well, its editorials demanded women be allowed to be named to the Legion of Honor and to participate in parliamentary debates. This included, later in 1910, Durand's attempt to organize female candidates for the legislative elections. At the 1900 World's Fair in Paris, she organized the Congress For The Rights of Women. As well as establishing a summer residence for female journalists ids, Pierrefonds in the Picardy region, Durand turned to activism for working women, helping to organize several trade unions. Marguerite Durand, consumed by a passion for the equality of women, was an attractive woman of style and elegance who was famous for walking the streets of Paris with her pet lion she named \\"Tiger.\\" Instrumental in the establishing of the zoological Cimeti√®re des Chiens in the Parisian suburb of Asni√®res-sur-Seine where her lion was eventually interred, her activism raised the profile of feminism in France and Europe to an unprecedented level of respectability. Along the way, she compiled an enormous collection of papers that she gave to the government in 1931. The following year, the Biblioth√®que Marguerite Durand opened in Paris. In 2006 the library was still open and researchers were working beneath a portrait of Durand.

With her work much in demand, from the 1820s to the 1850s, Sedgwick made a good living writing short stories for a variety of periodicals. She became one of the most notable female novelists of her time. She wrote work in American settings, and combined patriotism with protests against historic Puritan oppressiveness. Her topics contributed to the creation of a national literature, enhanced by her detailed descriptions of nature. Sedgwick created spirited heroines who did not conform to the stereotypical conduct of women at the time. She promoted Republican motherhood. Early life and education The Sedgwick home at Stockbridge. Catharine Maria Sedgwick was born December 28, 1789, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Her mother was Pamela Dwight (1752‚Äì1807) of the New England Dwight family, daughter of General Joseph Dwight (1703‚Äì1765) and granddaughter of Ephraim Williams, founder of Williams College. Her father was Theodore Sedgwick (1746‚Äì1813), a prosperous lawyer and successful politician. He was later elected Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and in 1802, was appointed a justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Sedgwick's four brothers were educated for the law: they naturally followed the profession in which their father, Judge Sedgwick, had been eminent, yet not one of them followed him in the political career in which he had been equally distinguished. The eldest, Theodore, practiced law in Albany; Harry and Robert, in New York; Charles, the youngest, in his home town. Her talents seem to have been from the first justly appreciated by her brothers, Henry and Theodore, whose judicious encouragement was acknowledged in the preface to a new edition of her works in 1849. As a child, Sedgwick was cared for by Elizabeth Freeman (aka Mumbet), a former slave whose freedom Theodore Sedgwick helped gain by arguing her case in county court in 1781. After winning her freedom Freeman declined her previous owner's job offer, and instead accepted a job working for the Sedgwick family. In her autobiography, Sedgwick refers to Elizabeth Freeman multiple times and reflects upon the influence that this woman had on Sedgwick's perception of the world. The integrity and pride that Freeman possessed regarding her own personal intelligence and understanding of the world can be reflected in Sedgwick's admiration of the woman. When Sedgwick was seven or eight, she passed the summer under the care of her cousin Sabrina Parsons, in Bennington, Vermont, at the house of the Rev. Mr. Swift, the husband of Sedgwick's aunt. At home, she attended the district schools, but no one dictated her studies or overlooked her progress. Reading, spelling, and Dwight's Geography were the only subjects taught, in addition to the first four rules of arithmetic, the names of the several parts of speech. During her first winter in New York, when she was 11 years old, she studied dance under M. Lalliet, and had a French master who came three times a week. About two years later, she attended Mrs. Bell's boarding school in Albany, New York, as a day-scholar. At the age of 15, she was sent to Mr. Payne's boarding school in Boston to complete her education, and was there for six months. One of her schoolmates, Susan Anne Ridley Sedgwick (1788‚Äì1867), would become her sister-in-law and a published author. Career As a young woman, Sedgwick took charge of a school in Lenox. She converted from Calvinism to Unitarianism, which led her to write a pamphlet denouncing religious intolerance. This further inspired her to write her first novel, A New-England Tale. Redwood accordingly followed in 1824. It was received at once with a degree of favour that caused the author's name to be associated, and on equal terms, with that of James Fenimore Cooper, who was then at the height of his popularity; and, indeed, in a French translation of the book, which then appeared, Cooper is given on the title-page as the author. Redwood was also translated into the Italian, besides being reprinted in England. Sedgwick then engaged in a work of somewhat humbler aim than Redwood, and in 1825 was published The Travelers, a work professing to give the narrative of a journey made by two very young persons, a brother and sister, with their parents, to Niagara Falls and the northern lakes. On their way, these travelers meet everywhere some incident or some sight, which is made the source of entertainment and instruction. This was the first of Sedgwick's books intended for young persons and the public gave it a ready welcome. Its success encouraged her in after years to write the series of works intended for young readers which became popular. The reputation of the author was confirmed and extended by the appearance, in 1827, of Hope Leslie, the most decided favourite of all her novels. She wrote other things afterward, that in the opinion of some of the critics are superior to either Redwood or Hope Leslie. But these later writings had to jostle their way among a crowd of competitors, both domestic and foreign. Her earlier works stood alone, and Hope Leslie, especially, became firmly associated in the public mind with the rising form of a native literature. It was not only read with satisfaction but familiarly quoted and applauded as a source of national pride. Her subsequent novels followed at about uniform intervals, Clarence, a Tale of our Own Times appearing in 1830. Sedgwick gives the Native American population a voice within Hope Leslie through her characterization of various people within the novel. Similar to the manner in which Sedgwick represented a progressive attitude toward the supposed duties of women during the time period, Philip Gura highlights her addition of minority groups as significant characters and her commitment to questioning the history of the nation that has been told exclusively by white men. A little later, the Brothers Harper conceived the idea of publishing a collection of tales by several well-known authors, and applied to Sedgwick to become one of the contributors. She complied, and two volumes were published in 1832, with the title of Tales of the Glauber Spa. Sedgwick's contribution was a tale of the times of Charlemagne, entitled \\"Le Bossu\\", in which she skillfully availed herself of the elements of the picturesque to be found in the customs of that warlike age, and the court of that monarch. Then came The Linwoods, or Sixty Years Since in America, in 1835. In 1836, she commenced writing in a new vein, giving a series of illustrations of common life, called The Poor Rich Man, and the Rich Poor Man. These were followed, in 1837, by Live and Let Live, and afterwards by Means and Ends, a Love Token for Children, and Stories for Young Persons. In 1839, Miss Sedgwick went to Europe, and while there, wrote Letters from Abroad to Kindred at Home. These were collected after her return and published in two volumes. She also wrote a Life of Lucretia M. Davidson, and contributed numerous articles to the Annuals and the Magazines. Some of her publications were prepared expressly for children and young persons. The Boy of Mount Rhigi, published in 1848, was one of a series of tales projected for the purpose of diffusing sentiments of goodness among the young. The titles of some of her other small volumes are Facts and Fancies, Beatitudes and Pleasant Sundays, Morals of Manners, Wilton Harvey, Home, Louisa and her Cousins, and Lessons without Books. In her final novel, Married or Single (1857), she put forth the bold idea that women should not marry if it meant they would lose their self-respect (but she married off her heroine). In later years, both the brothers who resided in New York City were dead; and her time was divided between her friends in the neighborhood of Boston and those in her native Berkshire. At this time, she wrote Memoir of Joseph Curtis, a Model Man. Personal life Sedgwick was engaged at one point to Harmanus Bleecker, a friend of her father and law partner of her brother Theodore (1780-1839). They did not marry, and Sedgwick turned down several other marriage proposals, instead choosing to remain single and focus on her career. Catharine Sedgwick Sedgwick died in 1867. She is buried in the family plot in Stockbridge. Her family arranged to have Freeman buried in their family plot as well, and had a tombstone inscribed for her. Critical response By the end of the 19th century, she had been relegated to near obscurity. There was a rise of male critics who deprecated women's writing as they worked to create an American literature. Interest in Sedgwick's works and an appreciation of her contribution to American literature has been stimulated by the late 20th century's feminist movement. Beginning in the 1960s, feminist scholars began to re-evaluate women's contributions to literature and other arts and created new frames of reference for considering their work. In addition, the advent of low-cost electronic reproductions, which became available at the end of the 20th century, made Sedgwick and other nineteenth-century authors' work more accessible for study and pleasure. Edgar Allan Poe described Sedgwick in his \\"The Literati of New York City\\" (1846).\\"Catharine Sedgwick\\", Portraits of American Women Writers, The Library Company of Philadelphia. 2005; citing: in 1846 ‚ÄúThe Literati of New York City. No. V,‚Äù in Godey's Lady's Book, v. 33, pp. 131-132: > She is about the medium height, perhaps a little below it. Her forehead is > an unusually fine one nose of a slightly Roman curve; eyes dark and > piercing; mouth well-formed and remarkably pleasant in its expression. The > portrait in Graham's Magazine is by no means a likeness, and, although the > hair is represented as curled, (Miss Sedgwick at present wears a cap‚Äîat > least, most usually,) gives her the air of being much older than she is. =The New England Tale= Sedgwick's first publication was The New England Tale. The author informs us in the preface, that the story was commenced as a religious tract, and that it gradually grew in her hands, beyond the proper limits of such a work. Finding this to be the case, she abandoned all design of publication but finished the tale for her own amusement. Once finished, however, the opinions and solicitations of her friends prevailed over her own earnest wishes, and the volume was published in 1822. The original intention of this book led the author to give special prominence to topics of a questionable character for a professed novel, and the unfavourable portraiture which she gives of New England Puritanism, brought some censure upon her. The limited plan of the story did not give the opportunity for the display of that extent and variety of power which appear in some of her later productions. Still, it contains passages of stirring eloquence, as well as of deep tenderness, that compares favourably with her other writings. Perhaps the chief value of The New England Tale was its effect upon the author herself. Its publication broke the ice of diffidence and indifference, and launched her career. =Hope Leslie= Hope Leslie Sedgwick's third novel, Hope Leslie (1827), recounted a dramatic conflict among the British Empire, colonists and Native Americans. The book earned a large readership and established the author's reputation in both the United States and Great Britain. Using the techniques of the \\"New Criticism\\" of the 1950s, Judith Fetterley (1998) provides a close reading of Hope Leslie. She notes both the areas in which the heroine Leslie (and thus the author) is ahead of her time and the areas in which she is a product of her time. Leslie constantly challenges the role of women suggested during the colonial period. Sedgwick portrays Leslie as living in a hostile world, where, as a woman, she creates a holistic public role that is not separate from the private sphere. Sedgwick regularly uses the rhetoric of \\"sameness\\" when comparing Leslie and the main male character, Everell. Her treatment of her characters is both radical and conservative. For instance, Fetterley believes that Leslie is repulsed to discover that her long-lost sister, Faith Leslie, taken captive by Indians, has \\"gone native\\", assimilated and married an Indian. Sedgwick portrays the Indian woman Magawisca sympathetically. But she viewed nonwhite women as a threat to the efforts of white women to establish themselves independently in society, and seemed to write nonwhite women out of the future by expressing the contemporary belief that American Indians were a vanishing race.Judith Fetterley, \\"'My Sister! My Sister!' The Rhetoric Of Catharine Sedgwick's 'Hope Leslie',\\" American Literature 1998 70(3): 491-516 Barbara Bardes and Suzanne Gossett differ in opinions about the meaning of Hope Leslie. They see the figure of Magawisca as a double for Hope Leslie, and note that the author did research on Mohawk customs and presents their religion sympathetically. Because Sedgwick portrays Faith Leslie's marriage to an Indian and refusal to rejoin the Puritan community, they see her as more open to American-Native American relations than was James Fenimore Cooper, for instance, whose novel Last of the Mohicans (1826) was published the year before.Barbara A.

The story follows Gertrude Clarence, a young heiress on the New York City marriage market. An author's revised edition of the novel was released in 1849. Critical reception of the novel in America was mostly positive. A review in the New York Evening Post (14 June 1830) praises the presentations of American domestic life as being \\"managed with great liveliness and ingenuity, and constitute one of the most attractive parts of the book\\". Reviews of the novel in England are mixed. The Ladies Museum (1 September 1830) criticizes the novel for being outmoded, complaining that the novel was written \\"in a style that was considered good fifty years ago\\". =The Linwoods= The Linwoods; or Sixty Years Since in America (1835) is an historical romance set during the American Revolution. Sedgwick uses a cosmopolitan framework to shed light on American character and national identity in the early republic by exploring America's relationship with Britain and France. The balance between American nationalism and cosmopolitanism is idealized in the novel through the character of the Marquis de Lafayette, as is the struggle between Old World notions of class and the reality of American democracy.Philip Gould, \\"Catharine Sedgwick's Cosmopolitan Nation\\", New England Quarterly 2005 78(2): 232-258 =Live and Let Live= Live and Let Live Live and Let Live; or, Domestic Service Illustrated (1837) depicts the ideal workplaces for working-class women to develop domestic skills. Sedgwick's expression of relations between mistress-employer and housekeepers reflects a return to aristocratic class relations, but one that includes employer respect for the employee's humanity and political rights. Domestic economist Catharine Beecher's subsequent publications, A Treatise on Domestic Economy (1841) and The American Woman's Home (1869), similarly promoted the importance of the \\"labor contract\\" in these relationships.Laurie Ousley, \\"The Business of Housekeeping: The Mistress, the Domestic Worker, and the Construction of Class,\\" Legacy 2006 23(2): 132-147 Literary style and themes Hart in 1857 stated:-\\"The quality of mind which is most apparent in Miss Sedgwick's writings is that of strength. The reader feels at every step that he has to do with a vigorous and active intellect. Another quality, resulting from this possession of power, is the entire absence of affectation of every kind. There is no straining for effect, no mere verbal prettinesses. The discourse proceeds with the utmost simplicity and directness, as though the author were more intent upon what she is saying than how she says it. As a novelist, Sedgwick has for the most part wisely chosen American subjects. The local traditions, scenery, manners, and costume, being thus entirely familiar, she has had greater freedom in the exercise of the creative faculty, on which, after all, real eminence in the art mainly depends. Her characters are conceived with distinctness, and are minutely individual and consistent, while her plot always shows a mind fertile in resources and a happy adaptation of means to ends.\\" In 1880, in a Harper and brothers review, it was said:-\\"Sedgwick has marked individuality; she writes with a higher aim than merely to amuse. Indeed, the rare endowments of her mind depend in an unusual degree upon the moral qualities with which they are united for their value. Animated by a cheerful philosophy, and anxious to pour its sunshine into every place where there is lurking care or suffering, she selects for illustration the scenes of everyday experience, paints them with exact fidelity, and seeks to diffuse over the mind a delicious serenity, and in the heart kind feelings and sympathies, and wise ambition and steady hope. Her style is colloquial, picturesque, and marked by a facile grace which is evidently a gift of nature. Her characters are nicely drawn and delicately contrasted, her delineation of manners decidedly the best that has appeared.

She was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the archerfish. Archerfish is best known for sinking the Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano in November 1944, the largest warship ever sunk by a submarine. For this achievement, she received a Presidential Unit Citation after World War II. Archerfishs keel was laid down on 22 January 1943 in the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 28 May 1943, sponsored by Miss Malvina Thompson, the personal secretary to first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The boat was commissioned on 4 September 1943, Lieutenant Commander George W. Kehl in command.  World War II  Archerfish underwent shakedown training through the first part of November off the New England coast, and headed for Hawaii via the Panama Canal. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 November 1943 and joined the Pacific Fleet. = First four patrols, December 1943 ‚Äì September 1944 = After receiving voyage repairs and undergoing training exercises, Archerfish got under way on 23 December for her first war patrol. She paused at Midway Atoll on 27 December to refuel before proceeding to her patrol area north of Taiwan. During this patrol, she attacked three ships, but scored no kills before returning to Midway on 16 February 1944 for repairs and training. The submarine stood out of Midway on 16 March 1944 on her second war patrol but encountered no Japanese targets during her 42 days at sea, mostly near the Palau Islands. She returned to the Submarine Base at Pearl Harbor via Johnston Island on 27 April to commence refitting. A month and a day later, Archerfish left Pearl Harbor, bound for the Bonin Islands area and her third patrol. She was assigned lifeguard duty during the strikes against Iwo Jima on 4 July, and rescued downed aviator Ensign John B. Anderson before returning to Midway on 15 July. After a refit alongside submarine tender and training exercises, Archerfish got under way again on 7 August to begin another patrol. She prowled the waters off Honsh≈´ for more than a month without bagging any enemy ships, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 September after 53 days at sea. = Fifth patrol, October‚ÄìDecember 1944: Sinking Shinano = Archerfish left Hawaii on 30 October under the command of Commander Joseph F. Enright, visited Saipan on 9 November for quick voyage repairs, and departed two days later to carry out her next patrol, in which her primary mission was to provide lifeguard services for the first B-29 Superfortress strikes against Tokyo. On 28 November, she received word that no air raids would be launched that day, giving her carte blanche to roam the waters near Tokyo Bay. That evening, lookouts spotted what looked like a tanker leaving the bay. It was later discovered that it was actually a large aircraft carrier screened by three destroyers (Hamakaze, Yukikaze, Isokaze) and a submarine chaser (Cha-241). Shinano underway during sea trials in Tokyo Bay Enright realized that a surface attack would be suicidal; the destroyers would blow Archerfish out of the water before he could get the sub into position. Even without the destroyers, Enright also knew that the carrier was too massive for the sub's four-inch gun to have any effect. He ordered that the carrier be tracked from ahead in preparation for an attack from below. After six hours, the enemy carrier turned right back into Archerfishs path, and Archerfish got into an attack position. Archerfish submerged and fired six torpedoes. Enright deliberately set the torpedoes to run shallow () in hopes of capsizing the target by holing it higher up on its hull. He also wanted to increase the chances of a hit in case the torpedoes ran deeper than set. Even as Archerfish descended to to avoid a depth charge attack, Enright and the crew saw that the carrier was already listing to starboard. The crew also began picking up loud breaking-up noises from the target shortly after firing the last torpedo. The noises continued for 47 minutes. The patrol ended at Guam on 15 December after 48 days on station. Initially, the Office of Naval Intelligence thought that Archerfish had sunk a cruiser, not believing that there were any carriers in that stretch of ocean. However, Enright had made sketches of the target, and Archerfish was given credit for sinking a 28,000-ton carrier. It was only after the war that the Americans learned the identity of Archerfishs quarry: Shinano, the biggest aircraft carrier ever built at the time. It was originally the third of the s, but had been converted into a 72,000-ton supercarrier after the Battle of Midway. Four of Archerfishs six torpedoes had hit, striking the carrier between the anti-torpedo bulge and the waterline at approximately 03:20. The damage was magnified by the fact that Shinano had turned south just minutes before Enright loosed his torpedoes, thus exposing her entire side to Archerfish‚Äîa nearly ideal firing situation for a submarine. The ship initially continued under way, but it lost power around 06:00. The crew were unable to contain the flooding due to serious design flaws and inexperience, and the carrier capsized just before 11:00.Reports of the US Naval Technical Mission to Japan, Ship and Related Targets Archerfish received the Presidential Unit Citation and Enright received the Navy Cross for this action. To this day, Shinano is the largest warship to be sunk by a submarine. = Last two patrols, January‚ÄìSeptember 1945 = While her officers and crew spent the holidays at a rest and recreation camp located on Guam, Archerfish underwent refit at the island. On 10 January 1945, the submarine got underway for her sixth patrol. Enright was in command of \\"Joe's Jugheads\\", a three-submarine \\"wolfpack\\" comprising Archerfish, , and . This mission took her to waters in the South China Sea off Hong Kong and the southern tip of Formosa. She damaged one unidentified target and claimed a submarine on February 14, 1945 U boat netforum USS Archerfish during this patrol which ended on 3 March, three days earlier than scheduled, due to bow-plane problems. (The submarine sinking was not confirmed until after the war.) Archerfish touched at Saipan and Pearl Harbor before arriving back in the United States at San Francisco, California on 13 March. She then proceeded to the Hunters Point Navy Yard for overhaul and drydocking. Archerfish undergoing a sea test on 5 June 1945 near San Francisco Following completion of the yard work, Archerfish sailed on 14 June for Oahu. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 June and commenced voyage repairs and training exercises. The submarine got underway on 10 July for her seventh and last war patrol, which she conducted in the area off the east coast of Honsh≈´ and the south coast of Hokkaid≈ç, providing lifeguard services for Superfortresses striking the Japanese home islands. She was still off Hokkaid≈ç on 15 August when word of the Japanese capitulation arrived. Archerfish was one of 12 submarines that entered Tokyo Bay on 31 August and moored alongside Proteus, near the Yokosuka Navy Yard. After the formal Japanese surrender on 2 September, Archerfish departed Tokyo Bay, bound for Pearl Harbor, and arrived there on 12 September. She was then assigned to Submarine Squadron 1 (SubRon 1) for duty and training. =Post- war= The submarine left Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1946, bound for San Francisco. From 8 January to 13 March, the ship's force carried out her preinactivation overhaul. On the latter day, she proceeded to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard where the final stages of inactivation were completed. Archerfish was decommissioned on 12 June 1946 and placed in the Pacific Reserve Group berthed at Mare Island.  1952‚Äì1955  During the Korean War, many inactive Navy vessels were recommissioned. Archerfish was chosen for recommissioning on 7 January 1952. She was recommissioned on 7 March and reported for duty to the Pacific Fleet on 26 March. The next day she sailed for three weeks of shakedown training out of San Diego, California. However, a fire broke out in her maneuvering room on 28 March, and the ship returned to Mare Island under her own power for a restricted availability to have the damage corrected. With repairs complete on 27 May, Archerfish held shakedown off the West Coast. She then transited the Panama Canal and joined the Atlantic Fleet on 3 July. Attached to SubRon 12, she operated out of Key West, Florida, visiting such places as Santiago and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Port-au- Prince, Haiti; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Trinidad, British West Indies. The vessel departed Key West on 25 April 1955 and proceeded to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for decommissioning. After completing her inactivation overhaul, the ship was towed to New London, Connecticut, and was decommissioned on 21 October 1955.  Oceanographic work, 1958‚Äì1964  Archerfish was reactivated at New London in July 1957, placed back in commission on 1 August, and again joined SubRon 12 at Key West. On 13 January 1958, she got underway for a cruise under the technical supervision of the Navy Hydrographic Office. On this deployment, she visited Recife, Brazil, and Trinidad. Upon completion of that mission she provided services for the fleet training commands at Key West and Guantanamo Bay. (In this time, she also portrayed the in the 1959 movie Operation Petticoat for the underwater and distance scenes and shots.) Dr. George Bond and Chief Engineman Cyril Tuckfield following record buoyant ascent in 1959. On 2 October 1959, approximately 15 miles southwest of Key West, over Vestal Shoal, Archerfish bottomed at . Commander George F. Bond and Chief Engineman Cyril Tuckfield safely completed a 52-second, 302-foot buoyant ascent from the forward escape trunk. Both men received the Legion of Merit in 1960 for establishing the feasibility of deep submarine escape by locking out. In early 1960, Archerfish was chosen to participate in Operation \\"Sea Scan\\", a scientific study of marine weather conditions, water composition, ocean depths, and temperature ranges. She entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in January to be specially equipped for this new mission. During this time, the vessel was redesignated an auxiliary submarine, with hull classification symbol AGSS-311. Embarking a team of civilian scientists, she commenced the first phase of \\"Sea Scan\\" on 18 May. On the cruise, the submarine visited Portsmouth, England; Hammerfest and Bergen, Norway; Faslane, Scotland; Thule, Godthaab, and Julianehab, Greenland; Belfast, Northern Ireland; and Halifax, Nova Scotia, before mooring at New London on 3 December. After six weeks of upkeep, Archerfish got underway on 20 January 1961 for the Pacific phase of \\"Sea Scan\\", transited the Panama Canal on 6 February, and proceeded via San Diego to Hawaii. She left Pearl Harbor on 27 March. During her operations the submarine visited Yokosuka and Hakodate, Japan, Hong Kong; Subic Bay, Philippines; Bangkok, Thailand; Penang, Malaya; Colombo, Ceylon; and Fremantle, Australia, and closed out 1961 moored at Yokosuka. Phase two of Operation \\"Sea Scan\\" continued during the early months of 1962 with operations in the western Pacific area and port calls at Sasebo, Japan, Guam, and Cebu City, Philippines. Early in March, the submarine completed phase two and proceeded via Pago Pago to Pearl Harbor. On 27 April she entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for overhaul. After completion of overhaul, the submarine moved to San Diego for a two-week upkeep. She then commenced phase three of \\"Sea Scan\\" in the eastern Pacific area, with stops in Pearl Harbor and Midway Atoll, and returned to San Diego for the Christmas holidays. Archerfish departed San Diego on 10 January 1963, bound for Yokosuka, where she began a three-week upkeep period. Following two and one- half months of operations she returned to the United States for a brief visit to San Francisco, California, before reentering Pearl Harbor early in May. Late May and most of June were devoted to surveying off the northwest coast of the United States and Canada, with port calls in Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; and Vancouver, British Columbia. The submarine was back in Yokosuka for drydocking in July and August before beginning three months of continuous surveying in the mid-Pacific, broken only by brief fueling and upkeep stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor. She departed Yokosuka on 25 November for an extended cruise to the southern hemisphere, arrived in Australia in mid-December and took a three-week holiday in Newcastle and Sydney. From the latter port, Archerfish traveled to Guam for a two-week upkeep in late January 1964 and finally reached Pearl Harbor on 5 March. Departing Pearl Harbor on 30 March, the ship continued \\"Sea Scan\\" operations in the eastern Pacific. She visited San Francisco in April and Vancouver, in May before returning to Pearl Harbor on 25 May, ending the third phase of \\"Sea Scan\\". Archerfish began an extended fourth and final phase of Operation \\"Sea Scan\\" when she left Pearl Harbor on 17 June and headed for the eastern Pacific. She made port calls during July at Seattle and Olympia, Washington, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 19 August for a three-week upkeep and drydocking before undertaking a cruise to the South Pacific. The submarine sailed on 9 September for the Fiji Islands. After briefly touching Suva, she headed for Auckland, New Zealand, for an 11-day visit. Her next stop was Wellington, New Zealand, but she left New Zealand on 19 October and arrived in Yokosuka on 6 November. She got underway again on 27 November to continue survey operations in the Caroline Islands area. After spending New Year's Eve in Guam, the ship sailed for Subic Bay, Philippines, where she closed the year in upkeep.  1965‚Äì1968  During the remaining three and a half years of her Navy career Archerfish carried out various research assignments in the eastern Pacific. In early 1968, Archerfish was declared unfit for further naval service and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1968. She was towed to a target position off San Diego and sunk by a torpedo fired from the submarine on 19 October 1968. Awards Archerfish received seven battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation for her World War II service.

Offenses by officials also include ordinary crimes, but perhaps with different standards of proof and punishment than for non-officials, on the grounds that more is expected of officials by their oaths of office.  Britain  The 1450 impeachment of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, a descendant of Michael, was the next to allege charges under this title. He was charged with using his influence to obstruct justice as well as cronyism and wasting public money. Other charges against him included acts of high treason. Impeachment fell out of use after 1459, but Parliament revived it in the early 17th century to try the King's ministers. In 1621, Parliament impeached the King's Attorney General, Sir Henry Yelverton, for high crimes and misdemeanors. The charges included failing to prosecute after starting lawsuits and using authority before it was properly his. After the Restoration the scope of the charge grew to include negligence, and abuse of power or trust while in office. For example, charges in the impeachment of Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford in 1701 included many violations of trust in his positions. In this case, he abused his position in the Privy Council to make profits for himself; as Treasurer of the Navy he embezzled funds; and as Admiral of the Fleet he got a commission for the pirate William Kidd.  United States  \\"High crimes and misdemeanors\\" is a phrase from Section 4 of Article Two of the United States Constitution: \\"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\\" \\"High,\\" in the legal and common parlance of the 17th and 18th centuries of \\"high crimes,\\" is activity by or against those who have special duties acquired by taking an oath of office that are not shared with common persons. A high crime is one that can be done only by someone in a unique position of authority, which is political in character, who does things to circumvent justice. The phrase \\"high crimes and misdemeanors,\\" used together, was a common phrase when the U.S. Constitution was written and did not require any stringent or difficult criteria for determining guilt but meant the opposite. The phrase was historically used to cover a very broad range of crimes. The Judiciary Committee's 1974 report \\"The Historical Origins of Impeachment\\" stated: \\"'High Crimes and Misdemeanors' has traditionally been considered a 'term of art', like such other constitutional phrases as 'levying war' and 'due process.' The Supreme Court has held that such phrases must be construed, not according to modern usage, but according to what the framers meant when they adopted them. Chief Justice John Marshall wrote of the phrase \\"levying war\\": Since 1386, the English parliament had used the term ‚Äúhigh crimes and misdemeanors‚Äù to describe one of the grounds to impeach officials of the crown. Officials accused of ‚Äúhigh crimes and misdemeanors‚Äù were accused of offenses as varied as misappropriating government funds, appointing unfit subordinates, not prosecuting cases, promoting themselves ahead of more deserving candidates, threatening a grand jury, disobeying an order from Parliament, arresting a man to keep him from running for Parliament, helping ‚Äúsuppress petitions to the King to call a Parliament,‚Äù etc. Benjamin Franklin asserted that the power of impeachment and removal was necessary for those times when the Executive \\"rendered himself obnoxious,\\" and the Constitution should provide for the \\"regular punishment of the Executive when his conduct should deserve it, and for his honorable acquittal when he should be unjustly accused.\\" James Madison said that \\"impeachment... was indispensable\\" to defend the community against \\"the incapacity, negligence or perfidy of the chief Magistrate.\\" With a single executive, Madison argued, unlike a legislature whose collective nature provided security, \\"loss of capacity or corruption was more within the compass of probable events, and either of them might be fatal to the Republic.\\" The process of impeaching someone in the House of Representatives and the Senate is difficult, made so to be the balance against efforts to easily remove people from office for minor reasons that could easily be determined by the standard of \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\". It was George Mason who offered up the term \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\" as one of the criteria to remove public officials who abuse their office. Their original intentions can be gleaned by the phrases and words that were proposed before, such as \\"high misdemeanor,\\" \\"maladministration,\\" or \\"other crime.\\" Edmund Randolph said impeachment should be reserved for those who \\"misbehave.\\" Charles Cotesworth Pinckney said, It should be reserved \\"for those who behave amiss, or betray their public trust.\\" As can be seen from all these references to \\"high crimes and misdemeanors,\\" the definition or its rationale does not relate to specific offences. This gives a lot of freedom of interpretation to the House of Representatives and the Senate. The constitutional law by nature is not concerned with being specific. The courts through precedence and the legislature through lawmaking make constitutional provisions specific. In this case the legislature (the House of Representatives and the Senate) acts as a court and can create a precedent. In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Hamilton said, \\"those offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\\" The first impeachment conviction by the United States Senate was in 1804 of John Pickering, a judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, for chronic intoxication. Federal judges have been impeached and removed from office for tax evasion, conspiracy to solicit a bribe, and making false statements to a grand jury. Andrew Johnson was impeached on February 24, 1868, in the United U.S. House of Representatives on eleven articles of impeachment detailing his \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\",The Trial of Andrew Jackson. On Articles of Impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives in accordance with Article Two of the United States Constitution. (The Senate fell one vote short of conviction.) The House's primary charge against Johnson was with violation of the Tenure of Office Act, passed by Congress the previous year. Specifically, he had removed Edwin M. Stanton, the Secretary of War from office and replaced him with John Schofield, but it was unclear if Johnson had violated the act as Stanton was nominated by President Abraham Lincoln and not by Johnson. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1999, White House Counsel Charles Ruff described a \\"narrow\\" interpretation of \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\" as requiring \\"a standard that the framers intentionally set at this extraordinarily high level to ensure that only the most serious offenses and in particular those that subverted our system of government would justify overturning a popular election\\". Writing in 1999, Mark R. Slusar commented that the narrow interpretation seemed to be most common among legal scholars and senators.

The 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Albert Fert and Peter Gr√ºnberg for the discovery of GMR. The effect is observed as a significant change in the electrical resistance depending on whether the magnetization of adjacent ferromagnetic layers are in a parallel or an antiparallel alignment. The overall resistance is relatively low for parallel alignment and relatively high for antiparallel alignment. The magnetization direction can be controlled, for example, by applying an external magnetic field. The effect is based on the dependence of electron scattering on the spin orientation. The main application of GMR is magnetic field sensors, which are used to read data in hard disk drives, biosensors, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and other devices. GMR multilayer structures are also used in magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) as cells that store one bit of information. In literature, the term giant magnetoresistance is sometimes confused with colossal magnetoresistance of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic semiconductors, which is not related to the multilayer structure. The founding results of Albert Fert and Peter Gr√ºnberg (1988): change in the resistance of Fe/Cr superlattices at 4.2 K in external magnetic field H. The current and magnetic field were parallel to the [110] axis. The arrow to the right shows maximum resistance change. Hs is saturation field. Formulation Magnetoresistance is the dependence of the electrical resistance of a sample on the strength of an external magnetic field. Numerically, it is characterized by the value : \\\\delta_H = \\\\frac{R(H)-R(0)}{R(0)} where R(H) is the resistance of the sample in a magnetic field H, and R(0) corresponds to H = 0. Alternative forms of this expression may use electrical resistivity instead of resistance, a different sign for Œ¥H, and are sometimes normalized by R(H) rather than R(0). The term \\"giant magnetoresistance\\" indicates that the value Œ¥H for multilayer structures significantly exceeds the anisotropic magnetoresistance, which has a typical value within a few percent. History GMR was discovered in 1988 independently by the groups of Albert Fert of the University of Paris-Sud, France, and Peter Gr√ºnberg of Forschungszentrum J√ºlich, Germany. The practical significance of this experimental discovery was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Fert and Gr√ºnberg in 2007. =Early steps= The first mathematical model describing the effect of magnetization on the mobility of charge carriers in solids, related to the spin of those carriers, was reported in 1936. Experimental evidence of the potential enhancement of Œ¥H has been known since the 1960s. By the late 1980s, the anisotropic magnetoresistance had been well explored, but the corresponding value of Œ¥H did not exceed a few percent. The enhancement of Œ¥H became possible with the advent of sample preparation techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy, which allows manufacturing multilayer thin films with a thickness of several nanometers. Experiment and its interpretation Fert and Gr√ºnberg studied electrical resistance of structures incorporating ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic materials. In particular, Fert worked on multilayer films, and Gr√ºnberg in 1986 discovered the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in Fe/Cr films. The GMR discovery work was carried out by the two groups on slightly different samples. The Fert group used (001)Fe/(001) Cr superlattices wherein the Fe and Cr layers were deposited in a high vacuum on a (001) GaAs substrate kept at 20 ¬∞C and the magnetoresistance measurements were taken at low temperature (typically 4.2 K). The Gr√ºnberg work was performed on multilayers of Fe and Cr on (110) GaAs at room temperature. In Fe/Cr multilayers with 3-nm-thick iron layers, increasing the thickness of the non-magnetic Cr layers from 0.9 to 3 nm weakened the antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe layers and reduced the demagnetization field, which also decreased when the sample was heated from 4.2 K to room temperature. Changing the thickness of the non-magnetic layers led to a significant reduction of the residual magnetization in the hysteresis loop. Electrical resistance changed by up to 50% with the external magnetic field at 4.2 K. Fert named the new effect giant magnetoresistance, to highlight its difference with the anisotropic magnetoresistance. The Gr√ºnberg experiment made the same discovery but the effect was less pronounced (3% compared to 50%) due to the samples being at room temperature rather than low temperature. The discoverers suggested that the effect is based on spin- dependent scattering of electrons in the superlattice, particularly on the dependence of resistance of the layers on the relative orientations of magnetization and electron spins. The theory of GMR for different directions of the current was developed in the next few years. In 1989, Camley and Barna≈õ calculated the \\"current in plane\\" (CIP) geometry, where the current flows along the layers, in the classical approximation, whereas Levy et al. used the quantum formalism. The theory of the GMR for the current perpendicular to the layers (current perpendicular to the plane or CPP geometry), known as the Valet-Fert theory, was reported in 1993. Applications favor the CPP geometry because it provides a greater magnetoresistance ratio (Œ¥H), thus resulting in a greater device sensitivity. Theory =Fundamentals= Spin-dependent scattering Electronic density of states (DOS) in magnetic and non-magnetic metals. 1: the structure of two ferromagnetic and one non-magnetic layers (arrows indicate the direction of magnetization). 2: splitting of DOS for electrons with different spin directions for each layer (arrows indicate the spin direction). F: Fermi level. The magnetic moment is antiparallel to the direction of total spin at the Fermi level. In magnetically ordered materials, the electrical resistance is crucially affected by scattering of electrons on the magnetic sublattice of the crystal, which is formed by crystallographically equivalent atoms with nonzero magnetic moments. Scattering depends on the relative orientations of the electron spins and those magnetic moments: it is weakest when they are parallel and strongest when they are antiparallel; it is relatively strong in the paramagnetic state, in which the magnetic moments of the atoms have random orientations. For good conductors such as gold or copper, the Fermi level lies within the sp band, and the d band is completely filled. In ferromagnets, the dependence of electron-atom scattering on the orientation of their magnetic moments is related to the filling of the band responsible for the magnetic properties of the metal, e.g., 3d band for iron, nickel or cobalt. The d band of ferromagnets is split, as it contains a different number of electrons with spins directed up and down. Therefore, the density of electronic states at the Fermi level is also different for spins pointing in opposite directions. The Fermi level for majority-spin electrons is located within the sp band, and their transport is similar in ferromagnets and non-magnetic metals. For minority-spin electrons the sp and d bands are hybridized, and the Fermi level lies within the d band. The hybridized spd band has a high density of states, which results in stronger scattering and thus shorter mean free path Œª for minority-spin than majority-spin electrons. In cobalt-doped nickel, the ratio Œª‚Üë/Œª‚Üì can reach 20. According to the Drude theory, the conductivity is proportional to Œª, which ranges from several to several tens of nanometers in thin metal films. Electrons \\"remember\\" the direction of spin within the so- called spin relaxation length (or spin diffusion length), which can significantly exceed the mean free path. Spin-dependent transport refers to the dependence of electrical conductivity on the spin direction of the charge carriers. In ferromagnets, it occurs due to electron transitions between the unsplit 4s and split 3d bands. In some materials, the interaction between electrons and atoms is the weakest when their magnetic moments are antiparallel rather than parallel. A combination of both types of materials can result in a so-called inverse GMR effect. CIP and CPP geometries Spin valves in the reading head of a sensor in the CIP (left) and CPP (right) geometries. Red: leads providing current to the sensor, green and yellow: ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers. V: potential difference. Electric current can be passed through magnetic superlattices in two ways. In the current in plane (CIP) geometry, the current flows along the layers, and the electrodes are located on one side of the structure. In the current perpendicular to plane (CPP) configuration, the current is passed perpendicular to the layers, and the electrodes are located on different sides of the superlattice. The CPP geometry results in more than twice higher GMR, but is more difficult to realize in practice than the CIP configuration. Carrier transport through a magnetic superlattice Spin valve based on the GMR effect. FM: ferromagnetic layer (arrows indicate the direction of magnetization), NM: non-magnetic layer. Electrons with spins up and down scatter differently in the valve. Magnetic ordering differs in superlattices with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interaction between the layers. In the former case, the magnetization directions are the same in different ferromagnetic layers in the absence of applied magnetic field, whereas in the latter case, opposite directions alternate in the multilayer. Electrons traveling through the ferromagnetic superlattice interact with it much weaker when their spin directions are opposite to the magnetization of the lattice than when they are parallel to it. Such anisotropy is not observed for the antiferromagnetic superlattice; as a result, it scatters electrons stronger than the ferromagnetic superlattice and exhibits a higher electrical resistance. Applications of the GMR effect require dynamic switching between the parallel and antiparallel magnetization of the layers in a superlattice. In first approximation, the energy density of the interaction between two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer is proportional to the scalar product of their magnetizations: : w = - J (\\\\mathbf M_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf M_2). The coefficient J is an oscillatory function of the thickness of the non-magnetic layer ds; therefore J can change its magnitude and sign. If the ds value corresponds to the antiparallel state then an external field can switch the superlattice from the antiparallel state (high resistance) to the parallel state (low resistance). The total resistance of the structure can be written as : R = R_0 + \\\\Delta R \\\\sin^2 \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}, where R0 is the resistance of ferromagnetic superlattice, ŒîR is the GMR increment and Œ∏ is the angle between the magnetizations of adjacent layers. =Mathematical description= The GMR phenomenon can be described using two spin-related conductivity channels corresponding to the conduction of electrons, for which the resistance is minimum or maximum. The relation between them is often defined in terms of the coefficient of the spin anisotropy Œ≤. This coefficient can be defined using the minimum and maximum of the specific electrical resistivity œÅF¬± for the spin-polarized current in the form : \\\\rho_{F\\\\pm}=\\\\frac{2\\\\rho_F}{1\\\\pm\\\\beta}, where œÅF is the average resistivity of the ferromagnet. Resistor model for CIP and CPP structures If scattering of charge carriers at the interface between the ferromagnetic and non-magnetic metal is small, and the direction of the electron spins persists long enough, it is convenient to consider a model in which the total resistance of the sample is a combination of the resistances of the magnetic and non-magnetic layers. In this model, there are two conduction channels for electrons with various spin directions relative to the magnetization of the layers. Therefore, the equivalent circuit of the GMR structure consists of two parallel connections corresponding to each of the channels. In this case, the GMR can be expressed as : \\\\delta_H = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta R}{R}=\\\\frac{R_{\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow}-R_{\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow}}{R_{\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow}}=\\\\frac{(\\\\rho_{F+}-\\\\rho_{F-})^2}{(2\\\\rho_{F+}+\\\\chi\\\\rho_N)(2\\\\rho_{F-}+\\\\chi\\\\rho_N)}. Here the subscript of R denote collinear and oppositely oriented magnetization in layers, œá = b/a is the thickness ratio of the magnetic and non-magnetic layers, and œÅN is the resistivity of non-magnetic metal. This expression is applicable for both CIP and CPP structures. Under the condition \\\\chi\\\\rho_N \\\\ll \\\\rho_{F\\\\pm} this relationship can be simplified using the coefficient of the spin asymmetry : \\\\delta_H = \\\\frac{\\\\beta^2}{1-\\\\beta^2}. Such a device, with resistance depending on the orientation of electron spin, is called a spin valve. It is \\"open\\", if the magnetizations of its layers are parallel, and \\"closed\\" otherwise. Valet-Fert model In 1993, Thierry Valet and Albert Fert presented a model for the giant magnetoresistance in the CPP geometry, based on the Boltzmann equations. In this model the chemical potential inside the magnetic layer is split into two functions, corresponding to electrons with spins parallel and antiparallel to the magnetization of the layer. If the non-magnetic layer is sufficiently thin then in the external field E0 the amendments to the electrochemical potential and the field inside the sample will take the form : \\\\Delta\\\\mu = \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{1-\\\\beta^2}eE_0\\\\ell_se^{z/\\\\ell_s}, : \\\\Delta E = \\\\frac{\\\\beta^2}{1-\\\\beta^2}eE_0\\\\ell_se^{z/\\\\ell_s}, where ‚Ñìs is the average length of spin relaxation, and the z coordinate is measured from the boundary between the magnetic and non-magnetic layers (z < 0 corresponds to the ferromagnetic). Thus electrons with a larger chemical potential will accumulate at the boundary of the ferromagnet. This can be represented by the potential of spin accumulation VAS or by the so-called interface resistance (inherent to the boundary between a ferromagnet and non-magnetic material) : R_i= \\\\frac{\\\\beta(\\\\mu_{\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow}-\\\\mu_{\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow})}{2ej} = \\\\frac{\\\\beta^2\\\\ell_{sN}\\\\rho_N}{1+(1-\\\\beta^2)\\\\ell_{sN}\\\\rho_N/(\\\\ell_{sF}\\\\rho_F)}, where j is current density in the sample, ‚ÑìsN and ‚ÑìsF are the length of the spin relaxation in a non-magnetic and magnetic materials, respectively. Device preparation =Materials and experimental data= Many combinations of materials exhibit GMR, and the most common are the following: * FeCr * Co10Cu90: Œ¥H = 40% at room temperature * [110]Co95Fe5/Cu: Œ¥H = 110% at room temperature. The magnetoresistance depends on many parameters such as the geometry of the device (CIP or CPP), its temperature, and the thicknesses of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers. At a temperature of 4.2 K and a thickness of cobalt layers of 1.5 nm, increasing the thickness of copper layers dCu from 1 to 10 nm decreased Œ¥H from 80 to 10% in the CIP geometry. Meanwhile, in the CPP geometry the maximum of Œ¥H (125%) was observed for dCu = 2.5 nm, and increasing dCu to 10 nm reduced Œ¥H to 60% in an oscillating manner. When a Co(1.2 nm)/Cu(1.1 nm) superlattice was heated from near zero to 300 K, its Œ¥H decreased from 40 to 20% in the CIP geometry, and from 100 to 55% in the CPP geometry. The non-magnetic layers can be non-metallic. For example, Œ¥H up to 40% was demonstrated for organic layers at 11 K. Graphene spin valves of various designs exhibited Œ¥H of about 12% at 7 K and 10% at 300 K, far below the theoretical limit of 109%. The GMR effect can be enhanced by spin filters that select electrons with a certain spin orientation; they are made of metals such as cobalt. For a filter of thickness t the change in conductivity ŒîG can be expressed as : \\\\Delta G = \\\\Delta G_{SV} + \\\\Delta G_f (1 - e^{\\\\beta t/\\\\lambda}), where ŒîGSV is change in the conductivity of the spin valve without the filter, ŒîGf is the maximum increase in conductivity with the filter, and Œ≤ is a parameter of the filter material. =Types of GMR= GMR is often classed by the type of devices which exhibit the effect. Films =Antiferromagnetic superlattices= GMR in films was first observed by Fert and Gr√ºnberg in a study of superlattices composed of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers. The thickness of the non-magnetic layers was chosen such that the interaction between the layers was antiferromagnetic and the magnetization in adjacent magnetic layers was antiparallel. Then an external magnetic field could make the magnetization vectors parallel thereby affecting the electrical resistance of the structure. Magnetic layers in such structures interact through antiferromagnetic coupling, which results in the oscillating dependence of the GMR on the thickness of the non-magnetic layer. In the first magnetic field sensors using antiferromagnetic superlattices, the saturation field was very large, up to tens of thousands of oersteds, due to the strong antiferromagnetic interaction between their layers (made of chromium, iron or cobalt) and the strong anisotropy fields in them. Therefore, the sensitivity of the devices was very low. The use of permalloy for the magnetic and silver for the non-magnetic layers lowered the saturation field to tens of oersteds. =Spin valves using exchange bias= In the most successful spin valves the GMR effect originates from exchange bias. They comprise a sensitive layer, \\"fixed\\" layer and an antiferromagnetic layer. The last layer freezes the magnetization direction in the \\"fixed\\" layer. The sensitive and antiferromagnetic layers are made thin to reduce the resistance of the structure. The valve reacts to the external magnetic field by changing the magnetization direction in the sensitive layer relatively to the \\"fixed\\" layer. The main difference of these spin valves from other multilayer GMR devices is the monotonic dependence of the amplitude of the effect on the thickness dN of the non-magnetic layers: : \\\\delta_H(d_N) = \\\\delta_{H0} \\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left(-d_N/\\\\lambda_N\\\\right)}{1 + d_N/d_0}, where Œ¥H0 is a normalization constant, ŒªN is the mean free path of electrons in the non- magnetic material, d0 is effective thickness that includes interaction between layers. The dependence on the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer can be given as: : \\\\delta_H(d_F) = \\\\delta_{H1} \\\\frac{1 - \\\\exp\\\\left(-d_F/\\\\lambda_F\\\\right)}{1 + d_F/d_0}. The parameters have the same meaning as in the previous equation, but they now refer to the ferromagnetic layer. =Non-interacting multilayers (pseudospin valves)= GMR can also be observed in the absence of antiferromagnetic coupling layers. In this case, the magnetoresistance results from the differences in the coercive forces (for example, it is smaller for permalloy than cobalt). In multilayers such as permalloy/Cu/Co/Cu the external magnetic field switches the direction of saturation magnetization to parallel in strong fields and to antiparallel in weak fields. Such systems exhibit a lower saturation field and a larger Œ¥H than superlattices with antiferromagnetic coupling. A similar effect is observed in Co/Cu structures. The existence of these structures means that GMR does not require interlayer coupling, and can originate from a distribution of the magnetic moments that can be controlled by an external field. =Inverse GMR effect= In the inverse GMR, the resistance is minimum for the antiparallel orientation of the magnetization in the layers. Inverse GMR is observed when the magnetic layers are composed of different materials, such as NiCr/Cu/Co/Cu. The resistivity for electrons with opposite spins can be written as \\\\rho_{\\\\uparrow,\\\\downarrow}=\\\\frac{2\\\\rho_F}{1\\\\pm\\\\beta}; it has different values, i.e. different coefficients Œ≤, for spin-up and spin-down electrons. If the NiCr layer is not too thin, its contribution may exceed that of the Co layer, resulting in inverse GMR. Note that the GMR inversion depends on the sign of the product of the coefficients Œ≤ in adjacent ferromagnetic layers, but not on the signs of individual coefficients. Inverse GMR is also observed if NiCr alloy is replaced by vanadium-doped nickel, but not for doping of nickel with iron, cobalt, manganese, gold or copper. GMR in granular structures GMR in granular alloys of ferromagnetic and non- magnetic metals was discovered in 1992 and subsequently explained by the spin- dependent scattering of charge carriers at the surface and in the bulk of the grains. The grains form ferromagnetic clusters about 10 nm in diameter embedded in a non-magnetic metal, forming a kind of superlattice. A necessary condition for the GMR effect in such structures is poor mutual solubility in its components (e.g., cobalt and copper). Their properties strongly depend on the measurement and annealing temperature. They can also exhibit inverse GMR. Applications =Spin-valve sensors= General principle A copy of the GMR sensor developed by Peter Gr√ºnberg One of the main applications of GMR materials is in magnetic field sensors, e.g., in hard disk drives and biosensors, as well as detectors of oscillations in MEMS. A typical GMR-based sensor consists of seven layers: #Silicon substrate, #Binder layer, #Sensing (non-fixed) layer, #Non-magnetic layer, #Fixed layer, #Antiferromagnetic (Pinning) layer, #Protective layer. The binder and protective layers are often made of tantalum, and a typical non-magnetic material is copper. In the sensing layer, magnetization can be reoriented by the external magnetic field; it is typically made of NiFe or cobalt alloys. FeMn or NiMn can be used for the antiferromagnetic layer. The fixed layer is made of a magnetic material such as cobalt. Such a sensor has an asymmetric hysteresis loop owing to the presence of the magnetically hard, fixed layer. Spin valves may exhibit anisotropic magnetoresistance, which leads to an asymmetry in the sensitivity curve. Hard disk drives In hard disk drives (HDDs), information is encoded using magnetic domains, and a change in the direction of their magnetization is associated with the logical level 1 while no change represents a logical 0. There are two recording methods: longitudinal and perpendicular. In the longitudinal method, the magnetization is normal to the surface. A transition region (domain walls) is formed between domains, in which the magnetic field exits the material. If the domain wall is located at the interface of two north-pole domains then the field is directed outward, and for two south-pole domains it is directed inward. To read the direction of the magnetic field above the domain wall, the magnetization direction is fixed normal to the surface in the antiferromagnetic layer and parallel to the surface in the sensing layer. Changing the direction of the external magnetic field deflects the magnetization in the sensing layer. When the field tends to align the magnetizations in the sensing and fixed layers, the electrical resistance of the sensor decreases, and vice versa. =Magnetic RAM= The use of a spin valve in MRAM. 1: spin valve as a memory cell (arrows indicate the presence of ferromagnetic layers), 2: row line, 3: column line. Ellipses with arrows denote the magnetic field lines around the row and column lines when electric current flows through them. A cell of magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) has a structure similar to the spin-valve sensor. The value of the stored bits can be encoded via the magnetization direction in the sensor layer; it is read by measuring the resistance of the structure. The advantages of this technology are independence of power supply (the information is preserved when the power is switched off owing to the potential barrier for reorienting the magnetization), low power consumption and high speed. In a typical GMR-based storage unit, a CIP structure is located between two wires oriented perpendicular to each other. These conductors are called lines of rows and columns. Pulses of electric current passing through the lines generate a vortex magnetic field, which affects the GMR structure. The field lines have ellipsoid shapes, and the field direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) is determined by the direction of the current in the line. In the GMR structure, the magnetization is oriented along the line. The direction of the field produced by the line of the column is almost parallel to the magnetic moments, and it can not reorient them. Line of the row is perpendicular, and regardless of the magnitude of the field can rotate the magnetization by only 90 ¬∞. With the simultaneous passage of pulses along the row and column lines, of the total magnetic field at the location of the GMR structure will be directed at an acute angle with respect to one point and an obtuse to others. If the value of the field exceeds some critical value, the latter changes its direction. There are several storage and reading methods for the described cell. In one method, the information is stored in the sensing layer; it is read via resistance measurement and is erased upon reading. In another scheme, the information is kept in the fixed layer, which requires higher recording currents compared to reading currents. Tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is an extension of spin-valve GMR, in which the electrons travel with their spins oriented perpendicularly to the layers across a thin insulating tunnel barrier (replacing the non-ferromagnetic spacer). This allows to achieve a larger impedance, a larger magnetoresistance value (~10x at room temperature) and a negligible temperature dependence. TMR has now replaced GMR in MRAMs and disk drives, in particular for high area densities and perpendicular recording. =Other applications= Magnetoresistive insulators for contactless signal transmission between two electrically isolated parts of electrical circuits were first demonstrated in 1997 as an alternative to opto-isolators. A Wheatstone bridge of four identical GMR devices is insensitive to a uniform magnetic field and reacts only when the field directions are antiparallel in the neighboring arms of the bridge. Such devices were reported in 2003 and may be used as rectifiers with a linear frequency response.

The title refers to the sterile insect technique, a technique of eradicating the population of screwflies by the release of large amounts of sterilized males that would compete with fertile males, thus reducing the native population more with each generation this is done. This story concerns a similar distortion of human sexuality with disastrous results. Plot summary The story begins with an exchange of letters and news clippings between Alan, a scientist working on parasite eradication in Colombia, and his wife Anne at home in the U.S., concerning an epidemic of organized murder of women by men. Some scientists suspect a biological cause for this sexually selective insanity (selected observations of lab animals indicate that the normal male sexual urges are spiraling out of control, resulting in death), but the murderers feel it is a natural instinct and have constructed elaborate misogynistic rationalizations for it. For example, a new religious movement is spreading along with the murders: the Sons of Adam, who believe that women are evil, that the garden was a paradise before women were introduced, and that God is telling them to get rid of all of the women. When the religion initially arises, prior to the organized murders, little is done to stop the ideology's spread, nor are their actions of evicting women from the areas the men control prevented. Alan realizes that the disease causes male sexual impulses to instead become violent impulses. Alan, a sensitive, kindly man, realizes that he himself is succumbing and tries to resist the impulses, as well as isolate himself from women. While this occurs, his wife and teenaged daughter have a number of mother-daughter conflicts: the daughter, faithful to her father, refuses to believe her mother's warnings about him. She sneaks off to visit her father, and he murders her, killing himself after the horrific realization of his action. Anne flees north, to Canada, since the disease began in the tropical zones and spread outward. After most of the world's women are dead, adult men start murdering boys. In the end, Anne, pursued by an entire society bent on femicide, discovers the source and motivation behind the plague: an alien species is intentionally causing the human race to destroy itself so that the aliens can have Earth for themselves.

Early stories of hers appeared in Charlotte Yonge's magazine Monthly Packet. On 1 June 1867, Julie married Major Alexander Ewing (1830‚Äì1895) of the Army Pay Corps. He was also a keen churchgoer and shared his wife's interest in literature. Within a week of their marriage, the Ewings left England for Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, where he had received a new posting.

Family Robert Fabyan was the son of John Fabyan and his wife, Agnes. He is said to have been born in London. He had a brother, John. His nephew, John Fabyan, married Anne Waldegrave, by whom he had a daughter, Mary Fabian, wife of Sir Thomas Spert. Career Mark of Richard Pynson, who printed Fabyan's Chronicle He was apprenticed as a draper to William Holme about 1470, and was granted the freedom of the Worshipful Company of Drapers in 1476. In 1485 he served as renter warden of the Drapers, and in 1486 as auditor of the accounts of the City of London. In 1493 he was elected Sheriff, and in the following year as alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without. In 1495 he was elected Master of the Drapers, and in 1496 was chosen to petition Henry VII on behalf of the Company with respect to the levies on cloth exported from England to Flanders. During the Cornish Rebellion of 1497 Fabyan, John Brooke and John Warner were charged with securing Ludgate and Newgate. After the suppression of the rebellion they travelled with the King to Woodstock. In 1498 he was one of the assessors of a subsidy levied to finance the war in Scotland. In 1501 he was again elected Master of the Drapers. In 1503 he resigned his office of alderman on the ground that he lacked the financial resources to support election as Lord Mayor. He is best known as the author of the work commonly known as Fabyan's Chronicle, which presents 'parallel histories of England and France', and covers the period from the arrival of the legendary Brutus of Troy in England to the death of Henry VII. Two manuscripts are extant (Holkham Hall, MS 671, and BL, Cotton MS Nero C.xi), and although these are not in Fabyan's hand, it is almost certain that the text is his. The chronicle was initially printed without attribution by Richard Pynson in 1516 as The New Chronicles of England and France, but an edition of 1533 printed by William Rastell bore Fabyan's name on the title page: . Both John Bale and John Stow described the chronicle as Fabyan's work, although according to McLaren, Stow also wrongly attributes to him the manuscript of the Great Chronicle (London, Guildhall Library, MS 3313), likely because both Fabyan's Chronicle and the Great Chronicle are written (or copied) in the same hand. A continuation in 1509 appears also to be attributable to Fabyan, and includes events personally witnessed by him, such as the arrest in 1468 of Thomas Cooke,Great-grandfather of Sir Anthony Cooke; . a prominent merchant in London, and the arrival in England in 1502 of three men, inhabitants of Newfoundland, 'whom the King kept a time after'. Fabyan was the first London chronicler to cite his sources, which included The Brut, Bede, William of Malmesbury, Ranulf Higden, Henry of Huntingdon and numerous others, as well as records of the City of London. John Bale claimed that the 1516 edition was burned by Cardinal Wolsey. The second edition of 1533 was printed after Wolsey's death, and was followed by editions in 1542 and 1559. Henry Ellis edited a modern edition in 1811. Fabyan was executor of the will of his father-in-law, and through his wife inherited a house called Halstedys together with other lands in Theydon Garnon, Essex. At his death he also owned tenements in the London parishes of St Benet Fink and St Michael's, Cornhill, as well as lands and tenements in East Ham, West Ham, Leyton and other towns in Essex. Stow states that Fabyan died in 1511, while Bale dates his death to 25 February 1512. Stow also records that he was buried at St Michael's Cornhill, where his monument is no longer extant, although Stow preserved the English part of his epitaph. In his will, proved 12 July 1513, he left bequests to his wife, his six surviving children, his cousin, Dorothy, and the mercer Robert Tate, Lord Mayor of London, among others. Marriage and issue Fabyan married Elizabeth Pake, daughter and heir of a London draper, John Pake, by Elizabeth Stokker, by whom he had sixteen children, only six of whom, four sons, John, Robert, Thomas, and Anthony, and two daughters, Joan Haryat and Mary, were alive at his death. Ellis notes that a John Fabyan, in his will dated 16 March 1541, mentions 'the Lady Spert' (see above) as his sister, and refers to the Earl of Southampton as his master. He also mentions another sister, Martha, to whom he bequeaths four nobles yearly, and the Lady Marney, to whom he bequeaths his books of meditation and his chronicles. McLaren suggest that this might be the will of 'a grandson of Robert'; however Baldwin's statement that Robert Fabyan had a nephew, John Fabyan, whose daughter Mary married Sir Thomas Spert (see above), suggests that the 1541 will was the will of the son of Robert Fabyan's nephew.

The work gained for him the patronage of the Duke of York, through whose influence he obtained the position of purser on various warships. He had himself been one of three survivors of a trading ship on voyage from Alexandria to Venice. In 1751 he wrote and published a poem on the death of Frederick, Prince of Wales.

This book deals mainly with the individual, while his second book Rumuz-i-Bekhudi discusses the interaction between the individual and society.(12 October 1931). Iqbal's letter to The Times (of London) writersblocktgh.blogspot.co.uk Introduction Published in 1915, Asrar-i- Khudi (Secrets of the Self) was the first poetry book of Iqbal. Considered by many to be Iqbal's best book of poetry, it is concerned with the philosophy of religion. In a letter to the poet Ghulam Qadir Girami(d.1345/1927), Iqbal wrote that \\"the ideas behind the verses had never been expressed before either in the East or in the West.\\" R.A. Nicholson, who translated the Asrar as The Secrets of the Self, says it caught the attention of young Muslims as soon as it was printed. Iqbal wrote this in Persian because he felt the language was well-suited for the expression of these ideas. Overview In 1915, he published his first collection of poetry, the Asrar-e-Khudi (Secrets of the Self) in Persian. The poems emphasise the spirit and self from a religious, spiritual perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's finest poetic work In Asrar-e-Khudi, Iqbal has explained his philosophy of \\"Khudi,\\" or \\"Self.\\" Iqbal' s use of term \\"Khudi\\" is synonymous with the word of \\"Rooh\\" as mentioned in the Quran. \\"Rooh\\" is that divine spark which is present in every human being and was present in Adam for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam. However, one has to make a great journey of transformation to realize that divine spark which Iqbal calls \\"Khudi\\". A similitude of this journey could be understood by the relationship of fragrance and seed. Every seed has the potential for fragrance within it. But to reach its fragrance the seed must go through all the different changes and stages. First breaking out of its shell. Then breaking the ground to come into the light developing roots at the same time. Then fighting against the elements to develop leaves and flowers. Finally reaching its pinnacle by attaining the fragrance that was hidden within it. In the same way, to reach one's khudi or rooh one needs to go through multiple stages which Iqbal himself went through, spiritual path which he encourages others to travel. He notes that not all seeds reach the level of fragrance. Many die along the way, incomplete. In the same way, only few people could climb this Mount Everest of spirituality, most get consumed along the way by materialism. The same concept had been used by the Medieval poet and philosopher Farid ud-Din Attar in his \\"Mantaq-ul-Tair\\" (\\"The Conference of the Birds\\"). Iqbal proves by various means that the whole universe obeys the will of the \\"Self.\\" He condemns self- destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the \\"Self\\" has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the \\"Self\\" to become the vicegerent of God.

Pre-Brythonic Armorica includes the ancient megalith cultures in the area and the Celtic tribal territories that existed before Roman rule. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, large scale migration from the British Isles led to the foundation of British colonies linked initially to homelands in Cornwall, Devon, and Wales. The various independent petty Breton states later developed into a Kingdom and then a Duchy of Brittany, before it was unified with France to become a province. After the French Revolution Brittany was abolished as an administrative unit, but continued to retain its distinctive cultural identity. Its administrative existence was reconstituted, in reduced size, as the Region of Brittany in the mid-20th century. The history of Brittany begins with settlement beginning in prehistoric times, beginning around 700 000 BCE. The neolithic era, which began around 5000 BCE, is characterised in the region by the development of an important megalithic art found in sites such as the cairn of Barnenez, the cairn of Gavrinis, the table of the Merchants of Locmariaquer or the alignments of Carnac. In the course of its protohistory which began around the middle of the third century BCE, a subsoil rich in tin allowed the development of an industry in bronze objects, which led to commercial routes for export to other regions of Europe. It was inhabited by Gallic peoples including the Veneti and the Namnetes in the first centuries BCE before these territories were conquered by Julius Caesar in 57 BCE, and progressively Romanized. As part of Armorica since the Gallo-Roman period, Brittany developed an important maritime trade network near the ports of Nantes, Vannes, and Alet, as well as salting factories along its coasts. When Rome encountered crises in the third and fifth centuries, the first wave of island Bretons were asked by the imperial power to help secure their territory, beginning with a migratory movement that was carried out until the sixth century, and saw the beginnings of many kingdoms in the peninsula. In order to prevent Breton incursion, the neighbouring Frankish kingdom created a Breton borderland incorporating the counties of Rennes and Nantes. From the sixth to ninth centuries however, the Merovingian dynasty and the Carolingian dynasty tried to integrate the region into the Frankish kingdom, with limited and ephemeral success. The union of the country as Brittany occurred in 851 under King Erispo√´, son of Nomino√´, but was disrupted by disputes over succession and Norsemen incursions. Since 939, Brittany was re-established as a Sovereign Duchy with somewhat definite borders, administered by Dukes of Breton houses from 939 to 1166, before falling into the sphere of influence of the Plantagenets and then the Capets. The War of the Breton Succession lasted from 1341 to 1364 against the backdrop of the Hundred Years' War. An autonomous power emerged in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, maintaining a policy of independence from France. The union of Brittany to France occurred in 1532. The Breton province then maintained relative autonomy and benefited from its own institutions. After a period of strong economic and demographic growth in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, due to a period of newfound peace, Brittany experienced a troubled period from the end of the seventeenth century to the French Revolution of 1789. Brittany was dissolved in 1789 and divided among the departments of C√¥tes-du-Nord, Finist√®re, Ille- et-Vilaine, Loire-Inf√©rieure and Morbihan. After a long nineteenth century marked by a modernization of agriculture and by huge increases in population, an emigration to the rest of France began. Although a traditionally conservative region, Brittany saw the rise of workers' movements in cities such as Brest, Lorient and Saint-Nazaire. The First World War was an important turning point for Bretons, who discovered new ways of life, which some would seek to integrate little by little. The question of the proper place for the Breton language and regional traditions became the central element of a political movement which began to emerge in the same era. A long process of modernization took place from the 1920s through the 1970s, in concert with a movement of cultural reaffirmation.  Prehistory of Brittany  = Stone Age =  Paleolithic  The Paleolithic period of Brittany ranges from 700 000 to 10 000 years BC. Traces of the oldest industries were found in the middle valley of the Vilaine river, identified as pebbles arranged in a quarry in Saint-Malo-de-Phily.. The oldest traces of habitat are located in Saint- Colomban, in Carnac, and take the form of settlements built in natural shelters (cliffs created by the erosion along the coasts). In addition to pebble, bifaces are found there, and the site dates to 300,000 BC. J.-C. Acheulian bifacials from this period are found along the sea coast, as Treguennec, H√¥pital-Camfrout or Pl√©neuf. The oldest traces of fire use (in the region but also of occidental Europe) are found on the site of Menez Dregan with a date making them up to 400 000 years BC. The few human groups are then made of hunter-gatherers.. From the Middle-Mousterian period, remain two outstanding sites in the region, in Mont-Dol where scrapers were found in a site dated to 70,000 BC. , as well as at Goar√©va on the island of Br√©hat. The Upper Paleolithic is characterized by a refined tools like blades and lamellae found on the site of Beg-ar-C'Hastel in Kerlouan, or at Plasenn-al-Lomm on the island of Br√©hat. No painted cave is identified in the area, probably because of the rise of the level of the sea during the next period waters ; but the nearest cave of this type is known in Saulges. The end of the Palaeolithic period in the region is around 10,000 BC. J.-C.  Mesolithic  The Mesolithic period covers in the region a period from 10,000 BC. to 5000 BC. , corresponding to the end of the last Ice Age and the resulting rise in water level. Steppe vegetation is replaced by a vegetation of birch and pine, and hazel, oak and elms; large mammals give way to animals of smaller size as deer or wild boar. Men abandon the hunt for the picking and the first domestication trials appear. The population is mainly coastal and larger on the south coast. The skeletons found from this period attest to an average size of 1.59 meters for men and 1.52 m for women. Human technology continue to progress with a reduction in size of stone tools to form microliths. Human societies are more structured, with a degree of specialization of activities in a given community (as indicated by studies of the T√©viec burial site) and the beginning of an artistic expression. Traces of deaths caused by tools like arrows are also visible on some skeletons, attesting to sometimes violent conflicts between different communities.  Neolithic  The Neolithic period (stretching from 5000 BC to 2000 BC.) saw the arrival of an agriculture based on slash- and-burn: land is reclaimed from the forest after having fired and is then used for breeding before sprinkling grass. This evolution was made possible by the development of methods of extracting stones and their shaping. In a quarry in Plussulien, about 5000 dolerite axes were extracted per year, representing 40% of the axes of the Breton peninsula. The dissemination of these tools stretched to Paris basin, and 10 copies of these axes were found to Belgium and southern England. The region also imported yellow blond flint blades from Touraine. This period is also notable for the development of megalithic monuments, helped by a significant economic growth. Two of the most ancient sites, the mound of Barnenez and the Petit-Mont, whose buildings date back to 5000 BC., evidenced by their similarities to a unity of culture in the peninsula. This type of construction will eventually evolve and provide more regional variants.. In these burial sites were found engravings similar to those observed in Irish sites like Newgrange.. Besides these barrows are also present menhirs, the highest known being in the Leon region where the largest, that of Kerloas, rises to 9.50 m. The largest ever erected is located in South Brittany in Locmariaquer: the Locmariaquer megaliths amounting to 18.5 m. Engravings can also be found there and their functions are multiple: Indicator of burials, astronomical and topographic features, or reflecting a water worship. The last menhirs were raised around 1800-1500 BC. They can be combined in single or multiple rows, or in semicircles or circles.. = Protohistory = Iron Age A variety of tribes are mentioned in Roman sources, like the Veneti, Armoricani, Osismii, Namnetes and Coriosolites. Strabo and Poseidonius describe the Armoricani as belonging to the Belgae. Armorican gold coins have been widely exported and are even found in the Rhineland. Salterns are widespread in Northern Armorica, for example at Tr√©gor, Ebihens and Enez Vihan near Pleumeur-Bodou (C√¥tes-d'Armor) and the island of Yoc'h near Landuvez (Finist√®re) of late La T√®ne date. An estimated 40‚Äì55 kg of salt per oven were produced at Ebihens. Each oven was about 2 m long. The site dates to the end of the early La T√®ne or the middle La T√®ne period. Numerous briquetage remains have been found. At Tregor, boudins de Calage (hand-bricks) were the typical form of briquetage, between 2.5 and 15 cm long and with a diameter of 4‚Äì7 cm. At the salterns at Landrellec and Enez Vihan at Pleumeur-Bodou the remains of rectangular ovens have been excavated that are 2.5‚Äì3 m long and about 1 m wide, constructed of stones and clay. On the Gulf of Morbihan about 50 salterns have been found so far, mainly dating to the final La T√©ne period. Roman rule In 56 BC the area was conquered by the Romans under Julius Caesar. The main resistance came from the Veneti. After their defeat their leaders were killed and the tribe sold as slaves. The Romans called the district Armorica (a Latinisation of a Celtic word meaning \\"coastal region\\"), part of the Gallia Lugdunensis province. The modern d√©partement of C√¥tes-d'Armor has taken up the ancient name. After the reforms of Diocletian, it was part of the diocesis Galliarum. The uprising of the Bagaudae in the 3rd century led to unrest and depopulation, numerous villages were destroyed. Thick layers of black earth in the towns point to urban depopulation as well. The rule of Constantine (307‚Äì350) led to a certain renaissance. Numerous coins were minted. At the tractus Armoricanus, new forts were built, for example at Brest, Avranches and Le Yaudet. The Notitia Dignitatum (circa 400 AD) mentions a number of local units manning the Tractus armoricanus et nervicanus, for example Mauritanian troops in the territory of the Veneti and Osismii. Frankish laeti were present in Rennes. Christianisation is commonly dated to the late fourth century, but material evidence is rare. Middle Ages =Early Middle Ages= Arrival of the Bretons Map of British settlements in the 6th century. In the 380s, a large number of Britons in the Roman army may have been stationed in Armorica. The 9th century Historia Brittonum states that the emperor Magnus Maximus, who withdrew Roman forces from Britania, settled the troops there. Other British and Welsh authors (Nennius and Gildas) mention a second wave of South-Western Britons from Dumnonia, settling in Armorica in the following century to escape the invading Anglo-Saxons and Irish. Modern archaeology supports a two-wave migration.L√©on Fleuriot, Les origines de la Bretagne: l'√©migration, Paris, Payot, 1980. These Britons gave the region its current name and contributed the Breton language, Brezhoneg, a sister language to Welsh and Cornish. (Brittany used to be known in English as Little Britain to distinguish it from Great Britain - the street in London called Little Britain was the location of the embassy of the Duchy of Brittany). Conan Meriadoc, the mythic founder of the house of Rohan, is mentioned by medieval Welsh sources as having led the settlement of Brittany by mercenaries serving Maximus. The Welsh text The Dream of Maxen, which contains semi-factual information about the usurpation of Maximus, states that they married native women after cutting out their tongues to preserve the purity of their language.The Mabinogion trans. Lady Charlotte Guest. This can be interpreted as a legend formulated in order to explain the Welsh (Brythonic) name for Brittany, Llydaw, as originating from lled-taw or \\"half-silent\\". In fact, the term \\"Llydaw\\" or \\"Ledav\\" in early Breton probably derives from the Celtic name Litavis. There are numerous records of missionaries migrating from Britania during the second wave, especially the Seven founder-saints of Brittany and Saint Gildas. Many Breton towns are named for these early saints. The Irish saint Colombanus also evangelised Brittany, commemorated at Saint-Columban in Carnac. The earliest text known in the Breton language, a botanical treatise, dates from 590 (for comparison, the earliest text in French dates from 843).Source:Leiden University, the Netherlands. Most of the early Breton language medieval manuscripts were lost during the Viking invasions. The Petty Kingdoms In the Early Middle Ages, Brittany was divided into three kingdoms - *Domnonia (Devnent), *Cornouaille (Kernev), and *Bro Waroc'h (Bro√´rec) - which eventually were incorporated into the larger Breton state. The first two kingdoms derive their names from the homelands of the migrating Britons (Devon and Cornwall). Bro Waroc'h (\\"land of Waroch\\") derives from the name of one of the first known Breton rulers, who dominated the region of Vannes (Gwened). The rulers of Domnonia such as Conomor sought to expand their territory (including holdings in British Devon and Cornwall), claiming overlordship over all Bretons, though there was constant tension between local lords. =Resistance to outside rule= Partition of the Carolingian Empire in 843 During the 9th century the Bretons resisted incorporation into the Frankish Carolingian Empire. The first unified Duchy of Brittany was founded by Nominoe. The Bretons made friendly overtures to the Danish Vikings to help contain Frankish expansionist ideas. When the Carolingian empire was divided in 843, Nominoe took advantage of the confusion to consolidate his territory. In alliance with Lambert II of Nantes and the Viking warlord Hastein, Nominoe's son Erispoe defeated the Franks at the Battle of Messac. In 845 the Breton army under Nominoe defeated the forces of Charles the Bald, King of West Francia (France), at the Battle of Ballon, in the eastern part of Brittany near Redon and the Frankish border. Nominoe gained control over the major towns of Rennes and Nantes, which had previously formed part of the Frankish border zone known as the \\"Breton March\\". Control over Rennes, Nantes and the Pays de Retz was secured when the Frankish army was defeated once again in 851 at the Battle of Jengland by the Bretons under Erispoe; consequently Charles the Bald recognised the independence of Brittany and determined the borders that defined the historic duchy and later province. Under Erispoe's successor Salomon, Hastein's Vikings and the Bretons united as one in 865 to defeat a Frankish army at the Battle of Brissarthe, near modern- day Le Mans. Two Frankish leaders, Robert the Strong and Ranulf, were killed by the Vikings. The Franks were forced to confirm Brittany's independence from the Frankish kingdoms and expand Salomon's territory. The Vikings tactically helped their Breton allies by making devastating pillaging raids on the Frankish kingdoms. This unfortunately became a double edged sword over the next few decades as the Vikings turned on the Bretons and pillaged Brittany eventually occupying it. This situation was only overturned with the return of exiled Bretons and a alliance with the Franks. From this point Brittany became a Duchy with various levels of fealty to West Francia and eventually France. =High Middle Ages= Bretons took part in the Revolt of 1173‚Äì1174, siding with the rebels against Henry II of England. Henry's son Geoffroy II, then heir apparent to the Duchy of Brittany, resisted his father's attempts to annex Brittany to the possessions of the English Crown. Geoffroy's son Arthur did likewise during his reign (1186-1203) until his death, perhaps by assassination under King John's orders. In 1185, Geoffroy II signed \\"Count Geoffrey's Assise\\" which forbade the subdivision of fiefs, thereby reinforcing the Breton feudal system. After the presumed death of Duke Arthur I, with Arthur's full elder sister Eleanor captive under John of England, the Bretons supported Arthur's half younger sister Alix instead. King Philip August of France married Alix to the Capetian prince Peter Mauclerc of Dreux, establishing Peter as regent of Alix. In 1213, with the aim of strengthening his power in Brittany, Philip August introduced Peter as administrator of the duchy and tutor of his son, duke Jehan of Brittany. It was Peter Mauclerc who introduced the use of ermines in the Breton coat of arms and came to espouse the cause of his fief's independence with respect to France. While John attempted to regain Brittany in the name of Eleanor, he was defeated in 1214 and finally recognized Alix and Peter. Eleanor ended up in English prison without issue, with her claim never raised ever since. The 14th and 15th centuries saw the recognition of the distinction between a Gallo-speaking Britannia gallicana (now called Upper Brittany) and a Breton-speaking Britannia britonizans (now Lower Brittany).John T. Koch (ed.), Celtic Culture: a historical encyclopedia, Volumes 1-5 (2006), p. 244 The Breton War of Succession was fought 1341-1364\\\\. The parties were the half-brother of the last duke, John of Montfort (supported by the English) and his niece, Joanna of Penthi√®vre, who was married to Charles of Blois, nephew of the king of France. This protracted conflict, a component of the Hundred Years' War, has passed into legend (see for example Combat of the Thirty and Bertrand de Guesclin). Its outcome was decided at the Battle of Auray in 1364, where the House of Montfort was victorious over the French party. After the first Treaty of Gu√©rande, Joanna of Penthi√®vre abdicated her claims to the dukedom in favour of John the Conqueror. A modified form of Salic law was introduced in Brittany as a result. In the midst of the conflict, in 1352, the √âtats de Bretagne or Estates of Brittany were established. They would develop into the Duchy's parlement. The tomb of Francis II in Nantes Deserted by his nobles, duke John IV left for exile in England in 1373. The higher nobility of that time, like the house of Coetmen-Penthi√®vre, or the house of Roug√©, descendants of the former kings of Brittany, strongly supported the Penthi√®vre side and nearly extinguished in the repeated fights between Montfort and Penthi√®vre's troops. The king of France Charles V named as lieutenant-general of Brittany his brother, the duke of Anjou (also a son-in-law of Joanna de Penthi√®vre). In 1378, the king of France sought to annex Brittany, which provoked the Bretons to recall John IV from exile. The second Treaty of Gu√©rande (1381) established Brittany's neutrality in the Anglo-French conflict, although John continued to swear homage to Charles VI. In 1420, duke John V was kidnapped by the count of Penthi√®vre, son of Joanna of Penthi√®vre. John's wife, duchess Joanna de France besieged the rebels and set free her husband, who confiscated the Penthi√®vre's goods. In 1464 the Catholicon, a Breton-Latin-French dictionary by Jehan Lagadeuc, was published. This book was the world's first trilingual dictionary, the first Breton dictionary and also the first French dictionary. The army of the Kingdom of France, with the help of 5,000 mercenaries from Switzerland and Italy, defeated the Breton army in 1488, and the last Duke of independent Brittany, Francis II, was forced to submit to a treaty giving the King of France the right to determine the marriage of the Duke's daughter, a 12-year-old girl, the heir to the Duchy. The Duchess Anne was the last independent ruler of the duchy as she was ultimately obliged to marry Louis XII of France. The duchy passed on her death to her daughter Claude, but Claude's husband Francis I of France incorporated the duchy into the Kingdom of France in 1532 through the Edict of Union between Brittany and France, which was registered with the Estates of Brittany. Modern era =Early modern period= After 1532, Brittany retained a certain fiscal and regulatory autonomy, which was defended by the Estates of Brittany despite the rising tide of royal absolutism. Brittany remained on the whole strongly Catholic during the period of the Huguenots and the Wars of Religion, although Protestantism made some headway in Nantes and a few other areas. From 1590‚Äì98, during the War of the Catholic League, Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc≈ìur (governor of Brittany and husband of the countess of Penthi√®vre) sought to have himself proclaimed Duke of Brittany and allied with Philip II of Spain. The latter, on the other hand, considered establishing his daughter Isabella at the head of a reconstituted Brittany. Henry IV, however, brought Merc≈ìur to an honourable surrender. During the era of Colbert, Brittany benefited from France's naval expansion. Major ports were built or renovated at Saint-Malo, Brest, and Lorient, and Bretons came to constitute a leading component of the French navy. Bretons played an important role in the colonization of New France and the West Indies (see French colonisation of the Americas). In 1675, insurgents in the diocese of Cornouaille and elsewhere rose up in the Revolt of the Bonnets Rouges. The rebels, in contact with Holland, were expecting assistance that never came. S√©bastian Ar Balp, the leader of the rebellion, was assassinated by the Marquis de Montgaillard whom Ar Balp was holding prisoner. The rebellion was repressed by the duc de Chaulnes, and hundreds of Bretons were hanged or broken on the wheel. Madame de S√©vign√© claimed that French soldiers garrisoned in Rennes had roasted a Breton infant on a spit. A whole street in Rennes, suspected of seditiousness, was demolished leaving the inhabitants homeless.Arthur de La Borderie. \\"La R√©volte du Papier Timbr√© advenu en Bretagne en 1675\\". Saint-Brieuc 1884. In the conspiracy of Pontcallec of 1720, members of the petty nobility in contact with Spain led a tax revolt against the R√©gence. The marquis de Pontcallec and three others were tried and executed in Nantes for the uprising. During the 18th century, Nantes rose to become one of the most important commercial centres of France. The backbone of Nantes's prosperity was the Atlantic slave trade. On 4 August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly in Paris unanimously proclaimed the abolition of feudal privileges. These included the privileges of the provinces such as Brittany. Brittany thus lost the juridical existence, autonomy, Parlement, and administrative, fiscal and legal peculiarities guaranteed since the Edict of Union of 1532. Although the Breton Club (better known as the Jacobins) in Paris had initiated the move to abolish feudal distinctions, the decision proved increasingly unpopular in Brittany, where the loss of local autonomy and the increasingly anti-clerical character of the Revolution were resented. Many Bretons took part in the Chouannerie, the royalist insurgency assisted by Great Britain and allied with the revolt in the Vend√©e. Brittany thus became a hotbed of resistance to the French Revolution. The territory of Brittany was divided in 1789 into five d√©partements, partially on the basis of earlier divisions called pr√©sidiaux which in turn had issued from medieval bailliages. =Revolutionary period= Many Bretons, especially members of the merchant class, were sympathetic to the monarchy during the French Revolution. In 1791, Bretons began to plan a re-establishment of the Estates General of the province, and a return to the three-tiered system. The Marquis de la Rou√´rie was a significant figure in this plot but ultimately ended up in hiding after a secret agent divulged his participation to Georges Danton.Kropotkin, The Great French Revolution, 1927. Despite the obstacle posed by one of the plot's major architects going into hiding, the insurrection continued on aided by the English, as they desired access to the ports on Brittany's coast. Brittany was especially vulnerable to the British since the Breton naval fleet was weakened by September 1793 due to previous mutinies and the restructuring of the military.Popkin, A Short History of the French Revolution, 2015, p. 78. Brittany, with its weak infrastructure, was poorly connected to the rest of France. The British only wanted to end the war with the goal of preserving \\"the old balance of power on the Continent.‚ÄùPalmer, Twelve Who Ruled: The Year of the Terror in the French Revolution, 1941, p. 206. Normally, cities in Brittany were used for their naval importance, but they eventually became industrialized because of the Republic, which prepared them for war. The Committee of Public Safety was preparing to attack England as the English had significant influence in the towns of Saint-Malo and Brest, and some revolutionaries feared that these towns would give themselves up to the English as Toulon had done.Palmer, Twelve Who Ruled: The Year of the Terror in the French Revolution, 1941, p. 209. In light of these mounting foreign threats, the Committee of Public Safety sent Republican forces known as ‚ÄòRepresentatives on a Mission‚Äô to local regions‚Äîsuch as Brittany‚Äîto ensure the preservation of national unity within France.Carrier & Carrier, Correspondence of Jean-Baptiste Carrier during His Mission in Brittany, 1920, p. 1. The function of these Representatives, by order of the National Convention, was to replace the local government leaders. In doing so, the Representatives were meant to quell anti-revolutionary sentiment.Carrier & Carrier, Correspondence of Jean-Baptiste Carrier during His Mission in Brittany, 1920, p. 1. The order of the National Convention on August 14, 1793 declared that these Representatives ‚Äútake every measure of interior and exterior defense which they may consider necessary‚Äù contributed to the nation-wide violence experienced during the Terror.Carrier & Carrier, Correspondence of Jean-Baptiste Carrier during His Mission in Brittany, 1920, p. 7. Jean-Baptiste Carrier, one prominent Representative on a Mission, who had been sent to Brittany, dutifully reported to the Committee of Public Safety that he would ‚Äúarrest those declared guilty of the counter- revolutionary disorders committed by this company.‚ÄùCarrier & Carrier, Correspondence of Jean-Baptiste Carrier during His Mission in Brittany, 1920, p. 18. Pierre Louis Prieur, another such Representative on a Mission, was involved in extinguishing the uprisings in the coastal towns of Brittany such as Lorient and Vannes. The peasants in Brittany were royalist and opposed the new government. Prieur sought to implement the authority of the Convention by arresting suspected counter-revolutionaries, removing the local authorities of Brittany, and making speeches. In Vannes, there was an unfavorable attitude towards the Revolution with only 200 of the city's population of 12,000 accepting the new constitution. Prieur declared Brittany's countryside overcome by fanaticism in order to justify terror as the new order. Prieur then infiltrated cities with troops and conducted house searches to locate and silence rebellious aristocrats and peasants.Palmer, Twelve Who Ruled: The Year of the Terror in the French Revolution, 1941, p. 210. While arrests were the first defense of the newly established government against counter- revolutionaries, fear quickly mounted concerning the power of this group. Quickly, leaders such as Carrier had moved from ordering arrests to ordering executions of anyone found guilty of treason against the state.Carrier & Carrier, Correspondence of Jean-Baptiste Carrier during His Mission in Brittany, 1920, p. 18. =Post-Revolutionary period= A Breton couple (L√©na and Th√©odore Botrel) wearing traditional Breton costumes at the beginning of the 20th century In the 19th-century Brittany acquired a reputation for timeless autarky, as Romantics developed an image of the province as a bastion of peasant traditionalism, religious festivals, and wild landscapes. At the same time, Breton life became increasingly integrated with that of the rest of France, particularly under the Third Republic. However, the image of Brittany as anti-republican led French politicians to doubt the reliability of Breton soldiers during the military actions that followed the collapse of the Second French Empire, as resulted from the disastrous French defeat in the Battle of Sedan during the Franco-Prussian War. Fearing Breton separatist sentiments, the soldiers were interned in a military camp, Camp Conlie, outside Le Mans. Because of bad conditions, worsened by mud and rain, several hundreds died from disease. The camp has been described as a \\"concentration camp\\" and became a significant atrocity story within Breton nationalism. In 1871 the camp was closed and the French military decided to incorporate the remaining 19,000 Breton soldiers into the 2nd Army of the Loire. They participated in the Battle of Le Mans, but poorly equipped, they were crushed by the Prussians and also blamed for the defeat by the French commanders. Brittany has had its own regionalist and separatist movements which have experienced varying success at elections and other political contests. Modern Breton nationalism developed at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. The main body of these movements situated themselves within the Catholic traditionalist current. After 1944, Breton nationalism was widely discredited thanks to the collaboration of a number of prominent nationalists (such as Roparz Hemon) with the Nazis, who occupied Brittany along with most of the rest of the French state during the Second World War. On the other hand, other Breton nationalists took part in the Resistance. Brittany played a particularly important role in the Resistance thanks to its proximity to Great Britain, the relatively rugged landscape, and the presence of important naval installations. However, during the Second World War the Allies bombed Brittany along with the rest of Northern France with such ferocity that many towns such as Lorient nearly ceased to exist. The act involved the killing of many thousands of French citizens. In the case of Lorient, the town was not freed until the end of the war and the submarine pens were not destroyed unlike the civilian areas which had been wiped out. When France was divided into administrative regions by the Vichy government, the official Brittany Region included only four of the five departments traditionally understood to comprise the Breton territory. This removal of Loire-Atlantique, which contains Nantes (one of the two traditional Breton capitals) from the Breton region has been a matter of much controversy. An experimental nuclear power station was constructed at Brennilis in the Monts d'Arr√©e during the 1960s. This was in operation for about ten years, and since 1988 it has been in the process of being dismantled. This is the first time that a nuclear power station has been dismantled in France. Since the 1960s in particular Breton nationalism has developed a strong leftist character, alongside the Catholic traditionalist strain. Certain groups such as the FLB and the ARB, marginal even within nationalist circles, made headlines through sabotage against highly symbolic targets. In March 1972, workers at the Joint Fran√ßais, a factory in Saint-Brieuc, went on strike to obtain a wage increase. The strike lasted eight weeks. Since the 1940s, use of the Breton language has declined precipitously. In most Breton-speaking communities, it has become uncommon for children born since 1945 to acquire much of the language as French becomes universalized. On the other hand, Breton has enjoyed increasing support among intellectuals and professionals since the 1970s, and the relatively small, urban-based Diwan movement has sought to stem the loss of young Breton speakers through bilingual immersion schools. Breton music has also become more widely known through the work of musicians such as Alan Stivell. On 16 March 1978, the supertanker Amoco Cadiz ran aground a few hundred metres from the shores of the small port of Portsall in Ploudalm√©zeau. The result was the fifth-largest oil spill in world history which severely affected the north and northwest coasts of Brittany. In February and March 1980, the population of Plogoff, the commune containing the Pointe du Raz, demonstrated to prevent the construction of a nuclear power generator in their commune, despite the paratroopers and helicopters sent by the government. They received a wide support from the media. The power station project was abandoned after the presidential elections of 1981, which brought Fran√ßois Mitterrand to power. In 2014, the Bonnets Rouges destroyed hundreds of highway speed cameras, tax portals, and tax bureau offices in their successful direct action campaign to have the \\"ecotaxe\\" abolished.

Richard Farmer FRS FSA (1735‚Äì1797) was a Shakespearean scholar and Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He is known for his Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare (1767), in which he maintained that Shakespeare's knowledge of the classics was through translations, the errors of which he reproduced. Life Farmer was born at Leicester on 28 August 1735, the second son of Richard Farmer, a maltster, by his wife Hannah, daughter of John Knibb. He was educated under the Rev. Gerrard Andrewes, in the free grammar school at Leicester, and about 1753 entered as a pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1757, and was a 'senior optime.' He successfully contested with Wanley Sawbridge for the silver cup given at Emmanuel College to the best graduate of that year. In 1760 he commenced M.A., and succeeded the Rev. Mr. Bickham as classical tutor of his college. For many years, while tutor, he served the curacy of Swavesey. On 19 May 1763 Farmer was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1765 he was junior proctor of the university. He had already formed an extensive library and had acquired a reputation as a scholar and antiquary. When Samuel Johnson visited Cambridge in 1765 he had a 'joyous meeting' with Farmer at Emmanuel.An account written by an eye-witness, B. N. Turner, of Denton, Lincolnshire, is in the New Monthly Magazine for December 1818 (x. 388). The two scholars afterwards maintained a correspondence on literary topics; on one occasion Johnson requested Farmer to help George Steevens on translations which Shakespeare might have seen, and on another he himself asked for information from the university registers on Cambridge graduates in the Lives of the Poets. In 1767 he took the degree of B.D., and on 8 July 1769 Richard Terrick, bishop of London, appointed him one of the preachers at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall. When in London he usually resided at the house of Dr. Anthony Askew, the eminent physician, in Queen Square, Bloomsbury. In 1775, on the death of Dr. Richardson, he was chosen master of Emmanuel College, Henry Hubbard, the senior fellow, having declined the post. He now took the degree of D.D., and was very soon succeeded in the tutorship by Dr. William Bennet, later bishop of Cloyne. He served the office of vice-chancellor of the university in 1775‚Äì6, and again in 1787‚Äì8. During his first term of office the university voted an address to the king, in support of the American policy of the government. One member of the Caput refused to give up the key of the place containing the university seal, and Farmer is said to have forced open the door with a sledge-hammer‚Äîan exploit which some biographers allege to have been the cause of all his subsequent preferments. On the death of Dr. Barnardiston, master of Corpus Christi College, he was (27 June 1778) unanimously elected principal librarian of the university. In April 1780 he was collated by Bishop Richard Hurd to the prebend of Alrewas in Lichfield Cathedral. In March 1782 he was installed a canon in the ninth prebend of the church of Canterbury. After enjoying this prebend for several years he resigned it on being preferred by William Pitt to a canonry residentiary and the prebend of Consumpta-per-Mare at St Paul's Cathedral, on 19 March 1788. The last years of his life were divided between Emmanuel College and the residentiary house in Amen Corner. He was a member of clubs: the Eum√©lean Club at Blenheim Tavern, Bond Street, of which Dr. John Ash was president, the Unincreasable Club, Queen's Head, Holborn, of which Isaac Reed was president, and the Literary Club, founded by Dr. Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. Farmer twice declined a bishopric that was offered to him by Pitt as a reward for his Tory principles. In 1796 he was admitted ad eundem at Oxford. He died, after a long and painful illness, at the lodge of Emmanuel College, on 8 September 1797, and was buried in the chapel. A monument was erected to his memory in the cloisters, inscribed with a Latin epitaph composed by Samuel Parr. A portrait of him was engraved by John Jones from a painting by George Romney. Works His friend Isaac Reed remarked on his easy way at Emmanuel as a successful Master; but as a scholar he was not productive. When a young man he wrote some Directions for Studying the English History, which were printed in the European Magazine for 1791 and in William Seward's Biographiana. On 15 May 1766 Farmer issued from the university press proposals for printing the history of Leicester, written by Thomas Staveley; but eventually abandoned this plan. Staveley's collections, together with those of the Rev. Samuel Carte, several original manuscripts, and some engraved plates, he presented to John Nichols, who made use of them in his work Leicestershire. In 1767 he brought out the first edition of his only published work, an Essay on the Learning of Shakspeare (Cambridge), addressed to his friend and schoolfellow, Joseph Cradock of Gumley. A second expanded edition came out in the same year. A third edition was printed at London in 1789. A fourth edition appeared at London in 1821. The essay is also in George Steevens's edition of Shakespeare 1793, in Reed's edition 1803, in Harris's edition 1812, and in Boswell's 'Variorum,‚Äô 1821. Farmer proposed that Shakespeare's knowledge of classical history was obtained at second hand through translations. His library, rich in scarce tracts and old English literature, was sold in London in 1798. The catalogue extends to 379 pages, and the separate books number 8,155; it sold for ¬£2,210. A scurrilous pamphlet, entitled 'The Battle between Dr. Farmer and Peter Musgrave, the Cambridge Taylor, in Hudibrastic verse,‚Äô appeared at London in 1792.

At Cambridge he won the Chancellor's Gold Medal for poetry in 1852. He was for some years a master at Harrow School and, from 1871 to 1876, the headmaster of Marlborough College. Farrar spent much of his career associated with Westminster Abbey. He was successively a canon there, rector of St Margaret's (the church next door), archdeacon of the Abbey. He later served as Dean of Canterbury;Crockford's Clerical Directory 1898 p403: London, Horace Cox, 1898 and chaplain in ordinary, i.e. attached to the Royal Household.A Famous Churchman, in the Red River Prospector, published 2 May 1901; retrieved 17 May 2014 He was an eloquent preacher and a voluminous author, his writings including stories of school life, such as Eric, or, Little by Little and St. Winifred's about life in a boys' boarding school in late Victorian England, and two historical romances. Farrar was a classics scholar and a comparative philologist, who applied Charles Darwin's ideas of branching descent to the relationships between languages, engaging in a protracted debate with the anti-Darwinian linguist Max M√ºller. While Farrar was never convinced by the evidence for evolution in biology, he had no theological objections to the idea and urged that it be considered on purely scientific grounds. On Darwin's nomination, Farrar was elected to the Royal Society in 1866 for his philological work. When Darwin died in 1882, Farrar helped get the church's permission for him to be buried in Westminster Abbey and preached the sermon at his funeral. Farrar's religious writings included Life of Christ (1874), which had great popularity, and Life of St. Paul (1879). His works were translated into many languages, especially Life of Christ. Farrar believed that some could be saved after death.The Eternal Fate of Unbelievers, Part II, \\"The Witness of Church History (2): The Modern Period\\", excerpted and adapted from Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment by Robert A.

In 1877 Farrar in an introduction to five sermons he wrote, in the preface he attacks the idea that he holds to universalism. He also dismisses any accusation from those who would say otherwise. He says, \\"I dare not lay down any dogma of Universalism, partly because it is impossible for us to estimate the hardening effect obstinate persistence in evil, and the power of the human will to resist the love of God.\\"\\"Eternal Hope\\" by Rev. Frederic W. Farrar,(New York:E.P. Dutton & Company, 1878), xvi and xxi.

Russell Lowell, Mr. W. Spottiswoode, Sir Joseph Hooker, Mr. A. R. Wallace, Professor Huxley, and Sir John Lubbock.The Funeral of Mr Darwin, The Times, 27 April 1882. (Wikisource) Family The memorial to Farrar at St Margaret's, Westminster On 1 August 1860 at St Leonard's Church, Exeter, he married Lucy Mary Cardew; they had five sons and five daughters: * Reginald Anstruther Farrar (1861-) * Evelyn Lucy Farrar (1862-) * Hilda Cardew Farrar (1863-1908) * Maud Farrar (1864-1949) * Eric Maurice Farrar (1866-) * Sibyl Farrar (1867-) * Cyril Lytton Farrar (1869-) * Lilian Farrar (1870-) * Frederic Percival Farrar (1871-) * Ivor Granville Farrar (1874-1944) (born Bernard Farrar) The first eight were born at Harrow; the last two were born at Marlborough. The second daughter, Hilda, was married in 1881 to John Stafford Northcote, vicar of St Andrew's, Westminster. He was the third son of Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh and their son Henry succeeded as third Earl in 1927. Farrar allowed his third daughter, Maud, to become engaged to Henry Montgomery at 14 and marry at 16. Farrar was then archdeacon of St Margaret's and Montgomery was the curate; Montgomery went on to become Bishop of Tasmania. Their children included the World War II hero \\"Monty\\", Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein. Farrar's son Reginald published his biography in 1902. Farrar died on 22 March 1903, and was buried in the cloister of the Canterbury Cathedral. Farrar has a street named after him ‚Äì Dean Farrar Street in Westminster, London. There is also a memorial to him at the church of St Margaret's, Westminster by the sculptor Nathaniel Hitch.

In Navajo culture, the pictographs are credited to people who lived before the flood. The Fremont River itself is named for John Charles Fr√©mont, an American explorer. It inhabited sites in what is now Utah and parts of Nevada, Idaho and Colorado from AD 1 to 1301 (2,000-700 years agoJanetski and Talbot 2014 in Archaeology in the Great Basin and Southwest p. 118.). It was adjacent to, roughly contemporaneous with, but distinctly different from the Ancestral Pueblo peoples located to their south.Typical \\"Moki Hut\\" placement in the crevice of the cliff Location A Fremont Granary, called Moki Huts locally Fremont Indian State Park in the Clear Creek Canyon area in Sevier County Utah contains the biggest Fremont culture site in Utah. Thousand-year-old pit houses, petroglyphs, and other Fremont artifacts were discovered at Range Creek, Utah. Nearby Nine Mile Canyon has long been known for its large collection of Fremont rock art. Other sites are found in The San Rafael Swell, Capitol Reef National Park, Dinosaur National Monument, Zion National Park, and Arches National Park. People Fremont petroglyph, Dinosaur National Monument Fremont Indian petroglyphs in Capitol Reef National Park, southern Utah Scholars do not agree that the Fremont culture represents a single, cohesive group with a common language, ancestry, or way of life, but several aspects of their material culture provides evidence for this concept. First, Fremont culture people foraged wild food sources and grew corn. The culture participated in a continuum of fairly reliable subsistence strategies that no doubt varied from place to place and time to time. This shows up in the archaeological record at most village sites and long term camps as a collection of butchered, cooked and then discarded bone from mostly deer and rabbits, charred corn cobs with the kernels removed, and wild edible plant remains. Other unifying characteristics include the manufacture of relatively expedient gray ware pottery and a signature style of basketry and rock art. Most of the Fremont lived in small single and extended family units comprising villages ranging from two to a dozen pithouse structures, with only a few having been occupied at any one time. Still, exceptions to this rule exist (partly why the Fremont have earned a reputation for being so hard to define), including an unusually large village in the Parowan Valley of southwestern Utah, the large and extensively excavated village of Five Finger Ridge at the above mentioned Fremont Indian State Park, and others, all appearing to be anomalous in that they were either occupied for a long period of time, were simultaneously occupied by a large number of people, 60 or more at any given moment, or both. The Fremont are sometimes thought to have begun as a splinter group of the Ancestral Pueblo people, although archaeologists do not agree on this theory. According to archaeologist Dean Snow, > Fremont people generally wore moccasins like their Great Basin ancestors > rather than sandals like the Ancestral Puebloans. They were part-time > farmers who lived in scattered semi-sedentary farmsteads and small villages, > never entirely giving up traditional hunting and gathering for more risky > full-time farming. They made pottery, built houses and food storage > facilities, and raised corn, but overall they must have looked like poor > cousins to the major traditions of the Greater Southwest, while at the same > time seeming like aspiring copy-cats to the hunter-gatherers still living > around them. Snow notes that Fremont culture declined due to changing climate conditions c. 950 CE. The culture moved to the then-marshy areas of northwestern Utah, which sustained them for about 400 years. Recent developments Pilling Figurines, unfired clay Fremont figurines, on display in the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum.

Background and education 1881 Cartoon from Punch: \\"PROFESSOR FAWCETT, M.P and P.M.G., A Politician of a certain stamp, and President of the Republic of Letters at St. Martin-le-Grand's\\" Henry Fawcett Henry Fawcett was born in Salisbury, and educated at King's College School and the University of Cambridge: entering Peterhouse in 1852, he migrated to Trinity Hall the following year, and became a fellow there in 1856, the year he graduated BA as 7th Wrangler. In 1858, when he was 25, he was blinded in a shooting accident. Despite his blindness, he continued with his studies, especially in economics. He was able to enter Lincoln's Inn, but decided against a career as a barrister and took his name off their books in 1860. Academic career Two years later, Henry Fawcett reportedly attended the 1860 Oxford evolution debate, during which he was asked whether he thought Bishop Samuel Wilberforce had actually read the Origin of Species. Reportedly, Henry Fawcett replied loudly, \\"Oh no, I would swear he has never read a word of it\\". Ready to recriminate, Wilberforce swung round to him scowling, but stepped back and bit his tongue on noting that the speaker was the blind economist.Janet Browne, Charles Darwin: The Power of Place, 2003, p. 126. At the next meeting (in September 1861) of the British Association in Manchester, Henry Fawcett defended the logic behind Charles Darwin's theories.London Illustrated News, 16 September 1861, p. 279 This significantly affected its acceptance. In 1863, Henry Fawcett published his Manual of Political Economy and became Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge. He made himself a recognised authority on economics, his works on which include The Economic Position of the British Labourer (1865) and Labour and Wages. In 1883, he was elected Rector of Glasgow University. Political career After repeated defeats as a Liberal Party candidate, Henry Fawcett was elected Member of Parliament for Brighton in 1865. He held this seat until 1874, and thereafter represented Hackney between 1874 and 1884. He campaigned for women's suffrage. In 1880, he was appointed Postmaster-General by William Ewart Gladstone and sworn of the Privy Council. He had a particular interest in encouraging saving through the Post Office Savings Bank. He introduced the savings stamp which allowed people to save pennies at a time to build up the minimum account limit of a shilling. He pushed through parliament an act to allow savers to convert their post office savings to government stock and he developed the post office's life insurance and annuities schemes.Archibald Grainger Bowie The Romance of the Savings Banks 1898 SW Partridge & Co He introduced many other innovations, including parcel post, postal orders, and licensing changes to permit payphones and trunk lines. Family Through his campaigning for women's suffrage, Henry Fawcett met Elizabeth Garrett, to whom he proposed in 1865. She rejected the proposal to concentrate on becoming a doctor at a time when female doctors were extremely rare. However, in 1867 Fawcett married Elizabeth's younger sister Millicent Garrett.Millicent Garrett Fawcett ‚Äì Spartacus EducationalThe Passing Parade with John Doremus, Evening with Ian Holland, Radio 2CH 20:40 AEST 3 August 2007. They had one child, Philippa Fawcett. Henry Fawcett's career was cut short by his premature death from pleurisy in November 1884, aged 51. He is buried in Trumpington Extension Cemetery, Cambridge where several members of the family of Charles Darwin are also buried, including Sir George Darwin, Lady Maud, and Gwen Raverat. Legacy There are statues of him in Salisbury Market Square and in Victoria Embankment Gardens (Henry Fawcett Memorial) near Charing Cross in central London. The latter is by the eminent sculptor Mary Grant. A fine statue with an angel standing over a seated Henry Fawcett (by the sculptor George Tinworth) was erected in 1893 in Vauxhall Park (opened in 1890 on this site of Fawcett's house, The Lawns) but was removed by Lambeth Council in 1959. Alfred Gilbert was commissioned to make a memorial which stands in Westminster Abbey. Sir Leslie Stephen wrote a biography of him, Life of Henry Fawcett, in 1885. He is listed amongst the important British Reformers on the \\"Reformers Memorial\\" in the centre of the eastmost oval section in Kensal Green Cemetery.

The novella first appeared in the anthology Aurora: Beyond Equality, edited by Vonda N. McIntyre and Susan J. Anderson, published by Fawcett in May 1976.

It remains Tiptree's most famous and most reprinted story. Plot summary The story portrays a crew of three male astronauts launched in the near future on a circumsolar mission in the spaceship Sunbird. A large solar flare damages their craft and leaves them drifting and lost in space. They make repeated attempts to contact NASA in Houston, to no avail. Soon, however, they begin to pick up strange radio communications. They are puzzled that almost all of the voices are female, usually with a strong Australian accent. They overhear conversations about personal matters (including the birth of a cow) as well as unknown slang terms. Various theories are discussed by the perplexed astronauts: hallucinations? A hoax? A hostile power trying to trick them? They record and play back the conversations over and over, trying to figure out what is going on. Soon, they realize that these unknown people are aware of them and are offering to help. At first, the Sunbird's commander refuses to communicate with them, suspicious of their motives. As they continue to plead with the astronauts to accept their rescue offer, the men are chilled to hear their mission referred to in historical terms. They come to realize that they were not only thrown off-course in space, but in time as well, and that their flight was lost centuries ago. They are given bare details of the current Earth: an undefined cataclysm has reduced the human population to a few million. Eventually, the Sunbird agrees to rendezvous with the spaceship Gloria to allow the astronauts to spacewalk to safety. The Gloria is an enigma to them. Besides having an almost all-female crew, the ship is haphazard and cluttered with plants and animals on board. The technology used on the ship does not appear to them to be as advanced as they would have thought the world to be after such a long passage of time, and they think it odd that some of the ship's functions are powered by stationary bikes. Their culture shock is compounded by the cryptic and incomplete answers they are given concerning the Earth. Little by little, the three gather clues from both observations and slips of the tongue. While crew members often refer to their \\"sisters,\\" there is no mention of husbands, boyfriends, or families. There are twins on board (both named Judy), yet one seems older than the other. The one male, a teen named Andy, seems strangely feminine. Technology, and science and culture in general, seems to be relatively unadvanced considering the centuries that passed. Eventually, they learn the truth. A plague wiped out most human life, including all males. Only about 11,000 women survived, mostly concentrated in Australasia and a few other areas. Until recently, they reproduced only by cloning, so most women are clones of the original 11,000 genotypes. Babies are raised communally in cr√®ches, and all members of each genotype are encouraged to add their story to a book that is passed on for the inspiration and education of future \\"sisters.\\" Certain genotypes are given early androgen treatments (hence, Andy, who the astronauts thought was male) to increase bulk and strength for physical tasks. The resulting communal male-free society has settled into a peaceful pattern -- without major conflict and seemingly happy. The Sunbird's crew react to these revelations in different ways. The commander considers this to be a great tragedy, and believes he was chosen by God to subjugate the women to their intended roles and lead them back to the true path with men as leaders of society and family. Another eagerly anticipates the prospect of millions of women who have not known a man's touch, believing that the women are all sexually unfulfilled without a man, and he engages in violent sexual fantasies of domination. The third crew member -- the narrator -- differs from the other two in that he is an intellectual man without much physical development -- the other two men look down upon him for his nerdy qualities, and he thinks back to all of the abuse and bullying he has been the victim of over the years by men like them. He realizes that their feelings of superiority and importance are blinding them to what is really going on: he and his crewmates have been given a mind-altering drug -- it disinhibits them and causes them to show their \\"true selves\\" and voice their thoughts. He realizes that the traits they have exhibited of violence and domination are unacceptable in the new world of women, and they are all going to be killed, even himself. He tries to explain to them that though he expressed sexual thoughts in aggressive, violent words, he would never act on such thoughts. The women explain that they do not even have such thoughts. They are content to live in a world of women, and they don't want for leadership or sexual fulfillment without men. Their study of these three astronauts has shown that allowing men on Earth will pose unacceptable risks, so they are now merely studying the men and obtaining useful information and (in the case of the over-amorous astronaut) sperm samples, presumably to introduce fresh genetic material and create new genotypes.

His translation of the Argonautica in rhymed couplets appeared in 1780.

On 16 March 1738 he was admitted as a sizar to Jesus College, Cambridge, where his tutor was the Rev. Richard Oakley. He took his degree of B.A in 1742, and proceeded M.A. in 1745. He was ordained in the Church of England, and took the curacy of Bramham in Yorkshire. Fawkes later held the curacy of Croydon, where he came to the notice of Archbishop Thomas Herring; he became vicar of Orpington, Kent. Fawkes remained at Orpington until April 1774, when, by the favour of Charles Plumptree, rector of Orpington and patron of the adjacent rectory of Hayes, he was appointed to Hayes with the curacy of Downe. The other piece of clerical patronage which he received was a chaplaincy to the Princess Dowager of Wales. He died on 26 August 1777, when his widow, formerly a Miss Purrier of Leeds, whom he married about 1760, was left with scanty resources. His library was sold in 1778. Works He was a sort of chaplain to George Fox-Lane, and his first production in literature is said to have been an anonymous poem describing the beauties of his house Bramham Park, published in 1745. An elegy 'Aurelius' for Herring was printed in 1761 with the 'Original Poems and Translations' of Fawkes; and reprinted in 1763 in the volume of 'Seven Sermons by Archbishop Herring'. Fawkes was considered by his contemporaries the best translator since the days of Alexander Pope, and Samuel Johnson approved of his translation of Anacreon. His works were: * ‚ÄòA Description of May from Gawin Douglas‚Äô (modernised), by F.

Fawkes's translation was printed in France in 1835 and included in the 'Collections of the British Poets' by Robert Anderson (vol. xiii.) and Alexander Chalmers (vol. xx.), and in the 'Greek and Roman Poets' of Charles Whittingham (vol. xiv.).

In this translation he had the assistance of friends, including Zachary Pearce, John Jortin, and Samuel Johnson. It was dedicated to Charles Yorke. * Apollonius Rhodius translated into English, published after his death in 1780, revised by Henry Meen for Fawkes's widow.

Lord Mahon, later Earl of Stanhope, married Lady Hester Pitt, daughter of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, whose seat was situated in Fawkes's parish of Hayes, on 19 December 1774, and some lines addressed to the bridegroom by Fawkes on this occasion are printed in the Chatham Correspondence, iv. 373. Great popularity attended his song of The Brown Jug, which began with the words :Dear Tom, this brown jug that now foams with mild ale :Was once Toby Fillpott. It was introduced by John O'Keeffe into his comic opera The Poor Soldier, which was played at Covent Garden Theatre for the first time on 4 November 1783. It was sung then by John Henry Johnstone, and it was later a favourite piece of Charles Incledon. During the debates on Catholic emancipation the opening lines were quoted in the House of Commons by George Canning to ridicule John Copley: the punning imputation was that a speech by Copley was from a pamphlet of Henry Phillpotts.

The original edition included 100 ‚Äúresolves‚Äù that were considered to be ‚Äúshort, aphoristic commentaries on aspects of the three realms delineated by the title: divine, ethical, and political‚Ä¶[and] they concern[ed] in equal measure the private and public realms of middle-class English life.‚Äù Later revisions reflect how Feltham attempted to amalgamate these three distinct dimensions of ‚Äúmiddle- class English life‚Äù‚Äîdivine, ethical and political‚Äîinto a more cohesive context. Or, in other words, the revisions reflect ‚Äú ‚Äòthe expansion of aphorisms into statements that approach conversation‚Äô‚Ä¶[which] corresponds to a more tolerant humanism.‚Äù This tolerance is perhaps best demonstrated in regards to the ubiquitous Woman Question, a debate which continued to play a large role in the social atmosphere of Renaissance Britain. Both men and women joined in the debate, and though most men viewed the fairer sex in rigid terms‚Äîas either ‚Äúunconstant‚Äù or ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù‚Äîthere were many men like Feltham who preferred to ‚Äú[accept] some assumptions about gender but [question] many others: he asks commonsense questions and is willing to look beyond stereotypes.‚Äù In his 1661 edition of Resolves, Feltham‚Äôs 85th resolve, entitled \\"Of Marriage and Single Life,\\" he writes: \\"A wise wife comprehends both sexes: she is a woman for her body, and she is a man within: for her soul is like her Husbands.... It is a Crown of blessings, when in one woman a man findeth both a wife and a friend.\\" In his 1628 edition, which includes the resolve entitled ‚ÄúOf Woman,‚Äù Feltham observes the social disparities of his time in regards to gender equality. Though he does not offer any solutions, his commentary could be considered a type of proto-feminist or proto- egalitarianist philosophy: ‚ÄúWhence proceed the most abhorred villainies, but from a masculine unblushing impudence? When a woman grows bold and daring, we dislike her, and say, ‚Äòshe is too like a man‚Äô: yet in our selves, we magnify what we condemn. Is not this injustice?‚Äù Sources *BookRags The Broadview Anthology of British Literature. Ed. Joseph Black et al.New York: Broadview Press, 2007.

The story of the murder of Mr. Smith has entered English Criminal history as one of the classic \\"cut-throat\\" cases involving a pair of killers. A \\"cut- throat\\" case is one where the killers each put forth a defence that the other one was guilty, and in doing this they only convince the jury that both parties are equally guilty of the killing. Another example of such a case is that of Frederick Guy Browne and William Kennedy for the murder of Police Constable George Gutteridge in 1928. Muswell Hill was a wealthy neighbourhood in North London. In 1896 the elderly Smith lived there in a large house called Muswell Lodge. Smith was somewhat reclusive, and rumour had it he was a wealthy miser keeping large sums of money in the house. He lived alone (though he had a gardener in the daytime), and apparently pegged his safety on some trap-guns set up on the grounds; unfortunately, he did not have any secondary level of protection. Smith's body was discovered on the morning of 14 February, a few hours after his murder, by his gardener, Charles Webber, who alerted Smith's neighbours, called in a local doctor (Ridley Webster, M.D.), and notified the police. They entered the house and found that Smith had been bound with shreds of blankets and had sustained several head wounds. Two pocket knives and a toy lantern were found next to the body. Smith's safe had been cracked and his bedroom torn apart. The day before the murder two men had been seen near the house. For weeks the police tried to find the killers, using the toy lantern as the best clue they had. Unfortunately hundreds were in existence, so it was a clue that might never be traced. Instead, a Detective named William Burrell was aware of a burglar named Albert Milsome who had disappeared from his neighbourhood. Milsome had recently been seen in the company of one Henry Fowler. Burrell was aware of the younger brother-in- law of Milsome reportedly having a toy lantern, but understood he could not question him or other members of the family about it without tipping them off about its significance. A trap was set at a nearby candy store, where the lantern was set up. The trap succeeded when Milsome's brother-in-law, Henry Miller, identified the lantern as his own. Now that they were aware that it was Milsome whom they wanted, and that Fowler was missing as well, the police started a manhunt. It eventually turned out that the men were together in a small travelling waxworks that journeyed to fairs around the country, with Fowler acting as the strong man in the circus. A police raid captured both men at Bath. Milsom gave up meekly, but Fowler fought like a tiger and had to be clubbed into submission. Fowler denied knowing anything about the murder, but Milsome soon cracked under the strain and confessed to robbing Smith, though he said his partner had done the killing. Their trial was held in the Old Bailey in front of Mr. Justice Sir Henry Hawkins. The evidence was basically streamlined because of Milsom's confession, although Fowler kept denying its truth. Fowler was aware of the great damage Milson had done. During a break in the trial, Fowler suddenly jumped up in the dock, and started throttling him. A number of policemen interfered and pulled Fowler off the cowering Milsom. As it turned out the jury believed Milsome in part - the evidence had shown two knives near the dead Smith, and that suggested the two burglars had jointly committed the tying up and killing of the man. Milsom collapsed when he heard the guilty verdict against him. Fowler just laughed at the failure of Milsom's scheme, and mimicked his partner's protesting of the verdict. When asked if they had anything further to say, Fowler told the court that there were two miscarriages of justice for which he was responsible, naming two recent convictions of two burglars for whose crimes Fowler claimed responsibility. He asked the court to keep these in mind for reviewing those two sentences. As it turned out, Fowler was lying - the evidence against the two burglars was stronger than Fowler thought, and they (the two burglars) were friends of his for whom he was trying to do a favour. The authorities were afraid that when Milsome and Fowler were going to be hanged Fowler might attack Milsome again. It was decided to hang the two men with a third one between them. A recent double murder had been committed in the Whitechapel section of London of a pawnbroker named John Goodman Levy and his housekeeper, Mrs. Sarah Gale by a burglar named William Seaman. Seaman was cornered while still in Levy's home on the roof. He was subdued in a violent fight by future Chief Constable of Scotland Yard, Frederick Porter Wensley. Seaman too was sentenced to death, and he was put between Milsome and Fowler on the gallows built at Newgate Prison on 9 June 1896. Actually, despite fears by the executioner John Billington Fowler did not make a scene. He came out onto the scaffold after Milsome and Seaman were set up, asked if Milsome was there, and was satisfied to see he was. Seaman, until then unaware of why he was being placed as he was between the Muswell Hill murderers, said, \\"Well this is the first time in my life I've ever been a bloody peacemaker.\\" Shortly afterwards all three men were hanged. Usually this is the end of the anecdote about the triple execution of 9 June 1896. There is a little more involved in it. At one point there was a chance that there would have been a quadruple hanging because Amelia Dyer the notorious baby farmer, was supposed to be hanged with them, but it was decided that Mrs. Dyer should be hanged the following day. She was taken out of the prison and taken for a police wagon ride until after the three men were executed. Also at least one source adds to the anecdote about Seaman's final words on the scaffold. Edward Abinger the barrister best recalled for his defence of Steinie Morrison in 1910, wrote an autobiography. In it he reveals that a moment after Seaman made his comment, Fowler signaled he wanted to say something. It is possible that Seaman's comment struck Fowler as funny, and he said (according to Abinger), \\"Well this is the first time in my life I've ever been a bloody penitent.\\" But Abinger is the only person who ever seems to have noted that comment.

History Dusheti is located on both banks of the small, mountainous Dushetis-Khevi River in the foothills of the Greater Caucasus range at an elevation of 900 m above sea level. It functions as the center of the Dusheti Municipality which, beyond the town itself, includes several villages of the historical community of Pkhovi (Pshavi and Khevsureti). As of the 2014 all-Georgia census, the town had a population of about 6,167. The Dusheti coat of arms, devised adopted in 1875 and used under the Imperial Russian rule. Dusheti first appears in Georgian written records in 1215. In the 17th century, it served as a residence of the local mountainous lords ‚Äì the dukes of Aragvi ‚Äì whose defiance to the Georgian crown more than once led to invasions and devastation of the town by the royal troops. After the abolition of the duchy of Aragvi in the 1740s, Dusheti passed to the crown but significantly declined. In 1801, the Russians took over and granted Dusheti a town status. Next year, it became the center of Dushetsky Uyezd. The town and its environs were a scene of disturbances during the Russian Revolution of 1905, the peasants‚Äô revolt in 1918, and an armed clash during the 1924 August Uprising against the Soviet rule. Dusheti was a center of agriculture and light industry during the Soviet era, but suffered an economic decline and population decrease in the years following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Nowadays, most people work in service industries (banking, education, auto-repair, and retail) as well as subsistence farming. The town is also known for its khinkali, a meat-filled dumpling very popular in Georgia. Economy =Transport= Dusheti has access by a paved road to the highway connecting Tbilisi and Stepantsminda. There is a regular bus traffic between Dusheti and Tbilisi. Culture and recreation There are several historical and recreational places in and around Dusheti such as the Ananuri castle and the Bazaleti Lake. The town itself houses a number of architectural monuments including the 9th-10th- century church of St. George and the 18th-century palace of the Chilashvili family.

In 1707, Fenton published a book of poems. He later became tutor to Sir William Trumbull's son at Easthampstead Park in Berkshire and is now best known as the assistant of his neighbour, Alexander Pope, in his translation of the Odyssey, of which he 'Englished' the first, fourth, nineteenth, and twentieth books, catching the manner of his master so completely that it is hardly possible to distinguish between their work; while thus engaged he published (1723) a successful tragedy, Mariamne. His later contributions to literature were a Life of John Milton, and as an editor of Edmund Waller's Poems (1729). He died on 16 July 1730, and is buried in the churchyard of Stoke Parish Church, Stoke-on-Trent.

He was also an actor. Life His father was the Puritan preacher John Field, and his brother Theophilus Field became the Bishop of Llandaff. One of his brothers named Nathaniel, often confused with the actor, became a printer. Nathan's father passionately opposed London's public entertainments: he delivered a sermon which attributed Divine judgment to the collapse of the public seating area, during a bear baiting on a Sunday, at Beargarden in 1583, which resulted in several deaths. Nathan presumably did not intend a career in the theatre; he was a student of Richard Mulcaster at St. Paul's School in the late 1590s. At some point before 1600, he was impressed by Nathaniel Giles, the master of Elizabeth's choir and one of the managers of the new troupe of boy players at Blackfriars Theatre, called alternately the Children of the Chapel Royal and the Blackfriars Children. He remained in this profession for the remainder of his life, later adding to it the profession of a playwright. John Field was buried on 26 March 1588. When John Field died, he left seven children, of whom the eldest was only seventeen. He left all his property to his wife, Joan. The first child was a daughter, Dorcas, baptized on 7 May 1570. The first son was baptized on 4 January 1572 and was named after his father, John. Theophilus was baptized on 22 January 1574, Jonathan on 13 May 1577, Nathaniel on 13 June 1581, Elizabeth on 2 February 1583 and Nathan on 17 October 1587. Little is known of the two daughters: Dorcas was married to Edward Rice on 9 November 1590; Elizabeth was buried at St. Anne, Blackfriars, on 14 June 1603, when she had just reached twenty, the age at which Dorcas married. We know nothing of the life of John Field, junior. Jonathan Field, who died in 1640. Theophilus followed his father's profession. He married and in his will left all his possessions to his wife, Alice. He died on 2 June 1636 and was buried in Hereford Cathedral. As a member of the Children of the Queen's Revels, Field acted in the innovative drama staged at Blackfriars in the first years of the 17th century. Cast lists associate him with Ben Jonson's Cynthia's Revels (1600) and The Poetaster (1601); a 1641 quarto associated him with George Chapman's Bussy D'Ambois. Later in the decade, he performed in Epicoene and, perhaps, played Humphrey in Francis Beaumont's The Knight of the Burning Pestle. During the same years, he wrote commendatory verses for Jonson's Volpone and Catiline, and for John Fletcher's The Faithful Shepherdess. Field was presumably also among those of the children's company briefly imprisoned for the official displeasure occasioned by Eastward Hoe and John Day's The Isle of Gulls; the latter imprisonment was in Bridewell Prison. Field stayed with a children's company until 1613, his twenty-sixth year. He appears to be the only one of the boy actors of 1600 to remain with the Blackfriars troupe when, in 1609, Philip Rosseter and Robert Keysar assumed control of the company. In this company, he performed in the theatre in Whitefriars and, frequently, at court, in plays such as Beaumont and Fletcher's The Coxcomb. From the latter years of this period come the first of his plays: A Woman is a Weathercock and The Honest Man's Fortune (the latter with Fletcher and Philip Massinger). In 1613, Rosseter combined his company with the Lady Elizabeth's Men, managed by Philip Henslowe. Performing at the Swan Theatre and Hope Theatre, Field acted in Thomas Middleton's A Chaste Maid in Cheapside and Jonson's Bartholomew Fair. For the latter play, in which he may have performed as Cokes or Littlewit, he received payment for the company after a performance at court. These years witnessed some degree of tumult; Henslowe's business practices resulted in his actors' drawing up certain \\"articles of grievance\\" against him, and Rosseter's attempt to build a new private theater (Porter's Hall) in Blackfriars was blocked by the city and Privy Council. This period ended when Henslowe died, Rosseter abandoned his plans, and Lady Elizabeth's Men briefly merged and then separated from Prince Charles's Men, thereafter touring in the country. For Field, the period had a presumably more satisfactory end: by late 1616, he had joined the King's Men. With the King's Men, Field seems to have performed as Voltore in Volpone and as Face in The Alchemist. It is not clear what other parts he played; an epigram, produced by John Payne Collier, that associated the actor with the role of Othello is an apparent forgery. Edmond Malone supposed that Field played women's roles with the company; O. J. Campbell, however, suggests that he played young second leads. Of course he acted in a number of Fletcher's plays, as well as Shakespeare's; presumably he also acted in his own Amends for Ladies (printed 1618, though probably written earlier), and in The Fatal Dowry, which he wrote with Philip Massinger. Field died some time between May 1619 and August 1620. Scholars and critics have argued for authorial contributions from Field in a number of plays of his era, most commonly in Four Plays in One, The Honest Man's Fortune, The Queen of Corinth and The Knight of Malta, four dramas in the canon of Fletcher and his collaborators. Field had a contemporary reputation as a ladies' man; gossip reported by William Trumbull charges him with a child of the Countess of Argyll. A portrait believed to be of Field can be seen at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, UK. Where he is depicted as a melancholy figure with hand on heart, it has been said that this painting may be one of the first depictions of an actor \\"in character\\". The portrait artist is unknown, but some believe it was painted by William Larkin. Cultural reference Susan Cooper's children's novel King of Shadows features Nathan Field as a character. Set in 1599, it uses Field's background as a student of Richard Mulcaster's at St Paul's as a springboard. The Nathan Field in the story, who briefly works at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, is actually a like-named boy from 1999, who has switched places with the young Elizabethan actor.

Members are descended from the Bantu peoples of the East African region. Some were merchants, sailors, indentured servants, slaves and mercenaries. The Siddi population is currently estimated at around 270,000‚Äì350,000 individuals, with Karnataka, Gujarat and Hyderabad in India and Makran and Karachi in Pakistan as the main population centres. Siddis are primarily Muslims, although some are Hindus and others belong to the Catholic Church.  Etymology  A Siddi girl from the town of Yellapur in Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka, India. There are conflicting hypotheses on the origin of the name Siddi. One theory is that the word derives from sahibi, an Arabic term of respect in North Africa, similar to the word sahib in modern India and Pakistan. A second theory is that the term Siddi is derived from the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to India; these captains were known as Sayyid. Similarly, another term for Siddis, habshi, is held to be derived from the common name for the captains of the Abyssinian ships that also first delivered Siddi slaves to the subcontinent. Siddis are also sometimes referred to as Afro-Indians. Siddis were referred to as Zanji by Arabs; in China, various transcriptions of this Arabic word were used, including Xinji (ËæõÂêâ) and Jinzhi (Ê¥•Ëäù).David Brion Davis, Challenging the Boundaries of Slavery (Harvard University Press, 2006), p. 12.Ci Hai 7(1): 125.Roland Oliver, Africa in the Iron Age: c.500 BC-1400 AD, (Cambridge University Press, 1975), p. 192.F. R. C. Bagley et al., The Last Great Muslim Empires, (Brill: 1997), p. 174.  History  Ikhlas Khan, African prime minister of Bijapur, c. 1650 The first Siddis are thought to have arrived in India in 628 AD at the Bharuch port. Several others followed with the first Arab Islamic conquest of the subcontinent in 712 AD. The latter group are believed to have been soldiers with Muhammad bin Qasim's Arab army, and were called Zanjis. Some Siddis escaped slavery to establish communities in forested areas, and some also established the small Siddi principalities of Janjira State on Janjira Island and Jafarabad State in Kathiawar as early as the twelfth century. A former alternative name of Janjira was Habshan (i.e., land of the Habshis). In the Delhi Sultanate period prior to the rise of the Mughals in India, Jamal-ud-Din Yaqut was a prominent Siddi slave-turned- nobleman who was a close confidant of Razia Sultana (1235‚Äì1240 CE). Although this is disputed, he may also have been her lover, but contemporary sources do not indicate that this was necessarily the case. Siddis were also brought as slaves by the Deccan Sultanates. Several former slaves rose to high ranks in the military and administration, the most prominent of which was Malik Ambar. Later the Siddi population was added to via Bantu peoples from Southeast Africa that had been brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves by the Portuguese. Later most of these migrants became Muslim and a small minority became Hindu. The Nizam of Hyderabad also employed African-origin guards and soldiers. Flag of the Siddis from Murud-Janjira, an important vassal of the Mughal Empire.  India  Sidis of Madras Harris (1971) provides an historical survey of the eastward dispersal of slaves from Southeast Africa to places like India.Harris, J. E. (1971). The African Presence in Asia: Consequences of the East African Slave Trade. Hamilton (1990) argues that Siddis in South India are a significant social group whose histories, experiences, cultures, and expressions are integral to the African Diaspora and thus, help better understand the dynamics of dispersed peoples. More recent focused scholarship argues that although Siddis are numerically a minority, their historic presence in India for over five hundred years, as well as their self-perception, and how the broader Indian society relates to them, make them a distinct Bantu/Indian.Obeng, P. (2007). Shaping Membership, Defining Nation: The Cultural Politics of African Indians in South India, p. xiii. Historically, Siddis have not existed only within binary relations to the nation state and imperial forces. They did not simply succumb to the ideologies and structures of imperial forces, nor did they simply rebel against imperial rule. The Siddi are recognized as a scheduled tribe in 3 states and 1 union territory: Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka and Daman and Diu. =Hyderabad= In the 18th century, a Siddi community was established in Hyderabad State by the Arab Siddi diaspora, who have frequently served as cavalry guards to the Asif Jahi Nizam of Hyderabad's army. The Asif Jahi rulers patronised them with rewards and the traditional Marfa music gained popularity and would be performed during official celebrations and ceremonies. The Siddis of Hyderabad have traditionally resided in the A.C.

On the way to Deva-dungar is the quaint village of Sirvan, inhabited entirely by Siddis. They were brought 300 years ago from Portuguese colonial territories for the Nawab of Junagadh. Today, they follow very few of their original customs, with a few exceptions like the traditional Dhamal dance.Shekhawat, Rahul Singh (n.d.), \\"Black Sufis: Preserving the Siddi's and its age old culture in India\\" Although Gujarati Siddis have adopted the language and many customs of their surrounding populations, some of their Bantu traditions have been preserved. These include the Goma music and dance form, which is sometimes called Dhamaal (Gujarati: ‡™ß‡™Æ‡™æ‡™≤, fun). The term is believed to be derived from the Ngoma drumming and traditional dance forms of the Bantu people inhabiting Central, East and Southern Africa. The Goma also has a spiritual significance and, at the climax of the dance, some dancers are believed to be vehicles for the presence of Siddi saints of the past. Goma music comes from the Kiswahili word \\"ngoma\\", which means a drum or drums. It also denotes any dancing occasion where traditional drums are principally used. The majority of the Siddis in Gujarat are Muslims (98.7%), with very few following Hinduism (1%).http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/SCST- Series/ST14/ST-24-00-014-DDW-2011.XLS = Karnataka = The Siddis of Karnataka (also spelled Siddhis) are an ethnic group of mainly Bantu descent that has made Karnataka their home for the last 400 years. There is a 50,000-strong Siddhi population across India, of which more than a third live in Karnataka. In Karnataka, they are concentrated around Yellapur, Haliyal, Ankola, Joida, Mundgod and Sirsi taluks of Uttara Kannada and in Khanapur of Belgaum and Kalaghatagi of Dharwad district. Many members of the Siddis community of Karnataka had migrated to Pakistan after independence and have settled in Karachi, Sindh. It has been reported that these Siddis believe that Barack Obama shares their genepool.They wished to gift him and honour him on his visit to India in 2010.Anil Budur Lulla, A Bottle of Honey for Our Brother Prez , Short Takes section, Open Magazine, 30 October 2010.

They live primarily along the Makran in Balochistan, and lower Sindh. The estimated population of Sheedis in Pakistan is 250,000.Paracha, Nadeem (26 August 2018), \\"Smokers‚Äô corner: Sindh's African roots \\", Dawn. In the city of Karachi, the main Sheedi centre is the area of Lyari and other nearby coastal areas. Technically, the Sheedi are a brotherhood or a subdivision of the Siddi. The Sheedis are divided into four clans, or houses: Kharadar Makan, Hyderabad Makan, Lassi Makan and Belaro Makan.Sheedi Mela begins with ritual aplomb, The News International, 7 July 2008. The Sufi saint Pir Mangho is regarded by many as the patron saint of the Sheedis, and the annual Sheedi Mela festival, is the key event in the Sheedi community's cultural calendar. Some glimpses of the rituals at Sidi/Sheedi Festival 2010 include visit to sacred alligators at Mangho pir, playing music and dance., BBC Urdu, 18 June 2010 Clearly, the instrument, songs and dance appear to be derived from Africa.\\"Manghopir urs a living tribute to Sheedi culture\\", Dawn 16 July 2007. In Sindh, the Sheedis have traditionally intermarried only with people such as the Mallahs (fisherpeople), Khaskheli (laborers), Khatri (dyeing community) and Kori (clothmakers). Famous Sheedis include the historic Sindhi army leader Hoshu Sheedi\\"‚ÄòHoshu Sheedi Day‚Äô on March 23\\", Dawn, 21 March 2007. and Urdu poet Noon Meem Danish.\\"A poet in New York\\", Dawn, 9 December 2007.Afro-Asia in Pakistan Hasan Mujtaba, Samar Magazine, Issue 13: Winter/Spring, 2000. Sheedis are also well known for their excellence in sports, especially in football and boxing. Qasim Umer is one cricketer who played for Pakistan in 80s. The musical anthem of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, \\"Bija Teer\\", is a Balochi song in the musical style of the Sheedis with Black African style rhythm and drums.YouTube ‚Äì teer bija Younis Jani is a popular Sheedi singer famous for singing an Urdu version of the reggaeton song \\"Papi chulo...

They are very active in cultural activities and organise annual festivals, like, Habash Festival, with the support of several community organisations. In the local culture, when there is a dance it is not performed by some selected few and watched idly by others but it is participated by all the people present there, ending difference between the performers and the audience. Sheedis in Sindh also proudly call themselves the Qambranis, (; ), in reverence to Qambar, the freed slave of Ali, the fourth Rashid Caliph. Tanzeela Qambrani became the first Sheedi woman to be elected as the member of Provincial Assembly of Sindh in 2018 Pakistani general election.Tanzeela Qambrani: First Sheedi woman to become member of Sindh AssemblyTanzeela to be first Sheedi woman to enter Sindh Assembly Genetics Recent advances in genetic analyses have helped shed some light on the ethnogenesis of the Siddi. Genetic genealogy, although a novel tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of the modern Siddi. =Y DNA= A Y-chromosome study by Shah et al. (2011) tested Siddi individuals in India for paternal lineages. The authors observed the E1b1a1-M2 haplogroup, which is frequent among Bantu peoples, in about 42% and 34% of Siddis from Karnataka and Gujarat, respectively. Around 14% of Siddis from Karnataka and 35% of Siddis from Gujarat also belonged to the Sub-Saharan B-M60. The remaining Siddis had Indian associated or Near Eastern-linked clades, including haplogroups P, H, R1a-M17, J2 and L-M20. Thangaraj (2009) observed similar, mainly Bantu-linked paternal affinities amongst the Siddi. Qamar et al. (2002) analysed Makrani Siddis in Pakistan and found that they instead predominantly carried Indian-associated or Near Eastern-linked haplogroups. R1a1a-M17 (30.30%), J2 (18.18%) and R2 (18.18%) were their most common male lineages. Only around 12% carried Africa-derived clades, which mainly consisted of the archaic haplogroup B-M60, of which they bore the highest frequency of any Pakistani population Underhill et al. (2009) likewise detected a relatively high frequency of R1a1a-M17 (25%) subclade among Makrani Siddis. =mtDNA= According to an mtDNA study by Shah et al. (2011), the maternal ancestry of the Siddi consists of a mixture of Bantu-associated haplogroups and Indian-associated haplogroups, reflecting substantial female gene flow from neighbouring Indian populations. About 53% of the Siddis from Gujarat and 24% of the Siddis from Karnataka belonged to various Bantu-derived macro-haplogroup L subclades. The latter mainly consisted of L0 and L2a sublineages associated with Bantu women. The remainder possessed Indian- specific subclades of the Eurasian haplogroups M and N, which points to recent admixture with autochthonous Indian groups. =Autosomal DNA= Narang et al. (2011) examined the autosomal DNA of Siddis in India. According to the researchers, about 58% of the Siddis' ancestry is derived from Bantu peoples. The remainder is associated with local Indo-European-speaking North and Northwest Indian populations, due to recent admixture events. Similarly, Shah et al. (2011) observed that Siddis in Gujarat derive 66.90%‚Äì70.50% of their ancestry from Bantu forebears, while the Siddis in Karnataka possess 64.80%‚Äì74.40% such Southeast African ancestry. The remaining autosomal DNA components in the studied Siddi were mainly associated with local South Asian populations. According to the authors, gene flow between the Siddis' Bantu ancestors and local Indian populations was also largely unidirectional. They estimate this admixture episode's time of occurrence at within the past 200 years or eight generations. However, Guha et al. (2012) observed few genetic differences between the Makrani of Pakistan and adjacent populations. According to the authors, the genome-wide ancestry of the Makrani was essentially the same as that of the neighboring Indo-European speaking Balochi and Dravidian-speaking Brahui.  Culture  The culture of the Siddi is indicative of both the length of time they have been in India and their East African origins. While they have assimilated in many ways to the dominant culture, http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160801-indias-forgotten-jungle- dwellers they have also kept some ancestral practices especially in music and dance. https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/04/siddi-people-africa- india-tribe-culture/ Like other ethnic groups separated by geography, there are both differences and similarities in cultural practices among the Siddi. Generally, the Siddi primarily associate and marry members of their own communities. https://www.thebetterindia.com/93626/india-racism-siddi-african/ It is rare for the Siddi to marry outside of their communities although in Pakistan a growing number of the Sheedi (as they are known there) intermarry as a way to dilute their African lineage and reduce racial discrimination and prejudice. https://qz.com/india/440978/meet-the-fast-disappearing-community- of-indians-and-pakistanis-of-african-origin/amp/ Siddi communities, although classified as a tribe by the Indian government (in order to receive benefits), primarily live in agricultural communities where men are responsible for the farming and women are responsible for the home and children. https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/04/siddi-people-africa-india- tribe-culture/ Outside of their communities, men also tend to be employed as farm hands, drivers, manual laborers, and security guards. http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160801-indias-forgotten-jungle-dwellers When it comes to dress, women and men dress in typical Indian fashion. For instance, Siddi women wear colorful saris and don bindis. Men wear what is generally appropriate for men in their communities. Like in other aspects of life, the Siddi have adopted the common dietary practices of the dominant society. But, an example of a staple meal would be a large portions of rice with dal and pickles. https://www.thebetterindia.com/93626/india-racism-siddi- african/ Athletics has been an important part of the Siddi community and has been a means to uplift youth and a means of escape from poverty and discrimination.

Biography Finlay was born in Faversham, Kent, where his Scottish father, Captain John Finlay FRS, an officer in the Royal Engineers, was inspector of government powder mills. Finlay's father died in 1802, and his Scottish mother and uncle (Kirkman Finlay) took hand of his education. His love of history was attributed to his mother. Intended for the law, he was educated at the University of Glasgow, the University of G√∂ttingen, and the University of Edinburgh, but becoming an enthusiast in the cause of Greece, he joined Byron in the war of independence, and thereafter bought a property near Athens, where he settled and busied himself with schemes for the improvement of the country, which met with little success. For many years, he acted as the special correspondent of the London Times. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1838.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory He died in Athens. His History of Greece, produced in sections between 1843 and 1861, did not at first receive the recognition which its merits deserved, but it has since been given by scholars in all countries, and specially in Germany, a place among works of permanent value, alike for its literary style and the depth and insight of its historical views. It was re- issued in 1877 as A History of Greece from the Roman Conquest to the Present Time (146 BC to 1864).

The China Relief Expedition was part of a multi-national military effort known as the Eight-Nation Alliance to which the United States contributed troops between 1900 and 1901. Towards the close of the expedition, the focus shifted from rescuing non-combatants to suppressing the rebellion. By 1902, at least in the city of Peking, the Boxer Rebellion had been effectively controlled. Background The American annexation of the Philippines resulting from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War stimulated a growing American interest in China for both commercial and humanitarian reasons. The Philippines served as a convenient way point for trade with the Qing China, and would be of use in the protection of American interests in the Pacific. The dominant problem in China at the end of the nineteenth century was its threatened partition by the Great Powers. Both the United States and the British opposed this, and in September 1899 the United States announced it had secured agreement from the interested powers for maintenance of an Open Door policy in their relations with China. Many Chinese resented the extensive foreign intervention in China. This discontent coalesced into the nucleus of a secret group called the Righteous Harmony Society (Áæ©ÂíåÂúò ‚Äì Y√¨h√©tu√°n); Westerners called them Boxers. The Boxers, with the support of Prince Duan, undertook a campaign against foreign influences and foreigners. By early 1900 this movement had brought much of China to the verge of revolution. Boxers in the northern provinces attacked and killed hundreds of Chinese Christians and foreigners, mostly missionaries. The wave of unrest came to an apex following the assassination of Clemens von Ketteler, the German ambassador plenipotentiary, on June 20. The Chinese government then broke off diplomatic relations and demanded that all foreigners leave immediately, promising safe escort. About 3,500 foreigners and Chinese Christians refused to leave, and fearing for their safety, took refuge in the foreign legation compound, where they were besieged. A composite military force of 407 men (including 56 Americans) plus about 200 civilians defended the compound. The Great Powers took immediate steps to organize a large relief expedition for Peking, to stamp out what came to be known as the Boxer Rebellion. Although the William McKinley administration disliked the idea of becoming involved in an international incident with overtones of entangling foreign alliances during an election year, President McKinley agreed to join with the other powers to take steps to rescue their beleaguered nationals. =Seymour Expedition= The Seymour Expedition (10‚Äì26 June), an international column of Sailors and Marines, including 112 Americans, made a hurried attempt to relieve Peking, but failed to get through when it met with severe resistance after it left Tientsin, the nearest port city to Peking. =Skirmishes around Tientsin= As a result of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, the United States had forces available nearby in the Philippines, and was therefore in a position to contribute one of the larger contingents to the international relief expedition. The first American forces left the Philippines on June 14. A detachment of 107 Marines went to China to protect American lives and property; this detachment was drawn from the 1st Marine Infantry Regiment stationed at Cavite. This detachment steamed toward Taku aboard the USS Newark, arriving on June 18, where they joined by 32 Marines aboard the . Under the command of Major Littleton W.T. Waller, the detachment landed at Taku the next day and advanced toward Tientsin. Although General Arthur MacArthur, Jr., commanding in the Philippines, was reluctant to weaken his already overextended forces, he agreed to dispatch to China the 9th Infantry Regiment, which departed from Manila on June 27. On June 17 the United States Navy's China Squadron under Rear Admiral Louis Kempff declined to join foreign naval forces in the Battle of Taku Forts, which guarded the river approach to Tientsin. On July 6 the 9th Infantry Regiment arrived at Taku. Colonel Emerson H. Liscum, commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment, disembarked the regiment's 1st and 2nd Battalions and marched on Tientsin. On 13 July 1900 elements of this force participated in the attack on Tientsin troops from several other nations. The city of Tientsin fell to the Allies on the same day. Liscum and the flag bearer of the regiment were killed by Chinese snipers, the 9th infantry regiment suffered a ten percent casualty rate. The route of the China Relief Expedition from Tientsin to Peking. By the beginning of August, the American forces were reinforced by the 14th Infantry Regiment, and Battery F of the 5th Artillery Regiment.Leonhard, pg. 35. Major-General Adna R. Chaffee, Sr arrived in Nagasaki, Japan, on July 24. Within two days of his arrival, General Chaffee received orders to proceed to Taku and assume command of the American forces there; his new command was designated the China Relief Expedition. Other units, including the 6th Cavalry Regiment, were deployed directly from the mainland United States. Using Manila as a base and Nagasaki as an advance port, the United States eventually assembled some 2,500 soldiers and Marines in China. Battle of Peking By early August a multinational coalition of 19,000 soldiers, including British, French, Japanese, Russian, German, Austrian, Italian, and American troops, was ready to move out of Tientsin toward Peking, some seventy miles distant. High points of the fighting en route were at Pei-tsang, which fell on 5 August, and a severe engagement for American and British contingents at Yang-tsun on 6 August. The force reached the Qing capital on 12 August 1900 and prepared immediately to assault the gates leading into the Outer City. Lacking effective central direction, the relief expedition's attack was poorly executed. The Russian contingent prematurely forced an entrance into the Outer City on 10 August, only to be ambushed by waiting Chinese soldiers and require rescue by other allied troops. In the seizure of the Outer City of Peking on 14 August, elements of the 14th Infantry scaled the Tartar Wall, planted the first foreign flag ever to fly there, and opened the way for British units to relieve the legation compound. Then on 15 August, Captain Henry J. Reilly's Light Battery F of the U.S. 5th Artillery shattered the gates leading into the Inner City with several well-placed salvos, opening the way for the allied troops to occupy the center of Peking. Although American troops had suffered comparatively light losses‚Äîslightly more than 200 killed and wounded‚Äîthey did not take part in subsequent military operations, which consisted primarily of suppressing scattered Boxer elements and rescuing foreigners in the provinces. Most American units were withdrawn to Manila before winter, and mopping up operations in the provinces were left to the other Powers. A few American Regulars remained to form part of an allied occupation force and a small guard for the United States Legation in Peking. Aftermath In a few months the Allies offered peace terms to the Dowager Empress, which included the payment of an indemnity and reaffirm previously existing commercial concessions. During prolonged negotiations an international army of occupation to which the United States contributed a small contingent of Regulars remained in north China. It was withdrawn in September 1901 under terms of the Boxer Protocol. This agreement also provided that the powers maintain a fortified legation in Peking, garrison the Tientsin-Peking Railway‚Äîan American contingent served as a part of this force until 1938‚Äîand receive reparations of $333 million. Of this amount the United States claimed only $25 million. In a few years it became apparent that even this sum was more than was needed to indemnify claims of American nationals and in 1907, and again in 1924, the United States returned portions totaling nearly $17 million to China, which placed the money in a trust fund for education of Chinese youths in both countries. The participation of the United States in the Boxer Uprising marked the first time since the American Revolution that the country had joined with other powers in an allied military operation. The intervention in China represented an instance of the gradual change taking place in the traditional policies and attitudes of the United States in world affairs as a result of the triumph of imperialism. Most Americans still believed, despite the acquisition of overseas colonies, the nation could continue to adhere to its doctrine of isolationism. Developments in the early years of the 20th century would demonstrate, however, that the nation had to make changes and adjustments in many long-established institutions and policies‚Äîincluding those relating to military defense of the country‚Äîto meet the requirements of its new status as a world power.

It was co-located with the civilian London Air Traffic Control Centre to provide a vital link between civil and military flying and airspace requirements. Following the departure of the remaining civil and military air traffic control systems by 2008, the site was closed and demolished for a new residential development. History =Operations= View across the site The station was used to house 700 athletes competing at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, together with RAF Uxbridge and Richmond. The station became a unit of No. 11 Group RAF in January 1965. RAF West Drayton was also the home of the Linesman System, hence the main Operations Building being known as the L1. The system used Link 1 to exchange Air Defence data between the UK and Europe. There were links to Continental Early Warning (CEW) sites at: Reitan, Norway, Maakeroy, Vaedbek, Nieuw-Milligen, Glons and Doulons. Aerospace System Operators (ASOps or Scopies) were responsible for the tracking and identification of every flight - military and civil, that entered or left the UK Air Defence Region (UKADR). This was a labour-intensive task in the days before automatic initiation and tracking systems, but a big improvement on the plotting table and small perspex plaques with information written on them. The School of Fighter Control continued to teach plotting and writing backwards until 1990. The School of Fighter Control moved to RAF West Drayton from RAF Bawdsey, training junior officers to be Fighter Controllers. In addition to teaching RAF officers, foreign and commonwealth students also attended, and there was even one course of Yugoslavian MiG pilots. The station also became responsible for collecting and analysing many reports of UFOs after information was received by the Ministry of Defence. =Closure and redevelopment= A London bus passes the RAF West Drayton complex in 2005 The Royal Air Force withdrew in 1994, at which point the English Electric Lightning acting as a gate guardian was scrapped; only the nose section was retained and sent to the Malta Aviation Museum. Air traffic control services remained, although the section responsible for airspace outside London moved to Swanwick in Hampshire in 2002. The remaining operation was named the London Terminal Control Centre. RAF personnel remained on the site, as military air traffic control functions for the eastern side of England remained. In November 2007, the remaining civil air traffic control services moved to Swanwick, and in January 2008 the military operation also left the site. National Air Traffic Services vacated the site in 2008. The MT section of the Queen's Colour Squadron relocated to RAF Northolt. Plans for 773 homes, a nursing home, shops and offices were approved by the London Borough of Hillingdon in July 2010. Inland Homes named the new development \\"Drayton Garden Village\\", aiming to create a 1930s style village. Demolition work was carried out between 2010 and 2011. Following demolition work, the additional part of the site is undergoing development under the name \\"Parkwest\\". The Drayton Garden Village development opened officially on 21 October 2011, with a ceremony led by the Mayor of Hillingdon.

In the United States, audiences know him for his involvement with that vocal group and for his renditions of \\"God Bless America.\\" He is also known for participating in the 1984 and 1988 Summer Paralympics. Life and career Tynan was born in Dublin, Ireland. His family home is in Johnstown, County Kilkenny, Ireland. He was born with phocomelia, causing both of his lower legs to be underdeveloped; his legs were unusually short (he is now 6-foot 4), his feet were splayed outward, and he had three toes on each foot. He was one of a set of twins; his twin brother Edmond died at 11 months old. At age 20, he had his legs amputated below the knee, after a back injury from a car accident; the injury to his back made it impossible for him to continue using prosthetic legs without the amputation. Within weeks of the accident, he was climbing stairs at his college dormitory on artificial legs. Within a year, Tynan was winning in international competitions in track and field athletics. He represented Ireland in the 1984 and 1988 Summer Paralympics, winning four golds, two silvers, and one bronze medal. (dead link; archived March 3, 2016)) Between 1981 and 1984, he won 18 gold medals from various competitions and set 14 world records. In the following years, Tynan became the first person with a disability to be admitted to the National College of Physical Education, in Limerick. He worked for about two years in the prosthetics industry, then went to Trinity College, became a physician specialising in Orthopedic Sports Injuries, and graduated in 1993. Encouraged to also study voice by his father Edmund, Tynan won a series of voice competition awards and joined the Irish Tenors.

Shortly after this, the Yankees cancelled Tynan's performance of \\"God Bless America\\" for Game 1 of the 2009 American League Championship Series on 16 October 2009 because of the incident.http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/tenor_booted_from_yankees_game_after_NmiZdYsI7VFwNBCZA8QxwI \\"Tenor Booted from Yankees Game After Anti-Semitic Slur\\"], New York Post, 16 October 2009, p. 7. According to Tynan's version of the event, two Jewish women came to view an apartment in his building. Some time afterwards, another real estate agent showed up with a potential client. The agent joked to Tynan \\"at least they're not (Boston) Red Sox fans\\". \\"As long as they're not Jewish,\\" Tynan replied, referring to the exacting women he had met earlier. The prospective client, Jewish paediatrician Dr. Gabrielle Gold-Von Simson, took umbrage and said: \\"Why would you say that?\\" Tynan replied: \\"That would be scary\\", and laughed, referring to the previous incident. Tynan subsequently apologised for his remark. The Anti-Defamation League accepted his apology. Tynan performed at an ADL event in Manhattan soon thereafter.

Timeline  ** Mir Salim Khan I ** Mir Shah Sultan Khan ** Mir Shahbaz Khan (1710 - Unknown) ** Mir Shahbeg Khan ** Mir Shah Khisrow Khan (1750 - 1790) ** Mir Mirza Khan (1790) ** Mir Salim Khan II (1790 - 1825) ** Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan I (1825 - 1864) ** Mir Muhammad Ghazan Khan I (1864 - 1886) ** Mir Safdar Ali Khan (1886 - 1891) *** Mir Safdar fled to China after conquest of Hunza and Nagar States by British Forces in December 1891. His younger brother Nazim Khan was placed in his position by British Raj in September 1892. ** Mir Muhammad Nazim Khan (1892 - 1938) ** Mir Muhammad Ghazan Khan II (1938 - 1945) ** Mir Muhammad Jamal Khan (1945 - 1976) *** Jamal Khan was last ruling Mir of Hunza. His emperorship was abolished as a result of dissolution of Hunza state by Z.A. Bhutto on 25 September 1974. ** Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan II (1976 ‚Äì present)  Abolishment  In 1974 the state became a part of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan under the Pakistani Federal Government. The last Mir of Hunza was Mir Muhammad Jamal Khan.  Current Situation  In the years to follow, the title of Mir was used as symbol of respect for the former Mirs of Hunza. Consequently, Mir Mohammad Jamal Khan's eldest son, Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan (born 31 December 1945), uses the title of Mir on his official documents. Amongst other benefits to the former rulers, the federal Government also pays a privy purse or a monthly stipend to the current Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan. The family is also allowed to retain the former vehicle number plates bearing 'Hunza'. After the abolition of Hunza State, the Northern Areas, now known as Gilgit-Baltistan region, fell under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan contested the elections several times from his hometown of Karimabad and served as a member of the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly. His last position of prominence was as Leader of the House and the first Chief Minister of Gilgit-Baltistan under the rule of President Musharraf. In the general election of 2009, Mir Ghazanfar's son Prince Shehryar Khan (born 5 June 1977) contested the election in place of his father but did not succeed in securing the majority votes from the region; however, he won by a majority in his hometown of Karimabad.

Since 1827 the community has used arms depicting Schloss Bellikon. The present form was established in 1965.  Sites of interest  Bellikon Castle *Schloss Bellikon (Bellikon Castle), which features in the municipal coat of arms, is a small castle that was built in the 13th century by the Habsburgs and was known as Rotten Hus. From 1314 to 1640, the patrician Krieg family of Zurich owned the castle. It was later auctioned twice, most recently at the end of September 1999.  Administration  The community meeting of the enfranchised voters exercises legislative power. The implementing authority is the local council. The term of office is four years. It leads and represents the municipality. In addition it carries out the resolutions of the municipality meeting and the tasks assigned by the canton and the Swiss Federation.  Economy  Suva clinic The largest business (and taxpayer) in the village is the Suva, which is a rehab clinic operating with over 200 beds. There are not many businesses, and the majority are small. Many of the residents are employed in the agglomerations of Baden and Zurich. , Bellikon had an unemployment rate of 1.49%. , there were 37 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 13 businesses involved in this sector. 23 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 9 businesses in this sector. 496 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 34 businesses in this sector. there were 769 total workers who lived in the municipality. Of these, 589 or about 76.6% of the residents worked outside Bellikon while 321 people commuted into the municipality for work. There were a total of 501 jobs (of at least 6 hours per week) in the municipality.Statistical Department of Canton Aargau-Bereich 11 Verkehr und Nachrichtenwesen accessed 21 January 2010 Bellikon has a rehab hospital which has over 200 beds.

Released in 1963, it was an evolution of the final series of DB4. Although not the first in the DB series, the DB5 is the best-known cinematic James Bond car, first appearing in the James Bond film Goldfinger (1964). Design The principal differences between the DB4 Series V and the DB5 are the all-aluminium engine, enlarged from 3.7 L to 4.0 L; a new robust ZF five-speed transmission (except for some of the very first DB5s); and three SU carburettors. This engine, producing , which propelled the car to , available on the Vantage (high powered) version of the DB4 since March 1962, became the standard Aston Martin power unit with the launch in September 1963 of the DB5. Standard equipment on the DB5 included reclining seats, wool pile carpets, electric windows, twin fuel tanks, chrome wire wheels, oil cooler, magnesium-alloy body built to superleggera patent technique, full leather trim in the cabin and even a fire extinguisher. All models have two doors and are of a 2+2 configuration. The boot (trunk) lids differed slightly between the DB4 mark 5 and the DB5. Like the DB4, the DB5 used a live rear axle. At the beginning, the original four-speed manual (with optional overdrive) was standard fitment, but it was soon dropped in favour of the ZF five-speed. A three-speed Borg-Warner DG automatic transmission was available as well. The automatic option was then changed to the Borg-Warner Model 8 shortly before the DB6 replaced the DB5. Aston Martin DB5.

Variants =DB5 Vantage= Aston Martin DB5 Vantage. The high-performance DB5 Vantage was introduced in 1964 featuring three SU model HD-8 side-draft carburetors and revised camshaft profiles, delivering greater top-end performance at the expense of overall flexibility, especially as legendary Webers are renowned as 'full-throttle' devices. This engine produced at 5,500 rpm. 65 DB5 Vantage coup√©s were built. =DB5 convertible= 1965 DB5 Vantage convertible. 123 convertible DB5s were produced (also with bodies by Touring), though they did not use the typical \\"Volante\\" name until 1965. The convertible model was offered from 1963 through to 1965. Originally only 19 of the 123 DB5 Convertibles made were left-hand drive. 12 cars were originally fitted with a factory Vantage engine, and at least one further convertible was subsequently factory fitted with a DB6 specification Vantage engine. A rare factory option (actually fitted by Works Service prior to customer delivery) was a steel removable hard top. From October 1965 to October 1966, Aston Martin used the last 37 of the Aston Martin DB5 chassis' to make another convertible model. These 37 cars were known as \\"Short Chassis\\" Volantes and were the first Aston Martins to hold the \\"Volante\\" name. Although calling it a \\"Short Chassis\\" is a bit of a misnomer as the \\"short\\" comes from comparing it to the subsequent DB6, which has a longer chassis. When compared to the DB5, it is not \\"short\\" but rather the same size, however these cars differ to the DB5 convertible models as they feature DB6 split front and rear bumpers and rear TR4 lights, as also used on the DB6. =DB5 shooting-brake= DB5 shooting-brake. A prototype DB5 shooting-brake was custom produced by the factory for David Brown, an avid hunter and dog owner, and a further 11-12 coup√©s were custom modified for Aston Martin by independent coachbuilder, Harold Radford. The taillights used were Triumph units, and were also adopted for the succeeding DB6. In August 2019 a DB5 sold for a record $1.765m (¬£1.456m) making it the most valuable Shooting Brake bodied-car of any marque sold at auction. James Bond's DB5 alt=A silver-colour car; the plate reads \\"JBZ6007\\" The Aston Martin DB5 is among the best-known cars in the world thanks to special effects expert John Stears, who modified the DB5 for use by James Bond in the film Goldfinger (1964). Although Ian Fleming had placed Bond in a DB Mark III in the novel, Stears persuaded the company to make its DB5 prototype available. To promote the film, the two DB5s were showcased at the 1964 New York World's Fair, and it was dubbed \\"the most famous car in the world\\", and subsequently sales of the car rose. In January 2006, one of these was auctioned in Arizona; the same car was originally bought in 1970 from the owner, Sir Anthony Bamford, by a Tennessee museum owner. A car, mainly used for promoting the movie, is now located in the Louwman Museum, Netherlands. The first DB5 prototype used in Goldfinger with the chassis number DP/216/1 was later stripped of its weaponry and gadgetry by Aston Martin and then resold. It was then retrofitted by subsequent owners with nonoriginal weaponry. It later appeared in the film The Cannonball Run (1981), in which it was driven by Roger Moore. The Chassis DP/216/1 DB5 was stolen in 1997 from its last owner in Florida and is currently still missing. Since the film, the DB5 has become closely associated with the James Bond franchise and is considered to be the quintessential vehicle of the character. As such, it has reappeared in subsequent films over the years. Within the universe of James Bond, the same car (registration BMT 216A) was used again in the following film, Thunderball, a year later. A different Aston Martin DB5 (registration BMT 214A) was used in the 1995 Bond film GoldenEye, in which the car is Bond's personal vehicle and has no gadgets. Although it did come equipped with a champagne cooler in the arm rest and a fax machine. Three different DB5s were used for filming. This same car briefly reappeared in the next film, Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), and was set to make a cameo appearance in the Scotland-set scenes in The World Is Not Enough (1999), but most of the scenes were cut in the final edit. Yet another DB5 (registration 56526) appeared in Casino Royale (2006), this time owned by the villain, Alex Dimitrios. This car has Bahamian number plates and left-hand drive (where the previous British versions had been right-hand drive). In the film Bond wins the car from Dimitrios after beating him in a card game. The Goldeneye DB5 currently resides at the London Film Museum in Covent Garden. Of the three cars used in the production, one car was filmed for the static ocean side shot, one's participation is unknown, and DB5/1885/R was driven in the chase scene against the Ferrari in Monte Carlo. DB5/1885/R was bought at a Christies auction in 2001 and entered the Guinness Book of Records that year for the highest paid for a Bond memorabilia. It was first exhibited at the Bond exhibition at Beaulieu before moving to its new home in The London Film Museum. Another silver-birch DB5 with the original registration BMT 216A was used in the 23rd James Bond film, Skyfall, during the 50th anniversary of the release of the first James Bond film Dr. No (1962). It is unclear if this car is meant to be the same one Bond won in Casino Royale, refitted with British number plates, right-hand drive, and gadgets. The car is destroyed in the film's climactic finale. It is seen again in Spectre (2015), firstly in Q's underground workshop in various stages of rebuild, and at the film's ending, fully rebuilt, with Bond driving away with it. On 1 June 2010, RM Auctions announced the upcoming auction of a DB5 used in both Goldfinger and Thunderball. The owner (Jerry Lee, president/owner of WBEB Radio in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) originally bought the car from the Aston Martin company in 1969. At the auction, the DB5 was sold for ¬£2.6 million. (¬£2.912m with commission) equates to $4.6m. In August 2019 a DB5 Bond car made to promote Thunderball sold for a record $6,385,000 (¬£5,267,593). Aston Martin announced in August 2018 that it plans to build 25 replicas of the DB5 as seen in Goldfinger, including some of the gadgets seen in the film, each selling for about . In 2019, it was confirmed by Aston Martin that the car would be featured in the next Bond film, No Time to Die, to be released in April 2020. The plan was to build a replica, not use an existing vehicle. In fact, a full 25 were to be built, in partnership with Eon Productions, the Bond films producer. The Goldfinger DB5 cars were to have several functional spy gadgets, including smoke screen, oil slick, revolving license plates, machine guns (non-functional) and rear bullet shield. =Promotional items= alt=a silver- coloured toy car showing a plastic man being ejected through the roof. With Goldfinger, Corgi Toys began its decades-long relationship with the Bond franchise: they produced a toy of the car, which became the biggest selling toy of 1964. A highly detailed 1:24 scale plastic kit was also produced by Airfix between 1966 and 1970. A highly detailed 1:24 scale die-cast model with many working features was produced as a limited edition in 2006 for Casino Royale, by the Danbury Mint. In January 2011 a 1/8 scale model was released by part work magazine publisher GE Fabbri in the UK. Over 85 weekly parts, the model builds into one of the biggest 007 scale models to date, with working gadgets and lights. In 2015 Hotwheels Elite released their Cult Classics Goldfinger Aston Martin DB5 in 1/18 and 1/43 scale, the 1/18 model featured many of the gadgets from the original film. In July 2018 Lego and Naomie Harris unveiled a 1:8 scale 1,290 piece set with bullet shield and ejector seat. In popular culture Aside from its use in the Bond films, the DB5 also appeared in \\"The Noble Sportsman\\", a 1964 episode of The Saint TV series starring future Bond, Roger Moore. The car in question was the original Chassis DP/216/1 DB5, with the registration BMT 216A, used in Goldfinger. The episode was filmed before Goldfinger, when the car was still painted in its original dark red coat. The Chassis DP/216/1 DB5 also appeared in the film The Cannonball Run (1981), in which it was again driven by Moore (although he did not drive the car during his Bond tenure). In the film, Moore plays Seymour Goldfarb, Jr, a man who believes himself to be Roger Moore, who participates in a madcap, cross-country road race. Since its appearance in Goldfinger, the car had been stripped of its gadgets and re-registered as a regular road car. The car appears with its new registration number, 6633PP, and replica gadgets that were fitted to the car for the film. The 1983 reunion telefilm The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair includes a brief cameo by George Lazenby as \\"JB\\", a white-tuxedoed British man shown driving a DB5, who assists Napoleon Solo during a car chase. \\"It's just like On Her Majesty's Secret Service,\\" enthuses a female character at the conclusion of the cameo. This special came out in 1983, the same year as Octopussy and Never Say Never Again were released. It appears in several video games such as 007 Racing, Driver San Francisco (Deluxe Edition), James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire, From Russia with Love, and James Bond 007: Blood Stone. The film, From Russia with Love was released in 1963, one year before Goldfinger (in which the DB5 was first used), but the video game used the car. It appeared in animated form in James Bond Jr. in the very first episode \\"The Beginning\\". In the episode it was able to transform into a plane and could be driven by remote control. The car was destroyed in a plane crash and was recycled into a red sports car, which the PAL VHS cover identifies as the \\"Aston Martin Super\\". A version of the car appeared in Grand Theft Auto: London 1969, being called a \\"James Bomb\\". Leonardo DiCaprio was seen driving the car in Catch Me If You Can (2002) imitating Bond (even down to the suit) in Goldfinger, during a scene which takes place the year the film was released. It also appeared in the action comedy film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003), driven by Bernie Mac's character, Jimmy Bosley. It is only seen once in which Bosley is driving a witness, Max Petroni (portrayed by Shia LaBeouf) to his mother's house, to be safe from the O'Grady Crime Syndicate. The French spy comedy film, Double Z√©ro (2004) directed by G√©rard Pir√®s also featured a DB5. It can be seen once in the film, when the two main characters go to meet the parody of Q. An Aston Martin DB5 appeared in heavily stylized form as \\"Finn McMissile\\", a British secret agent voiced by Michael Caine in the Pixar film Cars 2 (2011). The car character was a homage to the Bond DB5, although it also bore a resemblance to the Volvo P1800, as used by the fictional British secret agent Simon Templar in The Saint television series. The car appeared in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again, a sequel to Fleming's novel by Frank Cottrell-Boyce, which was published in 2011. In the book, it is heavily implied that the car had belonged to James Bond. In 2013, Grand Theft Auto V featured a car called the \\"JB 700\\" that is based on the DB5; In the game's story mode, the player must steal one equipped with numerous gadgets ‚Äì including caltrops and functional machine guns mounted to the car's front wings ‚Äì from a film set. Need for Speed: Most Wanted released a DLC named \\"Movie Legends\\" that featured the car. The music video for the Usher song \\"Burn\\" features a DB5. The same car with the same registration number appears a number of times in the short lived TV series Fastlane. In the 2015 TV series Thunderbirds Are Go a DB5 can be seen as Lady Penelope gets into Fab 1 in the first episode \\"Ring of Fire\\". The DB5 appears in yet another racing game entitled Forza Horizon 4 as part of the James Bond DLC pack. The gadgets used in Goldfinger can be seen in its showcase mode.

It refers to certain two-person topological games of length œâ. AD states that every game of a certain type is determined; that is, one of the two players has a winning strategy. They motivated AD by its interesting consequences, and suggested that AD could be true in the least natural model L(R) of a set theory, which accepts only a weak form of the axiom of choice (AC) but contains all real and all ordinal numbers. Some consequences of AD followed from theorems proved earlier by Stefan Banach and Stanis≈Çaw Mazur, and Morton Davis. Mycielski and Stanis≈Çaw ≈öwierczkowski contributed another one: AD implies that all sets of real numbers are Lebesgue measurable. Later Donald A. Martin and others proved more important consequences, especially in descriptive set theory. In 1988, John R. Steel and W. Hugh Woodin concluded a long line of research. Assuming the existence of some uncountable cardinal numbers analogous to \\\\alef_0, they proved the original conjecture of Mycielski and Steinhaus that AD is true in L(R). Types of game that are determined The axiom of determinacy refers to games of the following specific form: Consider a subset A of the Baire space œâœâ of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. Two players, I and II, alternately pick natural numbers :n0, n1, n2, n3, ... After infinitely many moves, a sequence (n_i)_{i \\\\in \\\\omega} is generated. Player I wins the game if and only if the sequence generated is an element of A. The axiom of determinacy is the statement that all such games are determined. Not all games require the axiom of determinacy to prove them determined. If the set A is clopen, the game is essentially a finite game, and is therefore determined. Similarly, if A is a closed set, then the game is determined. It was shown in 1975 by Donald A. Martin that games whose winning set is a Borel set are determined. It follows from the existence of sufficiently large cardinals that all games with winning set a projective set are determined (see Projective determinacy), and that AD holds in L(R). The axiom of determinacy implies that for every subspace X of the real numbers, the Banach‚ÄìMazur game BM(X) is determined (and therefore that every set of reals has the property of Baire).  Incompatibility of the axiom of determinacy with the axiom of choice  The set S1 of all first player strategies in an œâ-game G has the same cardinality as the continuum. The same is true of the set S2 of all second player strategies. We note that the cardinality of the set SG of all sequences possible in G is also the continuum. Let A be the subset of SG of all sequences that make the first player win. With the axiom of choice we can well order the continuum; furthermore, we can do so in such a way that any proper initial portion does not have the cardinality of the continuum. We create a counterexample by transfinite induction on the set of strategies under this well ordering: We start with the set A undefined. Let T be the \\"time\\" whose axis has length continuum. We need to consider all strategies {s1(T)} of the first player and all strategies {s2(T)} of the second player to make sure that for every strategy there is a strategy of the other player that wins against it. For every strategy of the player considered we will generate a sequence that gives the other player a win. Let t be the time whose axis has length ‚Ñµ0 and which is used during each game sequence. # Consider the current strategy {s1(T)} of the first player. #Go through the entire game, generating (together with the first player's strategy s1(T)) a sequence {a(1), b(2), a(3), b(4),...,a(t), b(t+1),...}. #Decide that this sequence does not belong to A, i.e. s1(T) lost. #Consider the strategy {s2(T)} of the second player. #Go through the next entire game, generating (together with the second player's strategy s2(T)) a sequence {c(1), d(2), c(3), d(4),...,c(t), d(t+1),...}, making sure that this sequence is different from {a(1), b(2), a(3), b(4),...,a(t), b(t+1),...}. #Decide that this sequence belongs to A, i.e. s2(T) lost. #Keep repeating with further strategies if there are any, making sure that sequences already considered do not become generated again. (We start from the set of all sequences and each time we generate a sequence and refute a strategy we project the generated sequence onto first player moves and onto second player moves, and we take away the two resulting sequences from our set of sequences.) #For all sequences that did not come up in the above consideration arbitrarily decide whether they belong to A, or to the complement of A. Once this has been done we have a game G. If you give me a strategy s1 then we considered that strategy at some time T = T(s1). At time T, we decided an outcome of s1 that would be a loss of s1. Hence this strategy fails. But this is true for an arbitrary strategy; hence the axiom of determinacy and the axiom of choice are incompatible.  Infinite logic and the axiom of determinacy  Many different versions of infinitary logic were proposed in the late 20th century. One reason that has been given for believing in the axiom of determinacy is that it can be written as follows (in a version of infinite logic): \\\\forall G \\\\subseteq Seq(S): \\\\forall a \\\\in S :\\\\exists a' \\\\in S :\\\\forall b \\\\in S :\\\\exists b' \\\\in S :\\\\forall c \\\\in S :\\\\exists c' \\\\in S ... : (a,a',b,b',c,c'...) \\\\in G OR \\\\exists a \\\\in S :\\\\forall a' \\\\in S :\\\\exists b \\\\in S :\\\\forall b' \\\\in S :\\\\exists c \\\\in S :\\\\forall c' \\\\in S ... :(a,a',b,b',c,c'...) otin G Note: Seq(S) is the set of all \\\\omega-sequences of S. The sentences here are infinitely long with a countably infinite list of quantifiers where the ellipses appear. In an infinitary logic, this principle is therefore a natural generalization of the usual (de Morgan) rule for quantifiers that are true for finite formulas, such as \\\\forall a:\\\\exists b : \\\\forall c: \\\\exists d : R(a,b,c,d) OR \\\\exists a: \\\\forall b: \\\\exists c: \\\\forall d: \\\\lnot R(a,b,c,d).  Large cardinals and the axiom of determinacy  The consistency of the axiom of determinacy is closely related to the question of the consistency of large cardinal axioms. By a theorem of Woodin, the consistency of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory without choice (ZF) together with the axiom of determinacy is equivalent to the consistency of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory with choice (ZFC) together with the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals. Since Woodin cardinals are strongly inaccessible, if AD is consistent, then so are an infinity of inaccessible cardinals. Moreover, if to the hypothesis of an infinite set of Woodin cardinals is added the existence of a measurable cardinal larger than all of them, a very strong theory of Lebesgue measurable sets of reals emerges, as it is then provable that the axiom of determinacy is true in L(R), and therefore that every set of real numbers in L(R) is determined.

In this paradigm, a processor executes instructions in an order governed by the availability of input data and execution units, rather than by their original order in a program. In doing so, the processor can avoid being idle while waiting for the preceding instruction to complete and can, in the meantime, process the next instructions that are able to run immediately and independently.  History  Out-of-order execution is a restricted form of data flow computation, which was a major research area in computer architecture in the 1970s and early 1980s. Important academic research in this subject was led by Yale Patt and his HPSm simulator. A paper by James E. Smith and A. R. Pleszkun, published in 1985 completed the scheme by describing how the precise behavior of exceptions could be maintained in out-of-order machines. Arguably the first machine to use out-of-order execution is the CDC 6600 (1964), which uses a scoreboard to resolve conflicts (although in modern usage, such scoreboarding is considered to be in-order execution, not out-of- order execution, since such machines stall on the first RAW conflict ‚Äì strictly speaking, such machines initiate execution in-order, although they may complete execution out-of-order). About three years later, the IBM System/360 Model 91 (1966) introduced Tomasulo's algorithm, which makes full out-of-order execution possible. In 1990, IBM introduced the first out-of- order microprocessor, the POWER1, although out-of-order execution is limited to floating-point instructions (as is also the case on the Model 91). In 1990s, out-of-order execution became more common, and was featured in the IBM/Motorola PowerPC 601 (1993), Fujitsu/HAL SPARC64 (1995), Intel Pentium Pro (1995), MIPS R10000 (1996), HP PA-8000 (1996), AMD K5 (1996) and DEC Alpha 21264 (1996). Notable exceptions to this trend include the Sun UltraSPARC, HP/Intel Itanium, Intel Atom until Silvermont Architecture, and the IBM POWER6. The high logical complexity of the out-of-order technique is the reason that it did not reach mainstream machines until the mid-1990s. Many low-end processors meant for cost-sensitive markets still do not use this paradigm due to the large silicon area required for its implementation. Low power usage is another design goal that is harder to achieve with an out-of- order execution (OoOE) design.  Basic concept  = In-order processors = In earlier processors, the processing of instructions is performed in an instruction cycle normally consisting of the following steps: # Instruction fetch. # If input operands are available (in processor registers, for instance), the instruction is dispatched to the appropriate functional unit. If one or more operands are unavailable during the current clock cycle (generally because they are being fetched from memory), the processor stalls until they are available. # The instruction is executed by the appropriate functional unit. # The functional unit writes the results back to the register file. = Out-of-order processors = This new paradigm breaks up the processing of instructions into these steps: # Instruction fetch. # Instruction dispatch to an instruction queue (also called instruction buffer or reservation stations). # The instruction waits in the queue until its input operands are available. The instruction is then allowed to leave the queue before earlier, than older instructions. # The instruction is issued to the appropriate functional unit and executed by that unit. # The results are queued. # Only after all older instructions have their results written back to the register file, then this result is written back to the register file. This is called the graduation or retire stage. The key concept of OoOE processing is to allow the processor to avoid a class of stalls that occur when the data needed to perform an operation are unavailable. In the outline above, the OoOE processor avoids the stall that occurs in step (2) of the in-order processor when the instruction is not completely ready to be processed due to missing data. OoOE processors fill these \\"slots\\" in time with other instructions that are ready, then re-order the results at the end to make it appear that the instructions were processed as normal. The way the instructions are ordered in the original computer code is known as program order, in the processor they are handled in data order, the order in which the data, operands, become available in the processor's registers. Fairly complex circuitry is needed to convert from one ordering to the other and maintain a logical ordering of the output; the processor itself runs the instructions in seemingly random order. The benefit of OoOE processing grows as the instruction pipeline deepens and the speed difference between main memory (or cache memory) and the processor widens. On modern machines, the processor runs many times faster than the memory, so during the time an in-order processor spends waiting for data to arrive, it could have processed a large number of instructions.  Dispatch and issue decoupling allows out-of-order issue  One of the differences created by the new paradigm is the creation of queues that allows the dispatch step to be decoupled from the issue step and the graduation stage to be decoupled from the execute stage. An early name for the paradigm was decoupled architecture. In the earlier in-order processors, these stages operated in a fairly lock-step, pipelined fashion. The instructions of the program may not be run in the originally specified order, as long as the end result is correct. It separates the fetch and decode stages from the execute stage in a pipelined processor by using a buffer. The buffer's purpose is to partition the memory access and execute functions in a computer program and achieve high-performance by exploiting the fine-grain parallelism between the two. In doing so, it effectively hides all memory latency from the processor's perspective. A larger buffer can, in theory, increase throughput. However, if the processor has a branch misprediction then the entire buffer may need to be flushed, wasting a lot of clock cycles and reducing the effectiveness. Furthermore, larger buffers create more heat and use more die space. For this reason processor designers today favour a multi-threaded design approach. Decoupled architectures are generally thought of as not useful for general purpose computing as they do not handle control intensive code well. Control intensive code include such things as nested branches that occur frequently in operating system kernels. Decoupled architectures play an important role in scheduling in very long instruction word (VLIW) architectures. To avoid false operand dependencies, which would decrease the frequency when instructions could be issued out of order, a technique called register renaming is used. In this scheme, there are more physical registers than defined by the architecture. The physical registers are tagged so that multiple versions of the same architectural register can exist at the same time.  Execute and writeback decoupling allows program restart  The queue for results is necessary to resolve issues such as branch mispredictions and exceptions/traps. The results queue allows programs to be restarted after an exception, which requires the instructions to be completed in program order. The queue allows results to be discarded due to mispredictions on older branch instructions and exceptions taken on older instructions. The ability to issue instructions past branches that are yet to resolve is known as speculative execution.  Micro-architectural choices  * Are the instructions dispatched to a centralized queue or to multiple distributed queues? :IBM PowerPC processors use queues that are distributed among the different functional units while other out-of-order processors use a centralized queue. IBM uses the term reservation stations for their distributed queues. * Is there an actual results queue or are the results written directly into a register file? For the latter, the queueing function is handled by register maps that hold the register renaming information for each instruction in flight. :Early Intel out-of-order processors use a results queue called a re-order buffer, while most later out-of-order processors use register maps. :More precisely: Intel P6 family microprocessors have both a re-order buffer (ROB) and a register alias table (RAT). The ROB was motivated mainly by branch misprediction recovery. :The Intel P6 family was among the earliest OoOE microprocessors, but were supplanted by the NetBurst architecture. Years later, Netburst proved to be a dead end due to its long pipeline that assumed the possibility of much higher operating frequencies. Materials were not able to match the design's ambitious clock targets due to thermal issues and later designs based on NetBurst, namely Tejas and Jayhawk, were cancelled. Intel reverted to the P6 design as the basis of the Core and Nehalem microarchitectures. The succeeding Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, and Haswell microarchitectures are a departure from the reordering techniques used in P6 and employ re-ordering techniques from the EV6 and the P4 but with a somewhat shorter pipeline.

The subsidiary states included Hunza, Nagar and other states in the present day districts of Gupis-Yasin, Ghizer, Darel, Tangir and Diamer. The agency was based in the town of Gilgit, which was itself under the direct administration of the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. An Officer on Special Duty was established in 1877 in the town of Gilgit, upgraded to a permanent Political Agent in 1889. In 1935, the Gilgit tehsil of the princely state was leased from the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, which also came under the administration of the Political Agent. The Astore tehsil continued to be under the Maharaja's administration. In July 1947, shortly before the independence of India and Pakistan, the Gilgit Leased Area was returned to the Maharaja. However, the Gilgit Scouts rebelled on 1 November 1947 after the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India, and Pakistan took over the administration of the areas soon thereafter. Under Pakistani administration, the Gilgit district, the Astore district as well as the subsidiary states were clubbed together under the name the \\"Gilgit Agency\\". The unit remained in existence till about 1974, when the it was abolished by the Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and made part of Federally Administered Northern Areas (later renamed to \\"Gilgit-Baltistan\\"). India continues to claim the entire region of Gilgit-Baltistan as part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.  Area and borders  Present day Gilgit-Baltistan The areas under the Gilgit Agency consisted of * the state of Chilas (present day Diamer District) * the territories of Darel and Tangir (now their own districts) * Punial, Yasin, Kuh-Ghizar, and Ishkoman regions (present day Gupis‚ÄìYasin and Ghizer districts) * the states of Hunza and Nagar (now their own districts) All these states had their own rulers or systems of administration; the Agency provided supervision. Until 1935, Gilgit and Astore tehsils (now districts) comprised the Gilgit wazarat of Jammu and Kashmir with its own governor (wazir-e-wazarat), who was also based at Gilgit. However, the Political Agent did exercise some control over the wazarat's affairs, leading to a system of 'dyarchy' and causing frictions. In 1935, the British leased the Gilgit tehsil as the \\"Gilgit Leased Area\\". It was administered directly by the Political Agent. The Astore tehsil became its own wazarat, which was administered as part of the Kashmir province of Jammu and Kashmir. In 1941, the Gilgit Agency had a population of 77,000 and the Gilgit leased area had 23,000. Both the areas together came to be loosely referred to as the 'Gilgit Agency'. The administration of the Agency was carried out \\"on behalf of His Highness‚Äô Government\\". The Political Agent communicated with the central government in New Delhi via Peshawar (the capital of the North-West Frontier Province) for reasons of security. The administered area was bounded in the west by the Chitral State, in the northwest by Afghanistan's Wakhan corridor, in the east by Chinese Turkestan, in the south by the Kashmir province, and in the southeast by the Ladakh‚ÄìBaltistan wazarat of Jammu and Kashmir.  Background  The Treaty of Amritsar (1846) granted to Raja Gulab Singh the entirety of the Sikh Empire. During the First Anglo-Sikh War, Maharaja Gulab Singh Jamwal (Dogra) helped the British Empire against the Sikhs. After the defeat of the Sikh Empire, The Treaty of Lahore (9 March 1846) and the Treaty of Amritsar (1846) (16 March 1846) were signed. Under Article IV of The Treaty of Lahore, signed between the Maharaja Duleep Singh and the British Empire, the Sikhs ceded the territories between the rivers Beas and Indus as war indemnity. > IV. The British Government having demanded from the Lahore State, as > indemnification for the expenses of the war, in addition to the cession of > territory described in Article 3, payment of one and half crore of Rupees, > and the Lahore Government being unable to pay the whole of this sum at this > time, or to give security satisfactory to the British Government for its > eventual payment, the Maharajah cedes to the Honourable Company, in > perpetual sovereignty, as equivalent for one crore of Rupees, all his forts, > territories, rights and interests in the hill countries, which are situated > between the Rivers Beas and Indus, including the Provinces of Cashmere and > Hazarah. In the north, these territories included Gilgit (the present Gilgit District), Astore (the present Astore District) and Chilas (presently a tehsil of the Diamir District). By 1860, the three areas were constituted as a Gilgit wazarat (district), and the princely states of Hunza and Nagar to the northeast accepted the suzerainty of the Maharaja Ranbir Singh. The Treaty of Amritsar did not constrain the Maharaja from establishing relationships with external powers, and he is said to have had dealings with Russia, Afghanistan and Chinese Turkestan. The British watched these developments with concern, especially in the light of Russian expansion in the north.  Establishment of the Agency  British Westland Wapitis based at an airfield in Gilgit around 1930 Ranbir Singh's successor Pratap Singh was a weak ruler. The British used the opportunity to establish an Agency in Gilgit in 1889, stationing a Political Agent who reported to the British Resident in Srinagar. The initial purpose of the Agency was to keep watch on the frontier and to restrain Hunza and Nagar from dealing with the Russians. Soon afterwards, the states of Hunza and Nagar were brought under the direct purview of the Gilgit Agency. The Jammu and Kashmir State Forces were stationed in a garrison at Gilgit, which were used by the Agency to keep order. They were replaced by a British- officered Gilgit Scouts in 1913. Gradually, the princely states to the west of Gilgit (Punial, Yasin, Kuh-Ghizar, Ishkoman and Chitral) were also brought under the purview of the Gilgit Agency. These areas were nominally under the suzerainty of Kashmir but were directly administered by the Agency. Following a rebellion 1892, Chitral was transferred to the Malakand Agency in the Frontier Areas. The remaining areas remained under the control of the Gilgit Agency, which administered them through governors.  Inside Pakistan  The local rulers of these territories continued to appear at the Jammu and Kashmir Durbars until 1947. Following the Partition of India, on 31 October 1947 the British officer William Brown led the Gilgit Scouts in a coup against the Dogra governor of Gilgit which resulted in the region becoming part of Pakistan administered Kashmir. Most of the Ladakh Wazarat, including the Kargil area, became part of Indian-administered Kashmir. The Line of Control established at the end of the war is the current de facto border of India and Pakistan. Initially, the Gilgit Agency was not absorbed into any of the provinces of West Pakistan, but was ruled directly by political agents of the federal government of Pakistan. In 1963, Pakistan entered into a treaty with China to transfer part of the Gilgit Agency to China, (the Trans-Karakoram Tract), with the proviso that the settlement was subject to the final solution of the Kashmir dispute. The dissolution of the province of West Pakistan in 1970 was accompanied by change of the name of the Gilgit Agency to the Northern Areas. In 1974, the states of Hunza and Nagar and the independent valleys of Darel-Tangir, which had been de facto dependencies of Pakistan, were also incorporated into the Northern Areas. Pakistan and India continue to dispute the sovereignty of the territories that had comprised the Gilgit Agency.

The company has major offices located in Baltimore, Maryland; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Denver, Colorado; Norwood, Massachusetts; Exton, Pennsylvania; Harrison, New York; Johns Creek, Georgia; Plano, Texas; and St. Petersburg, Florida. Additional affiliated offices are located throughout the United States. In 1999, it became a subsidiary of Aegon, a European financial services company headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands. Transamerica funds the Transamerica Institute, a nonprofit foundation which comprises the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies and the Transamerica Center for Health Studies. History The Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco In October 1904, A.P. Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco which later became known as Bank of America. In 1928, Giannini put the bank into a holding company he named the Transamerica Corporation. In 1930, the company acquired Occidental Life Insurance Company, founded in 1906, and renamed it Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company. Gradually, the company became a more diversified conglomerate which included the film distributor United Artists, Transamerica Airlines and Budget Rent a Car. In 1972, the company completed construction of the Transamerica Pyramid skyscraper in San Francisco which served as its headquarters for many years. Although the company currently retains only a few offices in the building, the pyramid is still depicted in the company's logo and marketing materials. In the 1980s, Transamerica began to divest and focused exclusively on financial services. It was eventually pared down to three main product divisions: insurance, investments and retirement. In July 1999, Transamerica CEO Frank C. Herringer announced that Aegon, the Netherlands-based insurer, would acquire the company. Transamerica Occidental merged into Transamerica Life Insurance Company on October 1, 2008. When the film Heaven's Gate distributed by United Artists was released on November 19, 1980, it was a huge critical and box office failure, losing more than $44 million for UA and Transamerica. Because of this financial debacle, Transamerica sold United Artists to its current owner Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $380 million on May 21, 1981. Products and services Transamerica primarily offers insurance and financial services. Types of life and health insurance policies offered include term life, whole life, universal life, variable universal life, accidental death, Medicare supplement, and long term care. Transamerica companies also offer a variety of mutual funds and annuities. Transamerica has over 15,000 licensed insurance agents just in the state of California. Transamerica‚Äôs retirement division offers defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans, including 401(k) and 403(b), 457, profit sharing, money purchase, cash balance, Taft-Hartley, multiple employer plans, nonqualified deferred compensation, and rollover individual retirement accounts. Other services include plan-level record keeping and administrative services, participant communications and education services, fiduciary risk mitigation services, open investment architecture, and compliance guidance and regulatory support. Sponsorships Transamerica works with like-minded academics, organizations, and athletes to promote the important link between Wealth and Health as well as its presence in local communities. Transamerica is a long-time sponsor of Cedar Rapids native and 12-time PGA Tour winner Zach Johnson, who captured the 2015 Open Championship, 2007 Masters Tournament, and represented the U.S. on five Ryder Cup teams. Transamerica also sponsors Kyle Stanley, 2009 Open Championship winner Stewart Cink, and Azahara Munoz, in addition to the American Junior Golf Association and its annual Transamerica Scholastic Junior All-America teams. With a large employee presence in Denver, Transamerica in 2015 became the shirt sponsor of the Colorado Rapids, winners of the 2010 MLS Cup. Transamerica has an additional sponsorship agreement with Rapids and United States national team goalkeeper Tim Howard. Transamerica currently collaborates with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology AgeLab, as well as the American Heart Association. Foundations Transamerica funds two foundations: the Aegon Transamerica Foundation and the Transamerica Institute. It created the Aegon Transamerica Foundation in 1994 to provide financial grants to community non-profit organizations. Transamerica employees also volunteer services to these organizations. The foundation received the Corporate Citizenship Award in 2013 for creating the first urban farm in Iowa. The Transamerica Institute consists of two divisions: the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies and the Transamerica Center for Health Studies. The Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies researches and provides education on trends, issues, and opportunities related to saving and planning for retirement. The Transamerica Center for Health Studies focuses on identifying, researching, and analyzing health care issues facing consumers and employers. The Transamerica Institute is funded by contributions from Transamerica Life Insurance Company.

The film was released on direct-to-VHS in the United States on July 15, 1992.Black Belt - May 1993 Vol. 31, No. 5 The ninth- and 10th-best fight films are, respectively, Johnathan Ke Quan's Breathing Fire and Tang Tak Wing's Trained to Fight. Breathing Fire includes some original tournament fight sequences between Quan and Eddie Saavedra, which ... It is a remake of the 1977 Hong Kong film The Flash Legs that starred Tao-liang Tan, who executive produced and wrote this film under the pseudonym of Delon Tanners. This was Eddie Saavedra's first American film only. After the film, Saavedra has retired from acting. Plot Michael Moore (Jerry Trimble), a Vietnam vet, pulls off a bank heist with his gang, which includes the bank's manager. To ensure the loyalty of everyone involved, a set of keys is made to the hiding place for the loot so it can only be opened if all the members are present. These sets of keys were encrusted in a fake pizza mold that was later sliced and given to the gang. The bank manager gets cold feet and tries to back out, but Michael and his henchman arrive to kill him and his wife in their home. The bank manager's daughter Annie (Laura Hamilton) gets hold of the key and runs for help to David Moore (Ed Neil), one of her father's old friends and also a Vietnam vet as well as Michael's brother. David does some investigation, alongside Michael's two sons, Charlie (Jonathan Ke Quan) and Tony (Eddie Saavedra), to find out who murdered the girl's parents. During his investigation, a disguised Michael cripples David. Charlie and Tony, having seen David fight, are impressed with his skills and asks him to train them. At first, David refuses. However, when the brothers are able to prove their bravery when they kneel on bricks overnight. David begins training the brothers. When the brothers' investigation leads them to one of Michael's gang members, Tank (Wendell C. Whitaker), a confrontation leads to Tank having a change of heart for the sake of his mother. Tank decides to help the brothers gain intel but Michael eventually finds out and kills Tank. Meanwhile, Tony and Charlie use their new skills first on gang member Alan (Allen Tackett) and eventually, the hulking Thunder (Bolo Yeung). When David and Charlie eventually learn Michael is the gang leader and the one who killed the bank manager, Michael confronts the two. However, trouble brews up when Michael reveals why he adopted his son Charlie. During their time in Vietnam, David caught Michael killing Charlie's birth mother and had convinced him to adopt the orphaned baby. Shocked, Charlie is at first upset but then attempts to reason with Michael. However, Michael's arrogance and ultimatum leads to a showdown between father and son. When Michael is arrested, Tony arrives and not knowing the truth, puts the blame on Charlie. Tony vows to settle the score with Charlie at the national taekwondo tournament. Both Charlie and Tony eventually make the finals and Charlie at first refuses to fight Tony. After getting berated by the referee, Charlie finally fights back until he lets Tony knock him out. Tony wins but is even more in regret when he sees an unconscious Charlie. Tony attempts to help wake Charlie up and when he does, the brothers finally make amends with Tony the winner of the tournament.

Fest√°l is a free series of annual ethnically-related festivals that take place on the grounds of Seattle Center in Seattle, Washington. A major cultural program of Seattle, these festivals aim to celebrate and connect the city to its varied ethnic and international community. Most festivals contain various arts performances (dances, theatre, musical ensembles, films), dances, marketplace and other programs. These have also come to be the annual gathering place for ethnic groups of the community. Both older and younger people attend, especially the dances and musical concerts. The Fest√°l events range enormously in scope, from smaller festivals to the enormous pan-ethnic Northwest Folklife Festival, which draws an estimated 250,000 visitors on Memorial Day weekend. Typical Fest√°l events draw 5,000 to 30,000 visitors. Some of them (such as Fiestas Patrias) draw crowds that are predominantly of the ethnic group that is the focus of the festival; others draw more of a cross-section of the city. Fest√°l began in 1996 and includes: Vietnam: T√™t Festival The T√™t Festival in February is the Vietnamese Lunar New Year celebration welcoming the return of spring. For the Vietnamese community, it is a time to reflect on the last year and prepare for the new. The new year is also the time for clearing debts and setting one's house in order. Kitchens are cleaned and new clothing is given to mark the new year. The festival includes Vietnamese artistic exhibits, music, storytelling, food, and a fashion show. African American: Festival Sundiata Festal Sundiata in February is one of the oldest Seattle Center festivals, beginning in 1981. The festival is the most comprehensive African American festival in the city. Named to celebrate the West African Mansa (king of kings) of the Mali Empire, who rescued the Griot - his people's storyteller and tribal historian - Festival Sundiata is a represents diverse cultural traditions. Music and dance at the festival includes jazz, rap, gospel, hip- hop, R&B;, and traditional African styles, all performed by northwest, national and international artists. The festival also includes Black Science Fiction Writers, Smokin' Black Chefs, children's activities, and visual art. Ireland: The Irish Week Festival Irish Week Festival is centered on St. Patrick's Day in March, the celebration of Ireland's patron saint. The festival is presented by the Seattle Irish Heritage Club. Partly because Seattle and Ireland are very much alike in climate, Seattle and Galway are sister cities. The festival includes a St. Patrick's Day parade from downtown Seattle to Seattle Center. The Irish festival weekend includes traditional Irish step and gig dancing, musical performances, Irish films, and sing- alongs. The Seattle Genealogical Society appears annually to help anyone trace their Irish genealogy. Also featured are free lessons in Gaelic. Japan: Seattle Cherry Blossom & Japanese Cultural Festival In April, the Seattle Cherry Blossom festival is held. The largest Japanese cultural event in the Pacific Northwest commemorates the late Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Miki's gift of 1,000 cherry trees, as part of the United States Bicentennial, to Seattle in 1976. The trees were planted along Lake Washington Boulevard, Seward Park, Seattle Center, The Arboretum, the Seattle Japanese Garden, University of Washington, and the Seattle Buddhist Church. The cherry tree tradition follows at every year's festival, by bringing cherry tree experts from Japan to Seattle to teach Washingtonians about the proper care and maintenance of cherry trees. The cherry tree experts give instruction during the festival and the week that follows. The festival's mission is to deepen mutual understanding between the people of Japan and the people of the Northwest; to exchange ideas and friendship; to promote the culture, arts, and technologies of Japan, including achievements of the Japanese-American community. The festival includes dance and music, colorful costumes, martial arts, and tea ceremonies. For children, the festival offers Japanese games, kite making and kimono dress up. Asia-Pacific: Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month Celebration May is designated as Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month. In Seattle, the Asia-Pacific festival celebrates the diversity of China, Philippines, Samoa, Laos, Japan, Pacific Islands and Cambodia. The Asian Pacific Directors Coalition host the festival with cultural arts, entertainment and crafts. The performance showcase includes lion dance, youth drill teams, martial arts, taiko drums and guest artists from out of state. West Africa: Spirit of West Africa In May, the Spirit of West Africa Festival presents the traditions of six West African countries through exhibits, live music, dance performances, and storytelling. Live performances by top local and touring artists from Ghana, Senegal, Benin, Nigeria, Gambia and Guinea demonstrate the African roots of hip hop, jazz and rock. In workshops presented by Thione Diop Productions, Festivalgoers can take part in drum and dance workshops, learn how a drum talks, and witness the healing drums of West African drum masters trained since birth to serve their communities. China: Chinese Culture and Arts Festival Due to the large Chinese population in Seattle, the Chinese culture and arts festival is one of the best attended festivals. In June, the festival offers a comprehensive look at Chinese Culture through Chinese performing arts, visual arts display and gift/informational booths and interactive activities. Performances are by artists from the Pacific Northwest and China. Performances have included Chinese Classical dance and Chinese folk dance from Hengda Dance Academy, Chinese music from Seattle Chinese Orchestra, Chinese Wushu from Yijiao Wushu & Taichi Academy, and Chinese music played on Western instruments from Zhenlun Cello studio and Haiying Violin Studio. Philippines: Pagdiriwang Philippine Festival In June, the Seattle Philippine culture is celebrated. \\"Pagdiriwang\\" means celebration in Tagalog, as the festival commemorates Philippine independence from Spain in 1898. Performing arts include pageantry, music, dance, dill teams and rock bands. Other cultural activities include food, children's activities, exhibits and martial arts. This festival is noted for its rich colors and fabrics, its largely native turnout, and exceptional culinary arts. France: French Fest Madleen Gratien au violon 2010 Seattle's French Fest: A Celebration of French-Speaking Cultures is held in March of each year in celebration of the Mois de la Francophonie.

BrasilFest's Eduardo Mendonca states that \\"being a part of this strengthens the visibility of Brazilian artistic expression. It is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a series of festivals that promotes rituals and celebrations from around the world.\\" Tibet: TibetFest In late August, Tibet comes alive once again at Seattle Center. The ancient cultural tradition is preserved and renewed through ritual and tradition by the small Tibetan Community in greater Seattle area. With centuries-old stories, melodies, masks and costumes, modern and ancient combine to form the culture of Tibet. Highlights are a Tibetan bazaar, prayer flags, performers and food. The Artists use traditional instruments like Dra-nyen, piwang and unique combinations of flutes, horns, drums, bells and cymbals. Korea: Korean Cultural and Art Festival The September Korean Festival is one of the most important festivals. Strong ties link trade, culture and family between Korea and Seattle. Every year, the festival falls on Ch'usok, or Harvest Festival Day, one of the great holidays of the year in Korean culture. On this day, feasts are prepared, families hold memorial services at ancestral gravesites, and full-moon viewing takes place in the evening. This Korean holiday is considered not only the most generous in spirit, but a day of thanksgiving for a good harvest.

Most Hmong have been in the United States less than 30 years, and Washington's Hmong population is growing. The festival was originally conceived to raise awareness about the Hmong people, who aided the U.S. in the Vietnam War against the Vietcong. Most of their population was killed as a result, and most survivors emigrated to the U.S. This festival marks the Lunar New Year of this Southeast Asian highland culture originating in the mountains of China, Laos and Thailand. Hmong people preserved their stories and language through intricate storytelling, embroidery, music and unusual communication techniques. Highlights include traditional ball-tossing, dances, children's activities, a fashion show and a Hmong band. Exhibits include the history of the Hmong settlement in King County, along with traditional embroideries.

The piece is given by many organizations to new parents of children with special needs issues such as Down syndrome. As a testament to its popularity, several individuals have received the first name \\"Holland\\". Emily Kingsley is the mother of Jason Kingsley. The younger Kingsley is an actor who has appeared on programs such as Sesame Street and enjoyed a varied career, despite the family being told early in his childhood that his struggles would prevent him from having a meaningful life. \\"Welcome to Holland\\", written in the second person, employs a metaphor of excitement for a vacation to Italy that first becomes disappointment when the plane lands instead in Holland and then contentment at the happy events which they experience instead. Background and contents The metaphor is that the trip to Italy is a typical birth and child-raising experience, and that the trip to Holland is the experiencing of having and raising a child with special needs. In the end, however, the reader sees that the \\"trip\\" is still well worth it: Author and social activist Emily Perl Kingsley wrote the piece based on her experiences with her son, Jason Kingsley, and her changing beliefs through parenthood. The younger Kingsley was born in 1974 with Down syndrome. Their doctor labeled the child as a \\"mongoloid\\" that would fail to learn to speak or walk and instructed the parents to act essentially as if the birth hadn't happened, with the mother sent to receive tranquilizing drugs preventing lactation. She recounted that she cried for several days straight. Although such medical attitudes were consistent with the prejudices of the time, the distraught family resisted and determined to provide the boy with as intellectually stimulating an environment as possible. Accounts of widespread abuse as a result of controversial institutionalization policies served to spur them on even more. The younger Kingsley has worked as an actor, appearing on programs such as Sesame Street, and otherwise enjoyed a varied career despite various challenges. Responses and influence As a testament to its popularity, several individuals have received the first name \\"Holland\\". In 2004, Will Livingston wrote a song loosely based on the story. He also used the title \\"Welcome to Holland\\". Critical analysis of the work and its influence has compared it to poet Robert Frost's piece The Road Not Taken, which also discusses the human tendency to look back and fret about 'what might have been' after people make decisions. A response essay describing the possible toll that parenting can take on a family's welfare, such as raising children with severe autism, was created titled \\"Welcome to Beirut\\", with the later piece alluding to the suffering from the Lebanese Civil War. \\"Welcome to Holland\\" has also attracted some amused, humorous responses from individuals living in both Holland and Italy in contrast to the original story's American perspective.

The village lies on a hill above and to the east of the Reuss Valley, covering part of the Mutschellen Pass. This municipality is bounded by Rudolfstetten-Friedlisberg, Widen, Zufikon, and Oberwil-Lieli, all in canton Aargau, and shares a boundary with the canton of Zurich (district of Dietikon) to the east. History Berikon Aerial view (1966) Berikon was mentioned for the first time in 1153 as a court place \\"Berchheim\\". In 1184 it was mentioned as Berchein. Over time, the name of the place changed from Berchheim to Bergheim, then to Berchan, Berkein, and finally Berikon. The originally separate settlements Unterberikon (Lower Berikon) and Oberberikon (Upper Berikon) fell under the territorial lordship of the city of Zurich in 1415, when the Eidgenossen (Confederacy) conquered Aargau. Later, in 1471, Unterberikon became part of Amt Rohrdorf in the county of Baden, while Oberberikon fell under the oversight of the Kelleramt (Freiamt Affoltern). When in 1798 the French overran Switzerland and instituted the Helvetic Republic, both municipalities came to the short-lived canton of Baden. During the establishment of the canton of Aargau in 1803, the two municipalities were reunited and joined the district of Bremgarten. On 1 May 1902, the Bremgarten- Dietikon-Bahn was opened, giving Berikon a railway connection to the rest of Switzerland. Still, until well into the 20th century, Berikon was a rural village, populated by just 900 inhabitants in 1950, before a sudden boom of construction activity occurred. Within thirty years the total population increased by over 150%. Today's population is roughly quadruple that of the 1960s. Berikon has grown together with the neighbouring municipalities and is today part of the agglomeration of Zurich. Geography Berikon has an area, , of .

She started out as part of the Davis Sisters as a teenager in the late 1940s, eventually landing on RCA Victor. In the late 1950s, she became a solo star. One of the first women to achieve major stardom in the country music field as a solo vocalist, she was an acknowledged influence on Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton and was hailed as an \\"extraordinary country/pop singer\\" by The New York Times music critic Robert Palmer. Life and career =1931‚Äì1947: Early life= Davis was born Mary Frances Penick on December 30, 1931, the first of seven children born to farmer William Lee and Sarah Rachel Penick (n√©e Roberts), in Dry Ridge, Kentucky. Because her grandfather thought she had a lot of energy for a young child, he nicknamed Mary Frances \\"Skeeter\\" (slang for mosquito). When Davis was a toddler, her great-uncle was convicted of murdering her maternal grandfather (his brother) in Indiana. After this incident, Davis recalled that her mother became a \\"bitterly depressed woman.\\" Throughout her childhood, Davis's mother attempted suicide multiple times, several of which Davis herself prevented from being carried out: \\"I once slapped a bottle of Clorox she was drinking out of her mouth and sat on her hands to keep her from reaching for a butcher knife,\\" she recalled. On one occasion, her mother attempted to leap from the family's apartment window with Davis and her infant brother in her arms. Her relationship with her mother remained strained throughout much of her life, and by Davis's account, she \\"couldn't seem to win my mother's respect and affection, [so] I turned my attention toward my daddy.\\" Davis in a school photo, at the age of ten. In the mid-1930s, the Penick family relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio, where they remained for several years before returning to Dry Ridge. They later moved to Erlanger, Kentucky in 1947. Davis was raised a Protestant, attending Disciples of Christ churches. As an adolescent, Davis was inspired by the music of Betty Hutton, and also developed interest in musicals, memorizing songs from films such as Stage Door Canteen (1943) and I'll Be Seeing You (1944). She would sometimes stage routines in her backyard, dancing, singing, and telling ghost stories to neighborhood children. When Davis was in seventh grade, her father relocated to Oak Ridge, Tennessee for work. She and her siblings remained in the care of their mother who, during this time, became an alcoholic. In the summer of 1948, Davis and her family relocated to Covington, Kentucky, where her father was working as an electrician, and moved into a house owned by the Villa Madonna Academy, run by Benedictine nuns. Davis became fascinated by the sisters, and for a time considered becoming a nun. While attending Dixie Heights High School in Erlanger, Skeeter met Betty Jack Davis, and the two became close friends, bonding over their love of music. They began singing songs and playing guitar together during breaks at school, which drew attention from their classmates, and they performed in several school talent shows. On a trip to the Grand Ole Opry, the two convinced a stage manager to allow them backstage, where they met Hank Williams and Chet Atkins. =1948‚Äì1956: The Davis Sisters; rise to fame= During her junior year of high school, Skeeter and Betty Jack won a local yodeling contest, whose prize was a time slot singing on a local daytime television show. The two were billed as the Davis Sisters, with Skeeter adopting Betty Jack's last name, despite their being unrelated. Their appearance on the local program led to them receiving singing opportunities on the Detroit radio station WJR's program Barnyard Frolics. After graduating from high school in 1949, Davis relocated to Detroit with Betty Jack, where they completed demonstration recordings for Fortune Records; among these were the song \\"Jealous Love,\\" which was released as a single in 1953. RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes heard their demos and was impressed by their harmonies. In the spring of 1953, Skeeter and Betty Jack met with Sholes at the RCA headquarters in New York City, who offered them a recording contract. After signing the contract, they left New York to begin recording material in Nashville, Tennessee. On May 23, 1953, they recorded \\"I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know,\\" a song that had previously been recorded by Sonny James. The Davis Sisters toured regionally to support the single on live broadcast radio programs, though Davis recalled that both \\"were so insecure and uninformed about the [music] business.\\" The single was a significant success, spending eight weeks at number one on the country charts in 1953, as well as making the top 20 on the pop charts. The record ranks number 65 on the Top 100 Country Singles of All Time, according to Billboard historian Joel Whitburn. On August 1, 1953, the Davis Sisters performed on the WWVA evening show in Wheeling, West Virginia. After midnight, the two left Wheeling en route back to Covington. Around 7:00 am on August 2, near Cincinnati, a passing motorist fell asleep at the wheel, crashing head-on with the car in which Skeeter and Betty Jack Davis were riding. Betty Jack was killed in the collision, while Skeeter sustained serious head injuries. The driver of the car also survived. Newspaper bulletins at the time erroneously reported that both the Davis Sisters had been pronounced dead at Our Lady of Sorrow Hospital in Cincinnati. Following the accident, Davis moved in with Betty Jack's mother, Ollie, while recovering from her injuries. She recounted in her autobiography that Ollie \\"took advantage of this tragic situation to suit her own ends,\\" alleging that she had kept Skeeter sedated with drugs administered from a local dentist and sequestered her in the house, where she repeatedly played the girls' records. Once Skeeter recovered, Ollie could \\"hardly wait for her chance to re-create the Davis Sisters,\\" suggesting that Betty Jack's younger sister, Georgia, take her place in the singing duo. Davis reluctantly agreed, and six months after the accident, she resumed singing in the duo with Georgia Davis. In her autobiography, she would claim that she felt she had been brainwashed by Ollie and coerced into resuming the musical duo. Between 1954 and 1956, Skeeter and Georgia released a total of nine singles for RCA as the Davis Sisters, which they recorded in New York City and Chicago, and toured the United States as a part of the RCA Caravan of the Stars alongside Minnie Pearl, Hawkshaw Hawkins, and Chet Atkins, among others. The singles recorded with Georgia were notably less successful than the duo's former material, with low chart positions, though Davis felt that \\"the material was good.\\" The two held a tribute performance for Betty Jack at the Grand Ole Opry in 1954. In 1955, the Davis Sisters were booked for a regional tour alongside Hank Snow, The Carter Sisters (minus June), and Elvis Presley. Davis recounted her friendship with Presley in her autobiography. In 1956, Davis met Kenneth DePew, a railroad worker and acquaintance of Georgia. The two began dating and married shortly after, though Davis would later state that he had married her for her income: \\"He saw the nice new furniture my money had bought the Davises; he saw the Oldsmobile and knew I had money in the bank. I could be a short cut to easy street.\\" According to Davis, their marriage was not consummated until eight days into their honeymoon. Shortly after her marriage, the Davis Sisters formally disbanded. =1957‚Äì1965: Early solo career= In the late 1950s during her marriage to DePew, Davis suffered from depression and \\"harbored a death wish\\" over the grief of Betty Jack's death as well as her \\"contrived\\" marriage. She resumed performing as a solo act, touring with Ernest Tubb, and co-wrote and recorded the song \\"Set Him Free\\" for RCA, produced by Chet Atkins. The song earned Davis a Grammy Award nomination for best country recording. Sometime during this period, 1958, Davis and DePew were divorced, and she relocated to Nashville. The same year, Davis recorded \\"Lost to a Geisha Girl\\", an answer song to Hank Locklin's hit \\"Geisha Girl\\", which reached the country number 15 and became her first solo hit. Atkins worked with Davis as a guitarist on all of these sessions. At Davis's suggestion, Atkins frequently multiple-tracked Davis's voice for harmony vocals to resemble the sound of the Davis Sisters. This echo can be found on several of her early solo hits, such as \\"Am I That Easy to Forget.\\" She subsequently co-wrote and recorded another top-20 hit called \\"Homebreaker,\\" which peaked at number 15 on the Hot Country Songs chart in November 1959. The same year, Davis joined the Grand Ole Opry. During this time, she toured with June Carter, and the two became good friends. From 1960 to 1962, Davis had top-10 hits with the songs \\"(I Can't Help You) I'm Falling Too\\", \\"My Last Date (With You)\\", \\"Where I Ought to Be\\", and \\"Optimistic\\". \\"(I Can't Help You) I'm Falling Too\\" marked Davis's first entrance as a solo artist onto the Billboard pop charts in 1960, and resulted in her being invited to perform on Dick Clark's American Bandstand. The song went all the way to the top 40, unheard of for a female country singer at the time. The same year, she married WSM disc jockey Ralph Emery in Franklin, Kentucky. Their marriage was tumultuous, with Davis recalling that Emery was jealous and controlling of her, refusing her to work more than several days per month, obsessively calling her while she was on tour, and recurrently accusing her of infidelity. The two resided in Ridgetop, Tennessee for a time, before Emery had a home built for them in the Brentwood area. In 1961, she scored a second pop hit with a lyric version (written by Skeeter) of Floyd Cramer's instrumental country pop smash \\"Last Date\\" called \\"My Last Date (With You)\\" which did even better, making the top 30 on the pop charts. Both of these songs did exceptionally well on the country charts, peaking at number two and number five, respectively. In 1963, Davis achieved her biggest success with country pop crossover hit \\"The End of the World\\". The song just missed topping the country and pop charts that year; however, it did top the adult contemporary charts. The record was also a surprise top-five hit on the rhythm and blues charts, making Davis one of the few white female singers to have a top-10 hit in that market. The single sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. This song was likely the first popular example of Sound on Sound where the erase magnet was disabled and the artist sang along with the recording or the original recording was mixed with the live artist voice and re-recorded, Therefore, it sounds like a duet in places. \\"The End of the World\\" soon became Davis‚Äôs signature song. Davis achieved one other country- pop hit with the Gerry Goffin and Carole King-penned \\"I Can't Stay Mad at You\\", which peaked at number seven on the pop charts and number two on the Easy Listening chart in 1963. In 1964, after four years of marriage, Davis divorced Emery after finding he had been unfaithful to her, and conceived a child with another woman. The same year, she was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for her recording of \\"He Says the Same Things to Me.\\" Davis's success continued with \\"I'm Saving My Love\\" and 1964's Gonna Get Along Without You Now, an updated cover of a 1956 hit by Patience and Prudence). Both made the top 10 on the country charts and cracked the Billboard Top 50 pop charts, though the success of \\"Gonna Get\\" was likely hampered by another remake of the song by vocalist Tracey Dey simultaneously climbing the charts to peak slightly lower than Davis‚Äôs version. Later pop efforts, such as \\"Let Me Get Close to You\\" in July 1964, missed making the Billboard Hot 100, reflecting the changing nature of pop styles due to the ongoing British invasion. In 1965, she recorded a duet with Bobby Bare called \\"A Dear John Letter\\", which just missed the country top 10. The following year, she earned her third Grammy nomination for \\"Sun Glasses,\\" which peaked at number 30 on the Hot Country Songs chart. =1966‚Äì1976: Crossover and critical accolades= In 1967, Davis was back in the top 10 with \\"What Does It Take (To Keep a Man Like You Satisfied)\\". Davis only achieved two other major country hits the rest of the decade, \\"Fuel to the Flame\\" (written by Dolly Parton, to whom Davis paid tribute with an album called Skeeter Sings Dolly in 1972), and \\"There's a Fool Born Every Minute\\". She received her fourth Grammy nomination for 1967's \\"What Does It Take.\\" In the late 1960s, she recorded several full-length albums, including two tribute works: Skeeter Davis Sings Buddy Holly (1967) and I Love Flatt and Scruggs (1968). Davis's recording of the anti-war song \\"One Tin Soldier\\", released in 1972, earned her an appearance on The Midnight Special. The single was a major success in Canada, peaking as a top-ten hit on RPM country and adult contemporary charts. In 1970, Davis had another top-10 hit with \\"I'm a Lover (Not a Fighter)\\" and another duet with Bobby Bare with \\"Your Husband, My Wife\\". The following year, she had a hit with the autobiographical \\"Bus Fare To Kentucky\\". Subsequently, however, her chart success began to fade. Singles such as \\"It's Hard to Be a Woman\\" and \\"Love Takes a Lot of My Time\\" failed to crack the country top 40. Her last major hit was 1973's \\"I Can't Believe That It's All Over\\", which peaked at number 12 in country and number 101 on the pop chart. In the 1970s, she began regularly touring foreign countries such as Barbados, Singapore, and Sweden, where she retained a following. Davis had the first and only controversy of her career when during a 1973 Grand Ole Opry performance, she dedicated a gospel song to a group of young church workers whom she noted in her introduction had been arrested for evangelizing at a local mall. The Opry suspended her from membership after receiving complaints from some local policemen. She was reinstated at the Opry more than a year later. After losing several bookings during that period, Davis became active singing with a number of religious ministries and spent an extensive period evangelizing in Africa. =1977‚Äì2004: Later life and career= Davis returned to the recording studio in 1976 with a brief stint on Mercury Records, which produced two single releases, including her last song to make the national charts, 1976's \\"I Love Us\\". In 1978, she recorded the first of several albums for minor record labels which she did on occasion into the 1990s. In 1987, she married NRBQ's bassist Joey Spampinato. She recorded the album She Sings, They Play with Spampinato and NRBQ; they divorced in 1996. The following year, in August 1988, Davis was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy of her right breast to treat the cancer, and was in remission for several years before having a recurrence in 1996. Her autobiography, Bus Fare to Kentucky (named after a 1971 song), was published in 1993. In 1998, she wrote a children's book, The Christmas Note, with Cathie Pelletier. Death In 2001, Davis became incapacitated by her breast cancer, which had metastasized. The following year, she made her final performance at the Grand Ole Opry, performing \\"The End of the World.\\" She died of breast cancer in a Nashville, Tennessee, hospice on September 19, 2004, aged 72. Legacy Davis's song \\"The End of the World\\" has been named as a major influence on several artists: Among them are Lou Reed, and 21st-century singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, both of whom named it among their favorite recordings of all time. Bob Dylan also recorded a version of \\"I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know\\" featuring the Davis Sisters' arrangements on his 1970 album Self Portrait. Also the song \\"The End of the World\\" was used in the popular video game Fallout 4. Davis penned nearly 70 songs over the course of her career, and earned two BMI awards: for \\"Set Him Free\\" and \\"My Last Date With You\\", the latter also recorded by Ann- Margret, Pat Boone, Kay Starr, Joni James, and several others, in addition to Davis' original hit version. Deborah Harry recorded a remake of Davis' version in 1993 featuring Michael Stipe, a long-time Davis fan. (Conway Twitty wrote new lyrics for the instrumental in 1972 as \\"Lost Her Love (On Our Last Date), which reached number one on the country chart, as did Emmylou Harris' remake of Twitty's version in 1983 retitled \\"Lost His Love (On Our Last Date)\\".)

It may be a corruption of Dyfed, itself a corruption of D√©si, colonists from south-east Ireland who occupied the old tribal area of the Demetae in south-west Wales in the late third century AD, establishing a dynasty which lasted five centuries'The Celts', TGE Powell, Thames & Hudson, 1958. Dyfed is recorded as a surname as late as the 12th century for e.g. Gwynfard Dyfed, born in 1175. 'Dafydd' appears as a given name in the 13th Century, e.g. Dafydd ap Gruffydd (1238‚Äì1283), Prince of Wales, and Dafydd ab Edmwnd (fl. c. 1450‚Äì97), Welsh poet. The given name 'Dafydd' is generally translated into English as 'David'. Alternatively it may derive from David (a Hebrew name meaning \\"beloved\\"), the name of Wales's patron saint. In Wales Davies is standardly pronounced , that is, identically to Davis. This pronunciation also dominates elsewhere in the United Kingdom and is used by many outside it, though it competes with the spelling pronunciation , which is particularly common in the US. Davies is the 2nd most common surname in Wales and 8th most common in England of Welsh descendants, where it is particularly widespread in the southwest, especially Cornwall. It is not common in the United States where the spelling Davis is preferred.

Personal life Ford moved to California in 1977. His father, Desmond Ford, was a noted Seventh-day Adventist theologian, and was the center of a theological controversy in the late 1970s and '80s. His mother, Gwen Ford, published a book when he was two years old, but died of bone cancer in March 1970, when Ford was three. After leaving the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Ford explored atheism. Ford states that he was converted to Judaism through the Los Angeles Beis Din. Ford says he observes the Jewish Sabbath, attends synagogue regularly, and keeps kosher. He has been asked to leave at least two different congregations. Ford wrote about his religious ostracism in XXX-Communicated: A Rebel Without a Shul. Ford has been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. Professional Ford studied economics at UCLA but did not graduate. Instead, he worked as an investigative journalist for southern California newspapers and at a radio station. In 1995, he became intrigued with the lack of journalistic coverage of the pornography industry, and started to write a book, which became A History of X. In January 1996, after researching porn for a year, Ford wrote, produced, directed and acted in What Women Want, a pornographic video. It was not a success. Ford is credited as \\"Dick Dundee\\". In 1997, Ford started his pornography gossip website, LukeFord.com. He said, \\"I'm not a businessman. I'm not a conventional journalist. I'm a story teller/entertainer/lunatic.\\" Ford was sued for defamation multiple times by people in the porn industry, including by RJB Telecom, whom he (as well as the Federal Trade Commission) accused of dishonesty; Christi Lake, whom he mislabeled in a bestiality photo; and Laurie Holmes (widow of John Holmes), for accusations of prostitution on the set. Ford has said that he has been sued five times to date: one suit was dropped, another was thrown out, another was settled when his insurance company paid $100,000, and the last two were settled when he removed some of his statements without making a retraction. Wired called him \\"The Most Hated Man in Web Porn\\". He was physically assaulted by Mike Albo, an editor for Hustler. In August 2001, after urgings of his rabbi, Ford sold his main website, lukeford.com to Netvideogirls.com for $25,000, and created lukeford.net which avoided pornography, and focused more on Jewish issues. One year later, after nearly going broke, he returned to his pornographic roots by starting lukeisback.com with many of his old archives. On October 23, 2007, Ford announced he had sold lukeisback.com and its contents for an undisclosed sum to an undisclosed party. \\"Any writing I do on the porn industry from now on will be for publications with no porn advertising,\\" Ford said. Those owners (whose names have not been divulged) ran the site until June 2008 but walked away from the site saying that writing the site was too much work for the money earned. It was sold a second time, with the new owner being long-time industry observer Cindy Loftus. AVN Hall of Famer Bill Margold has said that \\"Luke Ford is exactly what we deserve... Luke's not really a blogger as much as is an internet journalist\\". Ford was also in the 2012 documentary After Porn Ends, which is about life after being a porn actor. Ford maintains a blog and YouTube channel. He hosts a Sunday morning live podcast where he has interviewed figures of controversy such as Richard Spencer and Professor Kevin MacDonald.

The Avernus side of the passage was decorated with a colonnade and had many statues in niches hewn into the tuff walls of the entrance. Light and air were provided by six vertical shafts dug into the hill (the longest of which was over thirty metres high) The Aqua Augusta aqueduct supplying the port was dug in a tunnel parallel to and on the northern side the road and was also equipped with niches and vertical shafts. The Crypta Romana tunnel was also built nearby through Monte Grillo in the same period for similar reasons, as well as other tunnels in the vicinity (e.g. the Crypta Neapolitana). With the end of the civil war between Octavian and Mark Antony in 31 BC and the displacement of the fleet from Portus Julius to the port of Misenum in 12 BC, the tunnels lost their strategic interest, but continued to be useful for practical and commercial reasons. The tunnel is also known as the , in reference to a Spanish captain, Pietro de Pace, who made use of the tunnel in 1508‚Äì1509 to plunder the ruins of Cumae, which, at the time, still bore many rich items.

It has undergone extensive restoration works in recent years (up to 2017) and should be reopened in the near future. However, colonies of five species of legally-protected bats were discovered during the restoration, making an environmental assessment necessary before the reopening can go through.

Ross is best known for a long and distinguished career as a play-by-play commentator for WWE. He is known affectionately as Good ol' JR and has been labeled as the greatest wrestling commentator of all time. After years of working various jobs in the professional wrestling industry, Ross became the primary play-by-play announcer for Mid-South Wrestling in the early 1980s. He went on to do commentary for the National Wrestling Alliance and World Championship Wrestling, before jumping to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), making his first appearance for the promotion at WrestleMania IX in 1993. During his tenure with WWF/WWE, Ross was widely regarded as the voice of the company, particularly during The Attitude Era of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Ross was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2007. He was also the lead announcer for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) on AXS TV from 2015 to 2018 and occasionally does play-by-play for boxing and mixed martial arts. Ross also hosts his own weekly podcast, \\"Grilling JR\\". Outside of wrestling, Ross is known for his barbecue sauce and beef jerky brand, J.R.'s Family BBQ. Early life James William Ross was born on January 3, 1952, in Fort Bragg, California. While attending Westville High School, Ross played first base on the Westville baseball team. Ross was a two-time all-conference football player for the Westville Yellowjackets in 1968‚Äì69. His maternal grandparents owned a general store in Westville, Oklahoma and his paternal grandfather, Dee Ross, owned an off-sale beer store and was a carpenter. Ross was also President of the Student Body, a 4-year letterman in basketball, and State Vice President of the Future Farmers of America where he was State Speech Champion in 1968. Ross was also named Honorable Mention on the 1969 High School All-State Football team by the Tulsa World as a center. Broadcasting career =Professional wrestling= NWA Tri-State/Mid-South Wrestling/Universal Wrestling Federation (1974‚Äì1987) During his tenure in college, Ross had spent some time commentating on college radio. With this experience, Ross was given the opportunity to fill a broadcast position in the local NWA Tri-State territory, after an announcer was unable to appear at one of the territory's events. After his arrival in the promotion, Ross first worked as a referee starting in 1974. Ross remained as a referee until 1977 when he then transitioned to the promotion's broadcast team. After Bill Watts' purchase of NWA Tri-State in 1982 and the subsequent re-branding to Mid-South Wrestling (MSW), Ross was promoted to the promotion's lead play-by-play position and also became Mid-South Vice President of Marketing. During this time, Ross was able to call his very first NWA World Heavyweight Championship match which featured Ric Flair and Ted DiBiase. Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1987‚Äì1993) When Jim Crockett, Jr. bought the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) and merged it with his Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) group, Ross joined JCP and began doing color commentary alongside David Crockett and Tony Schiavone. With his new position, Ross became the head play-by-play man for the National Wrestling Alliance. Ross continued to hone his skills as JCP became World Championship Wrestling (WCW), following the purchase of the regional promotion by Ted Turner. In 1991, WCW left the NWA and Ross was teamed with former NWA broadcaster Bob Caudle. In 1992, he also spent one season as a commentator on the Atlanta Falcons radio broadcasts. Ross worked his way up the WCW ladder to become head of broadcasting, but had a contentious relationship with WCW's newest commentator and future executive Eric Bischoff. According to Ross, Bischoff, who reported to him, did a really good job of \\"selling himself\\" to executives of WCW's owner Turner Broadcasting. According to Bischoff, Ross mistreated him and others (mostly in deference to Ross' then-supervisor Bill Watts), and when Bischoff was promoted to executive producer in 1993, Ross demanded and received his release. Ross had a three-year contract with Turner Broadcasting, but he took an immediate buy-out for fear that he would not get work elsewhere due to being taken off television for a long period of time. Mick Foley claims that Ross resigned from WCW's booking committee.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.145) Ross left WCW after being taken off the air by Bischoff.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.238) World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (1993‚Äì1994, 1994‚Äì2013) Ross was hired by the World Wrestling Federation and made his on-screen debut at WrestleMania IX. He took over for Gorilla Monsoon on WWF Wrestling Challenge the following weekend. Ross worked alongside Bobby Heenan on the show until Heenan left the WWF in December 1993. Ross was originally the main voice of the WWF's pay-per-view events when he was first brought in, calling both WrestleMania IX and the King of the Ring with Heenan and Randy Savage in 1993. Vince McMahon took over his position at pay-per-views starting with SummerSlam 1993. Ross suggested the idea of Radio WWF to McMahon, the idea was given a try and Ross was made host alongside Monsoon. In this role, Ross was joined by co-hosts such as Johnny Polo, and talked to various WWF wrestlers and fans. Ross and Monsoon called SummerSlam and Survivor Series at the end of 1993 and the Royal Rumble for Radio WWF. Ross was fired on February 11, 1994, two weeks after suffering his first attack of Bell's palsy on January 30, 1994, as stated by Ross on the September 23, 1996 episode of Raw. He subsequently became an announcer for Smoky Mountain Wrestling and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons (the second time he was with the Falcons as an announcer). In Smoky Mountain Wrestling, Ross was reunited with former NWA/WCW announcer Bob Caudle. The promotion was owned by longtime NWA Manager Jim Cornette and featured many former NWA/WCW wrestlers such as The Rock 'n' Roll Express, Eddie Gilbert, and \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams. When Vince McMahon was indicted by the United States federal government in 1994, he was unable to continue commentating on WWF Monday Night Raw. After a few weeks of Gorilla Monsoon on play-by-play, the WWF rehired Ross to fill in for McMahon alongside Randy Savage throughout that summer. After McMahon was acquitted Ross was let go by the WWF for leaking inside information to journalists. Ross briefly returned to Smoky Mountain Wrestling. The WWF rehired him in December 1994. Relocated to the syndicated WWF programming for the majority of the next two years, Ross rejoined the primary announce team in the summer of 1996. In September 1996, Ross turned heel in WWF storylines for the first time in his career. Following Scott Hall and Kevin Nash's departure from the WWF for World Championship Wrestling and their debut there as The Outsiders, Ross began to proclaim on television that he was still in touch with Razor Ramon and Diesel (Hall and Nash's WWF personas, respectively) and claimed that he would be bringing them back to the WWF soon. Other announcers were skeptical, and WWF President Gorilla Monsoon said that Hall and Nash were under contract with \\"another organization\\", and ordered Ross to cease and desist mentioning them on the air. On the September 23, 1996 episode of Monday Night Raw, Ross delivered a worked-shoot promo during which he ran down WWF Chairman Vince McMahon (outing him as chairman and not just a commentator for the first time in WWF storylines) and debuted his \\"new\\" Diesel and Razor, claiming that while working in the WWF \\"front office\\" he had been the man responsible for so many people leaving the company as part of his \\"revenge\\" against the WWF for how they treated him in the past. While he was kept on the air by McMahon, Ross portrayed himself to be bitter and spiteful, with repeated potshots at McMahon. However, the \\"New Diesel-New Razor\\" storyline was poorly received by fans, and Ross' heel turn was quickly dropped. Ross was mainly used as a commentator, but occasionally hosted in-ring interviews such as here with Ken Shamrock. After this angle, Ross went on to host various WWF programs such as Superstars, Action Zone, Raw Is War, and Shotgun Saturday Night. At the end of 1998, Ross took a break from Raw Is War, due to another attack of Bell's Palsy he suffered whilst broadcasting a PPV (Capital Carnage) in London, England. Earlier in the day Ross had been informed his mother had died. On March 8, 1999, he returned to Raw Is War as part of a storyline alleging that McMahon fired him because of his condition, but that he would not go down quietly and enlisted the services of \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams as his personal \\"enforcer\\". Ross confronted his replacement, Michael Cole, in the ring. Despite Cole's insistence that he was not trying to steal Ross' job, Ross kicked Cole in the crotch and attempted to return to the announce table, though Terry Taylor ended up commentating for the rest of the night. The narrative went as far as to have Ross set up his own announce table in front of the official announce table labeled \\"JR Is Raw\\". The storyline was soon dropped as the attempt to turn Ross heel failed (the fans ended up cheering Ross and booing Cole) and he took his seat back as \\"official\\" commentator of Raw Is War starting with the main event of WrestleMania XV. Ross' Bell's palsy proved fodder for ridicule by WWF's competitor, World Championship Wrestling, in late 1999. Ed Ferrara parodied Ross, including doing a full impression including mockery of his modified voice due to his medical condition. This was received negatively by fans and wrestlers alike. Ferrara ceased mocking the medical condition after the first week. The angle was soon dropped by WCW, but not before \\"Oklahoma\\", Ferrara's parody of JR, won the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. During this time, Ross was commissioned to announce regional telecasts of the XFL, a professional football league co-owned by WWF. Ross, who had experience announcing for the Atlanta Falcons, was initially placed on the regional broadcasts, with his WWF partner Jerry Lawler as color commentator, even though Lawler admitted knowing and caring little about the sport, for the first regional telecast. After an incident in which the head play-by-play man on the national broadcast team, Matt Vasgersian, openly criticized the production on-air, Ross was hastily promoted to lead play-by- play, with Jesse Ventura as color commentator, for the next four weeks of broadcasts. Ross returned to the regional telecasts halfway through the XFL's Longhorns lone season, with Dick Butkus as his color commentator after Lawler left the company. Ross was the \\"voice of Raw Is War\\" throughout the Monday Night Wars alongside Jerry Lawler and cemented his legacy as one of the great wrestling commentators as WWE became the sole major wrestling promotion in North America. After the WWE Brand Extension, Ross worked exclusively for the Raw brand, cutting down to doing play-by-play on Raw-only pay-per-views, while SmackDown!-only pay-per-views were announced by SmackDown!'s announce team. Jerry Lawler (left) and Jim Ross (right) at the Raw commentators table. JR was involved in a lengthy feud with Eric Bischoff over the latters mistreatment of Stone Cold Steve Austin. Also during this time, Ross served as an Executive Vice President of Talent Relations for the WWF/WWE, a codified extension of his long-time backstage role as a key individual in charge of hiring new talent. By 2005, Ross had stepped down from his executive and management roles. According to repeated statements on his official blog, the move away from management proved beneficial in terms of decreased work-load, giving him more time to focus on his health, his family, and his entrepreneurial endeavors. Still working as the voice of Raw, Ross was again \\"fired\\" (kayfabe) from his play-by-play job by Vince and Linda McMahon on October 10, 2005. Doctors had discovered a serious issue with Ross's colon, and his storyline termination provided an explanation for his absence. While recovering from his colon surgery, Joey Styles (best known for his commentary work for Extreme Championship Wrestling) called the weekly Raw. After recovering, Ross helped produce the Raw announcers from backstage, and was brought back for Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII in 2006, then the Raw-brand matches at WrestleMania 22 and Backlash before taking back his play-by-play job on Raw on May 8, 2006, after Styles quit Raw in the storyline, declaring his hatred for \\"sports entertainment\\". Ross' contract with WWE expired in October 2006. At that point, neither side had signed a new contract and instead worked week to week under the terms of the expired contract. In November 2006, Ross stated on his official blog that he had signed a new one-year contract with WWE and would continue to work year-to-year. On March 31, 2007, Ross was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2007 by Steve Austin. On June 23, 2008 during the 2008 WWE Draft, Ross was drafted from Raw to the SmackDown brand while Michael Cole was drafted from SmackDown to Raw, trading positions as commentators on each brand. This ended Ross' position as Monday Night Raw's play-by-play commentator after a nearly 12-year run. The following day Ross posted a blog on his official website saying initially he was not happy with the move and considered quitting the company since he was not told beforehand about the move, but that he would work \\"to make SmackDown the best program the WWE produces\\". On September 23, 2008 episode of ECW on Syfy, Ross made an appearance on the ECW brand filling in for a sick Todd Grisham alongside Matt Striker. Ross (right) during his run on SmackDown with fellow commentator Todd Grisham. On April 8, 2009, Ross announced on his WWE Universe blog that with the departure of Tazz from World Wrestling Entertainment, he would assume the role of SmackDown's color analyst, with ECW announcer Todd Grisham moving over to the brand as the play-by-play announcer. October 6, 2009 was his last broadcast as a full-time announcer for WWE. Ross missed the SmackDown tapings on October 13, 2009, as he asked for a day off due to an anniversary. Seven days later, on October 20, Ross suffered his third Bell's palsy episode en route to Columbia, South Carolina for a SmackDown taping. After initially planning on working the tapings and reuniting with Lawler, Ross instead flew back to Oklahoma, missing the show‚ÄîLawler and Cole commentated SmackDown‚Äîand leaving his plans for Bragging Rights in the air. On October 21, 2009, Jim Ross announced that he would not be commentating the WWE Bragging Rights pay- per-view, but Grisham mentioned that SmackDown would give Ross the Bragging Rights trophy as a \\"get well\\" gift. On the November 15, 2010 Old School Raw special, Ross made a guest appearance on commentary with Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole, calling a match between Daniel Bryan and Jack Swagger. Cole insulted Ross throughout the match, which resulted in Ross hitting Cole over the head with his hat after the match had finished. Ross returned on March 14, 2011 to confront Cole, who had entered into a feud with Lawler. After being insulted by Cole, he challenged him to a match but was attacked by Swagger. Ross called the final four matches at WrestleMania XXVII, including the Cole vs Lawler match. On the post-WrestleMania Raw, Ross joined commentary, only to walk out later in the night after Cole squirted him with barbecue sauce. Ross and Lawler defeated Cole and Swagger on the April 11 and 25 episodes of Raw but were defeated by Cole and Swagger in a Country Whipping match at Extreme Rules. As Lawler's feud with Cole ended at Over the Limit, Ross showed up to gain revenge on Cole by squirting him with barbecue sauce. On July 25, 2011, the new COO of WWE, Triple H re-hired Ross to a full-time commentating position on Raw. The new Raw Interim General Manager, John Laurinaitis, fired Ross on October 10 for walking out on Triple H a week earlier. Ross later revealed that he was given no prior notice that he was to be publicly fired. Ross returned on October 17, joining John Cena to defeat Michael Cole and Alberto Del Rio in a tag match. A week later, Cole challenged Ross to a \\"Michael Cole Challenge\\", with Ross's job on the line. The challenge took place on November 14; Ross won two of the three challenges, the first being a dance contest, the second being a rap battle (during which Ross legitimately forgot his lines) but lost the final challenge, which was who weighed less. Even though he lost the contest, he called the opening match of the night after Michael Cole was attacked by CM Punk. At WrestleMania XXVIII, he returned to call the 'End of an Era' Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and The Undertaker. Prior to the start of the match, Ross shook hands with Michael Cole, effectively healing any old wounds they had between them. Ross also made an appearance at Raw 1000, commentating the opening match. On June 20, 2012, Ross took over as a commentator on the revamped NXT alongside Byron Saxton and William Regal. Also during 2012, after Paul Levesque (Triple H) took control of Talent Relations he hired Jim Ross to work as an Adviser and Scout within the department. Following Jerry Lawler's heart attack on September 10, 2012, Ross returned to Raw to work as an interim commentator while Lawler recovered. Ross was honored on the October 1 edition of Raw as it was dedicated JR Appreciation Night and was held in his hometown of Oklahoma City. While CM Punk interrupted the segment as it aired, Ross was acknowledged by Vince McMahon and Triple H as well as local wrestling legends Bill Watts and Danny Hodge after Raw went off the air. Ross also served as presenter for the Match of the Year award at the 2012 Slammy Awards. In 2013, Ross began to coach and produce new announcers at the WWE Performance Center in Florida. He returned to television on the 20th Anniversary edition of Raw on January 14, 2013, where he called the steel cage main event between John Cena and Dolph Ziggler. On March 1, 2013 he appeared on WWE Smackdown to interview his long-time friend Jack Swagger, and Swagger's new advocate, Zeb Colter. During the segment, Swagger turned against Ross, ending their friendship. On August 16, 2013 while hosting a WWE 2K14 roster announcement panel with guests, Ross was suspected of being intoxicated. He used profanity during several points and appeared to have little to no interest in the topics that were scheduled to be covered. He also put down one of the sponsors of the event and allowed Ric Flair, who was a member of the guest panel and was also suspected of being intoxicated, to share an extensive amount of slew of off-color remarks and stories, among them being a description of John Cena as a \\"hardcore drinker.\\" On September 11, 2013, Ross officially announced his \\"retirement\\" from WWE as his contract had expired and was not to be renewed, however it was suspected that he was fired due to his actions at the roster announcement. In an interview in 2014, Ross claimed that an insult to the sponsor of the event was what led to his release. In the same interview he confirmed that he was not drunk, but rather fatigued due to Bell's palsy which was likely the reason he may have been perceived as being intoxicated. McMahon addressed the situation in a December 2014 interview, claiming that while he disapproved of Ross' behavior at the event, it was ultimately Ross' decision to leave WWE as he wanted to spend more time at home than working for WWE. McMahon stated that there is no heat between the two parties. New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2015‚Äì2018) On January 4, 2015, Ross and Matt Striker served as the English language commentators for Global Force Wrestling's presentation of New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome pay-per-view. On January 19, 2016, it was announced that Ross had signed to become the new lead announcer for NJPW's weekly program on AXS TV along with Josh Barnett. Ross' contract is directly with AXS TV and not NJPW. It was revealed in November 2018 that Barnett and Ross would no longer be doing NJPW commentary.https://411mania.com/wrestling/jim-ross-josh-barnett-njpw-axs-tv/ In 2019 they began using the New Japan World commentary team for the AXS shows. Independent circuit (2016‚Äìpresent) On October 8, 2016, Ross, along with Jim Cornette, provided commentary for What Culture Pro Wrestling's (WCPW) first iPPV, Refuse to Lose. On December 31, Ross was on commentary for the pilot episode of World of Sport Wrestling on ITV. On February 12, 2017, Ross returned to WCPW for commentary at the iPPV, True Destiny and for WCPW's Loaded tapings that same month. Return to WWE (2017‚Äì2019) On April 2, 2017, at WrestleMania 33, Ross returned to WWE, providing commentary for the main event No Holds Barred match between The Undertaker and Roman Reigns. Shortly after the event, it was announced that Ross had signed a two-year deal with the company. During the summer, Ross would provide commentary, alongside Lita, for the Mae Young Classic. On the January 22, 2018, episode of Raw 25 Years, Ross would reunite with Jerry Lawler as part of the commentary team that was at the Manhattan Center. On April 8, 2018, at WrestleMania 34, Ross called the fifth annual Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal on the WrestleMania 34 pre-show, alongside Jerry Lawler and Byron Saxton.. Ross's last televised appearance for WWE was part of the pre-show panel for the Greatest Royal Rumble on April 27, 2018. Ross left the WWE on March 27, 2019, after electing not to renew his contract. All Elite Wrestling (2019‚Äìpresent) On April 3, 2019, it was announced that Ross had signed a three-year deal with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) as a commentator and senior advisor. =Boxing= Ross made his debut calling boxing on May 26, 2014 for Golden Boy Promotions on Fox Sports 1. =Mixed martial arts= Ross teamed up with MMA fighter and UFC veteran Chael Sonnen to commentate the Battlegrounds MMA one night tournament PPV on October 3, 2014. =Podcasting= In February 2014 Ross began hosting his own podcast The Ross Report for PodcastOne. It was later relaunched as part of the Westwood One podcast network in 2018 as The Jim Ross Report. In April 2019, Ross partnered with wrestling podcaster/mortgage lender Conrad Thompson to revamp his podcast as Grilling JR, with a new format of reminiscences about Ross' history in wrestling, much in the same style as Thompson's podcasts with Bruce Prichard, Eric Bischoff, Tony Schiavone, and Arn Anderson. In-ring career Although Ross' career has predominantly been as a commentator, Ross has participated in matches, with some notable success, including a victory over Triple H in a no-DQ match (albeit with help from Batista). Another notable in-ring appearance by Ross was in a tag team match with broadcast partner Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler against Al Snow and Jonathan Coachman at the 2003 Unforgiven pay-per-view, with their Raw broadcast jobs on the line. They lost the contest to Snow and Coachman due to interference by Chris Jericho, however two weeks later Ross and Lawler regained their jobs when Ross defeated Coachman in a Country Whippin' match, using a stunner as a finishing maneuver. Ross has participated in more matches alongside Lawler, including a few with hardcore stipulations. In 2011, Ross competed against Michael Cole on the April 25 episode of Raw, where he defeated Cole by disqualification after Cole's manager for the match, Jack Swagger, attacked Ross while he had Cole mounted and was landing punches on him. Ross has been involved in numerous other conflicts with other competitors as well such as Triple H, Val Venis, Jack Swagger, Vladimir Kozlov, Mankind, and Steve Austin, Ross has been bloodied in a match by then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, and was even set on fire by Kane. Ross even main- evented the WWF's first-ever show from the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, GA, an episode of Raw is War that took place on October 11, 1999. Ross teamed with Steve Austin to take on WWF Champion Triple H and his partner Chyna. As part of storylines, Ross has been regularly targeted by Vince McMahon in rather harsh circumstances throughout his time with WWE: most notably in 2005 when Vince McMahon's character, Mr. McMahon, featured in a series of segments which made fun of Ross' legitimate colon surgery. In 2011, after his firing as an announcer by John Laurinaitis, he returned to team up with John Cena to face Michael Cole and Alberto Del Rio in a tag team match on Raw in a winning effort. Personal life Ric Flair claims he introduced Ross to his late wife, Jan. Ross writes in his autobiography that Ric Flair was present on an airplane when he first met Jan who was a flight attendant. He has two daughters from two previous marriages and two granddaughters. He cites Steve Austin and Jerry Lawler as his closest friends. Ross suffers from Bell's palsy, which sometimes temporarily paralyzes his facial muscles. The symptoms first occurred on January 30, 1994. In late 1998, following the death of his mother, Ross took a break from WWE Raw as the effects of his grief reportedly aggravated his palsy; Michael Cole filled in for him. In 2007, encouraged by sales of his line of barbecue sauces and beef products, Ross opened up J.R.'s Family Bar-B-Q in Norman, Oklahoma. The restaurant was closed by May 2010. Ross is an avid Oklahoma Sooners fan and a regular football season ticket holder. This is reflected in his entrance music, which is \\"Boomer Sooner\\" (the Sooners' fight song). He can be spotted at every Sooners home game, and when the Sooners play top teams around the country. In 2014, he became FoxSports.com's Contributor for NCAA Football and Oklahoma Sooners. His autobiography Slobberknocker was released on October 3, 2017. The foreword for the new autobiography was written by Vince McMahon. The book includes a letter from McMahon to Ross from when Ross was sick for the second time with Bell's Palsy. On March 21, 2017, Ross' wife Jan was involved in a vehicle accident, suffering serious head injuries.

It is sung from the point of view of a black stevedore on a showboat,\\"Lesson: Ol‚Äô Man River\\" (school lesson for Mississippi River), Michael E. Marrapodi, New Covenant Christian School, Ashland, Massachusetts, 2006, webpage: MassGeo-River : shows phrase \\"feared of dyin' \\" (rather than \\"skeered\\" of dying) as sung in earlier recordings. and is the most famous song from the show. The song is meant to be performed in a slow tempo, it is sung complete once in the musical's lengthy first scene by the stevedore \\"Joe\\" who travels with the boat, and, in the stage version, is heard four more times in brief reprises. Joe serves as a sort of musical one-man Greek chorus, and the song, when reprised, comments on the action, as if saying, \\"This has happened, but the river keeps rolling on anyway.\\" The song is notable for several aspects: the lyrical pentatonic-scale melody, the subjects of toil and social class, metaphor to the Mississippi, and as a bass solo (rare in musicals, solos for baritones or tenors being more common). Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra had a hit recording of the song in 1928, in a much faster tempo than Kern and Hammerstein intended, and featuring Bing Crosby on vocals and Bix Beiderbecke on cornet. A second version, by Paul Whiteman with bass singer Paul Robeson on vocals and sung in a dance tempo, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2006. In 2004, Robeson's version finished at #24 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. Various versions The song was first performed in the original stage production of Show Boat on December 27, 1927, by Jules Bledsoe, who also sang it in the part-talkie 1929 film, although that film version had little to do with the stage musical. Bledsoe also recorded the song years later. However, the most famous rendition of it, one that is still noted today, was sung by Paul Robeson in James Whale's classic 1936 film version of Show Boat. (Robeson had performed the song before in the 1928 London production of the show and in the 1932 Broadway revival.) The first known recording of the song was by 'Kenn' Sisson and His Orchestra, recorded on December 27, 1927, with Irving Kaufman on vocals. Turning upbeat-sounding melody into tragic one From the show's opening number \\"Cotton Blossom\\", the notes in the phrase \\"Cotton Blossom, Cotton Blossom\\" are the same notes as those in the phrase \\"Ol' Man River, dat Ol' Man River,\\" but inverted. However, \\"Cotton Blossom\\" was written first, and \\"Ol' Man River\\" was written only after Kern and Hammerstein realized they needed a song to end the first scene in the show. Hammerstein decided to use the idea of the Mississippi River as a basis for the song and told Kern to use the melody that the stevedores sang in \\"Cotton Blossom\\" but invert some of it, and slow down the tempo. This inversion gave \\"Ol' Man River\\" a tragic quality. Robeson's alterations to song lyrics Beginning about 1938 to the end of his career, Paul Robeson changed a few of the lyrics of \\"Ol' Man River\\" when singing it at recitals but never in actual stage performances of Show Boat and not in the 1936 film version. (In addition to the 1928 and 1932 stage productions as well as the 1936 film version, he appeared in a Los Angeles stage revival in 1940.) Except for the change of the word \\"niggers\\" to \\"darkies,\\" the lyrics of the song as Robeson performed it in the 1936 film version of the show remain exactly as Oscar Hammerstein II originally wrote them in 1927. However, after 1938, Robeson would record the song only with the lyrics that he had used in his post-1936 concert recitals. In the 1978 one-man play Paul Robeson, by Phillip Hayes Dean, there is a (perhaps fictitious) reference to the change in the lyrics - an unseen interviewer asks Robeson (played by James Earl Jones) about the original lyrics, and he responds \\"No, I don't sing it that way anymore\\". In the 1951 film version of Show Boat, as well as the 1962 studio recording and the 1966 Lincoln Center revival of the show, William Warfield sang only the introductory verse and the lyrics to the main section of the song, and omitted what could be considered a controversial section, in contrast to both Jules Bledsoe (who sang it in the prologue to the 1929 film version) and Robeson (who sang the whole song in the 1936 film). The section that Warfield omitted begins: ::Niggers all work on de Mississippi, ::Niggers all work while de white folks play... In the 1936 film, the word \\"niggers\\" was changed to \\"darkies\\". Ever since the 1946 revival, the term has been changed to \\"colored folks\\", although there have been revivals that change the lines to Here we all work on de Mississippi,/ Here we all work while de white folks play. Al Jolson sang a version starting with \\"lots of folks work on the Mississippi.\\" Also, the phrase \\"feared of dyin' \\" (rather than \\"skeered of dyin' \\") has been sung in some recordings, notably Lawrence Tibbett's 1930s version, Gordon MacRae's 1950s version (first heard on The Railroad Hour), and Frank Sinatra's 1946 performance, first heard in the film Till the Clouds Roll By. Robeson's own 1938 changes in the lyrics of the song are as follows: * Instead of \\"Dere's an ol' man called de Mississippi, / Dat's de ol' man that I'd like to be...\\", Robeson sang \\"There's an ol' man called the Mississippi, / That's the ol' man I don't like to be\\"...\\" * Instead of \\"Tote that barge! / Lift that bale! / Git a little drunk, / An' you land in jail...\\", Robeson sang \\"Tote that barge and lift dat bale!/ You show a little grit / And you lands in jail..\\" * Instead of \\"Ah gits weary / An' sick of tryin'; / Ah'm tired of livin' / An skeered of dyin', / But Ol' Man River, / He jes' keeps rolling along!\\", Robeson sang \\"But I keeps laffin'/ Instead of cryin' / I must keep fightin'; / Until I'm dyin', / And Ol' Man River, / He'll just keep rollin' along!\\"Sarah Lennox (2011). \\"Reading Transnationally: the GDR and American Black Writers\\" in Elaine Kelly, Amy Wlodarski (eds.), Art Outside the Lines: New Perspectives on GDR Art Culture. Editions Rodopi. . p.124 In Scene 7 of Act II of the show, Joe does sing this verse, but rather than singing \\"I must keep fightin' until I'm dyin\\", sings \\"I must keep livin' until I'm dyin,/ But Ol' Man River,/ He jes' keeps rollin' along!\\" According to the 1988 EMI album of Show Boat, these are Hammerstein's authentic lyrics for this reprise. In recitals and in several of his many recordings of the song, Robeson also omitted the controversial section \\"Niggers all work on de Mississippi...\\", etc., with its middle portion \\"Don't look up/ An' don't look down/ You don't dast make / De white boss frown\\", etc., as well as its concluding \\"Lemme go ' way from de Mississippi/ Lemme go ' way from de white man boss, etc.\\" . However, Robeson did include a portion of these lyrics in the 1932 4-record 78 rpm album of selections from Show Boat. Robeson's own changes to the lyrics were sung by him, and by no other singer, although a clip exists of William Warfield, singing the song with the changes that Robeson incorporated into it. The changes in Robeson's concert renditions of the song shift the portrayal of Joe away from a resigned and sad character who is susceptible to the forces of his world, to one who is timelessly empowered and able to persevere through even the most trying circumstances. The character of \\"Ol' Man River\\" is also changing. As originally conceived, the flowing river is perceived as eternally free and unchained, unaffected by oppression, which is why Joe would like to be like him. But in Robeson's interpretation, \\"Ol' Man River\\"'s \\"not caring that the land is not free\\" is regarded negatively, as indifference and not caring about the oppression and suffering of those who live on the river banks - and therefore, Joe does not want to be like him. Lawrence Tibbett, in his performances of the song, did use the word \\"niggers\\". Frank Sinatra famously changed \\"Niggers all work on de Mississippi...\\" to \\"Here we all work on the Mississippi...\\" in a version of the song that he recorded post-1946. His 1946 performance of it omitted this section altogether. The Temptations changed any references to the \\"white man boss\\" to \\"rich man boss\\", as well as \\"Here we all work while the white boys play\\" to \\"Here we all work while the rich boys play\\". In 1988, EMI/Angel Records issued a 3-CD set of the complete score of Show Boat, starring Frederica Von Stade, Jerry Hadley, Teresa Stratas, and Bruce Hubbard, conducted by John McGlinn. On this album, the original 1927 lyrics of Ol' Man River were heard for the first time on a hi-fi stereo recording. Gordon MacRae's version of the song, as performed on The Railroad Hour, changed the phrase white man boss to big man boss.

It bore the name of Tigranes the Great, who founded the city in the first century BC. There is so far no common agreement on the precise location of Tigranakert; it was either near present-day Silvan, Arzan (Arzn, in the Armenian province of Arzanene or Aghdznik),See Thomas A. Sinclair, \\"The Site of Tigranocerta. I,\\" Revue des √âtudes Arm√©niennes 25 (1994-95): pp. 183-254; idem, \\"The Site of Tigranocerta.

It was one of four cities in historic Armenia named Tigranakert. The others were located in Nakhichevan, Artsakh and Utik.  History  To create this city, Tigranes forced many people out of their homes to make up the population.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 36.2.3. Armenia at this time had expanded east to the Caspian Sea, west to central Cappadocia, and south towards Judea, advancing as far as the regions surrounding what is now the Krak des Chevaliers. The city's markets were filled with traders and merchants doing business from all over the ancient world. Tigranocerta quickly became a very important commercial, as well as cultural center of the Near East. The magnificent theater that was established by the Emperor, of which he was an avid devotee, conducted dramas and comedies mostly played by Greek as well as Armenian actors. Plutarch wrote that Tigranocerta was \\"a rich and beautiful city where every common man and every man of rank studied to adorn it\\".Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 26.2. The Hellenistic culture during the Artaxiad Dynasty had a strong influence and the Greek language was in fact the official language of the court. Tigranes had divided Greater Armenia ‚Äì the nucleus of the Empire ‚Äì into four major strategic regions or viceroyalties. A Roman force under Lucius Lucullus defeated Tigranes at the Battle of Tigranocerta nearby in 69 BC, and afterwards sacked the city, sending many of the people back to their original homes.Holmes, T. Rice, \\"Tigranocerta.\\" Journal of Roman Studies 7 (1917): pp. 120-38. After the plunder, which included the destruction of statues and temples, the city was set ablaze. An abundant quantity of gold and silver was carried off to Rome as war booty. Lucullus took most of the gold and silver from the melted-down statues, pots, cups and other valuable metals and precious stones. During the pillage most of the city's inhabitants fled to the countryside. The newly established theater building was also destroyed in the fire. The great city would never recover from this devastating destruction.Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 29.3. During Pompey the Great's 'conquests of the east', Tigranocerta was retaken briefly by Rome, but was lost when Tigranes the Great was given parts of his kingdom back after his initial surrender to Pompey for the cost of 6,000 talents (an indemnity paid to Rome over an uncertain period). It was again taken by the Romans under Corbulo, during the Roman‚ÄìParthian War of 58‚Äì63.Goldsworthy, Adrian. In the Name of Rome: The Men Who Won The Roman Empire, 2nd Ed.. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003. During late antiquity Tigranokert was commonly referred to as Chlomaron, which was either another name or the name of a more significant settlement near the ancient one. In 587 during the reign of emperor Maurice, Chlomaron and much of Armenia came under Roman administration after the Romans defeated the Sassanid Persian Empire at the battle of the Blarathon. During the Ottoman period, Armenians referred to the city of Diyarbekir as Dikranagerd (Western Armenian pronunciation of Tigranakert).

Life Baryatinsky entered the school of the ensigns of the Guard in his seventeenth year and, on 8 November 1833, received his commission of cornet in the Life Guards of the future Tsar Alexander II. In 1835, he served with great gallantry in the Caucasus, and on his return to St.Petersburg was rewarded with a golden sword for valour. On 1 January 1836, he was attached to the suite of Alexander, and in 1845 was again ordered off to the Caucasus and again most brilliantly distinguished himself, especially in the attack on Shamil's stronghold, for which he received the Order of St. George. In 1846, he assisted Field Marshal Ivan Paskevich to suppress the Krak√≥w Uprising. From 1848 to 1856 he took a leading part in all the chief military events in the Caucasus, his most notable exploits being his victory at Mezeninsk in 1850 and his operations against Shamil in Chechnya. His energetic and at the same time systematic tactics inaugurated a new era of mountain warfare. On 6 January 1853, he was appointed adjutant general and, on 5 July of the same year, chief of staff. In 1854, he took part in the brilliant Kurbsk Dere campaign. On 1 January 1856, he became commander-in-chief of the Caucasian army, and, subsequently, governor of the Caucasus. As an administrator, he showed himself fully worthy of his high reputation. Within three years of his appointment, the whole of the eastern Caucasus was subdued and the long elusive Shamil was taken captive. Baryatinsky also conquered many of the tribes of the western Caucasus dwelling between the rivers of Laba and Belaya. By the early 1860s, his health had seriously deteriorated, and on 6 December 1862, he was relieved of his post at his own request. He spent the last days of his life abroad and died in Geneva, after forty-eight years of active service.  Literature  * Alfred J. Rieber (Editor): The Politics of Autocracy.

It may occur as a short episode or may be of a long duration. There may be no symptoms but, when symptoms are present, the most common is upper abdominal pain. Other possible symptoms include nausea and vomiting, bloating, loss of appetite and heartburn. Complications may include stomach bleeding, stomach ulcers, and stomach tumors. When due to autoimmune problems, low red blood cells due to not enough vitamin B12 may occur, a condition known as pernicious anemia. Common causes include infection with Helicobacter pylori and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Less common causes include alcohol, smoking, cocaine, severe illness, autoimmune problems, radiation therapy and Crohn's disease. Endoscopy, a type of X-ray known as an upper gastrointestinal series, blood tests, and stool tests may help with diagnosis. The symptoms of gastritis may be a presentation of a myocardial infarction. Other conditions with similar symptoms include inflammation of the pancreas, gallbladder problems, and peptic ulcer disease. Prevention is by avoiding things that cause the disease. Treatment includes medications such as antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors. During an acute attack drinking viscous lidocaine may help. If gastritis is due to NSAIDs these may be stopped. If H. pylori is present it may be treated with a combination of antibiotics such as amoxicillin and clarithromycin. For those with pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 supplements are recommended either by mouth or by injection. People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them. Gastritis is believed to affect about half of people worldwide. In 2013 there were approximately 90 million new cases of the condition. As people get older the disease becomes more common. It, along with a similar condition in the first part of the intestines known as duodenitis, resulted in 50,000 deaths in 2015. H. pylori was first discovered in 1981 by Barry Marshall and Robin Warren.  Signs and symptoms  Endoscopic image. Many people with gastritis experience no symptoms at all. However, upper central abdominal pain is the most common symptom; the pain may be dull, vague, burning, aching, gnawing, sore, or sharp. Pain is usually located in the upper central portion of the abdomen, but it may occur anywhere from the upper left portion of the abdomen around to the back. Other signs and symptoms may include the following: *Nausea *Vomiting (may be clear, green or yellow, blood-streaked or completely bloody depending on the severity of the stomach inflammation) *Belching (does not usually relieve stomach pain if present) *Bloating *Early satiety *Loss of appetite *Unexplained weight loss  Cause  Common causes include Helicobacter pylori and NSAIDs. Less common causes include alcohol, cocaine, severe illness and Crohn disease, among others. =Helicobacter pylori= Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomachs of more than half of the world's population, and the infection continues to play a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of gastroduodenal diseases. Colonization of the gastric mucosa with Helicobacter pylori results in the development of chronic gastritis in infected individuals, and in a subset of patients chronic gastritis progresses to complications (e.g., ulcer disease, stomach cancers, some distinct extragastric disorders). However, over 80 percent of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic and it has been postulated that it may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology. =Critical illness= Gastritis may also develop after major surgery or traumatic injury (\\"Cushing ulcer\\"), burns (\\"Curling ulcer\\"), or severe infections. Gastritis may also occur in those who have had weight loss surgery resulting in the banding or reconstruction of the digestive tract. =Diet= Evidence does not support a role for specific foods including spicy foods and coffee in the development of peptic ulcers. People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them.  Pathophysiology  =Acute= Acute erosive gastritis typically involves discrete foci of surface necrosis due to damage to mucosal defenses. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase-1, or COX-1, an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of eicosanoids in the stomach, which increases the possibility of peptic ulcers forming. Also, NSAIDs, such as aspirin, reduce a substance that protects the stomach called prostaglandin. These drugs used in a short period are not typically dangerous. However, regular use can lead to gastritis. Additionally, severe physiologic stress (\\"stress ulcers\\") from sepsis, hypoxia, trauma, or surgery, is also a common etiology for acute erosive gastritis. This form of gastritis can occur in more than 5% of hospitalized patients. Also, note that alcohol consumption does not cause chronic gastritis. It does, however, erode the mucosal lining of the stomach; low doses of alcohol stimulate hydrochloric acid secretion. High doses of alcohol do not stimulate secretion of acid. =Chronic= Chronic gastritis refers to a wide range of problems of the gastric tissues. The immune system makes proteins and antibodies that fight infections in the body to maintain a homeostatic condition. In some disorders the body targets the stomach as if it were a foreign protein or pathogen; it makes antibodies against, severely damages, and may even destroy the stomach or its lining. In some cases bile, normally used to aid digestion in the small intestine, will enter through the pyloric valve of the stomach if it has been removed during surgery or does not work properly, also leading to gastritis. Gastritis may also be caused by other medical conditions, including HIV/AIDS, Crohn's disease, certain connective tissue disorders, and liver or kidney failure. Since 1992, chronic gastritis lesions are classified according to the Sydney system. Metaplasia Mucous gland metaplasia, the reversible replacement of differentiated cells, occurs in the setting of severe damage of the gastric glands, which then waste away (atrophic gastritis) and are progressively replaced by mucous glands. Gastric ulcers may develop; it is unclear if they are the causes or the consequences. Intestinal metaplasia typically begins in response to chronic mucosal injury in the antrum, and may extend to the body. Gastric mucosa cells change to resemble intestinal mucosa and may even assume absorptive characteristics. Intestinal metaplasia is classified histologically as complete or incomplete. With complete metaplasia, gastric mucosa is completely transformed into small-bowel mucosa, both histologically and functionally, with the ability to absorb nutrients and secrete peptides. In incomplete metaplasia, the epithelium assumes a histologic appearance closer to that of the large intestine and frequently exhibits dysplasia.  Diagnosis  Often, a diagnosis can be made based on the patient's description of their symptoms, but other methods which may be used to verify gastritis include: *Blood tests: **Blood cell count **Presence of H. pylori **Liver, kidney, gallbladder, or pancreas functions *Urinalysis *Stool sample, to look for blood in the stool *X-rays *Endoscopy, to check for stomach lining inflammation and mucous erosion *Stomach biopsy, to test for gastritis and other conditions Treatment Antacids are a common treatment for mild to medium gastritis. When antacids do not provide enough relief, medications such as H2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors that help reduce the amount of acid are often prescribed. Cytoprotective agents are designed to help protect the tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. They include the medications sucralfate and misoprostol. If NSAIDs are being taken regularly, one of these medications to protect the stomach may also be taken. Another cytoprotective agent is bismuth subsalicylate . Several regimens are used to treat H. pylori infection. Most use a combination of two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor. Sometimes bismuth is added to the regimen. History In 1,000 A.D, Avicenna first gave the description of stomach cancer. In 1728, German physician Georg Ernst Stahl first coined the term \\"gastritis\\". Italian anatomical pathologist Giovanni Battista Morgagni further described the characteristics of gastric inflammation. He described the characteristics of erosive or ulcerative gastritis and erosive gastritis. Between 1808 and 1831, French physician Fran√ßois-Joseph-Victor Broussais gathered information from the autopsy of the dead French soldiers. He described chronic gastritis as \\"Gastritide\\" and erroneously believed that gastritis was the cause of ascites, typhoid fever, and meningitis. In 1854, Charles Handfield Jones and Wilson Fox described the microscopic changes of stomach inner lining in gastritis which existed in diffuse and segmental forms. In 1855, Baron Carl von Rokitansky first described hypetrophic gastritis. In 1859, British physician, William Brinton first described about acute, subacute, and chronic gastritis. In 1870, Samuel Fenwick noted that pernicious anemia causes glandular atrophy in gastritis. German surgeon, Georg Ernst Konjetzny noticed that gastric ulcer and gastric cancer are the result of gastric inflammation. Shields Warren and Willam A. Meissner described the intestinal metaplasia of the stomach as a feature of chronic gastritis.

Administration  With a communal reform of 1975 the independent municipalities of Breitscheid, Eggerscheidt, H√∂sel, Lintorf (seat Angerland) as well as the local part of Homberg and the municipality of Homberg-Meiersberg (seat Hubbelrath) were added into the city of Ratingen. Water-Castle \\"Haus zum Haus\\"  History  Ratingen was settled before 849. Since the Middle Ages, the Ratingen area belonged to the count and later dukes of Berg. On December 11, 1276 the settlement received city rights. Ratingen was one of the four places of Berg which experienced an economic boom in the end of the Middle Ages, but slowed during the Thirty Years' War. At the beginning of the Industrial Age, the first manufacturing plants opened in 1783. In Cromford the first mechanical spinnery of Europe opened, which grew into the Textilfabrik Cromford, now part of the Rheinisches Industriemuseum (Rhine Industry Museum). In the Napoleonic times, it became part of the city of Berg and in 1815, into the Kingdom of Prussia. In the communal re- organization of 1929, Ratingen maintained its independence. After relatively small war damage, Ratingen in the 1960s and the 1970s experienced years of growth and development (West Ratingen with 20,000 inhabitants, developed in the late 1960s-1980s). Several important international enterprises (particularly from the IT industry) as Vodafone, ASUS, Hewlett-Packard, SAP, CEMEX, Tiptel and Esprit maintain branches and/or main centers in Ratingen. It is also the hometown of automotive dealer Gottfried Schultz. In 1970, before further incorporations the number of inhabitants surpassed 50,000.

The murder itself was extraordinarily brutal and caused a national outcry in the United Kingdom. Fanny was abducted by Baker and taken into a hop garden near her home. She was then brutally murdered and her body cut into several pieces, with some parts never being found. Further investigations suggested that two small knives were used for the murder, but it was later ruled they would have been insufficient to carry out the crime and that another weapon must have been used. Used to express total downtime or inaction, the military, manual- trade and locker room talk phrase \\"sweet Fanny Adams\\" has been in use since at least the mid 20th century, vying with a stronger expletive. Unusually, the phrase is not a bowdlerisation; \\"Fanny Adams\\" arrived in 1860s naval slang to deplore unliked meat stews. It broadened to mean anything badly substandard, then further so as to merge with the expletive sharing its initial letters to mean nothing at all. The phrase also appears today as \\"sweet F.A.\\" Background Fanny Adams (born 30 April 1859) and her family lived in Tanhouse Lane, on the northern side of Alton, a market town in Hampshire. The 1861 census shows that Fanny lived with her father and five siblings. The family were apparently locally rooted; a George Adams and his wife Ann, believed to have been Fanny's grandparents, lived next door. Fanny was described as being a \\"tall, comely and intelligent girl\\". She appeared older than her real age of eight and was known locally for her lively and cheerful disposition. Fanny's best friend, Minnie Warner, was the same age and lived next door but one in Tanhouse Lane. The town of Alton was renowned for its plentiful supply of hops, which led to many breweries opening in the town and made hop picking an integral part of its economy until the mid 20th century. To the northern end of Tanhouse Lane lies Flood Meadow and surrounding the River Wey, which sometimes flooded the area in times of heavy rain. A large hop garden was located next to the meadow. Murder An illustration of Fanny Adams' abduction by Illustrated Police News. The small market town of Alton had previously seen little crime during the 19th century. The afternoon of 24 August 1867 was reported as fine, sunny and hot. It was around this time that Fanny, along with her sister Lizzie and best friend Minnie Warner, asked Harriet Adams if she could go out to the nearby Flood Meadow. Having no objections and being pleased for the girls to leave her while she was getting on with housework, Harriet agreed. Fanny and the local children had often played in Flood Meadow, owing to its close proximity to Tanhouse Lane and the fact that there had been no real crime in Alton within living memory. As the girls were walking towards Flood Meadow and into a hop garden, they met Frederick Baker, a 29-year-old solicitor's clerk. He was wearing a frock coat, light-coloured trousers and a tall hat on his head. Baker had moved to work and live in Alton, about two months prior, which allegedly made him unfamiliar with the town. Baker gave Minnie and Lizzie three halfpence to spend on sweets and Fanny another halfpenny. The girls had seen Baker before at church meetings, and were thus unconcerned about taking money from him. Baker then watched the girls run up and down The Hollow (a lane leading to the nearby village of Shalden) as they played and ate the blackberries he had picked for them. An hour later, Lizzie and Minnie decided that they had had enough and opted to go home. Baker then approached Fanny and asked her to accompany him to Shalden. Fanny refused, and it was then that Baker abducted her, and carried her into the nearby hop garden. Lizzie and Minnie ran back to Tanhouse Lane, straight to Martha Warner, who ignored their story, so the girls thought everything was okay, and carried on playing together, oblivious of Fanny's abduction. It was not until 5 pm that they made their way home for dinner. Mrs. Gardner, who also lived on Tanhouse Lane, noticed Fanny's absence and asked the girls her whereabouts. The children relayed what had occurred earlier in the day, and told Mrs. Gardner that Fanny had been taken away by Baker. Mrs. Gardner then relayed the information to Fanny's mother and the two set off to search for her. They met with Baker after going only a short distance, near a gate separating the hop garden from Flood Meadow. According to the Hampshire Chronicle, Mrs. Gardner asked Baker what he had done with the child. But Baker assured her that he often gave money to children for buying sweets. Mrs. Gardner replied \\"I have a great mind to give you in charge of the police\\", to which Baker told her she could do what she liked. Baker's position in town as the solicitor's clerk initially deflected any suspicions the two women had. Both returned to their homes believing Fanny was still playing in one of the surrounding fields. =Discovery= Sometime between 7:00 and 8:00 pm, Fanny had still not returned home, prompting Harriet Adams and a group of neighbours to search for her missing child. As the evening was setting, the group began the search in The Hollow, to no success. In the nearby hop garden, however, labourer Thomas Gates (a Crimean War veteran who partook in the famous Charge of the Light Brigade) found the head of Fanny Adams stuck on two hop poles, while he was tending to the crops. An ear had been severed from the head, which had two large cuts, from mouth to ear across the temple. Further investigation discovered the remains of the child; the head, arms and legs were separated from the trunk. There were three incisions on the left side of the chest, and a deep cut on the left arm, dividing her muscles. Fanny's forearm was cut off at the elbow joint, and her left leg nearly severed off at the hip joint, with her left foot cut off at the ankle point. Her right leg was torn from the trunk, and the whole contents of her pelvis and chest were completely removed. Five further incisions had been made on the liver. Her heart had been cut out, and her vagina were both missing. Both of her eyes were cut out, and found in the nearby River Wey. Overwhelmed with grief, Harriet Adams collapsed,on her way to her husband, who was playing cricket at the time, to tell him of the news, so word was sent instead. When George Adams was told the details he returned home to take his loaded shotgun and set out to look for the culprit, but neighbours stopped him and instead sat with him through the night. The next day hundreds of people visited the hop garden to help collect Fanny's scattered remains. The police tried, unsuccessfully, to find the murder weapons, as they suspected that small knives were used to commit the crime. It is likely that the crowd of searching people had inadvertently trampled down any clues left on the ground. Members of the crowd did, however, recover all of her cut clothing, scattered around the field, with the exception of her hat. Most of her body parts were collected on that day but an arm, foot, and intestines were not found until the next morning. One foot was still in a shoe, and still clutched in one hand were The two half-pennies that Baker had given to Fanny. The breast bone was never found. The remains of Fanny were collected by searchers, and taken to a house named Leathern Bottle, to be sewn together, only yards away from her home. From there the police took them to the local police station. A stone which still had flesh and hair sticking to it was handed in to the police as evidence, as they thought it may have been the actual murder weapon. =Arrest of Frederick Baker= The Leathern Bottle, where Fanny's remains were collected and reassembled. That evening, police superintendent William Cheyney hurried from the local police station to Flood Meadow, where he was met by several people, who then led him to the Leathern Bottle. Upon arrival, the proprietor of the house handed Cheyney a bundle labeled \\"portions of a child\\", and with the help of some of his officers, organized a search to trace the missing body parts. Hearing that Frederick Baker had been seen with the children prior to Fanny's disappearance, Cheyney retraced his steps through the town and located Baker's place of work. Arriving at the solicitor's office at 9 pm, he found Baker still at work, an hour later than usual. Baker protested, claiming his innocence, despite being informed that he was the only suspect. Cheyney had no alternative but to arrest Baker, on suspicion of murder. By this time, a large, and agitated crowd had gathered outside the solicitor's office, forcing the police to smuggle Baker out the back door, for fear that the people would kill him. When searched at the police station, Baker was found to be in possession of two unstained small knives. Spots of blood were observed on both wristbands of his shirt, and his trousers had been soaked to conceal the bloodstains. After being questioned about his appearance, Baker responded: \\"Well, I don't see a scratch or cut on my hands to account for the blood\\". Baker's conduct during his interrogation was described as cool and collected. Some time after the arrest, Cheyney backtracked to Baker's desk, in the solicitor's office, and discovered a diary, among some legal papers. An entry had been made for Saturday 24 August 1867 which recorded: \\"Killed a young girl. It was fine and hot\\". The Hampshire Chronicle reported that the hop garden had been cleared on 21 September, but nothing connected with the murder had been found. It also added that Baker remained completely unfazed with the murder, and did not exhibit any symptoms of insanity or remorse. Further confusion was added when Baker stated that he was intoxicated after seeing the children. But, all evidence and witnesses rejected his claim. Baker was transferred to Winchester Prison on 19 October. Investigation Following investigations from Hampshire Constabulary continued until October. It was around this time when a young boy, whose parents lived close to the Adams family, came forward as an eyewitness. The boy testified that he saw Baker emerge from the hop garden at about 2 pm on the day Fanny was murdered, with his hands and clothes saturated with blood. Baker then reportedly stooped down to the river, and calmly wiped himself with a handkerchief, after which he put a small knife, and another unidentified object in his jacket pocket. The boy had related this story to his mother, at that time, but she had not told anyone until she spoke out in a pub, two months later. The police searched the whole area for sixteen days, but no other weapons were found. Superintendent Cheyney requested an immediate forensic test in late October. All recovered clothing, and the two knives taken from Baker at the time of his arrest, were sent to Professor A.S. Taylor at Guy's Hospital in London, where they received the most detailed tests possible, at the time. After examining them over the coming weeks, Taylor was able to confirm that the blood on the knives was from a human. One of the small knives contained a small amount of coagulated blood, although none was on the handle. Under cross-examination Taylor stated he would have expected more blood on the knives, and signs of rust if they had been washed. The quantity of blood found, was surprisingly small. However, Taylor opined that an inexperienced person armed with a proper weapon, could dismember a body in about half an hour ‚Äî blood would still run but would not have spurted from the body. Further examination of Baker's clothes uncovered some small traces of diluted blood in some parts of his waistcoat, trousers and stockings. The wristbands of his shirt had been folded back and diluted blood stained the folds. There was no sign of rape on the body. Doctor Lewis Leslie from Alton thought the ultimate cause of death was probably by a blow to the head with a stone. Leslie speculated that a larger instrument had to have been used to cut the body, and also added that dismemberment was achieved in less than an hour. Forensics indicated that cuts had been made when the body was still warm, and that Fanny had not only been cut, but also hacked and torn to pieces. The time it had taken Baker to cut the body into so many pieces most likely gave him the opportunity to choose his positioning so that he might not necessarily be covered in blood. The forensic staff in London concluded that the small knives found in Baker's possession would not have been capable of severing Fanny's body, so another weapon had to have been used. Meanwhile, in Winchester Prison, Baker was said to be talkative to the wardens and especially the chaplain. He still insisted that his conscience was clear with regards to the murder, and wondered who the guilty party was, hoping that \\"he would be found\\". He ate and slept well, which was in contrast to his time in Alton's prison, where he was reportedly disturbed in his sleep, and physically shuddered at the sight of meat. Trial =Initial trials in Alton= British law at the time required that in the case of sudden death, an immediate inquest must be held under the jurisdiction of a coroner. In the case of Fanny Adams' inquest, Deputy County Coroner Robert Harfield was in charge of the proceedings which were held at the Dukes Head Inn in Alton on 27 August 1867. Alton's divisional police superintendent William Cheyney was in attendance, along with acting Chief Constable superintendent Everitt, who was representing Hampshire Constabulary. Coincidentally, the pub where the initial trials were held was opposite the solicitor's offices where Baker worked and very close to the police station. The first to give evidence was Minnie Warner. She told the jury that Frederick Baker gave her money to run down The Hollow with Fanny and into a nearby field while Baker picked blackberries for them. She was unable to identify Baker but correctly described what he was wearing when he murdered Fanny. The next to testify was Fanny's mother, Harriet. She recalled that she met Baker at the gate to the hop garden, and that he was headed towards the road which led to Basingstoke. It was there Minnie identified Baker as the man who gave her the pennies. Baker contradicted Minnie at the time by saying \\"no, three halfpence\\". When asked by Harriet to give his name, Baker refused but told her where he could be found. Mrs Gardner, who had accompanied Harriet Adams to search for the missing girl, gave evidence next. She was able to identify Baker and told the jury that he appeared to be very relaxed at the time she saw him. After asking him if he had seen the missing child and enquiring why he had given her money, Mrs Gardner told Harriet that she should \\"give him in charge to the police\\", to which Baker calmly responded: \\"the reason why I speak so is that an old gentlemen has been giving halfpence to the children for no good purpose, and I thought you were of the same sort\\". After being asked again of Fanny's whereabouts, Baker said that he left her at the gate to play. The coroner asked Baker if he wanted to cross-question the witness, but he declined. At his trial on 5 December, the defence contested Minnie Warner's identification of Baker and claimed the knives found were too small for the crime anyway. They also argued insanity: Baker's father had been violent, a cousin had been in asylums, his sister had died of a brain fever and he himself had attempted suicide after a love affair. The defence also argued that the diary entry was typical of the \\"epileptic or formal way of entry\\" that the defendant used and that the absence of a comma after the word killed did not render the entry a confession. Justice Mellor invited the jury to consider a verdict of not responsible by reason of insanity, but they returned a guilty verdict after just fifteen minutes. On 24 December, Christmas Eve, Baker was hanged outside Winchester Gaol. The crime had become notorious and a crowd of 5,000 attended the execution. This was the last public execution held at that gaol. Before his death, Baker wrote to the Adamses expressing his sorrow for what he had done \\"in an unguarded hour\\" and seeking their forgiveness. Fanny was buried in Alton cemetery. The headstone, erected by voluntary subscription, reads: Legacy Fanny Adams' grave in Alton cemetery In 1869 new rations of tinned mutton were introduced for British seamen. They were unimpressed by it, and suggested it might be the butchered remains of Fanny Adams. \\"Fanny Adams\\" became slang for mediocre mutton,Sweet Fanny Adams stew, scarce leftovers and then anything worthless. The large tins the mutton was delivered in doubled as mess tins. These or cooking pots are still known as Fannys. By the mid-20th century, many working class men were pretending to their sons and social superiors that their own favored expression, \\"sweet F.A.\\", stood for \\"sweet Fanny Adams\\" with its commonplace meaning of total inaction or downtime, while they and their peers used that expression among themselves to mean \\"sweet fuck all\\". Sweet Fanny Adams has lingered as a euphemism for that expletive. Notes and references ;References ;Notes ;Bibliography * ;Notes References *\\"Killed a Young Girl.

It does this by using several \\"sub-receivers\\" called fingers, that is, several correlators each assigned to a different multipath component. Each finger independently decodes a single multipath component; at a later stage the contribution of all fingers are combined in order to make the most use of the different transmission characteristics of each transmission path. This could very well result in higher signal-to-noise ratio (or Eb/N0) in a multipath environment than in a \\"clean\\" environment. The multipath channel through which a radio wave transmits can be viewed as transmitting the original (line of sight) wave pulse through a number of multipath components. Multipath components are delayed copies of the original transmitted wave traveling through a different echo path, each with a different magnitude and time-of-arrival at the receiver. Since each component contains the original information, if the magnitude and time-of-arrival (phase) of each component is computed at the receiver (through a process called channel estimation), then all the components can be added coherently to improve the information reliability.  Mathematical definition  A rake receiver utilizes multiple correlators to separately detect the M strongest multipath components. Each correlator output may be quantized using several bits. Demodulation and bit decisions are then based on the weighted outputs of the M correlators, which provide a better estimate of the transmitted signal than is provided by a single component.  History  Rake receivers must have either a general-purpose CPU or some other form of digital signal processing hardware in them to process and correlate the intended signal. Rake receivers only became common after 16-bit CPUs capable of signal processing became widely available. The rake receiver was patented in the US by Robert Price and Paul E. Green in July 1956, but it took until the 1970s to design practical implementations of the receiver. Radio astronomers were the first substantial users of rake receivers in the late 1960s to mid-1980s as this kind of receiver could scan large sky regions yet not create large volumes of data beyond what most data recorders could handle at the time. Astropulse, which is part of the SETI@Home project, uses a variant of a rake receiver as part of its sky searches‚Äîso this kind of receiver is still current for the needs of radio astronomy.  Use  Rake receivers are common in a wide variety of CDMA and W-CDMA radio devices such as mobile phones and wireless LAN equipment. Rake receivers are also used in radio astronomy. The CSIRO Parkes radio telescope and Jodrell Bank telescope have filter-bank recording formats that can be processed in real time by software-based rake receivers. In a Flexible rake Receiver, signal reception is performed with a single correlator engine and a stream buffer storing the entire delay spread of baseband input/output (I/O) samples. The primary advantage of the rake receiver is flexible multipath allocation supporting enhanced modularity of the receiver and resource sharing among multiple channel decoders.

Despite vague statements in advertisements, it is not issued by the United States Mint and is not considered legal tender, nor is it considered non-circulating legal tender. The CNMI receives royalty fees from proceeds of the sale of the coin. The coin is actually minted by SoftSky, a Wyoming commemorative coin maker.  Description  The obverse of the coin features a rendered image of the original design proposal for the Freedom Tower by Daniel Libeskind that was to be built on the former site of the World Trade Center in New York City. Also on the obverse are the United States national motto \\"In God We Trust\\" and the words \\"Freedom Tower, July 4, 2004.\\" The reverse features an image of the former World Trade Center and the words \\"We Will Never Forget\\", along with a small symbol of a star on a stone pillar within a circle. This latter unidentified icon is in fact the coat of arms of the Northern Mariana Islands.  Legality  The distributor of the coin, National Collector's Mint, advertises the item as \\"legally authorized government issue\\" and marks the coin with the valuation of \\"One Dollar\\". This is seen as being a deliberate attempt to mislead American consumers into believing it is a legal tender coin produced by the United States Mint and is worth one U.S. dollar. In reaction to advertising for this product, the U.S. Mint, as well as the attorneys general of various U.S. states, released a statement that the coin is not U.S. government issue. Furthermore, since the Northern Mariana Islands is a United States Commonwealth, it cannot mint its own legal tender currency (it uses regular American money). The distributors also purport that the coins have been struck using silver recovered from a vault in the rubble of the World Trade Center. The validity of this claim has not been confirmed. Distributors warn that the minting of the coin will cease once the quantity of recovered silver has been exhausted, and have therefore placed a limit on the number of coins that can be ordered per person. The coins are not solid silver, but are silver clad (0.0001 inch (2.5 micrometre) layer). Actual silver content is 45 mg, or 0.00145 troy oz. The territorial government of the CNMI has made money from commissioning commemorative, non-tender coins through SoftSky and National Collector's Mint in the past, but does not claim the right to commission legal tender coinage. Some past coins issued by SoftSky, such as the 1933 Gold Double Eagle coin, have also incurred marketing controversy. In October 2004 the attorney general of New York, Eliot Spitzer, obtained a court order against National Collectors Mint (a Port Chester, New York company) to halt sales of the \\"Freedom Tower Silver Dollar\\" coin, citing it as fraudulently advertised. Spitzer also alleged that the company's sales contacts had asserted that the coin is legal tender. On October 13, 2004, Spitzer obtained a temporary order halting the company from advertising or selling the coin. On November 9, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph R. Cannizzaro ruled that the company had engaged in deceptive and fraudulent marketing practices, and ordered the company to terminate its misleading advertising of the coin. An investigation as to the silver content and the origin of the silver in the coins was started. The attorney general's office easily determined that the coin was only silver clad, but as of 2005 the veracity of the claim that this silver came from a World Trade Center bank vault had not been determined. As a result of the controversy and legal action over the Freedom Tower coin, CNMI governor Juan N. Babauta suspended the SoftSky contract on November 13, 2004. On December 2, Babauta ended the contract. Before this course of events, the CNMI government made about $160,000 off the deal. Other groups have also released silver Freedom Tower coins, but not with a denominational value or advertised as government issue. The CNMI coin was named \\"Stupid Investment of the Week\\" by CBS MarketWatch on September 24, 2004. 2005 Freedom Tower Dollar In 2005, a similar coin to the CNMI Freedom Tower coin was sold, with similar design and the same claim of being made from silver \\"reclaimed\\" from the World Trade Center, but bearing the name of the Cook Islands instead of the CNMI. The Cook Islands are a self- governing democracy, and do mint their own currency (at par with the New Zealand dollar), though this coin is sold as a \\"non-circulating legal tender\\" coin. As of February 19, 2014 this Company still has a catalog selling \\"World Trade Center 'Recovery Silver' Silver Eagle Dollars\\" for $99.00 with a claim that all silver has been independently verified as authentic from Ground Zero by a former Asst. Director of the FBI. 2001‚Äì2006 World Trade Center Gold and Silver Clad Commemorative As of 2006, the National Collectors Mint was offering what is variously described as 2001‚Äì2006 World Trade Center Gold and Silver Clad Commemorative, 2001‚Äì2006 World Trade Center Commemorative, and 5th Anniversary World Trade Center Commemorative. It is advertised as a \\"non- monetary issue\\" that \\"will never be released for circulation.\\" This coin is a two piece set of a gold coin with a detachable silver inset of the World Trade Center complex and claims to contain \\"15 mg. of 24 KT gold and 15 mg. of .999 Pure silver clad,\\" and also continued to claim that the silver was found in a bank vault buried under the rubble of Ground Zero. For comparison, a U.S. dollar coin is 8.1 g and a dime is 2.268 g, meaning that the precious metal content of the commemorative coin is likely between 0.4% and 1.3% of the total mass. It was discovered that the silver analyzed was, indeed, not silver, and was only worth about 32 cents. The company claims that \\"$5 of every 2001‚Äì2006 World Trade Center Commemorative order is donated to official 9/11 family charities and memorials.\\" This claim has not been verified.

Born in the town of Buchanan, Grand Bassa County, he worked his way up through the civil service to become secretary of the True Whig Party, the country's only political party at the time. Howard was elected president in 1911 and assumed office on January 1, 1912. With the outbreak of World War I, he attempted to maintain the country's neutrality, though he tended to support the Allies, whose colonial territories in Africa surrounded Liberia. Despite German protests, he allowed the French to operate a wireless station in the capital, Monrovia. Realizing that their complaints were in vain, the Germans sent a submarine to attack the city in 1917, forcing the reluctant Howard to side with the Allies and declare war on Germany. Howard remained in office for two years after the war's end. He died in Monrovia in 1935. Presidency (1912‚Äì1920) Daniel Edward Howard was the President of Liberia from 1912 to 1920. The finances of Liberia were so shaky that the pay of government employees was often suspended for months at a time. =Rebellion of indigenous= In 1915, the coastal Kru people, who had long resisted Monrovia's authority, rose in rebellion, declaring their loyalty to Great Britain and demanding annexation by Crown Colony of Sierra Leone. In response, the United States diverted the USS Chester to Africa en route home from Turkey to help quash the uprising. =World War I= At the outbreak of World War I, President Howard attempted to maintain the country's neutrality. However, he tended to support the Allies, whose colonial territories in Africa surrounded Liberia and whose naval superiority quickly disrupted trade with Germany. As Germany was Liberia's major trading partner, the loss of customs revenue severely impacted government finances. What little revenue remained was diminished by the blockade imposed by German submarines which effectively halted trade between Liberia and the Allies as well. Since Liberia's economy was almost completely dependent on export revenues, this sudden evaporation of customs revenues forced Liberia to postpone payment on the $1.7 million loan, and led President Daniel E. Howard to seek a $5 million loan from the Woodrow Wilson Administration. However, the United States Congress refused to approve the loan. Despite German protests, Howard allowed the French to operate a wireless station in the capital, Monrovia. Realizing that their complaints were in vain, the Germans sent a submarine to attack the city in 1917, forcing the reluctant Howard to side with the Allies and declare war on Germany on January 12, 1918. Liberia then liquidated the property of German nationals in Liberia. The money generated from this liquidation was deposited into the Liberian government bank account to compensate for loss of revenue from the blockade. The war ended in 1918, and Liberia's legislature ratified the Treaty of Versailles. =Territorial conflicts= In 1919, Liberia became a charter member of the League of Nations. Conflicts over territorial claims again resulted in the loss of land to Britain and/or France in 1919. Whenever the British and French seemed intent on enlarging at Liberia's expense the neighboring territories they already controlled, periodic appearances by U.S. warships helped discourage encroachment, even though successive American administrations rejected appeals from Monrovia for more forceful support.Liebenow, J.

Vertical tabs, to the left, represent languages in which a given spelling occurs, where the selected tab shows the word jam ('already') in Esperanto. In interface design, a tabbed document interface (TDI) or Tab is a graphical control element that allows multiple documents or panels to be contained within a single window, using tabs as a navigational widget for switching between sets of documents. It is an interface style most commonly associated with web browsers, web applications, text editors, and preference panes, with window managers, especially tiling window managers, being lesser known examples. GUI tabs are modeled after traditional card tabs inserted in paper files or card indexes (in keeping with the desktop metaphor). History The WordVision DOS word processor for the IBM PC in 1982 was perhaps the first commercially available product with a tabbed interface. PC Magazine later wrote that it \\"has served as a free R&D; department for the software business‚Äîits bones picked over for a decade by programmers looking for so- called new ideas\\". HyperTIES browser and Gosling Emacs authoring tool with pie menus on the NeWS window system Don Hopkins developed and released several versions of tabbed window frames for the NeWS window system as free software, which the window manager applied to all NeWS applications, and enabled users to drag the tabs around to any edge of the window. The NeWS version of UniPress's Gosling Emacs text editor was another early product with multiple tabbed windows in 1988. It was used to develop an authoring tool for Ben Shneiderman's hypermedia browser HyperTIES (the NeWS workstation version of The Interactive Encyclopedia System), in 1988 at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab. HyperTIES also supported pie menus for managing windows and browsing hypermedia documents with PostScript applets. While Boeing Calc already utilized tabbed sheets (as so called wordpads) since at least 1987, Borland's Quattro Pro popularized tabs for spreadsheets in 1992. Microsoft Word in 1993 used them to simplify submenus. In 1994, BookLink Technologies featured tabbed windows in its InternetWorks browser. That same year, the text editor UltraEdit also appeared with a modern multi-row tabbed interface. The tabbed interface approach was then followed by the Internet Explorer shell NetCaptor in 1997. These were followed by a number of others like IBrowse in 1999, and Opera in 2000 (with the release of version 4 - although a MDI interface was supported before then), MultiViews October 2000, which changed its name into MultiZilla on 1 April 2001 (an extension for the Mozilla Application Suite), Galeon in early 2001, Mozilla 0.9.5 in October 2001, Phoenix 0.1 (now Mozilla Firefox) in October 2002, Konqueror 3.1 in January 2003, and Safari in 2003. With the release of Internet Explorer 7 in 2006, all major web browsers featured a tabbed interface. Users have quickly adopted the use of tabs in web browsing and web search. A study of tabbed browsing behavior in June 2009 found that users switched tabs in 57% of tab sessions, and 36% of users used new tabs to open search engine results at least once during that period. Numerous special functions in association with browser tabs have emerged since then. One example is visual tabbed browsing in OmniWeb version 5, which displays preview images of pages in a drawer to the left or right of the main browser window. Another feature is the ability to re-order tabs and to bookmark all of the webpages opened in tab panes in a given window in a group or bookmark folder (as well as the ability to reopen all of them at the same time). Links can most often be opened in several modes, using different user interface options and commands: * in a new main window * in the same main window and tab panel * in the same main window and a new tab panel, which is instantly activated * in the same main window and a new tab panel, which remains in the background until the user switches to it. There are minor usability issues such as whether a new tab opens in the end of the tab list or next to its \\"parent\\". For example, Internet Explorer marks tab families with different colours. Compliance with Microsoft User Interface Guidelines The name TDI implies similarity to the Microsoft Windows standards for multiple document interfaces (MDI) and single document interfaces (SDI), but TDI does not form part of the Microsoft Windows User Interface Guidelines. An example of Mozilla Firefox with two tabs open. Each tab shows a different webpage, thus allowing multiple pages to be contained within a single browser window. There is some debate about how the TDI fits in with the Microsoft Windows User Interface Guidelines. In many ways the Workbook window management model most closely resembles TDI. However this is a relatively recent addition to the Windows User Interface Guidelines, and most developers still prefer to view SDI or MDI as the primary document models for MS Windows. =Comparison to SDI= Advantages Because the tabbed document interface holds many different documents logically under one window, it keeps the primary operating system interface free of the clutter that would be created by a large number of small child windows. Another advantage is that sets of related documents can be grouped within each of several windows. Tabbed web browsers often allow users to save their browsing session and return to it later. Disadvantages Geany text editor with vertically oriented tabs, showing the large number of documents that can be accommodated Although the tabbed document interface does allow for multiple views under one window, there are problems with this interface. One such problem is dealing with many tabs at once. When a window is tabbed to a certain number that exceeds the available display area, the tabs clutter up (this is the same problem as with SDI but moved to another place in the user interface). Multi- row tabs are a second issue that will appear in menu dialogs in some programs. Some prefer to have many tabs open, and some programs help making these compact yet identifiable,http://forum.maxthon.com/viewthread.php?tid=80713&pid;=528941&page;=7&extra;=#pid528941 while normally dealing with multiple rows of tabs in one window is seen to have two disadvantages: *It creates excess window clutter, unless it is limited to about 3 rows that can be scrolled by the mouse wheel. *It complicates what should be an easy-to-read dialog, and at the same time makes it easier to see the titles of many tabs at once. Finding a specific tab in a 3 or 4 level tabular interface can be difficult for some people. Part of the issue with this difficulty lies in the lack of any sorting scheme. Without such tabs can be strewn about without any sense of order, thus looking for a tab provides no meaningful understanding of a position to a tab relative to other tabs. Additionally, the clutter created by multiple tabs can create a dialog that is unusually small, with the tabs above it dominating the window. Thus, although tabbed windows are adequate in environments where there is a minimal necessity for tabs (around ten tabs or less), this scheme does not scale, and alternate methods may be required to address this issue. Among the methods for addressing the problems of the scalability of many tabs: * group tabs by dragging/moving them, and or freeze their position, and then reduce the width of individual tabs, so that more can fit within the available area, including multiple tab rows, and * change the color of selected tabs or according to source, along with the use of favicons for identification and tooltips on mouseover * introduce scrolling to enable tabs to occupy a non- visible region of the screen * introduce sections through any of various means, to spread tabs out to multiple areas * introduce real-time zooming of a tab, based on the position of the mouse cursor * discard tabs in favor of another interface element such as a listbox or drop-down list Large numbers of tabbed windows scale better with the tabs along the left or right edges of the window, instead of the top or bottom edges. That is because tab labels are usually much wider than they are tall, and because it is now common to use displays which are considerably wider than needed for displaying documents and web pages. The NeWS version of the UniPress Emacs text editor placed tabs along the right window edge, and laid windows out in a vertical column, so each tab was initially visible, and the user could use them to raise and lower the windows, drag them around in the column, or pull them out to anywhere on the screen. PSIBER visual PostScript programming environment for NeWS, with tabbed windows around objects on and off the stack. Tabbed window interfaces can give the user the freedom to position the tabs along any edge, so all four edges are available to organize different groups of tabs as the user or application sees fit. The PSIBER visual PostScript programming environment for NeWS had tabbed views that the user could stick onto the stack (represented as a \\"spike\\"), and the user could move the tabs to any edge. The NeWS pie menu and tab window manager enabled users to position the tabs anywhere along any edge, and the tabs popped up pie menus with window management functions, to uncover and bury windows, etc. =Comparison to MDI= Advantages For people used to SDI, MDI can be confusing as windows can be hidden behind other windows. Some MDI applications lack a taskbar or menu to allow quick access to all windows, so for these applications in some cases a window can only be found by closing or moving all others. Practically, however, most MDI environments provide for much richer window-switching functionality than SDI- oriented environments. On the other hand, since in TDI applications most tabs are visible and directly accessible, it is much harder for windows to get \\"lost\\". Some MDI applications such as Opera and Eudora also have this advantage, by having tabs to access the windows. Disadvantages TDI windows must always be maximized inside their parent window, and as a result two tabs cannot be visible at the same time. This makes comparing of documents or easy copy-and-pasting between two documents more difficult. Full MDI interfaces allow for tiling or cascading of child windows, and do not suffer from these limitations. One example of an application that allows either TDI or MDI browsing is Opera. Using TDI by default, this application also supports full MDI and can also run as an SDI application. In order to mitigate these problems, some integrated development environments, such as recent versions of XEmacs and Microsoft's Visual Studio, provide a hybrid interface which allows splitting the parent window into multiple MDI-like \\"panes,\\" each with their own separate TDI tab set. Tiling window managers such as Ion do the same for the entire desktop. This provides many of the advantages of both MDI and TDI, although it can still be difficult for users to get used to. The Konqueror browser by KDE (available on Unix and Unix work-alikes, such as Linux, and Windows) supports multiple documents within one tab by splitting documents. In a Konqueror tab, documents can be split horizontally or vertically, and each split document can be re-split. Another strategy for dealing with the limitation that only one tabbed document would ordinarily be visible at one time is to allow a tab to be dragged outside the parent window and converted to a separate window (which can itself have multiple tabs). This is supported in the Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox 3.5, and Internet Explorer 9 web browsers, for example. =Window managers that provide a tabbed document interface= The following window managers provide a tabbed document interface: * i3 - Tiling window manager available for most Unix-like systems * Wmii - Tiling window manager that i3 is based on * PWM * Fluxbox * KWin - KDE SC's default window manager, since KDE 4.4 * Pie Menu Tab Window Manager for The NeWS Toolkit 2.0 (1991) * PekWM Patent dispute Adobe Systems holds patents in the United States and Europe on certain uses of GUI tabs, for a \\"Method of displaying multiple sets of information in the same area of a computer screen\\" which are widely held to be trivial patents. There was prior art, in both GUI and text user interfaces (TUI). Adobe used these patents to sue Macromedia Inc. for employing tabs in its Macromedia Flash product. Adobe won the case and $2.8 million in damages. However, Macromedia initiated a countersuit which ended in a $4.9 million ruling against Adobe. The suits were settled on undisclosed terms. In 2005, Adobe ended further dispute between the two companies when it bought Macromedia for roughly $3.4 billion.

For his victories, he was made Count of Yerevan in 1828 and Namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland in 1831. He attained the rank of field marshal in the Russian army, and later in the Prussian and Austrian armies. Biography Ivan Paskevich was born in Poltava on 19 May 1782, to a well-known family of Ukrainian Cossack gentry, he was educated at the Page Corps, where his progress was rapid, and in 1800 received his commission in the Guards and was named aide-de-camp to the tsar. His first active service was in 1805, in the auxiliary army sent to the assistance of Austria against France, when he took part in the Battle of Austerlitz, 2 December 1805, where Austrian ‚Äì Russian troops were defeated by the French under Napoleon. Portrait by Jan Ksawery Kaniewski in 1849 From 1807 to 1812, Ivan Paskevich was engaged in the campaigns against the Ottomans, and distinguished himself by many brilliant and daring exploits, being made a general officer in his thirtieth year. During the war with France in 1812‚Äì1814 he was present, in command of the 26th division of infantry, at all the most important engagements, and he won promotion to the rank of lieutenant general. Paskevich with Abbas Mirza at the signing of the Treaty of Turkmenchay, 1828 On the outbreak of Russo-Persian War (1826‚Äì28) in 1826 he was appointed second in command, and, in the spring of the following year he replaced Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov as chief command. Under his leadership, Echmiadzin and the Nakhichevan Khanate were conquered from the Persians. After the Persians unsuccessfully tried to recapture Echmiadzin, the tsar granted Paskevich the title of \\"Erivanskii\\" (Count of Yerevan), a million rubles and a diamond- mounted sword for his services. The Russo-Turkish War, 1828‚Äì1829 immediately followed and he successfully led the eastern or Caucasus front. For this he was made a Field Marshal at the age of forty-seven. In 1830, he was engaged in the Caucasian War on the territory of present-day Dagestan. At the same time he appointed the high-ranking Muslim cleric Mir-Fatah-Agha from Iran as head of the recently established Caucasus Committee. Paskevich hoped that by the help of Mir-Fattah's high stature in the Muslim community, he could make a very valuable contribution to the Russian consolidation of power in the Caucasus. Together with Mir-Fatah's high esteem among Muslims and his devised plans for the Caucasus, they managed to keep the entire Caucasus stable from rebellious Muslim insurrections for many years to come. Paskevich Palace in Homel, Belarus (as painted by Marcin Zaleski) In June 1831, after the death of Field Marshal von Diebitsch, commander of Russian troops in Congress Poland, Paskevich was appointed his successor in crushing the Polish uprising. His armies, following the decisive success of Diebitsch at the Battle of Ostro≈Çƒôka in May, advanced slowly, but Paskevich redeemed his reputation at the Battle of Warsaw, giving a death blow to Polish hopes of restoring independence. He was created Prince of Warsaw and awarded the office of Namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland. With the kingdom's autonomy limited by the Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland, the period under Namestnik Paskevich ‚Äì known in Poland as the \\"Paskevich Night\\" ‚Äì became infamous for political and economic repressions, as well as for Russification. Viceregal Palace, Warsaw, with statue of Ivan Paskevich, before 1900 On the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 he was appointed to command the Russian troops sent to aid Austria, and finally compelled the Hungarians' surrender at Vil√°gos. In 1854 Paskevich took command of the Army of the Danube, which was then engaging the Turks in the initial stage of the conflict which evolved into the Crimean War. Though he laid siege to Silistria, Paskevich advocated aborting the campaign due to Austria's threat to intervene in the war. On 9 June he suffered a combat injury and was compelled to return to Russia, handing command of the army to General Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov. Paskevich died in Warsaw, where in 1870 a memorial was erected to him before the Koniecpolski Palace. It was demolished in October 1917 by the Poles. His remains were reburied by his son in the family mausoleum on the grounds of the Homel Palace. His widow Irina died in 1925.

He has often been identified as one of the sources for the character of Kurtz in Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness. Life Barttelot was born in Petworth, Sussex, the second son of Sir Walter Barttelot, 1st Baronet and his first wife, Harriet Musgrave. He attended Sandhurst before receiving a commission in the 7th Regiment of Foot on 22 January 1879 at the age of 19. Barttelot served in the British Raj before fighting in the Second Anglo-Afghan War and the Anglo‚ÄìEgyptian War. During the Nile Expedition of 1884-85, he joined the Camel Corps on their march to Khartoum, and caused some controversy by shooting an Aden man who attempted to vandalise a waterskin and struck Barttelot with a stick. Barttelot was promoted to the rank of Captain on 8 September 1886 before being brevetted Major the following day in recognition of his service in Sudan. In 1886, he volunteered for Henry Morton Stanley's Emin Pasha Relief Expedition. As Stanley's second in command he was leader of the Rear Column which was left at Yambuya on the Aruwimi River to wait for more porters to be brought by the Arab slave trader Tippu Tip while Stanley marched on to reach Emin as soon as possible. During Stanley's absence, the Rear Column descended into confusion. Barttelot was unable to maintain discipline, and resorted to repeated floggings of Africans, a least two of whom died from the beatings. Large numbers of bearers died from malnutrition and untreated illness or deserted. Although the Rear Column finally received some of the Manyema porters, it had only got as far as Banalya when the Major threatened a woman with his revolver because she was beating a drum during a ceremony in the early hours of the morning. He was shot dead by the woman's husband, a man named Sanga or Samba.Jeal, T, Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Explorer, Yale University Press, 2007, p.357-8. Stanley received reports about Barttelot's behaviour from other officers. One, William Bonny, said that \\"the least thing caused the Major to behave like a fiend\\" and that he would repeatedly stab African workers with a steel-pointed cane, bit a woman, and tried to poison an Arab chief. Bonny's comments, however, have been regarded with scepticism by historians who have studied the expedition, on account of his habitual dishonesty, his doctoring of his old diary entries, and his opium addiction.Gould, Tony In Limbo: The Story of Stanley's Rear Column, Hamish Hamilton, 1979 Another officer, John Rose Troup, said that the Major \\"had an intense hatred of anything in the shape of a black man\\". His 13-year-old 'boy' named Sudi bin Bohati had been beaten and kicked by him. Stanley nursed the injured Sudi, who died six weeks after Stanley returned. Furious, Stanley mainly blamed Barttelot for the failure of the Rear Column, though he also criticised the other officers for allowing him to \\"kick, strike and slay human beings\\". After being sewn into a blanket, Barttelot's body was buried in the forest. Reputation After the return of expedition-members to Europe and America, Barttelot's alleged abusive and incompetent behaviour was widely reported. In response, Barttelot's brother, Walter George Barttelot edited the diaries of his brother, defending his reputation and adding some biting comments on Stanley's behaviour. Recent historians have generally accepted the negative assessment of Barttelot. Adam Hochschild writes that after being left in charge of the Rear Column, > Major Barttelot promptly lost his mind. He sent Stanley's personal baggage > down the river. He dispatched another officer on a bizarre three-thousand- > mile three-month round trip to the nearest telegraph station to send a > senseless telegram to England.

New York, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1998, pp. 98; 145, Barttelot has been portrayed as a source for Kurtz in Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness.Conrad, J, Heart of Darkness, second edition, Broadview Press, 16 Aug 1999, p.192ff.'Bloom, Harold (ed)Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Infobase Publishing, 1 Jan 2009, pp.35-6. Jerry Allen considered him the principal historical source, though Harold Bloom argued that there was no single source, and the many of Kurtz's actions were more likely to be based on Barttelot's contemporary Tippu Tip. Hochschild also considers him a likely source, since he \\"went mad, began hitting, whipping, and killing people, and was finally murdered\\", but also thinks that other participants in the expedition and contemporary figures contributed to the character. He appears as a character in Simon Gray's 1978 play The Rear Column, which tells the story of the men of the rear column left by Stanley to wait for Tippu Tip. He is portrayed as weak and unstable. Barttelot was played by Barry Foster in the original production and in the 1980 BBC television version.

This is in contrast to dehydration by most conventional methods that evaporate water using heat. Because of the low temperature used in processing, the quality of the rehydrated product is excellent, and the original shape of the product is maintained. Primary applications of freeze drying include biological (e.g., bacteria and yeasts), biomedical (e.g., surgical transplants), food processing (e.g., coffee) and preservation.  History  Freeze drying began as early as 1890 by Richard Altmann who devised a method to freeze dry tissues (either plant or animal), but went virtually unnoticed until the 1930s. In 1909, Shackell independently created the vacuum chamber by using an electrical pump. No further freeze drying information was documented until Tival in 1927 and Elser in 1934 had patented freeze drying systems with improvements to freezing and condenser steps. A significant turning point for freeze drying occurred during World War II. Blood plasma and penicillin were needed to treat the wounded in the field, and because of the lack of refrigerated transport, many serum supplies spoiled before reaching their recipients. The freeze-drying process was developed as a commercial technique that enabled blood plasma and penicillin to be rendered chemically stable and viable without refrigeration. In the 1950s‚Äì1960s, freeze drying began to be viewed as a multi-purpose tool for both pharmaceuticals and food processing. = Early uses in food = Freeze-dried foods became a major component of astronaut and military rations. What began for astronaut crews as tubed meals and freeze-dried snacks that were difficult to rehydrate, were transformed into hot meals in space by improving the process of rehydrating freeze-dried meals with water. As technology and food processing improved, NASA looked for ways to provide a complete nutrient profile while reducing crumbs, disease- producing bacteria, and toxins. The complete nutrient profile was improved with the addition of an algae-based vegetable-like oil to add polyunsaturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are beneficial in mental and vision development, and as it remains stable during space travel, can provide astronauts with its added benefits. The crumb problem was solved with the addition of a gelatin coating on the foods to lock in and prevent crumbs. Disease-producing bacteria and toxins were reduced by quality control and the development of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan, which is widely used today to evaluate food material before, during and after processing. With the combination of these three innovations, NASA could provide safe and wholesome foods to their crews from freeze-dried meals. Military rations have also come a long way, from being served spoiled pork and corn meal to beefsteak with mushroom gravy. How rations are chosen and developed are based on acceptance, nutrition, wholesomeness, producibility, cost, and sanitation. Additional requirements for rations include a minimum shelf life of three years, be deliverable by air, consumable in worldwide environments, and provide a complete nutritional profile. The new tray rations (T Rations) which has been improved upon by increasing acceptable items and provide high quality meals while in the field. Freeze-dried coffee was also incorporated by replacing spray-dried coffee in the meal, ready-to-eat category. Stages of freeze drying In a typical phase diagram, the boundary between gas and liquid runs from the triple point to the critical point. Freeze-drying (blue arrow) brings the system around the triple point, avoiding the direct liquid‚Äìgas transition seen in ordinary drying (green arrow). There are four stages in the complete freeze drying process: pretreatment, freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. =Pretreatment= Pretreatment includes any method of treating the product prior to freezing. This may include concentrating the product, formulation revision (i.e., addition of components to increase stability, preserve appearance, and/or improve processing), decreasing a high-vapor-pressure solvent, or increasing the surface area. Food pieces are often IQF treated to make them free flowing prior to freeze drying. In many instances the decision to pretreat a product is based on theoretical knowledge of freeze-drying and its requirements, or is demanded by cycle time or product quality considerations.J. Jeff Schwegman (2009) \\"Basic Cycle Development Techniques for Lyophilized Products\\". =Freezing and annealing= During the freezing stage, the material is cooled below its triple point, the lowest temperature at which the solid, liquid and gas phases of the material can coexist. This ensures that sublimation rather than melting will occur in the following steps. To facilitate faster and more efficient freeze drying, larger ice crystals are preferable. The large ice crystals form a network within the product which promotes faster removal of water vapor during sublimation. To produce larger crystals, the product should be frozen slowly or can be cycled up and down in temperature in a process called annealing. The freezing phase is the most critical in the whole freeze-drying process, as the freezing method can impact the speed of reconstitution, duration of freeze- drying cycle, product stability, and appropriate crystallization. Amorphous materials do not have a eutectic point, but they do have a critical point, below which the product must be maintained to prevent melt-back or collapse during primary and secondary drying.  Structurally sensitive goods  In the case of goods where preservation of structure is required, like food or objects with formerly-living cells, large ice crystals will break the cell walls which can result in increasingly poor texture and loss of nutritive content. In this case, the freezing is done rapidly, in order to lower the material to below its eutectic point quickly, thus avoiding the formation of large ice crystals. Usually, the freezing temperatures are between and . =Primary drying= During the primary drying phase, the pressure is lowered (to the range of a few millibars), and enough heat is supplied to the material for the ice to sublime. The amount of heat necessary can be calculated using the sublimating molecules' latent heat of sublimation. In this initial drying phase, about 95% of the water in the material is sublimated. This phase may be slow (can be several days in the industry), because, if too much heat is added, the material's structure could be altered. In this phase, pressure is controlled through the application of partial vacuum. The vacuum speeds up the sublimation, making it useful as a deliberate drying process. Furthermore, a cold condenser chamber and/or condenser plates provide a surface(s) for the water vapour to re-liquify and solidify on. It is important to note that, in this range of pressure, the heat is brought mainly by conduction or radiation; the convection effect is negligible, due to the low air density. =Secondary drying= A benchtop manifold freeze-drier The secondary drying phase aims to remove unfrozen water molecules, since the ice was removed in the primary drying phase. This part of the freeze-drying process is governed by the material's adsorption isotherms. In this phase, the temperature is raised higher than in the primary drying phase, and can even be above , to break any physico-chemical interactions that have formed between the water molecules and the frozen material. Usually the pressure is also lowered in this stage to encourage desorption (typically in the range of microbars, or fractions of a pascal). However, there are products that benefit from increased pressure as well. After the freeze-drying process is complete, the vacuum is usually broken with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, before the material is sealed. At the end of the operation, the final residual water content in the product is extremely low, around 1% to 4%.  Applications of freeze drying  Freeze- drying causes less damage to the substance than other dehydration methods using higher temperatures. Nutrient factors that are sensitive to heat are lost less in the process as compared to the processes incorporating heat treatment for drying purposes. Freeze-drying does not usually cause shrinkage or toughening of the material being dried. In addition, flavours, smells, and nutritional content generally remain unchanged, making the process popular for preserving food. However, water is not the only chemical capable of sublimation, and the loss of other volatile compounds such as acetic acid (vinegar) and alcohols can yield undesirable results. Freeze-dried products can be rehydrated (reconstituted) much more quickly and easily because the process leaves microscopic pores. The pores are created by the ice crystals that sublimate, leaving gaps or pores in their place. This is especially important when it comes to pharmaceutical uses. Freeze-drying can also be used to increase the shelf life of some pharmaceuticals for many years. =Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology= Lyophilized 5% w/v sucrose cake in a pharmaceutical glass vial Pharmaceutical companies often use freeze-drying to increase the shelf life of the products, such as live virus vaccines, biologics and other injectables. By removing the water from the material and sealing the material in a glass vial, the material can be easily stored, shipped, and later reconstituted to its original form for injection. Another example from the pharmaceutical industry is the use of freeze drying to produce tablets or wafers, the advantage of which is less excipient as well as a rapidly absorbed and easily administered dosage form. Freeze-dried pharmaceutical products are produced as lyophilized powders for reconstitution in vials and more recently in prefilled syringes for self-administration by a patient. Examples of lyophilized biological products include many vaccines such as live measles virus vaccine, typhoid vaccine, and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine groups A and C combined. Other freeze-dried biological products include antihemophilic factor VIII, interferon alfa, anti-blood clot medicine streptokinase, and wasp venom allergenic extract. Many bio- pharmaceutical products based on therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies require lyophilization for stability. Examples of lyophilized biopharmaceuticals include blockbuster drugs such as etanercept (Enbrel by Amgen), infliximab (Remicade by Janssen Biotech), rituximab, and trastuzumab (Herceptin by Genentech). Freeze-drying is also used in manufacturing of raw materials for pharmaceutical products. Active Pharmaceutical Product Ingredients (APIs) are lyophilized to achieve chemical stability under room temperature storage. Bulk lyophilization of APIs is typically conducted using trays instead of glass vials. Cell extracts that support cell-free biotechnology applications such as point-of-care diagnostics and biomanufacturing are also freeze-dried to improve stability under room temperature storage. Dry powders of probiotics are often produced by bulk freeze-drying of live microorganisms such as lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. = Freeze drying of food = Freeze dried bacon bars Freeze- dried coffee, a form of instant coffee Freeze-dried Bulgarian apricot, melon, meatball soup, tarator Freeze dried ice cream and chocolate, and spaghetti with bacon The primary purpose of freeze drying within the food industry is to extend the shelf-life of the food while maintaining the quality. Freeze-drying is known to result in the highest quality of foods amongst all drying techniques because structural integrity is maintained along with preservation of flavors. Because freeze drying is expensive, it is used mainly with high- value products. Examples of high-value freeze-dried products are seasonal fruits and vegetables because of their limited availability, coffee; and foods used for military rations, astronauts/cosmonauts, and/or hikers.  NASA and military rations  Because of its light weight per volume of reconstituted food, freeze-dried products are popular and convenient for hikers, as military rations, or astronaut meals. A greater amount of dried food can be carried compared to the same weight of wet food. In replacement of wet food, freeze dried food can easily be rehydrated with water if desired and shelf-life of the dried product is longer than fresh/wet product making it ideal for long trips taken by hikers, military personnel, or astronauts. The development of freeze drying increased meal and snack variety to include items like shrimp cocktail, chicken and vegetables, butterscotch pudding, and apple sauce.  Coffee  Coffee contains flavor and aroma qualities that are created due to the Maillard reaction during roasting and can be preserved with freeze-drying. Compared to other drying methods like room temperature drying, hot-air drying, and solar drying, Robusta coffee beans that were freeze-dried contained higher amounts of essential amino acids like leucine, lysine, and phenylalanine. Also, few non-essential amino acids that significantly contributed to taste were preserved. Freeze-dried strawberries  Fruits  With conventional dehydration, berries can degrade in quality as their structure is very delicate and contains high levels of moisture. Strawberries were found to have the highest quality when freeze dried; retaining color, flavour, and ability to be re-hydrated.  Insects  Freeze-drying is used extensively to preserve insects for the purposes of consumption. Whole freeze-dried insects are sold as exotic pet food, bird feed, fish bait, and increasingly for human consumption. Powdered freeze-dried insects are used as a protein base in animal feeds, and in some markets, as a nutritional supplement for human use. Farmed insects are generally used for all of the aforementioned purposes versus harvesting wild insects, except in the case of grasshoppers which are often harvested out of field crops. =Technological industry= In chemical synthesis, products are often freeze-dried to make them more stable, or easier to dissolve in water for subsequent use. In bioseparations, freeze-drying can be used also as a late-stage purification procedure, because it can effectively remove solvents. Furthermore, it is capable of concentrating substances with low molecular weights that are too small to be removed by a filtration membrane. Freeze-drying is a relatively expensive process. The equipment is about three times as expensive as the equipment used for other separation processes, and the high energy demands lead to high energy costs. Furthermore, freeze-drying also has a long process time, because the addition of too much heat to the material can cause melting or structural deformations. Therefore, freeze-drying is often reserved for materials that are heat- sensitive, such as proteins, enzymes, microorganisms, and blood plasma. The low operating temperature of the process leads to minimal damage of these heat-sensitive products. In nanotechnology, freeze-drying is used for nanotube purification to avoid aggregation due to capillary forces during regular thermal vaporization drying. = Taxidermy = Freeze-drying is among the methods used to preserve animals in the field of taxidermy. When animals are preserved in this manner they are called \\"freeze-dried taxidermy\\" or \\"freeze- dried mounts\\". Freeze-drying is commonly used to preserve crustaceans, fish, amphibians, reptiles, insects, and smaller mammals. Freeze-drying is also used as a means to memorialize pets after death. Rather than opting for a traditional skin mount when choosing to preserve their pet via taxidermy, many owners opt for freeze-drying because it is less invasive upon the pet's body. =Other uses= Organizations such as the Document Conservation Laboratory at the United States National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) have done studies on freeze-drying as a recovery method of water-damaged books and documents. While recovery is possible, restoration quality depends on the material of the documents. If a document is made of a variety of materials, which have different absorption properties, expansion will occur at a non- uniform rate, which could lead to deformations. Water can also cause mold to grow or make inks bleed. In these cases, freeze-drying may not be an effective restoration method. In bacteriology freeze-drying is used to conserve special strains. Advanced ceramics processes sometimes use freeze-drying to create a formable powder from a sprayed slurry mist. Freeze-drying creates softer particles with a more homogeneous chemical composition than traditional hot spray drying, but it is also more expensive. A new form of burial which previously freeze-dries the body with liquid nitrogen has been developed by the Swedish company Promessa Organic AB, which puts it forward as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional casket and cremation burials.  Advantages  Freeze-drying is viewed as the optimal method of choice for dehydration because of the preservation of quality, meaning characteristics of the food product such as aroma, rehydration, and bioactivity, are noticeably higher compared to foods dried using other techniques. = Shelf-life extension = Shelf-life extension is a result from low processing temperatures in conjunction with rapid transition of water through sublimation. With these processing conditions, deterioration reactions, including nonenzymatic browning, enzymatic browning, and protein denaturation, are minimized. When the product is successfully dried, packaged properly, and placed in ideal storage conditions the foods have a shelf life of greater than 12 months. = Re-hydration = If a dried product cannot be easily or fully re-hydrated, it is considered to be of lower quality. Because the final freeze dried product is porous, complete re-hydration can occur in the food. This signifies greater quality of the product and makes it ideal for ready-to-eat instant meals. = Effect on nutrients and sensory quality = Due to the low processing temperatures and the minimization of deterioration reactions, nutrients are retained and color is maintained. Freeze-dried fruit maintains its original shape and has a characteristic soft crispy texture.  Disadvantages  = Microbial growth = Since the main method of microbial decontamination for freeze drying is the low temperature dehydration process, spoilage organisms and pathogens resistant to these conditions can remain in the product. Although microbial growth is inhibited by the low moisture conditions, it can still survive in the food product. An example of this is a hepatitis A outbreak that occurred in the United States in 2016, associated with frozen strawberries. If the product is not properly packaged and/or stored, the product can absorb moisture, allowing the once inhibited pathogens to begin reproducing as well. = Cost = Freeze-drying costs about five times as much as conventional drying, so it is most suitable for products which increase in value with processing. Costs are also variable depending on the product, the packaging material, processing capacity, etc. The most energy-intensive step is sublimation. = Silicone oil leakage = Silicone oil is the common fluid that is used to heat or cool shelves in the freeze- dryer. The continuous heat/cool cycle can lead to a leakage of silicone oil at weak areas that connect the shelf and hose. This can contaminate the product leading to major losses of food product. Hence, to avoid this issue, mass spectrometers are used to identify vapors released by silicone oil to immediately take corrective action and prevent contamination of the product. Equipment and types of freeze dryers Unloading trays of freeze-dried material from a small cabinet-type freeze-dryer There are many types of freeze-dryers available, however, they usually contain a few essential components. These are a vacuum chamber, shelves, process condenser, shelf- fluid system, refrigeration system, vacuum system, and control system. = Function of essential components =  Chamber  The chamber is highly polished and contains insulation, internally. It is manufactured with stainless steel and contains multiple shelves for holding the product. A hydraulic or electric motor is in place to ensure the door is vacuum-tight when closed.  Process condenser  The process condenser consists of refrigerated coils or plates that can be external or internal to the chamber. During the drying process, the condenser traps water. For increased efficiency, the condenser temperature should be less than the product during primary drying and have a defrosting mechanism to ensure that the maximum amount of water vapor in the air is condensed.  Shelf fluid  The amount of heat energy needed at times of the primary and secondary drying phase is regulated by an external heat exchanger. Usually, silicone oil is circulated around the system with a pump.  Refrigeration system  This system works to cool shelves and the process condenser by using compressors or liquid nitrogen, which will supply energy necessary for the product to freeze.  Vacuum system  During the drying process, a vacuum of 50-100 microbar is applied, by the vacuum system, to remove the solvent. A two-stage rotary vacuum pump is used, however, if the chamber is large then multiple pumps are needed. This system compresses non-condensable gases through the condenser.  Control system  Finally, the control system sets up controlled values for shelf temperature, pressure and time that are dependent on the product and/or the process. The freeze-dryer can run for a few hours or days depending on the product. = Contact freeze dryers = Contact freeze dryers use contact (conduction) of the food with the heating element to supply the sublimation energy. This type of freeze dryer is a basic model that is simple to set up for sample analysis. One of the major ways contact freeze dryers heat is with shelf-like platforms contacting the samples. The shelves play a major role as they behave like heat exchangers at different times of the freeze-drying process. They are connected to a silicone oil system that will remove heat energy during freezing and provide energy during drying times. Additionally, the shelf-fluid system works to provide specific temperatures to the shelves during drying by pumping a fluid (usually silicone oil) at low pressure. The downside to this type of freeze dryer is that the heat is only transferred from the heating element to the side of the sample immediately touching the heater. This problem can be minimized by maximizing the surface area of the sample touching the heating element by using a ribbed tray, slightly compressing the sample between two solid heated plates above and below, or compressing with a heated mesh from above and below. = Radiant freeze dryers = Radiant freeze dryers use infrared radiation to heat the sample in the tray. This type of heating allows for simple flat trays to be used as an infrared source can be located above the flat trays to radiate downwards onto the product. Infrared radiation heating allows for a very uniform heating of the surface of the product, but has very little capacity for penetration so it is used mostly with very shallow trays and homogeneous sample matrices. = Microwave-assisted freeze dryers = Microwave-assisted freeze dryers utilize microwaves to allow for deeper penetration into the sample to expedite the sublimation and heating processes in freeze-drying. This method can be very complicated to set up and run as the microwaves can create an electrical field capable of causing gases in the sample chamber to become plasma. This plasma could potentially burn the sample, so maintaining a microwave strength appropriate for the vacuum levels is imperative. The rate of sublimation in a product can affect the microwave impedance, in which power of the microwave must be changed accordingly.

The more common of the two, the StuG III, was built on the chassis of the proven Panzer III. The StuG III was initially designated \\"StuG\\" but with the creation of the StuG IV it was re-designated the \\"StuG III\\" to distinguish the two. Initially, they were intended as armored self-propelled guns providing close fire support to the infantry to destroy bunkers, pillboxes and other entrenched positions. Initially a secondary capability, employment as an anti- tank weapon became more important as the war progressed. Following the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, a significant problem developed when it was discovered that the main armament on the Panzer II and III tanks were inadequate to deal with the newer Soviet T-34 and KV-1 tanks. The main German anti-tank gun, the 37 mm Pak 36, also proved unable to penetrate the armor of these Soviet designs. A more powerful gun, the 75 mm Pak 40, was being developed, but it didn't fit in the turret of the Panzer III, Germany's primary medium tank at the time. It was found, however, that the turretless StuGs had enough room in the crew compartment to handle the 75 mm Pak 40, and this modification was made. The new vehicle proved to be an effective tank destroyer. Not only was its main gun powerful enough to knock out the new Soviet tanks, but the Panzer III chassis on which it was based was highly mobile and reliable, and the increased armor plating combined with its low silhouette made it a difficult vehicle to destroy. The StuG III became Nazi Germany's most produced armored fighting vehicle during World War II, with some 10,000 examples produced. The StuG was used primarily within the Sturmartillerie, a branch of the artillery in the Wehrmacht.  Development history  Alkett production plant Following the defeat of the German Empire in World War I, military commanders from the Reichswehr began to consider how mobile armored artillery units could provide support to advancing infantry units. Colonel Erich von Manstein recommended the concept of infantry Begleitbatterien (escort batteries) to General Beck, chief of the general staff in 1935.Liddell Hart p.63 Manstein theorized the vehicle would not be used as one uses a tank, but rather as an infantry support vehicle to destroy fortified objectives through direct fire.\\"Sturmgesch√ºtz: StuG III, StuH and StuG IV\\" Wargamer. Retrieved Sep. 19, 2010. Its mission was to destroy prepared defensive works, pill boxes, machine gun emplacements and tanks. It was not intended to be used to exploit breakthroughs and drive into the enemy rear areas, as the Panzertruppen units were intended to do. =StuG III= Daimler-Benz AG was given the order to develop and produce such a weapon on June 15, 1936. They created five prototypes, based on the chassis of the Panzer III, which were not useful for combat operations but did prove valuable for training.\\"Sturmgesch√ºtz III/IV\\" Achtung Panzer!. Retrieved Sep. 19, 2010. The first production units, the Sturmgesch√ºtz III Ausf A, arrived in 1940 mounted with the short barreled 75 mm StuK 37L/24 gun and increased frontal hull armor (from 30 mm to 50 mm). The main armament, which had a limited lateral traverse, was mounted directly in a casemate-style hull. This created the lowest possible profile in order to reduce the vehicle's height, making the StuG more difficult to hit and easier to protect in hull defilade.  Combat use  A StuG in action during the First Battle of Kharkov, Oct 1941 British troops inspect captured German equipment, including a StuG IV and a StuG III A StuG III in Normandy In 1942 and 1943 the StuG was one of the most effective tracked fighting vehicles fielded by the belligerents, in terms of enemy vehicles destroyed. Over 10,000 StuGs were eventually produced. The omission of a regular tank turret made for simpler and more cost-effective production, enabling greater numbers to be built. However, the lack of a traverse movement in the gun meant the entire vehicle had to be turned left or right to acquire targets, which proved to be a significant weakness at times. The StuG was more successful in defensive roles, such as ambush, rather than as an offensive vehicle. The lack of an internal light machine gun in early models left the StuG vulnerable to close-range infantry attack. A machine gun and shield were added to later versions. =StuG IV= In November 1943, Alkett, GmbH, a major StuG III manufacturer, was bombed as part of the RAF campaign against Berlin, and Alkett's StuG production declined from 255 StuG IIIs in October 1943, to just 24 vehicles in December. In a December 1943 conference, Hitler welcomed the suggestion of taking the StuG III superstructure and mounting it on a Panzer IV chassis to offset the loss of production of the StuG III. This restarted the Sturmgesch√ºtz IV project, which had earlier been considered and rejected. The superstructure of the StuG III Ausf. G was mounted on a Panzer IV chassis 7. The Krupp plant, which did not produce Panzer IIIs, used the Panzer IV chassis with a modified StuG III superstructure, with a box compartment for the driver added. Combat weight was 23 tonnes, lighter than the 23.9 tonnes for the StuG III Ausf. G. On December 16‚Äì17, 1943, Hitler was shown the StuG IV, and approved it. To make up for the large deficit in StuG III production, StuG IV production received full support. = Broadened use = Because of the decreased costs and ease of production, the Germans began to use the StuGs to replace standard tank losses.Sturmgeschutz III/IV at Achtung Panzer website They were used in this fashion as German losses of all types of armored vehicles now exceeded production. The StuGs proved effective in a defensive role, but were a poor substitute for conventional tanks offensively. Thus the panzer regiments continued to be equipped with Panzer IV and Panther medium tanks for offensive operations. Meanwhile, heavier armed tank destroyers were developed, such as the Jagdpanzer IV and the Jagdpanther, which combined the low silhouette of the StuG with the heavier armament of the Panther and Tiger II tanks, respectively. Still, the StuG III was an effective armored fighting vehicle long after the Panzer III had been retired as a main battle tank. = Post-war usr = A number of captured StuGs were refurbished in the Soviet Union and given to Syria, along with some Panzer IVs, where they were used briefly against Israel. A captured Syrian Panzer IV and StuG III are on display at the Armor Museum in Israel. The StuG was also used in Finland post-war where one unit even mixed StuGs and British turreted 'Charioteer' tank destroyers. A Finnish StuG (posing as a German one) appears in the movie The Eagle Has Landed, and ex-Finnish StuGs have since turned up in British war museums. The Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset has one painted in Finnish markings. The Imperial War Museum's Duxford site also has an ex-Finland StuG but its markings are more ambiguous. Another StuG III, in the possession of The Wheatcroft Collection, is awaiting restoration.

He is said to have defeated the Flemish near Heemstede with the help of the Haarlemmers at the site of the Manpad. In 1817 Mr. David Jacob van Lennep, who lived in the stately house called Huis te Manpad next to the Manpad, encouraged the Heemstede council to erect a monument. Van Lennep had already composed a romantic song about Witte van Haemstede that was quite popular.

In this picture, the flaps are extended; note also the extended leading edge slats. A flap is a high-lift device used to reduce the stalling speed of an aircraft wing at a given weight. Flaps are usually mounted on the wing trailing edges of a fixed-wing aircraft. Flaps are used to reduce the take-off distance and the landing distance. Flaps also cause an increase in drag so they are retracted when not needed. The flaps installed on most aircraft are partial-span flaps; spanwise from near the wing root to the inboard end of the ailerons. When partial-span flaps are extended they alter the spanwise lift distribution on the wing by causing the inboard half of the wing to supply an increased proportion of the lift, and the outboard half to supply a reduced proportion of the lift. Reducing the proportion of the lift supplied by the outboard half of the wing is accompanied by a reduction in the angle of attack on the outboard half. This is beneficial because it increases the margin above the stall of the outboard half, maintaining aileron effectiveness and reducing the likelihood of asymmetric stall, and spinning. Extending the wing flaps increases the camber or curvature of the wing, raising the maximum lift coefficient or the upper limit to the lift a wing can generate. This allows the aircraft to generate the required lift at a lower speed, reducing the minimum speed (known as stall speed) at which the aircraft will safely maintain flight. The increase in camber also increases the wing drag, which can be beneficial during approach and landing, because it allows the aircraft to descend at a steeper angle. For most aircraft configurations, a useful side effect of flap deployment is a decrease in aircraft pitch angle which lowers the nose thereby improving the pilot's view of the runway over the nose of the aircraft during landing. Another side effect however, depending on the type of flap, location on the wing and deployment speed during their extension, is that the flaps will cause the indicated (or relative to the unchanged airfoil) angle of attack to lower within a short time due to an increase in nose-down pitching moment which is characteristic to all trailing-edge flaps, as well as leading-edge flaps, then followed by a nose rise (pitch-up) due to the increase in lift, thus obscuring the pilot's view of the runway if no action is taken over the pitch inputs. There are many different designs of flaps, with the specific choice depending on the size, speed and complexity of the aircraft on which they are to be used, as well as the era in which the aircraft was designed. Plain flaps, slotted flaps, and Fowler flaps are the most common. Krueger flaps are positioned on the leading edge of the wings and are used on many jet airliners. The Fowler, Fairey-Youngman and Gouge types of flap increase the wing area in addition to changing the camber. The larger lifting surface reduces wing loading, hence further reducing the stalling speed. Some flaps are fitted elsewhere. Leading-edge flaps form the wing leading edge and when deployed they rotate down to increase the wing camber. The de Havilland DH.88 Comet racer had flaps running beneath the fuselage and forward of the wing trailing edge. Many of the Waco Custom Cabin series biplanes have the flaps at mid-chord on the underside of the top wing. Principles of operation The general airplane lift equation demonstrates these relationships:Perkins, Courtland; Hage, Robert (1949). Airplane performance, stability and control, Chapter 2, John Wiley and Sons. . :L = \\\\tfrac12 \\\\rho V^2 S C_L where: * L is the amount of Lift produced, * \\\\rho is the air density, * V is the true airspeed of the airplane or the Velocity of the airplane, relative to the air * S is the area of the wing * C_L is the lift coefficient, which is determined by the shape of the airfoil used and the angle at which the wing meets the air (or angle of attack). Here, it can be seen that increasing the area (S) and lift coefficient (C_L) allow a similar amount of lift to be generated at a lower airspeed (V). fairings streamlining the flap track mechanisms. The flaps (two on each side, on the Airbus A319) lie directly above these. Extending the flaps also increases the drag coefficient of the aircraft. Therefore, for any given weight and airspeed, flaps increase the drag force. Flaps increase the drag coefficient of an aircraft due to higher induced drag caused by the distorted spanwise lift distribution on the wing with flaps extended. Some flaps increase the wing area and, for any given speed, this also increases the parasitic drag component of total drag. Thus, flaps are extensively in use for short takeoffs and landings (STOL). = Flaps during takeoff = Cessna 172RG with undercarriage retracting and Fowler flaps set to 10¬∞ for a short-field take- off Depending on the aircraft type, flaps may be partially extended for takeoff. When used during takeoff, flaps trade runway distance for climb rate: using flaps reduces ground roll but also reduces the climb rate. The amount of flap used on takeoff is specific to each type of aircraft, and the manufacturer will suggest limits and may indicate the reduction in climb rate to be expected. The Cessna 172S Pilot Operating Handbook generally recommends 10¬∞ of flaps on takeoff, especially when the ground is rough or soft.Cessna Aircraft Company. Cessna Model 172S Nav III. Revision 3-12, 2006, pp. 4‚Äì19 to 4‚Äì47. = Flaps during landing = Flaps during ground roll after landing, with spoilers up, increasing drag. North American T-6 trainer, showing its split flaps Flaps may be fully extended for landing to give the aircraft a lower stall speed so the approach to landing can be flown more slowly, which also allows the aircraft to land in a shorter distance. The higher lift and drag associated with fully extended flaps allows a steeper and slower approach to the landing site, but imposes handling difficulties in aircraft with very low wing loading (i.e. having little weight and a large wing area). Winds across the line of flight, known as crosswinds, cause the windward side of the aircraft to generate more lift and drag, causing the aircraft to roll, yaw and pitch off its intended flight path, and as a result many light aircraft land with reduced flap settings in crosswinds. Furthermore, once the aircraft is on the ground, the flaps may decrease the effectiveness of the brakes since the wing is still generating lift and preventing the entire weight of the aircraft from resting on the tires, thus increasing stopping distance, particularly in wet or icy conditions. Usually, the pilot will raise the flaps as soon as possible to prevent this from occurring. = Maneuvering flaps = Some gliders not only use flaps when landing, but also in flight to optimize the camber of the wing for the chosen speed. While thermalling, flaps may be partially extended to reduce the stall speed so that the glider can be flown more slowly and thereby reduce the rate of sink, which lets the glider use the rising air of the thermal more efficiently, and to turn in a smaller circle to make best use of the core of the thermal. At higher speeds a negative flap setting is used to reduce the nose-down pitching moment. This reduces the balancing load required on the horizontal stabilizer, which in turn reduces the trim drag associated with keeping the glider in longitudinal trim. Negative flap may also be used during the initial stage of an aerotow launch and at the end of the landing run in order to maintain better control by the ailerons. Like gliders, some fighters such as the Nakajima Ki-43 also use special flaps to improve maneuverability during air combat, allowing the fighter to create more lift at a given speed, allowing for much tighter turns.Windrow 1965, p. 4. The flaps used for this must be designed specifically to handle the greater stresses and most flaps have a maximum speed at which they can be deployed. Control line model aircraft built for precision aerobatics competition usually have a type of maneuvering flap system that moves them in an opposing direction to the elevators, to assist in tightening the radius of a maneuver. = Flap tracks = Extending flaps often run on guide tracks. Where these run outside the wing structure they may be faired in to streamline them and protect them from damage. Some flap track fairings are designed to act as anti-shock bodies, which reduce drag caused by local sonic shock waves where the airflow becomes transonic at high speeds. =Thrust gates= Thrust gates, or gaps, in the trailing edge flaps may be required to minimise interference between the engine flow and deployed flaps. In the absence of an inboard aileron, which provides a gap in many flap installations, a modified flap section may be needed. The thrust gate on the Boeing 757 was provided by a single-slotted flap in between the inboard and outboard double-slotted flaps. The A320, A330, A340 and A380 have no inboard aileron. No thrust gate is required in the continuous, single-slotted flap. Interference in the go-around case while the flaps are still fully deployed can cause increased drag which must not compromise the climb gradient. Types of flap Flaps and high lift devices. Gurney flap exaggerated for clarity. Blown flap skipped as it is modified from any other type. Pale lines indicate line of movement, and green indicates flap setting used during dive.  The rear portion of airfoil rotates downwards on a simple hinge mounted at the front of the flap.Gunston 2004, p. 452. The Royal Aircraft Factory and National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom tested flaps in 1913 and 1914, but these were never installed in an actual aircraft.Taylor 1974, pp. 8‚Äì9. In 1916, the Fairey Aviation Company made a number of improvements to a Sopwith Baby they were rebuilding, including their Patent Camber Changing Gear, making the Fairey Hamble Baby as they renamed it, the first aircraft to fly with flaps. These were full span plain flaps which incorporated ailerons, making it also the first instance of flaperons. Fairey were not alone however, as Breguet soon incorporated automatic flaps into the lower wing of their Breguet 14 reconnaissance/bomber in 1917. Owing to the greater efficiency of other flap types, the plain flap is normally only used where simplicity is required.  The rear portion of the lower surface of the airfoil hinges downwards from the leading edge of the flap, while the upper surface stays immobile.Gunston 2004, p. 584. This can cause large changes in longitudinal trim, pitching the nose either down or up. At full deflection, a split flaps acts much like a spoiler, adding significantly to drag coefficient. It also adds a little to lift coefficient. It was invented by Orville Wright and James M. H. Jacobs in 1920, but only became common in the 1930s and was then quickly superseded. The Douglas DC-1 (progenitor to the DC-3 and C-47) was one of the first of many aircraft types to use split flaps.  A gap between the flap and the wing forces high pressure air from below the wing over the flap helping the airflow remain attached to the flap, increasing lift compared to a split flap.Gunston 2004, p. 569. Additionally, lift across the entire chord of the primary airfoil is greatly increased as the velocity of air leaving its trailing edge is raised, from the typical non-flap 80% of freestream, to that of the higher-speed, lower-pressure air flowing around the leading edge of the slotted flap. Any flap that allows air to pass between the wing and the flap is considered a slotted flap. The slotted flap was a result of research at Handley-Page, a variant of the slot that dates from the 1920s, but was not widely used until much later. Some flaps use multiple slots to further boost the effect.  A split flap that slides backwards, before hinging downward, thereby increasing first chord, then camber.Gunston 2004, p. 249‚Äì250. The flap may form part of the upper surface of the wing, like a plain flap, or it may not, like a split flap, but it must slide rearward before lowering. As a defining feature ‚Äì distinguishing it from the Gouge Flap ‚Äì it always provides a slot effect. Invented by Harlan D. Fowler in 1924, and tested by Fred Weick at NACA in 1932. They were first used on the Martin 146 prototype in 1935, and in production on the 1937 Lockheed Super Electra, and are still in widespread use on modern aircraft, often with multiple slots. =Junkers flap= A slotted plain flap fixed below the trailing edge of the wing, and rotating about its forward edge.Gunston 2004, p. 331. When not in use, it has more drag than other types, but is more effective at creating additional lift than a plain or split flap, while retaining their mechanical simplicity. Invented by Otto Mader at Junkers in the late 1920s, they were most often seen on the Junkers Ju 52 and the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka, though the same basic design can also be found on many modern ultralights, like the Denney Kitfox. This type of flap is sometimes referred to as an external- airfoil flap. =Gouge flap= A type of split flap that slides backward along curved tracks that force the trailing edge downward, increasing chord and camber without affecting trim or requiring any additional mechanisms.Gunston 2004, p. 270. It was invented by Arthur Gouge for Short Brothers in 1936 and used on the Short Empire and Sunderland flying boats, which used the very thick Shorts A.D.5 airfoil. Short Brothers may have been the only company to use this type.  Drops down (becoming a Junkers Flap) before sliding aft and then rotating up or down. Fairey was one of the few exponents of this design, which was used on the Fairey Firefly and Fairey Barracuda. When in the extended position, it could be angled up (to a negative angle of incidence) so that the aircraft could be dived vertically without needing excessive trim changes.  Commonly, but incorrectly, called the Zapp flap, it was invented by Edward F. Zaparka while he was with Berliner/Joyce and tested on a General Airplanes Corporation Aristocrat in 1932 and on other types periodically thereafter, but it saw little use on production aircraft other than on the Northrop P-61 Black Widow. The leading edge of the flap is mounted on a track, while a point at mid chord on the flap is connected via an arm to a pivot just above the track. When the flap's leading edge moves aft along the track, the triangle formed by the track, the shaft and the surface of the flap (fixed at the pivot) gets narrower and deeper, forcing the flap down. =Krueger flap= A hinged flap which folds out from under the wing's leading edge while not forming a part of the leading edge of the wing when retracted. This increases the camber and thickness of the wing, which in turn increases lift and drag. This is not the same as a leading edge droop flap, as that is formed from the entire leading edge.Gunston 2004, p. 335. Invented by Werner Kr√ºger in 1943 and evaluated in Goettingen, Krueger flaps are found on many modern swept wing airliners. =Gurney flap= A small fixed perpendicular tab of between 1 and 2% of the wing chord, mounted on the high pressure side of the trailing edge of an airfoil. It was named for racing car driver Dan Gurney who rediscovered it in 1971, and has since been used on some helicopters such as the Sikorsky S-76B to correct control problems without having to resort to a major redesign. It boosts the efficiency of even basic theoretical airfoils (made up of a triangle and a circle overlapped) to the equivalent of a conventional airfoil. The principle was discovered in the 1930s, but was rarely used and was then forgotten. Late marks of the Supermarine Spitfire used a bead on the trailing edge of the elevators, which functioned in a similar manner.  The entire leading edge of the wing rotates downward, effectively increasing camber and also slightly reducing chord.Clancy 1975, pp. 110‚Äì112.Gunston 2004, p. 191. Most commonly found on fighters with very thin wings unsuited to other leading edge high lift devices. =Blown flap= A type of Boundary Layer Control System, blown flaps pass engine-generated air or exhaust over the flaps to increase lift beyond that attainable with mechanical flaps. Types include the original (internally blown flap) which blows compressed air from the engine over the top of the flap, the externally blown flap, which blows engine exhaust over the upper and lower surfaces of the flap, and upper surface blowing which blows engine exhaust over the top of the wing and flap. While testing was done in Britain and Germany before the Second World War, and flight trials started, the first production aircraft with blown flaps wasn't until the 1957 Lockheed T2V SeaStar.American Military Training Aircraft' E.R. Johnson and Lloyd S. Jones, McFarland & Co. Inc. Publishers, Jefferson, North Carolina Upper Surface Blowing was used on the Boeing YC-14 in 1976. =Flexible flap= Also known as the FlexFoil. A modern interpretation of wing warping, internal mechanical actuators bend a lattice that changes the airfoil shape. It may have a flexible gap seal at the transition between fixed and flexible airfoils. =Flaperon= A type of aircraft control surface that combines the functions of both flaps and ailerons. = Continuous trailing-edge flap = As of 2014, U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) researchers at NASA's Langley Research Center developed an active-flap design for helicopter rotor blades. The Continuous Trailing-Edge Flap (CTEF) uses components to change blade camber during flight, eliminating mechanical hinges in order to improve system reliability. Prototypes were constructed for wind-tunnel testing. A team from ARL completed a live-fire test of a rotor blade with individual blade control technology in January 2016. The live fire experiments explored the ballistic vulnerability of blade control technologies. Researchers fired three shots representative of typical ground fire on a 7-foot-span, 10-inch-chord rotor blade section with a 4-foot- long CTEF at ARL's Airbase Experimental Facility. =Related devices= * Leading edge slats and slots are mounted on the top of the wings' leading edge and while they may be either fixed or retractable, when deployed they provide a slot or gap under the slat to force air against the top of the wing, which is absent on a Krueger flap. They offer excellent lift and enhance controllability at low speeds. Leading edge slats allow the wing to fly at a higher angle of attack which decrease takeoff and landing distances. Other types of flaps may be equipped with one or more slots to increase their effectiveness, a typical setup on many modern airliners. These are known as slotted flaps as described above. Frederick Handley Page experimented with fore and aft slot designs in the 20s and 30s. * Spoilers are intended to create drag and reduce lift by \\"spoiling\\" the airflow over the wing. A spoiler is much larger than a Gurney flap, and can be retracted. Spoilers are usually installed mid chord on the upper surface of the wing, but may also be installed on the lower surface of the wing as well. * Air brakes are used to increase drag, allowing the aircraft to decelerate rapidly. When installed on the wings they differ from flaps and spoilers in that they are not intended to modify the lift and are built strongly enough to be deployed at much higher speeds. * Ailerons are similar to flaps (and work the same way), but are intended to provide lateral control, rather than to change the lifting characteristics of both wings together, and so operate differentially ‚Äì when an aileron on one wing increases the lift, the opposite aileron does not, and will often work to decrease lift. When ailerons are designed to lower in conjunction with flaps, they are usually called flaperons, while those that spoil lift (typically placed on the upper surface before the trailing edge) they are called spoilerons.

It is native to temperate and tropical East Asia, South Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, and parts of the Russian Far East. It was also found in the Pacific Northwest of North America in late 2019, USDA New Pest Response Guidelines: Vespa mandarinia Asian giant hornet with a few more additional sightings in 2020. They prefer to live in low mountains and forests, while almost completely avoiding plains and high-altitude climates. V. mandarinia creates nests by digging, co-opting pre-existing tunnels dug by rodents, or occupying spaces near rotted pine roots. It feeds primarily on larger insects, colonies of other eusocial insects, tree sap, and honey from honey bee colonies. The hornet has a body length of , a wingspan around , and a stinger long, which injects a large amount of potent venom. The Asian giant hornet is often confused with the yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina), also known as the Asian hornet, an invasive species of major concern across Europe, including the UK.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  V. mandarinia is a species in the genus Vespa, which comprises all true hornets. Along with seven other species, V. mandarinia is a part of the V. tropica species group, defined by the single notch located on the apical margin of the seventh gastral sternum of the male. The most closely related species within the species group is V. soror. The triangular shape of the apical margin of the clypeus of the female is diagnostic, the vertex of both species is enlarged, and the shape of the apex of the aedeagus is distinct and similar. Division of the genus into subgenera has been attempted in the past, but has been abandoned, due to the anatomical similarity among species and because behavioral similarity is not associated with phylogeny. As of 2012, three subspecies were recognized: V. m. mandarinia, V. m. magnifica, and V. m. nobilis. The former subspecies referred to as V. m. japonica has not been considered valid since 1997. The most recent revision in 2020 has eliminated all of the subspecies rankings entirely, with \\"japonica\\", \\"magnifica\\", and \\"nobilis\\" now relegated to informal non-taxonomic names for different color forms.  Description  Head detail Regardless of sex, the hornet's head is a light shade of orange and its antennae are brown with a yellow-orange base. Its eyes and ocelli are dark brown to black. V. mandarinia is distinguished from other hornets by its pronounced clypeus and large genae. Its orange mandible contains a black tooth that it uses for digging. The thorax is dark brown, with two grey wings varying in span from . Its forelegs are brighter than the mid and hind legs. The base of the forelegs is darker than the rest. The abdomen alternates between bands of dark brown or black, and a yellow-orange hue (consistent with its head color). The sixth segment is yellow. Its stinger is typically long and contains a potent venom that, in cases of multiple hornets stinging simultaneously, can kill a human. = Queens and workers = The queens are considerably larger than workers. Queens can exceed , while workers are between . The reproductive anatomy is consistent between the two, but workers do not reproduce. = Drones = Drones (males) are similar to females, but lack stingers. This is a consistent feature among the Hymenoptera.  Geographic distribution  The Asian giant hornet The Asian giant hornet can be found in the Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsky Krai (southern part only) and Jewish AO regions of Russia, Korea (where it is called \\"general officer hornet\\"), China, Taiwan (), Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka, and common in Japan, where it prefers rural areas where it can find trees to nest in and is known as the . At least by 2008, some popular media outlets in Japan also referred to this wasp as , a name that was passed along in 2020 to a New York Times reporter. The Asian giant hornet has been found in North America in 2019 and 2020. So far all sightings have been in the Vancouver area, and all Washington State sightings and captures have been in Whatcom County. * In September 2019, in Nanaimo, British Columbia; * At the end of the same month, , a worker was reported in Blaine, Washington. * another worker was found in Blaine. * On , in Blaine, another worker was found on the U.S. side of the border adjacent to Vancouver Island; * two specimens collected in May 2020, one from Langley, British Columbia, about north of Blaine, and one from Custer, Washington, southeast of Blaine * One queen sighting on from Bellingham, Washington, south of Custer * An unmated queen was trapped on from Birch Bay, Washington, west of Custer. * A male hornet was captured in Custer on .https://komonews.com/news/local/first-male-murder-hornet-trapped-in-wash- state * A hornet of unknown caste was reported in Birch Bay, and another trapped in the same area the following day. * Three hornets were seen (and two killed) SE of Blaine on September 21 and 25, 2020, \\"Three more Asian giant hornets found in Whatcom.

Annals of the Entomological Society of America https://doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saaa024 In April 2020, authorities in Washington asked members of the public to be alert and report any sightings of these hornets, which are expected to become active in April if they are in the area. If they become established, it is claimed that the hornets \\"could decimate bee populations in the United States and establish such a deep presence that all hope for eradication could be lost.\\" A \\"full-scale hunt\\" for the species by the Washington State Department of Agriculture is underway. An assessment model of their potential to spread from their present location on the US- Canada border suggests that they could spread northward into British Columbia, and southward as far as southern Oregon.Gengping Zhu, Javier Gutierrez Illan, Chris Looney, and David W. Crowder (2020) Assessing the ecological niche and invasion potential of the Asian giant hornet. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 202011441; Reports of this species from other parts of the world appear to be erroneous identifications of other introduced hornet species, such as V. orientalis in several locations around the world and V. velutina in Europe.  Nesting  V. mandarinia nests in low mountain foothills and lowland forests. As a particularly dominant species, no efforts are directed toward conserving V. mandarinia or its habitats, as they are common in areas of low human disturbance. Unlike other species of Vespa, V. mandarinia almost exclusively inhabits subterranean nests. In a study of 31 nests, 25 were found around rotten pine roots. Additionally, rodents, snakes, or other burrowing animals previously made some of the tunnels. The depth of these nests was between . The entrance at the ground surface varies in length from either horizontally, inclined, or vertically. The queens that found the nest prefer narrow cavities. Nests of Vespa hornets typically lack a developed envelope. During the initial stages of development, the envelope is in an inverted-bowl shape. As the nest develops, one to three rough sheets of combs are created. Often, single primordial combs are created simultaneously and then fused into a single comb. A system of one main pillar and secondary pillars connects the combs. Nests usually have four to seven combs. The top comb is abandoned after summer and left to rot. The largest comb is at the middle to bottom portion of the nest. The largest combs created by Vespa hornets measured with 1,192 cells (no obstacles, circular) and (elliptical; wrapped around a root system).  Colony cycle  The nesting cycle of V. mandarinia is fairly consistent with that of other eusocial insects. Six phases occur in each cycle. = Pre-nesting period = Inseminated and uninseminated queens enter hibernation following a cycle. They first appear in early to mid-April and begin feeding on the sap of Quercus (oak) trees. Although this timing is consistent among hornets, V. mandarinia dominates the order, receiving preference for premium sap sources. Among the V. mandarinia queens is a dominance hierarchy. The top-ranked queen begins feeding, while the other queens form a circle around her. Once the top queen finishes, the second-highest ranking queen feeds. This process repeats until the last queen feeds at a poor hour. = Solitary, cooperative and polyethic periods = Inseminated queens start to search for nesting sites in late April. The uninseminated queens do not search for nests, since their ovaries never fully develop. They continue to feed, but then disappear in early July. An inseminated queen begins to create relatively small cells in which she raises around 40 small workers. Workers do not begin to work outside of the hive until July. Queens participate in activities outside the hive until mid-July, when they stay inside the nest and allow workers to do extranidal activities. Early August marks a fully developed nest, containing three combs holding 500 cells and 100 workers. After mid-September, no more eggs are laid and the focus shifts to caring for larvae. The queens die in late October. = Dissolution and hibernating period = male Asian giant hornet Males and new queens take on their responsibilities in mid-September and mid-October, respectively. During this time, their body color becomes intense and the weight of the queens increase about 20%. Once the males and queens leave the nest, they do not return. In V. mandarinia, males wait outside the nest entrance until the queens emerge. Once the queens emerge, males intercept them in midair, bring them to the ground, and copulate from 8 to 45 seconds. After this episode, the males return to the entrance for a second chance, while the now-mated queen leaves to hibernate. Many queens attempt to fight off the males and leave unfertilized, at least temporarily. After this episode, pre- hibernating queens are found in moist, subterranean habitats. When sexed individuals emerge, workers shift their focus from protein and animal foods to carbohydrates. The last sexed individuals to emerge may die of starvation.  Sting  The stinger of the Asian giant hornet is about long, which is about longer than that of a honeybee. It injects an especially potent venom that contains, like many bee and wasp venoms, a cytolytic peptide (specifically, a mastoparan) that can damage tissue by stimulating phospholipase action, in addition to its own phospholipase. Masato Ono, an entomologist at Tamagawa University, described the sensation of being stung as feeling \\"like a hot nail being driven into my leg\\". The venom contains a neurotoxin called mandaratoxin, a single-chain polypeptide with a molecular weight around 20 kDa. While a single wasp cannot inject a lethal dose, it can be lethal even to people who are not allergic if the dose is sufficient (i.e., if multiple stings are received). However, if the victim is allergic to the venom, this greatly increases the risk of death. Tests involving mice found that the venom falls short of being the most lethal of all wasp venom, having an of 4.0 mg/kg. In comparison, the deadliest wasp venom (at least to laboratory mice) by weight belongs to Vespa luctuosa at 1.6 mg/kg. The potency of the V. mandarinia sting is due, rather, to the relatively large amount of venom injected. = Effects on humans = Since 2001, the yearly human death toll caused by stings of bees, wasps and hornets in Japan has been ranging between 12 and 26. Since this number also includes deaths caused by bees, wasps, and other hornet species, the number of deaths caused by Asian giant hornets is likely to be significantly lower. Advice in China is that people stung more than 10 times should seek medical help, and need emergency treatment for more than 30 stings. The stings can cause kidney failure. In 2013, stings by Asian giant hornets killed 41 people and injured more than 1,600 people in Shaanxi, China. Fatalities from envenomation are primarily related to anaphylactic shock or cardiac arrest. Deaths have occurred as a result of multiple organ failure, typically after a large number of stings. Sting victims that experience life-threatening organ failure commonly exhibit signs of skin hemorrhaging and necrosis, though in patients without organ failure, these symptoms are very rare. The two likely reasons for skin hemorrhaging and necrosis are an inability to effectively neutralize the venom, or unusually potent venom toxicity for that set of stings. In either case, for a small number of victims, these stings lead to multiple organ injury. While not all such victims displayed lesions or necrosis, a strong correlation existed between the number of stings and the severity of injury. Those who died, on average, were stung 59 times (with a standard error of 12), while those who survived suffered, on average, 28 stings (with a standard error of four, and a p=0.01).  Parasites  The strepsipteran Xenos moutoni is a common parasite among Vespa hornet species. In a study of parasites among species of Vespa, 4.3% of V. mandarinia females were parasitized. Males were not stylopized (parasitization by stylopid strepsipterans, such as Xenos moutoni) at all. The major consequence of being parasitized is the inability to reproduce, and stylopized queens follow the same fate as uninseminated queens. They do not search for an area to create a new colony and feed on sap until early July, when they disappear. In other species of Vespa hornets, males also have a chance of being stylopized. The consequences between the two sexes are similar, as neither sex is able to reproduce.  Communication and perception  V. mandarinia uses both visual and chemical cues as a means of navigating itself and others to the desired location. Scent marking was discussed as a way for hornets to direct other members of the colony to a food source. Even with antennae damage, V. mandarinia was able to navigate itself. It was unable to find its destination only when vision impairment was induced. This implies that while chemical signaling is important, visual cues play an equally important role in guiding individuals. Other behaviors include the formation of a ‚Äúroyal court‚Äù consisting of workers that lick and bite the queen, thereby ingesting her pheromones. These pheromones could directly communicate between the queen and her court or indirectly between her court and other workers due to the ingested pheromones. This is merely speculation, as no direct evidence has been collected to suggest the latter. V. mandarinia communicates acoustically, as well. When larvae are hungry, they scrape their mandibles against the walls of the cell. Furthermore, adult hornets click their mandibles as a warning to other creatures that encroach upon their territory.  Scent marking  V. mandarinia is the only species of social wasp known to apply a scent to direct its colony to a food source. The hornet secretes the chemical from the sixth sternal gland, also known as van der Vecht's gland. This behavior is observed during autumnal raids after the hornets begin hunting in groups instead of individually. The ability to apply scents may have arisen because the Asian giant hornet relies heavily on honey bee colonies as its main food source. A single hornet is unable to take on an entire colony of honey bees because species such as Apis cerana have a well- organized defense mechanism: the honey bees swarm one wasp and flutter their wings to heat up the hornet and raise carbon dioxide to a lethal level. So, organized attacks are much more effective and easily devastate a colony of tens of thousands of honey bees.  Interspecies dominance  In an experiment observing four different species of Vespa hornets, including V. ducalis, V. crabro, V. analis, and V. mandarinia, V. mandarinia was the dominant species. Multiple parameters were set to determine this. The first set parameter observed interaction-mediated departures, which are defined as scenarios wherein one species leaves its position due to the arrival of a more dominant individual. The proportion of interaction-mediated departures was the lowest for V. mandarinia. Another measured parameter was attempted patch entry. Over the observed time, conspecifics (interactions with the same species) resulted in refused entry far more than heterospecifics (interactions with different species). Lastly, when feeding at sap flows, fights between these hornets, Pseudotorynorrhina japonica, Neope goschkevitschii, and Lethe sicelis were observed, and once more V. mandarinia was the most dominant species. In 57 separate fights, one loss was observed to Neope goschkevitschii, giving V. mandarinia a win rate of 98.3%. Based on interaction-mediated departures, attempted patch entry, and interspecific fights, V. mandarinia is the most dominant species.  Predation  An Asian giant hornet feeding on a mantis The Asian giant hornet is intensely predatory; it hunts medium- to large-sized insects, such as bees, other hornet species, and mantises. The latter are favored targets in late summer and fall. Large insects such as mantises are key protein sources to feed queen and drone larvae. Workers forage to feed their larvae, and since their prey can include crop pests, the hornets are sometimes regarded as beneficial. This hornet often attacks both colonies of other Vespa species (V. simillima being the usual prey species) and honey bee hives to obtain the adults, pupae, and larvae as food for their own larvae; sometimes, they also cannibalize each other's colonies. A single scout, sometimes two or three, cautiously approaches the hive, producing pheromones to lead its nest-mates to the hive. The hornets can devastate a colony of honey bees, especially if it is the introduced western honey bee; a single hornet can kill as many as 40 bees per minute due to its large mandibles, which can quickly strike and decapitate prey. The honey bees' stings are ineffective because the hornets are five times their size and heavily armored. Only a few hornets (under 50) can exterminate a colony of tens of thousands of bees in a few hours. The hornets can fly up to in a single day, at speeds up to . The slightly smaller Asian hornet similarly predates on honey bees, and has been spreading throughout Europe. Hornet larvae, but not adults, can digest solid protein; the adult hornets can only drink the juices of their victims, and they chew their prey into a paste to feed to their larvae. The workers dismember the bodies of their prey to return only the most nutrient- rich body parts, such as flight muscles, to the nest. Larvae of predatory social vespids generally (not just Vespa) secrete a clear liquid, sometimes referred to as Vespa amino acid mixture, the exact amino acid composition of which varies considerably from species to species, and which they produce to feed the adults on demand. = Native honey bees = A defensive ball of Japanese honey bees (Apis cerana japonica) in which two hornets (Vespa simillima xanthoptera) are engulfed, incapacitated, heated and eventually killed; this sort of defense is also used against the Asian giant hornet. Beekeepers in Japan attempted to introduce western honey bees (Apis mellifera) for the sake of their high productivity. Western honey bees have no innate defense against the hornets, which can rapidly destroy their colonies. Although a handful of Asian giant hornets can easily defeat the uncoordinated defenses of a western honey bee colony, the Japanese honey bee (Apis cerana japonica) has an effective strategy. When a hornet scout locates and approaches a Japanese honey bee hive, she emits specific pheromonal hunting signals. When the Japanese honey bees detect these pheromones, 100 or so gather near the entrance of the nest and set up a trap, keeping the entrance open. This permits the hornet to enter the hive. As the hornet enters, a mob of hundreds of bees surrounds it in a ball, completely covering it and preventing it from reacting effectively. The bees violently vibrate their flight muscles in much the same way as they do to heat the hive in cold conditions. This raises the temperature in the ball to the critical temperature of . In addition, the exertions of the honey bees raise the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ball. At that concentration of CO2, they can tolerate up to , but the hornet cannot survive the combination of high temperature and high carbon dioxide level. Some honey bees do die along with the intruder, much as happens when they attack other intruders with their stings, but by killing the hornet scout, they prevent it from summoning reinforcements that would wipe out the entire colony. Detailed research suggests this account of the behavior of the honey bees and a few species of hornets is incomplete and that the honey bees and the predators are developing strategies to avoid expensive and mutually unprofitable conflict. Instead, when honey bees detect scouting hornets, they transmit an \\"I see you\\" signal that commonly warns off the predator. Another defence used by Apis cerana is speeding up dramatically when returning to the colony, to avoid midair attacks.  Extermination methods  As of 1973, six different methods were used to control hornets in Japan. Though these methods decrease damage done by V. mandarinia, controlling them entirely is difficult. = Beating = Hornets are crushed with wooden sticks with flat heads. Hornets do not counterattack when they are in the bee-hunting phase or the hive-attack phase (\\"slaughter\\"), but they aggressively guard a beehive once they kill the defenders and occupy it. The biggest expenditure in this method is time, as the process is inefficient. = Nest removal = Applying poisons or fires at night is an effective way of exterminating a colony. The most difficult part about this tactic is finding the subterranean nests. The most common method of discovering nests is giving a piece of frog or fish meat attached to a cotton ball to a wasp and following it back to its nest. With V. mandarinia, this is particularly difficult considering its common home flight radius of . V. mandarinia travels up to away from the nest. = Bait traps = Bait traps are placed in apiaries. The system consists of multiple compartments that direct the hornet into a one-sided hole which is difficult to return through once it is in the cul-de-sac compartment, an area located at the top of the box which honey bees can escape from through a mesh opening, but wasps cannot due to their large size. Baits used to attract the hornets include a diluted millet jelly solution or a crude sugar solution with a mixture of intoxicants, vinegar, or fruit essence. = Mass poisoning = Hornets at the apiary are captured and fed a sugar solution or bee that has been poisoned with malathion. The toxin is expected to spread through trophallaxis. This method is good in principle, but has not been tested extensively. = Trapping at hive entrances = The trap is attached to the front of beehives. The effectiveness of the trap is determined by its ability to capture hornets while allowing honey bees to escape easily. The hornet enters the trap and catches a bee. When it tries to fly back through the entrance of the hive, it hits the front of the trap. The hornet flies upwards to escape and enters the capture chamber, where the hornets are left to die. Some hornets find a way to escape the trap through the front, so these traps can be very inefficient. = Protective screens = As explained in the trapping section, if met by resistance, hornets lose the urge to attack and instead retreat. Different measures of resistance include weeds, wire, or fishing nets or limiting the passage size so only honey bees can make it through. Experienced hornets catch on and eventually stay on these traps, awaiting the arrival of bees. The best method of controlling hornets is to combine these protective screens with traps.  Human consumption  In some Japanese mountain villages, the nests are excavated and the larvae are considered a delicacy when fried. In the central Ch≈´bu region, these wasps are sometimes eaten as snacks or an ingredient in drinks. The grubs are often preserved in jars, pan-fried or steamed with rice to make a savory dish called hebo-gohan. The adults are fried on skewers, stinger and all, until the body becomes crunchy.

(photo 1960) The Rocky Mountain Arsenal was a United States chemical weapons manufacturing center located in the Denver Metropolitan Area in Commerce City, Colorado. The site was completed December 1942, operated by the United States Army throughout the later 20th century and was controversial among local residents until its closure in 1992. Much of the site is now protected as the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. History After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States entered World War II, the U.S. Army began looking for land to create a chemical manufacturing center. Located just north of Denver, in Commerce City and close to the Stapleton Airport, the U.S. Army purchased 20,000 acres. The location was ideal, not only because of the proximity to the airport, but because of the geographic features of the site, it was less likely to be attacked. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal manufactured chemical weapons including mustard gas, napalm, white phosphorus, lewisite, chlorine gas, and sarin. In the early 1960s, the U.S. Army began to lease out its facilities to private companies to manufacture pesticides. In the early 1980s the site was selected as a superfund site and the cleanup process began. In the mid-1980s, wildlife, including endangered species, moved into the space and the land became a protected park. =Policy= The environmental movement began in the United States in the 1960-1970s. The U.S. Congress responded to the movement in 1980 with the creation of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), most commonly referred to as a Superfund. CERCLA was a tax imposed on chemical and petroleum industries. CERCLA also gave the Federal government the authority to respond to the release of life-threatening hazardous materials. After 42 years of chemical manufacturing, in 1984, the United States Army began to inspect the level of contamination at Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA). The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL), a list of the most contaminated areas in the United States. Rocky Mountain Arsenal, among other post-military sites, was a top priority, establishing RMA as a superfund site. This was further exacerbated when the U.S. Army discovered an endangered species, the bald eagle. After the bald eagles were captured, tested, and found to be healthy, the National Wildlife Federation worked with policymakers to transition RMA to a wildlife refuge. In 1992, Congress Passed the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Act (RMANWR Act). Included in the RMANWR Act, areas within RMA that were still contaminated were still owned by the U.S. Army, however, the vast majority of the land that was deemed clean would be managed by the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Tensions arose between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the State of Colorado, United States Army, and the chemical industries as they partnered to clean up the site and create the RMANWR. This led the State of Colorado to take legal action over who has legal authority over RMA remediation efforts, payment of natural resource damages (NRDs), and reimbursement of costs expended for cleanup activities (response costs). Site selection The Arsenal's location was selected due to its relative distance from the coasts (and presumably not likely to be attacked), a sufficient labor force to work at the site, weather that was conducive to outdoor work, and the appropriate soil needed for the project. It was also helpful that the location was close to Stapleton airfield, a major transportation hub. In 1942, the US Army acquired 19,915 acres (80.59 km¬≤) of land on which to manufacture weapons in support of World War II military activities at a cost of $62,415,000. Additionally, some of this land was used for a prisoner of war camp (for German combatants) and later transferred to the city of Denver as Stapleton Airport expanded. A lateral was built off the High Line Canal to supply water to the Arsenal. Manufacturing operations Rocky Mountain Arsenal, south plant. (photo 1970) Weapons manufactured at RMA included both conventional and chemical munitions, including white phosphorus (M34 grenade), napalm, mustard gas, lewisite, and chlorine gas. RMA is also one of the few sites that had a stockpile of Sarin gas (aka nerve agent GB), an organophosphorus compound. The manufacture of these weapons continued until 1969. Rocket fuel to support Air Force operations was also manufactured and stored at RMA. Subsequently, through the 1970s until 1985, RMA was used as a demilitarization site to destroy munitions and chemically related items. Coinciding with these activities, from 1946 to 1982, the Army leased RMA facilities to private industries for the production of pesticides. One of the major lessees, Shell Oil Company, along with Julius Hyman and Company and Colorado Fuel and Iron, had manufacturing and processing capabilities on RMA between 1952 and 1982. The military reserved the right to oust these companies and restart chemical weapon production in the event of a national emergency. Deep injection well RMA contained a deep injection well that was constructed in 1961. It was drilled to a depth of 12,045 feet (3671 m). The well was cased and sealed to a depth of 11,975 feet (3650 m), with the remaining 70 feet (21 m) left as an open hole for the injection of Basin F liquids. For testing purposes, the well was injected with approximately 568,000 US gallons (2150 m¬≥) of city water prior to injecting any waste. The injected fluids had very little potential for reaching the surface or usable groundwater supply since the injection point had 11,900 feet (3630 m) of rock above it and was sealed at the opening. The Army discontinued use of the well in February 1966 because the fluid injection triggered a series of earthquakes in the area. The well remained unused until 1985 when the Army permanently sealed the disposal well. Environmental issues Rabbit used to check for leaks at Sarin nerve gas production plant. (photo 1970) In 1984, the Army began a systematic investigation of site contamination in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), commonly referred to as Superfund. In 1987, the RMA was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) of Superfund sites. As provided by CERCLA, a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) was conducted to determine the extent of contamination. Since 1985, the mission at RMA has been the remediation of the site. =Contaminants= The primary contaminants include organochloride pesticides, organophosphate pesticides, carbamate insecticides, organic solvents and feedstock chemicals used as raw products or intermediates in the manufacturing process (e.g., chlorinated benzenes), heavy metals, chemical warfare material and their related breakdown products and biological warfare agent such as TX. Additionally, ordnance (including incendiary munitions) was manufactured and tested, and asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were used at RMA. Today, it is considered a hazardous waste site according to the Colorado Department of Public and Environmental Health. =Groundwater contamination= The contamination of the underlying alluvial aquifer occurred due to the discharge of waste into unlined basins. The following data were derived from the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. From 1943 to 1956, the US Army and Shell discharged wastes into the unlined basins resulting in the contamination of the South Platte River outside the Arsenal. Farmers in the vicinity complained about the damage to crops due to the water pumped from the shallow alluvial aquifer. In response, the Army constructed an asphalt-lined impoundment for the disposal of wastes in 1956. Further, in 1961, the Army constructed a 12,000-foot deep injection well for the disposal of wastes. This resulted in subsequent earthquakes in Denver area. In 1975, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment ordered the Army and Shell to stop the non-permitted discharge of contaminants, to control the contaminated groundwater leaving the site, and to implement a monitoring plan. The Army and Shell took remedial actions to prevent the contamination that includes the installation of the groundwater barrier system which treated approximately 1 billion gallons of water every year. The deep injection well was closed in 1985 and Basin F was closed in 1988 According to National Resource Damage Assessment, although the contamination has been reduced by the treatment efforts, the water in and around the arsenal may never be fully clean. Approximately, 52,500 acre-feet alluvial is not usable for human consumption. =Wildlife Injuries= The NRDA found several injuries to the wildlife. It was estimated by the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service that at-least 20,000 ducks died in the 10-year span during the 1970s. Mallard carcasses found to have higher levels of Dieldrin. Many mammals and birds were found dead and even may have suffered the lower reproduction rates or birth defects. Safety concerns for neighboring residents Because of the Superfund site status and the dramatic cleanups, many residents in neighborhoods surrounding the RMA voiced concern about ongoing health risks of living within the close vicinity of the site. In September 2017, the state of Colorado filed a lawsuit to sue the United States government for the right to control the contaminated areas of the RMA. Though the cleanup of the site was considered complete in 2010, soil and groundwater monitoring practices occur every five years to ensure the effects of the clean-up remain. Restrictions on well water use, residential development, consumption of fish and game from the arsenal, and agricultural use of the arsenal will exist in perpetuity until further scientific research is completed at the site. =Water= Many of the surrounding neighborhoods have been provided with potable tap water from other areas of Adams county because of the potential effects of contaminated groundwater from wells. Trace amounts of the chemical 1,4-dioxane has been found in some samples of drinking water. There is no appropriate standard by the EPA, but the state of Colorado has a standard treatment protocol for this chemical. =Soil= As part of the clean up of the RMA, much of the soil, up to 10 feet below the surface was removed from the site. This soil is contained in hazardous waste landfills. Contaminated areas of soil remain in the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, but are contained in basins and containment structures. =Air quality= During the cleanup of the RMA, concern for air pollution from the hazardous materials was raised. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment established monitoring systems throughout various locations of the RMA. Throughout the decades of cleanup, the air monitors revealed there was no safety hazard to public health as no arsenal chemicals had been released into the air. =Epidemiological studies= Longstanding agricultural and health concerns related to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal have resulted in a complex history of political and legal battles. Heavy volatile contaminants related to Basin F raised concern among the public for the site and the process of the clean-up itself of the Arsenal and a medical monitoring program (MMP) was put in place as part of the Record of Decision (ROD) between the U.S. Army, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Colorado Department of Health and Environment in 1996. One of the goals of the MMP was to enhance community assurance that the clean-up was effective, and it included air quality monitoring, cancer surveillance, and birth defects surveillance. Air quality monitoring of the Arsenal began concurrently with the decontamination process in 1997 and surveillance continued until July 2009. The Surveillance for Birth Defects utilized passive observational data from an existing birth defects registry March 1989 ‚Äì March 2009. The following data were derived from the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Medical Monitoring Program Surveillance for Birth Defects Compendium prepared by Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and published in February 2010. In this study, baseline birth defects were estimated from the time period 1989‚Äì1997, which was the point at which the clean-up began, and inclusion criteria included mother's address at the time of birth being within the geographical study area. Other demographics of the mother were gathered as well. Birth defects included in the analysis were: \\"total congenital anomalies, major congenital anomalies, heart defects, muscle and skeletal defects, and kidney and bladder defects,\\" and these categories were inconsistent in reporting accuracy. Statistically significant findings (p<0.01) of this study included demographic differences in the mothers as follows: median age 24, compared to 27 years of age in Colorado as a whole, higher percent of mothers who were white/Hispanic and black, mean education level of 11.8 years compared to 13.1 years in Colorado as a whole, fewer mothers who were married, and fewer prenatal visits on average. These potential confounders are not clearly addressed in this report and may complicate the analysis as well as raise concern for disparities in exposure risk that is dependent upon demographic factors. Baseline rates of congenital anomalies in the study area compared to Colorado as a whole did not show significant differences between populations. No significant increase was observed in congenital anomalies during the clean-up period compared to pre- clean up, although there are no baseline data prior to initial contamination events because data was not yet being collected and the population was very different at that time. In summary, there is no current evidence of health effects. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found no increased risk of birth defects in infants. An separate study of cancer incidence by the Colorado Department of Health did not find convincing evidence of increased cancer risk in people living in residential areas surrounding the arsenal, although the study was made more difficult by the large demographic changes in the area and was also confounded by smoking and obesity rates. Additionally, studies performed at Colorado State University found no increased risk of Arsenic, Mercury, or neurotoxicity in communities within 15 miles of the RMA. Economic impact of contamination and clean up Many projects have attempted to clean contaminated groundwater at the Arsenal. For example, DIMP (diisopropyl methyl phosphonate) was one of the main contaminants in the area. One monitoring project has demonstrated incremental improvements over time, and specifically measured 640 parts per billion (ppb) in 1987 and 55 ppb in 1989, while a different off-post monitoring well measured 138 ppb in 1985, 105 ppb in 1987, 14 ppb in 1988, and 6.7 ppb in 1989. While it is difficult to capture the societal cost to clean up the site, the list of actions dealing with groundwater contamination listed by Mears and Heise include: * North boundary groundwater treatment system (1979‚Äì82) ‚Äì $4.3 million * Irondale groundwater treatment system by Shell (1981) ‚Äì $1.1 million * Basin F liquid evaporation and contaminated sewer removal (1982) ‚Äì $1.5 million * Northwest boundary groundwater treatment system (1984) ‚Äì $5.5 million * Deep well closure (1986) ‚Äì $2.5 million * Removal of 76,000 drums of waste salts (1986) ‚Äì $10.5 million * Treatment in the public water supply and The Klein Water Treatment Facility supplies safe drinking water to 30,000 south Adams County residents (1989) ‚Äì $23.1 million * Removal and containment of 10.5M gallons of Basin F liquids and 564,000 cubic yards of sludges (1989) ‚Äì $42 million * Improvements and modifications to North boundary system (1990‚Äì1) ‚Äì $2.75 million * Closure of 353 abandoned wells on-post (1990) ‚Äì $3.7 million * Basin F groundwater intercept system (1990) ‚Äì $0.7 million * Basin A neck groundwater treatment system (1990) ‚Äì $3.1 million * Northwest Boundary System Improvement (1991) ‚Äì $1.4 million * Rail classification yard and motor pool ground water (1991) ‚Äì $3.0 million * South tank farm plume (1991) ‚Äì $0.5 million * Army trenches (1991) ‚Äì $1.4 million * Shell trenches (1991) ‚Äì $3.2 million * Reapplication of windblown dust control (1991) ‚Äì $0.25 million * Groundwater treatment system to the north (1992‚Äì3) ‚Äì $8.7 million * Building 1727 sump cleanup (1993) ‚Äì $0.18 million Direct economic totals add up to approximately $111 million and this estimation does not include operation and maintenance costs. In addition, there were actions completed by Future Farmers of America (FFA) between 1991‚Äì93 that cost approximately $151.2 million. A more recent article in 2004 by Pimentel, estimated the cost of removal pesticides from the groundwater and soil at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal by approximately $2 billion. Also, they noted that if all groundwater were to be cleared for human consumption, the cost would be $500 million annually. Estimating exact direct and indirect impact of the contamination is very challenging as the cleaning and monitoring costs are complex. Further, there have been damages to the rural areas due to contamination resulting in livestock losses, and crop losses. In addition, contamination affects public health and nature (honeybee poisonings, pesticide resistance in pests, destruction of natural predators, wild birds, microbes) negatively. There are many studies that try to estimate the total costs due to contamination of pesticides in U.S. as well as in other countries; however, indirect costs are difficult to estimate, but likely several times than total direct environmental and social costs. In the case of Rocky Mountain Arsenal, total indirect cost was not estimated at all. Rocky Mountain Arsenal NWR Act Mule deer at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge with Denver, CO and the Rocky Mountain foothills in the background. (photo 2009) In 1986, it was discovered that the absence of human activity had made the area an involuntary park when a winter communal roost of bald eagles, then an endangered species, was discovered on site. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inventoried more than 330 species of wildlife that inhabit the Arsenal including deer, coyotes, white pelicans and owls. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Act was passed in October 1992 and signed by President George H. W. Bush. It stipulates that the majority of the site will become a National Wildlife Refuge under the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife Service when the environmental restoration is completed. The Act also provides that to the extent possible, parts of the Arsenal are to be managed as a Refuge in the interim. Finally, the Act provides for the transfer of some Arsenal land for road expansion around the perimeter of the Arsenal and 915 acres (3.70 km¬≤) to be sold for development and annexation by Commerce City. Already since 1995, the buildings became the seat of the National Eagle Repository, an office of the Fish and Wildlife Service that receives the bodies of all dead Golden and Bald Eagles in the nation and provides feathers and other parts to Native Americans for cultural uses. In September 2010, the cleanup was considered complete, and the remaining portions of land were transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, bringing the total to . Two sites were retained by the Army: the South Plants location due to historical use, and the North Plant location, which is now a landfill containing the remains of various buildings used in the plants. On May 21, 2011, the official visitor center for the refuge was opened with an exhibit about the site's history, ranging from the homesteading era to its current status. =Public use= Congruent with the outline of the June 1996 USFWS Comprehensive Management Plan, RMA will be available for public use through both community outreach and educational programs (as provided by the Visitor Access Plan and the USFWS). This public availability will be implemented while simultaneously supporting the remediation effort and the USFWS activities. =Dick's Sporting Goods Park= In April 2007 Dick's Sporting Goods Park, a soccer-specific stadium, was opened on part of the former Rocky Mountain Arsenal land that was transferred to Commerce City. The new venue hosts the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer. =Bison= A small herd of wild bison was introduced to the refuge in March 2007 as part of the USFWS Bison Project. The animals were transferred from the National Bison Range in Montana.

Grants of land are also awarded to individuals and companies as incentives to develop unused land in relatively unpopulated countries; the process of awarding land grants are not limited to the countries named below. The United States historically gave out numerous land grants as Homesteads to individuals desiring to prove a farm. The American Industrial Revolution was guided by many supportive acts of legislatures (for example, the Main Line of Public Works legislation of 1826) promoting commerce or transportation infrastructure development by private companies, such as the Cumberland Road turnpike, the Lehigh Canal, the Schuylkill Canal, and the many railroads that tied the young United States together. Ancient Rome Roman soldiers were given pensions (praemia) at the end of their service including cash or land. Augustus fixed the amount in AD 5 at 3,000 denarii and by the time of Caracalla it had risen to 5,000 denarii. One denarius was roughly equivalent to a day's wages for an unskilled laborer. Australia In 1788 the British claimed all of eastern Australia as its own, and forming the colony of New South Wales in Australia. The land was claimed as crown land. Over time, it granted land to officers and released convicts.State Records NSW , citing Historical Records of Australia 1.1.14, 1.1.124-8, 1.7.268, 1.12.107-125, 1.16.22. Males were allowed , plus if they were married, and additional per child. Instructions were issued on 20 August 1789 that non-commissioned marine officers were to be entitled to additional and privates to additional. Governor Macquarie canceled land grants issued during the Rum Rebellion of 1808-09, although some were later restored. Land grants started to be phased out when private tendering was introduced, and stricter limits were placed on grants without purchase. The instructions to Governor Brisbane were issued on 17 July 1825. From 9 January 1831, all land was to be sold at public auction. There were also significant land grants in the Swan River Colony (Western Australia), and in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) from 1803. = Land grant railways = * In 1886, the Midland Railway of Western Australia was granted land concessions to build and operate a railway from Midland, near Perth, to Walkaway, near Geraldton. This was built, but taken over by the government railway in the 1950s. It was and is gauge. * In 1889, a land grant railway from Roebuck Bay in Western Australia to Angle Pole in South Australia was proposed. This would have been 1000 miles (1600 km) long. Angle Pole was a locality where the Telegraph line had a bend in it. It was stillborn. The gauge would have been . * In 1897, a transcontinental North-South land grant railway was proposed to complete the missing link between Oodnadatta and Darwin, the latter then called Palmerston or Port Darwin. The plan was abandoned, though the government railway was extended in the 1920s from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, with similar extensions at the Darwin end. It was originally gauge, but was replaced by a new gauge line on a different route. * In 1909, a land grant railway was proposed in Queensland from Charleville to Point Parker on the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, but the plan was abandoned. Canada The Hudson's Bay Company was incorporated in 1670 with the grant of Rupert's Land by King Charles II of England; this vast territory was greater than one third the area of Canada today. Following the Rupert's Land Act in the British Parliament, Rupert's Land was sold in 1869 to the newly formed Canadian Government for the nominal sum of ¬£300,000. Land grants were an incentive for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Ireland The Plantations of Ireland in the 16th and 17th centuries involved the confiscation of some or all the land of Irish lords and its grant to settlers (\\"planters\\") from England or Scotland. The English Parliament's Adventurers Act 1642 and Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 specifically entitled \\"Adventurers\\" who funded the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland to lands seized from the leaders of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the ensuing Confederacy.  New Zealand  In New Zealand two private railway companies were offered land grants to build a railway, though both were eventually taken over by the government and incorporated into the government-owned New Zealand Railways Department. :The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company built and operated the 134 km Wellington-Manawatu Line north of Wellington to the Manawatu from 1881. The company was New Zealand owned. It was taken over by the government in 1908, and the line became part of the North Island Main Trunk. :The New Zealand Midland Railway Company started the Midland Line between Canterbury and the West Coast in 1886 but the British-owned company was taken over by the government in 1895, having constructed only 131 km of the 376 km route. United States Virginia Land Office warrant issued in 1779 to Joseph Cabell, assignee of Sgt. Gabriel Penn, to receive 200 acres of land in return for Penn's service in the French and Indian War =Colonial era=  English land grants  In America, starting in the 16th century, land grants were given for the purpose of establishing settlements, missions, and farms. England started with a headright system, used both by the Virginia Company of London and the Plymouth Colony, but later used primarily in colonies south of Maryland. Under this system, emigrants or those paying for their passage would receive land if they survived for a certain period of time (although many indentured servants did not survive their contracts and enslaved Africans were ineligible for headrights). Countries granting land included Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, and Britain. As English colonial law developed, headrights became patents and a patentee had to improve the land. Under this doctrine of planting and seeding, the patentee was required to cultivate of land and build a small house on the property, otherwise the patent would revert to the government.  Spanish and Mexican land grants  Between 1783 and 1821, Spain offered land grants to anyone who settled in their colony of Florida. When the United States acquired that land by treaty, it agreed to honor all valid land grants. As a result, years of litigation ensued over the validity of many of the Spanish Land Grants. Spain and Mexico used the same system of offering land grants along the Rio Grande River near the Texas/Mexico border. These grants were given to help colonization of the area, initially by the Spanish crown, and later by Mexican authorities nationals, and strengthen frontier towns along the Texas border. During the Mexican period of California (and other portions of Mexican territories inherited from New Spain),the Mexican government granted individuals hundreds of ranchos or large tracts of land. The ranchos established land-use patterns that remain recognizable in the California of today.David Hornbeck,Land tenure and rancho expansion in Alta California, 1784‚Äì1846, Journal of Historical Geography, Volume 4, Issue 4, October 1978, Pages 371‚Äì390 Controversy over community land grant claims in New Mexico persist to this day. =Public lands and bounty-land warrants= Future President Thomas Jefferson crafted the Ordinance of 1784 which carved out ten prospective states west of the Appalachian Mountains and established the basis for the Public Land Survey System. The Land Ordinance of 1785 provided a method for settling that land and establishing governmental institutions, which became federal land policy until 1862. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the Northwest Territory, pursuant to which homesteading settlers could buy land, and certain land was set aside for public schools and other purposes. The Federal Government acquired additional lands by treaties with various Native American Tribes, such as the 1833 Treaty of Chicago by which many eastern tribes agreed to settle across the Mississippi River. Revenues from public land purchases were a major source of funding for the federal government through the 19th centuries, along with tariff revenues, since the federal income tax was not established until the 20th century. Starting with the American Revolutionary War, United States veterans often received land grants instead of backpay or other remuneration.William D. Houghton Bounty-land warrants, often for 160 acres, were issued to United States military veterans from 1775 to 1855, thus including veterans of the American Revolutionary War, War of 1812 and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War as well as various Indian wars. The land grants helped settle the Northwest Territory (and later smaller units such as the Indiana Territory, Illinois Territory and Wisconsin Territory) and as well as the Platte Purchase in Missouri.https://www.archives.gov/research/military/bounty- land-1775-1855.pdf Eligibility for the warrants expanded over the years through new Congressional acts of 1842, 1850, 1852, and 1855 to the point where they could be sold or could be handed out to descendants. The warrant program was discontinued before the American Civil War. During the 19th century, various states (or even smaller units) as well as the federal government made extensive land grants to encourage internal improvements, usually to improve transportation, such as construction of bridges and canals. The Land Grant Act of 1850 provided for 3.75 million acres of land to the states to support railroad projects; by 1857 21 million acres of public lands were used for railroads in the Mississippi River valley, and the stage was set for more substantial Congressional subsidies to future railroads.Julian E. Zelizer, The American Congress: the building of democracy, p.288 Universities were also beneficiaries of land grants. All five of the transcontinental railroads in the United States were built using land grants. The Morrill Land- Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890 provided for the establishment of land-grant colleges.  Economic Impact  There is general agreement that the United States' federal policy of offering land grants had a positive impact on economic development in the 19th century.Whaples, R. (1995).

According to The Disturbed Areas (Special Courts) Act, 1976 once declared ‚Äòdisturbed‚Äô, the area has to maintain status quo for a minimum of 3 months. One such Act passed on 11 September 1958 was applicable to the Naga Hills, then part of Assam. In the following decades it spread, one by one, to the other Seven Sister States in India's northeast (at present, it not in force in the States of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur {excluding Imphal Municipal Council Area}, Changlang, Longding and Tirap districts of Arunachal Pradesh, and areas falling within the jurisdiction of the eight police stations of districts in Arunachal Pradesh bordering the State of Assam).\\"THE ARMED FORCES (SPECIAL POWERS) ACT, 1858\\" Another one passed in 1983 and applicable to Punjab and Chandigarh was withdrawn in 1997, roughly 14 years after it came to force. An Act passed in 1990 was applied to Jammu and Kashmir and has been in force since. The Acts have received criticism from several sections for alleged concerns about human rights violations in the regions of its enforcement alleged to have happened. National Politicians like P. Chidambaram and Saifuddin Soz of Congress have advocated revocation of AFSPA, while some like Amarinder Singh are against its revocation. History The Armed Forces Special Powers Ordinance of 1942 was promulgated by the British on 15 August 1942 to suppress the Quit India Movement. Modeled on these lines, four ordinances‚Äîthe Bengal Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance; the Assam Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance; the East Bengal Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance; the United provinces Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance were invoked by the central government to deal with the internal security situation in the country in 1947 which emerged due to the Partition of India. The Article 355 of the Constitution of India confers power to the Central Government to protect every state from internal disturbance. = Armed Forces Special Powers (Assam and Manipur) Act, 1958 = In 1951, the Naga National Council Nation‚Äô. There was a boycott of the first general election of 1952 which later extended to a boycott of government schools and officials. In order to deal with the situation, the Assam government imposed the Assam Maintenance of Public Order (Autonomous District) Act in the Naga Hills in 1953 and intensified police action against the rebels. When the situation worsened, Assam deployed the Assam Rifles in the Naga Hills and enacted the Assam Disturbed Areas Act of 1955, providing a legal framework for the paramilitary forces and the armed state police to combat insurgency in the region. But the Assam Rifles and the state armed police could not contain the Naga rebellion and the rebel Naga Nationalist Council (NNC) formed a parallel government \\"The Federal Government of Nagaland\\" on 23 March 1956. The Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Ordinance 1958 was promulgated by the President Dr. Rajendra Prasad on 22 May 1958. It was replaced by the Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958 on 11 September 1958. The Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958 empowered only the Governors of the States and the Administrators of the Union Territories to declare areas in the concerned State or the Union Territory as 'disturbed'. The reason for conferring such a power as per \\"Objects and Reasons'\\" appended to the Bill was that \\"Keeping in view the duty of the Union under Article 355 of the Constitution, interalia, to protect every State against internal disturbance, it is considered desirable that the Central government should also have power to declare areas as 'disturbed', to enable its armed forces to exercise the special powers\\". The territorial scope of Act also expanded to the five states of the North- East - Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. In addition, the words \\"The Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958\\" were substituted by \\"Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958\\", getting the acronym of AFSPA, 1958. Recently the Tripura state government has decided to withdraw the controversial Act, citing significant reduction in the extent of terrorist activities in the state. In June 2015, after review, the AFSPA in Nagaland state was extended by one more year. In November 2016, Government of India has extended AFSPA in three districts of Arunachal Pradesh- Tirap, Changlang and Longding. The period has further been extended by another 6 months in above three districts of Arunachal Pradesh in April, 2018. These have been declared as \\"disturbed area\\" under Section 3 of the AFSPA. In these districts, Naga underground factions including National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) and NSCN (Khaplang) are involved in extortion, recruitment of locals, and rivalry. =The Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act, 1983= The central government enacted the Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act on 6 October 1983, repealing The Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Ordinance, 1983 to enable the central armed forces to operate in the state of Punjab and the union territory of Chandigarh. The Act was enforced in the whole of Punjab and Chandigarh on 15 October 1983. The terms of the Act broadly remained the same as that of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (Assam and Manipur) of 1972 except for two sections, which provided additional powers to the armed forces. # Sub-section (e) was added to Section 4 stipulating that any vehicle can be stopped, searched and seized forcibly if it is suspected of carrying proclaimed offenders or ammunition. # Section 5 was added to the Act specifying that a soldier has the power to break open any locks \\"if the key there of is withheld\\". The Act was withdrawn in 1997, roughly 14 years after it came to force. =The Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990= The Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990 was enacted in September, 1990.Muzamil Jaleel for the Indian Express. 30 March 2015. Explained: AFSPA-Disturbed Areas debate in J&K;The Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990\\" Indian Ministry of Law and Justice Published by the Authority of New Deli If the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir or the Central Government, is of opinion that the whole or any part of the State is in such a disturbed and dangerous condition then this Act can be imposed. The Act The Articles in the Constitution of India empower state governments to declare a state of emergency due to one or more of the following reasons: * Failure of the administration and the local police to tackle local issues * Return of (central) security forces leads to return of miscreants/erosion of the \\"peace dividend\\" * The scale of unrest or instability in the state is too large for local forces to handle In such cases, it is the prerogative of the state government to call for central help. In most cases, for example during elections, when the local police may be stretched too thin to simultaneously handle day-to-day tasks, the central government obliges by sending in the BSF and the CRPF. Such cases do not come under the purview of AFSPA. AFSPA is confined to be enacted only when a state, or part of it, is declared a 'disturbed area'. Continued unrest, like in the cases of militancy and insurgency, and especially when borders are threatened, are situations where AFSPA is resorted to. By Act 7 of 1972, the power to declare areas as being disturbed was extended to the central government. In a civilian setting, soldiers have no legal tender, and are still bound to the same command chain as they would be in a war theater. Neither the soldiers nor their superiors have any training in civilian law or policing procedures. This is where and why the AFSPA comes to bear - to legitimize the presence and acts of armed forces in emergency situations which have been deemed war-like. According to the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), in an area that is proclaimed as \\"disturbed\\", an officer of the armed forces has powers to: \\"(PDF) The Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990\\" Indian Ministry of Law and Justice Published by the Authority of New Deli *After giving such due warning, Fire upon or use other kinds of force even if it causes death, against the person who is acting against law or order in the disturbed area for the maintenance of public order, *Destroy any arms dump, hide-outs, prepared or fortified position or shelter or training camp from which armed attacks are made by the armed volunteers or armed gangs or absconders wanted for any offence. *To arrest without a warrant anyone who has committed cognizable offences or is reasonably suspected of having done so and may use force if needed for the arrest. *To enter and search any premise in order to make such arrests, or to recover any person wrongfully restrained or any arms, ammunition or explosive substances and seize it. *Stop and search any vehicle or vessel reasonably suspected to be carrying such person or weapons. *Any person arrested and taken into custody under this Act shall be made present over to the officer in charge of the nearest police station with least possible delay, together with a report of the circumstances occasioning the arrest. *Army officers have legal immunity for their actions. There can be no prosecution, suit or any other legal proceeding against anyone acting under that law. Nor is the government's judgment on why an area is found to be disturbed subject to judicial review. *Protection of persons acting in good faith under this Act from prosecution, suit or other legal proceedings, except with the sanction of the Central Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by this Act. On 8 July 2016, in a landmark ruling, The Supreme Court of India ended the immunity of the armed forces from prosecution under AFSPA, saying, in an 85-page judgement, \\"It does not matter whether the victim was a common person or a militant or a terrorist, nor does it matter whether the aggressor was a common person or the state. The law is the same for both and is equally applicable to both... This is the requirement of a democracy and the requirement of preservation of the rule of law and the preservation of individual liberties.\\" Non-state views and commentary = United Nations view = When India presented its second periodic report to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 1991, members of the UNHRC asked numerous questions about the validity of the AFSPA. They questioned the constitutionality of the AFSPA under Indian law and asked how it could be justified in light of Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR. On 23 March 2009, UN Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay asked India to repeal the AFSPA. She termed the law as \\"dated and colonial-era law that breach contemporary international human rights standards.\\" On 31 March 2012, the UN asked India to revoke AFSPA saying it had no place in Indian democracy. Christof Heyns, UN's Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions said \\"During my visit to Kashmir, AFSPA was described to me as 'hated' and 'draconian'. It clearly violates International Law. A number of UN treaty bodies have pronounced it to be in violation of International Law as well.\\" =Non-governmental organizations' analysis= The Act has been criticized by Human Rights Watch as a \\"tool of state abuse, oppression and discrimination\\".\\"India: Repeal Armed Forces Special Powers Act\\" Human Rights Watch The South Asian Human Rights Documentation Centre argues that the governments' call for increased force is part of the problem. A report by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis points to multiple occurrences of violence by security forces against civilians in Manipur since the passage of the Act.Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, 'Manipur and Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958' \\"the alleged rape and killing of Manjab Manorama\\", \\"security forces have destroyed homes\\", \\"arrests without warrants\\", \\"widespread violations of humane rights\\", \\"The cases of Naga boys of Oinam village being tortured before their mothers by Assam rifles Jawans in July 1987; the killing of Amine Devi and her child of Bishnupur district on April 5, 1996, by a CRPF party; the abduction, torture and killing of 15-year-old Sanamacha of Angtha village by an Assam Rifles party on 12th February 1998; the shooting dead of 10 civilians by an Assam Rifles party in November 2000 are some of the glaring examples that are still fresh in the mind of Manipuris.\\" The report states that residents believe that the provision for immunity of security forces urge them to act more brutally.Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, 'Manipur and Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958' The article, however, goes on to say that repeal or withering away of the Act will encourage insurgency. Irom Chanu Sharmila also known as the \\"Iron Lady of Manipur\\" or \\"Mengoubi\\" (\\"the fair one\\") is a civil rights activist, political activist, and poet from the Indian state of Manipur. On 2 November 2000, she began a hunger strike which ended on 9 August 2016 after 16 years. On 2 November 2000, in Malom, a town in the Imphal Valley of Manipur, ten civilians were shot and killed while waiting at a bus stop. The incident, known as the \\"Malom Massacre\\", was allegedly committed by the Assam Rifles, one of the Indian Paramilitary forces operating in the state. In addition to this, there have been claims of disappearances by the police or the army in Kashmir by several human rights organizations. A soldier guards the roadside checkpoint outside Srinagar International Airport in January 2009.Many human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) have condemned human rights abuses in Kashmir by police such as \\"extra- judicial executions\\", \\"disappearances\\", and torture; the \\"Armed Forces Special Powers Act\\", which \\"provides impunity for human rights abuses and fuels cycles of violence. The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) grants the military wide powers of arrest, the right to shoot to kill, and to occupy or destroy property in counterinsurgency operations. Indian officials claim that troops need such powers because the army is only deployed when national security is at serious risk from armed combatants. Such circumstances, they say, call for extraordinary measures.\\" Human rights organizations have also asked Indian government to repeal the Public Safety Act, since \\"a detainee may be held in administrative detention for a maximum of two years without a court order.\\". Activists who are working in J&K; for peace and human rights include names of Madhu Kishwar, Ashima Kaul, Ram Jethmalani, Faisal Khan, Ravi Nitesh (founder of Mission Bhartiyam), Swami Agnivesh, Dr. Sandeep Pandey and many others. They all accept that people to people communication and development of new avenues are the only way for peace, however laws like AFSPA are continuously violating human rights issues there.\\"What [the Indian State] has failed to see is that such small, ethnic groups are resisting the Indian state for 55 years\\" says legal activist and scholar, Babloo Loitongbom =United States leaked diplomatic cables= The Wikileaks diplomatic cables have disclosed that Indian government employees agree to acts of human rights violations on part of the Indian armed forces and various paramilitary forces deployed in the north east parts of India especially Manipur. The violations have been carried out under the cover of this very Act. Governor S.S. Sidhu admitted to the American Consul General in Kolkata, Henry Jardine, that the Assam Rifles in particular are perpetrators of violations in Manipur which the very same cables described as a state that appeared more of a colony and less of an Indian state. But contrary to expectations 2014 Indian general election recorded nearly 80% voters turnout in Manipur. Earlier leaks had also stated that International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had reported to the United States diplomats in Delhi about the \\"grave human rights situation\\" in Kashmir which included \\"the use of electrocution, beatings and sexual humiliation against hundreds of detainees\\". =Santosh Hegde commission on Manipur encounter deaths= A high-power commission headed by the retired Supreme Court judge, N. Santosh Hegde was constituted in January 2013 to probe six encounter deaths in Manipur. The committee, comprising former Supreme Court judge Santosh Hegde, ex-CEC J M Lyngdoh and a senior police officer, has said in its report that the probe showed that none of the victims had any criminal records. The judicial commission set up by the Supreme Court is trying to make the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) more humane, and the security forces more accountable. The committee has suggested fixing a time frame of three months for the central government to decide whether to prosecute security personnel engaged in extrajudicial killings or unruly behaviour in insurgency-hit regions. The Commission noted that AFSPA was an impediment to achieving peace in regions such as Jammu and Kashmir and the North East.The commission also said the law needs to be reviewed every six months to see whether its implementation is actually necessary in states where it is being enforced. About Section 6 of the Act, which guarantees protection against prosecution to the armed forces, the report said: \\"It is not that no action can be taken at all. Action can be taken but with prior sanction of the Central Government.\\" =Justice Jeevan Reddy Commission= The commission recommended to repeal AFSPA as \\"the Act is a symbol of hate, oppression and instrument of high handedness\\" . It had submitted its report on 06.06.2005. after 10 years government of India reject the recommendation made by Justice Jeevan Reddy Commission to repeal the AFSPA. =Second Administrative Reforms Commission= The second Administratively Reforms Commission (ARC) in its fifth report on \\"Public Order,\\" recommended to repeal of Armed Forces Special Powers Act, 1958. It commented that its scrapping would remove sentiments of discrimination and alienation among the people of the North East India.The commission recommended to amend the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 inserting a new chapter to deploy the armed forces of the Union in the North eastern States. It supported a new doctrine of policing and criminal justice inherent in an inclusive approach to governance. =Supreme Court of India= Supreme Court said that any encounter carried out by armed forces in the garb of AFSPA should be subjected to thorough inquiry. In the words of supreme court \\"It does not matter whether the victim was a common person or a militant or a terrorist, nor does it matter whether the aggressor was a common person or the state.The law is the same for both and is equally applicable to both..

Located on the outskirts is the National Museum of War and Resistance of the Netherlands, which originated as a museum for a World War II battle (Battle of Overloon) that occurred around the village in September and October 1944. The village is located close to the A73 motorway between Venlo and Nijmegen. Toponymy In ancient times it was called simply Loon. Loon or Lo(o) means forest with low trees, with an open meadow and swamp. The element \\"over\\" was added to the name much later, to distinguish it from the nearby Loon Ravenstein, Neerloon. \\"Neder\\" and \\"over\\" here have the meanings respectively lower and higher, or downstream and upstream. History Since the formation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the village was part of the Maashees en Overloon municipality with the nearby hamlet of Maashees. In 1942 this municipality was added to the municipality of Vierlingsbeek and in 1998 they were all included within Boxmeer. Around 1900 the village was widely spread across moorlands and poorly connected to larger towns such as Venray, Vierlingsbeek, Sambeek, Oploo en Sint Anthonis. There were about 600 people in 110 houses. The oldest written mention of Loon is a grant of charter from Jan van Cuijk from the year 1308. Jan van Cuijk in this deed, that he recorded at St. Lawrence Church in Vierlingsbeek, gives the right to waive the (low) tax in(Over)Loon. =Administrative and legal until 1795= The Loon village government consisted of three aldermen, four jurors and one or two bankers. The latter were especially responsible for the finances. From the fourteenth century, the aldermen had jurisdiction together with that of an alderman of the Vierlingsbeek bank. Vierlingsbeek was the head of the four aldermen. Criminal cases had to go to the bench in Grave. This joint arrangement of aldermen was maintained until 1803. From that year, Overloon had the power to regulate the judiciary itself. This lasted only seven years, due to the unstable political situation. Between 1794 (after the French invasion) and 1810 the territory of the Netherlands, and hence that of Overloon, was first made part of the Republic of France (1794-1795), and then successively of the Kingdom of The Netherlands (1795 - 1796), the Batavian Republic (1796-1805), the Batavian Commonwealth (1805-1806) and the Kingdom of Holland (1806-1810). =Administration after 1810= In 1810 the entire Dutch territory was annexed by France and became a part of the Empire of France (1810-1814). As a result, there was new legislation and a different organization of public administration and law in the Netherlands. At local level, municipalities were formed, under the direction of a mayor. The village authorities were abolished from that moment. Overloon and Maashees merged into one municipality, of which Holthees was also a part. This had the name, Maashees and Overloon. This was, in 1942, in the municipality Vierlingsbeek, which in turn, on 1 January 1998, merged with Boxmeer. =World War II= In 1944, Overloon was almost completely destroyed at the Battle of Overloon, officially also known as Operation Aintree, in a ten-day tank battle between a British tank division and the German army. The Germans were trying to keep the Allies from crossing the Maas. There were more than two thousand dead. Overloon was liberated on October 14, 1944, but the fighting lasted for some days longer. This is the reason for the establishment of the War Museum, which later became known as the National War and Resistance Museum and then Liberty Park.Liberty Park Places of interest *The Liberty Park, including the National War and Resistance Museum, opened in 1946. *The Zoo Parc Overloon, a small zoo. *On the path between the Liberty Park and the zoo are seven wooden sculptures produced by Marjolijn Mandersloot.

In 1975 the fraternity disbanded. At the back of the church is still a picture of St. Donatus. *Schaartven is a former sand excavation site of 7 hectares. After the excavation site was closed, the total area of 23 hectares was planted and decorated by the municipality of Vierlingsbeek to which Overloon belonged to at that time.

Nothe Fort from the air. Nothe Fort is a fort in Weymouth, Dorset, England, situated at the end of the Nothe Peninsula, which juts eastwards from the town of Weymouth, and Weymouth Harbour, into the sea to the north of the ex-military Portland Harbour. The fort is located next to Nothe Gardens. The coastal defence was built between 1860 and 1872 by 26 Company of the Royal Engineers to protect Portland and Weymouth Harbours, with Portland then becoming an important Royal Navy base. Shaped like the letter D, the fort was built with bomb-proof casemates and deep magazines. The fort was abandoned in 1956 and purchased by the local council in 1961. It is now a museum and remains one of the best-preserved forts of its kind in the country. The fort and its outer gateway have been Grade II* listed since 1974. Its fusee steps, located in Nothe Gardens, have been Grade II listed since 2000, and was constructed for hauling trolleys transporting ammunition, spares and stores from the quay to Nothe Fort. In 1978, the Nothe Fort, tramway and searchlight battery at The Nothe, also became scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. History =Military= The fort's entrance. The fort's courtyard. Guns on the Fort Ramparts. Work began on Nothe Fort in 1860 by a civil engineering contractor, with the first stage of construction involving leveling the site and building a sea wall. After the contractor suffered financial problems, the construction work was taken over by 26 Company Royal Engineers in 1862. Although the upper earthen parapet was complete by 1869,http://www.victorianforts.co.uk/pdf/datasheets/nothe.pdf the fort was fully commissioned in 1872 at a total cost of ¬£117,049. It was constructed on three levels; the magazine stored the ammunition, the ground level casemates were designed to hold heavy muzzle-loaded cannons and accommodation for the soldiers manning them, and the ramparts, featuring a raised platform that could be used to fire weapons such as muskets and light muzzle-loaded cannons during attacks. The first soldiers to be stationed at the fort were No. 2 Battery Royal Artillery (Tatton-Browns). The unit were given responsibility to install the original cannons, which were two 64 pounders, four 9-inch rifled muzzle loaders and six 10-inch cannons. During the 1890s, seven of the guns were replaced by 12.5-inch RML guns. With the introduction of breech-loading guns in the early 20th century, the RML guns were removed and replaced by three 6-inch Mark VII breechloading naval guns on the ramparts. In order to carry the 100-pound shells from the magazines, a series of hoists were installed. In 1938 alterations were completed to allow the fort to be used as a central anti-aircraft ammunition depot for the south west, which included installing an electrically-operated hoist and the construction of a loading platform. Nothe Fort did not see combat until World War II. In July 1940, two ships entered the area and failed to identify themselves, prompting the fort to fire its guns as a warning. The two ships immediately switched on their lights, revealing themselves to be refugees from the Channel Islands. During the war, the fort was equipped with a battery of four Vickers QF 3.7-inch AA guns, sited on a purpose-built platform within the north-west corner of the fort, which was later replaced by a Bofors 40 mm gun. It was abandoned in 1956 as it was no longer required as a coastal defence, then used by the Royal Navy to house stores and degaussing equipment. =Recent history= By 1961 the Navy had no further use for the fort and it was sold to Weymouth and Melcombe Regis Borough Council. Under the ownership of the council the fort remained unoccupied and quickly became a victim of vandalism, before starting to fall into a state of dereliction. During this time, numerous ideas were suggested, including turning the fort into a luxury hotel complex. Work began to turn the fort into a hotel in 1971 but was soon abandoned shortly after. In 1980, the Weymouth Civic Society took over responsibility for the fort through a lease with the borough council, allowing restoration work to begin, with assistance from the Manpower Services Scheme. Later in the 1980s, as a result of the Cold War period, part of the fort's magazine level was used as a nuclear shelter for civil administration, which included the creation of command and accommodation areas, and the installation of heavy blast doors. Nothe Fort has been gradually transformed into a museum and tourist attraction, where it remains open to the public today. Following the early restoration work, the fort was given a ¬£1.8m lottery grant and a further ¬£600,000 investment due to the involvement of local authorities and English Heritage. The fort is run by a team of five paid staff members and a dedicated team of 70 volunteers, while the Friends of Nothe Fort group has also been established to promote interest in the fort and to encourage its growth as a museum and attraction. The museum itself features models, World War II memorabilia as well as original cannons and guns and British and American WWII vehicles, along with many displays, exhibits and audio-visual facilities. The courtyard often holds community events such as military festivals, concerts, drama and cultural Olympiad. In 2007, a survey carried out by The National Lottery revealed the fort to be voted one of the spookiest locations in the UK. In 2012, hundreds of individuals applied to be volunteers at the fort for the Summer Olympics. 150 people were recruited as marshals during the games, when 4,600 ticketed spectators a day flocked to the official view point for a fortnight. The fort and the gardens were closed off to the public during the games.

It is thus an extracorporeal therapy (a medical procedure performed outside the body). Three general types of plasmapheresis can be distinguished: * Autologuous, removing blood plasma, treating it in some way, and returning it to the same person, as a therapy. * Exchange, removing blood plasma and exchanging it with blood products to be donated to the recipient. This type is called plasma exchange (PE, PLEX, or PEX) or plasma exchange therapy (PET). The removed plasma is discarded and the patient receives replacement donor plasma, albumin, or a combination of albumin and saline (usually 70% albumin and 30% saline). * Donation, removing blood plasma, separating its components, and returning some of them to the same person while holding out others to become blood products donated by the donor. In such a plasma donation procedure, blood is removed from the body, blood cells and plasma are separated, and the blood cells are returned while the plasma is collected and frozen to preserve it for eventual use as fresh frozen plasma or as an ingredient in the manufacture of a variety of medications. Plasmapheresis of the autologous and exchange types is used to treat a variety of disorders, including those of the immune system, such as Goodpasture's syndrome, Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, lupus, myasthenia gravis, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.  Medical uses  During plasmapheresis, blood (which consists of blood cells and a clear liquid called plasma) is initially taken out of the body through a needle or previously implanted catheter. Plasma is then removed from the blood by a cell separator. Three procedures are commonly used to separate the plasma from the blood cells, with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages: * Discontinuous flow centrifugation: One venous catheter line is required. Typically, a 300 ml batch of blood is removed at a time and centrifuged to separate plasma from blood cells. * Continuous flow centrifugation: Two venous lines are used. This method requires slightly less blood volume out of the body at any one time, as it is able to continuously spin out plasma. * Plasma filtration: Two venous lines are used. The plasma is filtered using standard hemodialysis equipment. This continuous process requires that less than 100 ml of blood be outside the body at one time. After plasma separation, the blood cells are returned to the person undergoing treatment, while the plasma, which contains the antibodies, is first treated and then returned to the patient in traditional plasmapheresis. Rarely, other replacement fluids, such as hydroxyethyl starch, may be used in individuals who object to blood transfusion but these are rarely used due to severe side-effects. Medication to keep the blood from clotting (an anticoagulant) is given to the patient during the procedure. Plasmapheresis is used as a therapy in particular diseases. It is an uncommon treatment in the United States, but it is more common in Europe and particularly Japan. An important use of plasmapheresis is in the therapy of autoimmune disorders, where the rapid removal of disease-causing autoantibodies from the circulation is required in addition to other medical therapy. It is important to note that plasma exchange therapy in and of itself is useful to temper the disease process, while simultaneous medical and immunosuppressive therapy is required for long-term management. Plasma exchange offers the quickest short-term answer to removing harmful autoantibodies; however, the production of autoantibodies by the immune system must also be suppressed, usually by the use of medications such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, rituximab, or a mixture of these. Other uses are the removal of blood proteins where these are overly abundant and cause hyperviscosity syndrome. =Examples of diseases that can be treated with plasmapheresis= *Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) *Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS or APLS) *Behcet syndrome *Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy *Goodpasture's syndrome *Granulomatosis with polyangiitis *Graves' disease in infants and neonates *Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome *HELLP syndrome *HIV-related neuropathyKiprov D.D., Stricker R.B., Miller R.G.

Insertion of a rather large intravenous catheter can lead to bleeding, lung puncture (depending on the site of catheter insertion), and, if the catheter is left in too long, it can get infected. Aside from placing the catheter, the procedure itself has complications. When patient blood is outside of the body passing through the plasmapheresis machine, the blood has a tendency to clot. To reduce this tendency, in one common protocol, sodium citrate is infused while the blood is running through the circuit. Citrate binds to calcium in the blood, calcium being essential for blood to clot. Citrate is very effective in preventing blood from clotting; however, its use can lead to life- threateningly low calcium levels. This can be detected using the Chvostek's sign or Trousseau's sign. To prevent this complication, calcium is infused intravenously while the patient is undergoing the plasmapheresis; in addition, calcium supplementation by mouth may also be given. Other complications include: * Bleeding or hematoma from needle placement * Hypotension * Potential exposure to blood products, with risk of transfusion reactions or transfusion transmitted diseases * Suppression of the patient's immune system  Donation procedure Donating plasma is similar in many ways to whole blood donation, though the end product is used for different purposes. Most plasmapheresis is for fractionation into other products; other blood donations are transfused with relatively minor modifications. Plasma that is collected solely for further manufacturing is called Source Plasma. Plasma donors undergo a screening process to ensure both the donor's safety and the safety of the collected product. Factors monitored include blood pressure, pulse, temperature, total protein, protein electrophoresis, health history screening similar to that for whole blood, as well as an annual physical exam with a licensed physician or an approved physician substitute under the supervision of the physician. Donors are screened at each donation for viral diseases that can be transmitted by blood, sometimes by multiple methods. For example, donations are tested for HIV by ELISA, which shows if they have been exposed to the disease, as well as by nucleic acid methods (PCR or similar) to rule out recent infections that the ELISA test might miss and are also screened for hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Industry standards require at least two sets of negative test results before the collected plasma is used for injectable products. The plasma is also treated in processing multiple times to inactivate any virus that was undetected during the screening process. In a few countries, plasma (like blood) is donated by unpaid volunteers. In others, including the United States, Austria, Germany and some Canadian facilities plasma donors are paid for their donations.One Day, Two Dollars Standards for donating plasma are set by national regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),FDA > CDRH > CFR Title 21 Database Search the European Union, and by a professional organization, the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (or PPTA),Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association. PPTA [Online]. which audits and accredits collection facilities. A National Donor Deferral Registry (NDDR) is also maintained by the PPTA for use in keeping donors with prior positive viral antibody test results from donating at any facility. Almost all plasmapheresis in the US is performed by automated methods. In some cases, automated plasmapheresis is used to collect plasma products like fresh frozen plasma for direct transfusion purposes, often at the same time as plateletpheresis. These procedures are performed at facilities such as community blood centers. ; Manual method: For the manual method, approximately the same as a whole blood donation is collected from the donor. The collected blood is then separated by centrifuge machines in separate rooms, the plasma is pressed out of the collection set into a satellite container, and the red blood cells are returned to the donor. Since returning red cells causes the body to replace plasma more rapidly, a donor can provide up to a liter of plasma at a time and can donate with only a few days between donations, unlike the 56-day deferral for blood donation. The amount allowed in a donation varies vastly from country to country, but generally does not exceed two donations, each as much as a liter, per seven- day period. The danger with this method was that if the wrong red blood cells were returned to the donor, a serious and potentially fatal transfusion reaction could occur. Requiring donors to recite their names and ID numbers on returned bags of red cells minimized this risk. This procedure has largely become obsolete in favor of the automated method. ; Automated method: The automated method uses a very similar process. The difference is that the collection, separation, and return are all performed inside a machine connected to the donor through a needle in the arm, typically the antecubital vein. There is no risk of receiving the wrong red cells.Biolife - Donating Plasma: The Donation Process The devices used are very similar to the devices used for therapeutic plasmapheresis, and the potential for citrate toxicity is similar. The potential risks are explained to prospective donors at the first donation, and most donors tolerate the procedure well.Octapharma Plasma, Inc. - Plasma donation safety If a significant amount of red blood cells cannot be returned, the donor may not donate for 56 days, just as if they had donated a unit of blood. Depending on the collection system and the operation, the removed plasma may be replaced by saline. The body typically replaces the collected volume within 24 hours, and donors typically donate up to twice a week, though this varies by country. The collected plasma is promptly frozen at lower than -20 ¬∞C (-4 ¬∞F) and is typically shipped to a processing facility for fractionation. This process separates the collected plasma into specific components, such as albumin and immunoglobulins, most of which are made into medications for human use. Sometimes the plasma is thawed and transfused as Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), much like the plasma from a normal blood donation. ;Antibodies: Donors are sometimes immunized against agents such as tetanus or hepatitis B so that their plasma contains the antibodies against the toxin or disease. In other donors, an intentionally incompatible unit of blood is transfused to produce antibodies to the antigens on the red cells. The collected plasma then contains these components, which are used in manufacturing of medications. Donors who are already ill may have their plasma collected for use as a positive control for laboratory testing.  History  Edwin J. Cohn & Josep Antoni Gr√≠fols Lucas at the 4th International Congress of Blood Transfusion, Lisbon, 1951. Plasmapheresis was originally described by John Abel and Leonard Rowntree of Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1913. It was developed by Dr. Josep Antoni Gr√≠fols Lucas in 1950 and 1951. Gr√≠fols found that plasmapheresis allowed donors to donate more frequently without compromising their health, and this made it possible to respond more effectively to the demand for plasma. Gr√≠fols tried out the technique on himself, and, once he had confirmed that the technique was harmless, he practiced it on volunteer donors and gradually perfected it. He presented the results of his work in 1951 at the Fourth International Congress of Blood Transfusion in Lisbon, and in 1952 he published them in the British Medical Journal. Michael Rubinstein was the first to use plasmapheresis to treat an immune-related disorder when he \\"saved the life of an adolescent boy with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) at the ‚Ä¶Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles in 1959\\".Wallace, D.J. \\"Apheresis for lupus erythematosus\\".

Its Faculty of Medicine traces its founding to the Royal Naval College of Surgery in 1748, which was the first in Europe to combine medicine and surgery in a single school. The modern University of C√°diz was founded on October 30, 1979, with an inaugural session \\"Cajal, an√°lisis literario de un car√°cter\\" about Ram√≥n y Cajal and the first rector election was conducted in 1984. In March 1984, the Gold Medal was awarded to Juan Carlos I of Spain. In May 1985, Rafael Alberti and Antonio Dom√≠nguez Ortiz were invested Doctor Honoris Causa. In this year, the rectorate is relocated to the current building, Casa de los Cinco Gremios. University bylaws and statutes were approved in February 1986. In 1992, Centro Andaluz Superior de Estudios Marinos was inaugurated in Campus of Puerto Real. Since 2003, UCA has promoted new technologies for learning-related purposes, first with WebCT virtual campus and then Moodle (free software).
