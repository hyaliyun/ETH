Plot Officer De Ming is the pinnacle of modern law enforcement. Courteous. Courageous. Committed. Almost human. Designed to handle assignments too dangerous for traditional methods, De Ming is the first in the TN Research Bureau's \\"K Series\\"—a revolutionary cybernetic organism programmed with a sophisticated social conscience. Sent to a remote town as part of a covert training operation, De Ming is placed under the supervision of the local police captain, Xu Dachun. Xu's mission: facilitate De Ming's integration into the community while protecting the secret of his young protégé's true identity. Charmed with a talent for delivering both justice and compassion, De Ming is quick to win the hearts of the town residents—though none more completely than that of Su Mei, a fellow officer who also happens to be the object of the captain's secret affection. Nothing in De Ming's programming has prepared him for this. But affairs of the heart are put on hold when word arrives that one of De Ming's cybernetic siblings, the K-88, has disappeared after suffering a critical neural meltdown. Together, the two men hunt down and confront the malfunctioning cyborg in a spectacular clash of artificial wills that leaves the captain scarred, and De Ming confused and conflicted about his role in human society. Mission completed, the consequences of De Ming's actions continue to haunt the young cyborg. The captain's behavior has become increasingly strange and erratic since the battle with the K-88, a fact that De Ming feels compelled to hide from co-workers and superiors. Su Mei's behavior is no less troubling as she seems incapable of understanding that as a machine he is unable to love her in the way she so desperately desires. Torn between his bond to humanity and the knowledge that he will never be a part of it, De Ming must find within himself the strength to defeat the group of cyborg assassins that has descended on the town to avenge his betrayal of cyborg.

Campuses The main campus is situated on Out Risbygate in Bury St Edmunds, while the Building Services and Construction facilities are at The Milburn Centre on Anglian Lane, a short walk from the main campus. The college also has a number of local colleges throughout Suffolk. These are located in: Haverhill, Ipswich, Mildenhall, Stowmarket, Newmarket, Thetford and Sudbury. In 2015/16, there were 2,915 students enrolled on adult education courses. Each summer, the college has an awards ceremony at St Edmundsbury Cathedral.  Degree Studies at West Suffolk College  In 2017-18 81% of students achieved a 1st class degree or a 2:1. This was achieved through a very rigorous marking and quality assurance process. In 2017-18 85% of students progressed to a graduate job or post graduate study from Degree Studies at West Suffolk College. Graduation ceremonies are held every September/October at St Edmundsbury Cathedral. The University of Suffolk at West Suffolk College is renowned for its state-of-the-art recording studios and music production courses, with students continuing to exclusively record live concerts by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO). History In 1951, the Bury St Edmunds Technical Institute began offering Engineering, Building and vocational evening classes in the grounds of the Silver Jubilee School. In 1958, it decided to construct a new purpose built college on its own ground, at the Gibraltar Barracks site, where the West Suffolk College is today. It was officially opened on 29 May 1961. In the 1970s and 1980s, the college expanded; from 1970 to 1977, the Engineering, Construction and Motor Vehicle training centres were built. In 1983, Australia House, a dedicated beauty, hair and hospitality school was opened. A year later, a purpose built facility for students with learning difficulties and disabilities was built. The expansion continued into the 1990s; with Gibraltar House opening in 1999. In 2006, the college was awarded Grade 1: Outstanding by Ofsted and in 2011, Dr Ann Williams, the then Principal, was appointed an OBE for services to Further Education in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list. She was replaced by Dr Nikos Savvas in 2013. In 2014, a new building, The Gateway, now the face of the college, was opened. The following year the college received confirmation of a £7m government grant to help pay for an £8m energy, engineering and manufacturing teaching centre. In September 2015, the college began Animal Care and Management courses at the Newmarket Academy. In 2016, the college was ranked in the top five per cent in the country for its achievement rates in Level 3 Vocational Diplomas, the best in the Eastern Region, and the second best GCSE English resit results in the country. The college offers a range of Apprenticeships and in 2016, it enrolled over 1,000 people onto its apprenticeships, with an achievement rate eight per cent higher than the national average at 78%. Following an inspection under new grading criteria, the college was graded as 'Good' by Ofsted. The college was named in July 2019 as a computing hub for the National Centre for Computing Education.  Principal  Dr Nikos Savvas has a doctorate in High Energy Particle Physics from Manchester University and has held senior roles in the further education sector for a number of years. He is a Board member for University of Suffolk, ACER (Association of Colleges in the Eastern Region) and the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership for Norfolk and Suffolk. He took up the role of Principal at West Suffolk College in September 2013.  Suffolk Academies Trust and Abbeygate Sixth Form College  The college is a sponsor of the Suffolk Academies Trust, a collaboration with One, which was given permission by the Department for Education to build a new sixth form in Bury St Edmunds. The sixth form will aim to cater for up to 1,700 pupils. While the sixth form is built, Abbeygate Sixth Form College students are studying in The Gateway at West Suffolk College.

He identifies four structural transformations required for this reversal: * From Denationalization to a New National Project (dalla denazionalizzazione al nuovo progetto nazionale) * From Dysfunction to Effective Governance (dall'ingoernabilità alla governabilità) * From Passive to Active Welfare (dal welfare passivo a quello attivo) * From Weak Sovereignty to Convergent and Contributory Sovereignty (dalla sovranità debole a quella convergente e contributiva) The book introduces a systematic strategy that integrates internal reforms, of both the political architecture and economic model of Italy, with a project to strengthen Italy's external position. Strategy 2028 is a 10-year project with milestone events that will reinforce the plan's feasibility in its early stages. It is a national project intended to repair Italian democracy in a global scenario of reorganizing and converging democracies.  Nova Pax, 2015  In Nova Pax, Pelanda outlines a global systemic project that aims to: (a) create an alliance structured as an economic area with growing integration among democratic nations; (b) facilitate the reorganization of national political-economic models into structures compatible with the allied economic area; (c) form this new Free Community through the expansion of the G7; and (d) revive democratic ideology and restart the process of global democratization. The goal is to reorganize the world of “democratic capitalism” through this strategy, which combines national reforms and a new international architecture. The model of “democratic capitalism” is facing a crisis in its ability to generate economic growth, maintain geopolitical cohesion, and project influence globally. The realism of the project is based on the tendency of democracies to form free trade agreements, at times even with elements of a common market. This systemic project seeks to encourage this trend and organize it as Nova Pax, a successor to Pax Americana and the foundation for a new world order.  Europe Beyond, 2013  In Europe Beyond, Pelanda recognizes that the temptation is growing among certain nations to go beyond Europe because the EU and Eurozone are seen as dysfunctional. He argues that it would be more productive for Europe to reorganize itself with an outward focus so that it can become more useful for Europeans and the world. This new “post-European” innovation would treat Europe not as an end, but as the means to help stabilize and improve the global system. This extroverted posture would in turn resolve the internal defects that impair the European project today.  The New Progress, 2011  Pelanda argues that progress, defined as continuous improvement in the human condition, is experiencing a crisis. Our system of democratic capitalism has proven most successful at fostering progress through the self-reinforcing virtuous cycle between freedom, capital, and technology. He argues that the system is now weakening, and progress is slowing. The diffusion of wealth in the democratic capitalist system is in decline. Democracy shows signs of degeneration and its global spread is slowing or has stopped entirely. This deterioration occurred because the large abstractions and models that drove democratic capitalism in the past have not been updated and so no longer function. Pelanda identifies seven missions in The New Progress to help restart the virtuous cycle between freedom, capital, and technology: (a) re-launch mass capitalism through new guarantees; (b) modernize and expand the democratic revolution; (c) give a vertical architecture to the global market; (d) search for a new synthesis in moral philosophy; (e) add to the philosophy of analysis that of building; (f) rebuild confidence in technical solutions; and (g) bring about the passage from weak to strong thinking.  Formula Italy: The New National Project, 2010  Pelanda argues that the Risorgimento was a national and liberal project that is now in need of reinvention. His formula for this new national project identifies four transitions necessary to stave off crisis in the Italian national system: (a) from the de-nationalization of culture to positive patriotism; (b) from passive to active guarantees; (c) from weak to contributive sovereignty; and (d) from the horizontal to the vertical state.  The Grand Alliance, 2007  Pelanda argues that the system of world governance built on U.S. dominance, the U.S. Dollar, and the Western nature of international institutions is breaking down. The United States is still the single most powerful country in the world but it is now too “small” to maintain its role as global governor as it has done since 1945. The world has become too big to be governed by one power. Current trends show that divergent regional blocks and mega-nations are forming which will weaken the governance of the global economy and its security problems, increasing the risk of destabilization over the entire planet. In The Grand Alliance, Pelanda recommends a future alliance of the world’s largest democracies: the United States, European Union, Russia, India, and Japan. The gradual convergence of military and economic power within these nations will produce credible global governance based on Western and technical values.  Active Democracy, 2006  Active Democracy outlines three purposes. The first is scientific, rationally evaluating the properties of democracy and the ability to spread it to nations of the world. The second is informational, synthesizing the materials useful to students, scholars, and political activists to deepen the concepts of democracy and democratization. The third is ideological, advocating global democratization in light of its usefulness and feasibility, not in the abstract.  Sovereignty & Confidence, 2005 (with Paolo Savona)  The state was designed to guarantee the rights of individuals belonging to a population with a common culture that resides in a territory limited by borders. The state is the sole guarantor of the rights in that territory and is therefore sovereign. In a globalized world, where events in the territory of one nation can dramatically impact what happens in another, the role of sovereignty comes into question. Liberal internationalists would argue that the state must transfer sovereignty to a supranational body. Hardcore nationalists would argue that you cannot alter the sovereignty of the nation- state. Pelanda and Savona argue for a balanced approach that re-imagines the role of national sovereignty in the context of prioritizing confidence. Confidence is the idea that “the future will be better than today, in a global system that has a growing need for optimism to generate and diffuse wealth.” They argue that a globalized system has emerged without the political architecture necessary to sustain it, and therefore, there is a confidence deficit. The resolution of planetary emergencies requires such a political architecture to facilitate cooperation among states and provide the necessary conditions to build confidence in the global system. Likewise, nations must de-emphasize internal forces of stability and take measures to build confidence in their societies. Pelanda and Savona argue national sovereignty must be re-adapted to this new situation, not thinking that it is untouchable nor ceding all authority to a supranational body. They propose the development of new global standards and tools, which can facilitate the convergence of nations to manage crises and problems beyond the capabilities of their own intervention.  Futurization, 2003  Pelanda describes the possible birth of an era where historical limits on human life and actions can be overcome. Anthropogenic dominance over matter, information and energy can lead to the elimination of biological and ecological constraints, as well as the political, social, cultural, and economic conditions that have hindered human progress. There exists in our collective history the conscious desire for salvation and instinctive curiosity, which has driven motive and capability to overcome seemingly insurmountable barriers to progress. Hope - once reduced to mere reproduction and biological inheritance - now takes on operational and active qualities. There is possible an alliance between curiosity and improvement that can result in boldness and solution. This metaphysical chemistry leads to Futurization. The book outlines seven missions to prepare for and initiate Futurization: (a) Strengthen the capitalist model; (b) Start the cognitive revolution; (c) Build the State of active guarantees; (d) Give the global market a propulsive political architecture; (e) Manage the technological revolution with strong and not weak thought; (f) Steer the artificial ecology; (g) Open the culture of humanism to evolutionary exo- destinies.  Sovereignty & Wealth, 2001 (with Paolo Savona)  In the 2001 book, Sovereignty & Wealth: How to fill the Vacuum of the Globalization, Pelanda and Savona argue that globalization was not fully realized (even a void) at the political level and that this state of affairs threatens globalization at the economic level. The almost total freedom of movement for capital without commensurate freedoms for goods and services introduces pressures to the global capitalist system and the democratic structures that sustain it. The role of nation-states in the re-institutionalization of the global market is to ensure economic competitiveness within their territory. Even more important, however, is cooperation among nations to build the political architecture of the global market that can govern the gap between the hyper-competitiveness of “turbocapitalism” and the organizing structures that sustain it. The world of culture tends to rationalize frustrations over this gap rather than to propose solutions for its governance. Pelanda and Savona articulate a new concept of “balanced sovereignty” that simultaneously renews trust among citizens for the global project through enhanced national sovereignty and ensures the functioning of the international economic system through a new “global political function”.  The Growth State, 2000  Global capitalism is destroying old geoeconomic and geopolitical realities and creating new ones at a rate faster than governments can adapt. The diffusion of wealth in previous decades would therefore be interrupted by the consequences of these new geopolitical and geoeconomic realities for which governments are unprepared. The United States was able to lead a response or respond directly to these interruptions in the past. However, the global system has become too large of a regulatory responsibility for the American system alone. Without coordination of the European and American response, the world can expect future social and military crises. In the 2000 book, Growth State: For a Global Alliance between State and Market, Pelanda proposes a new formulation of the state that performs more efficiently and effectively the mission of helping the majority of citizens have a good position in the market. As wealth inequality grows, polarizing the rich and poor and creating social conflict, the state can prioritize growth or protectionism. Protectionist and aggressive nationalist policies will only accentuate wealth inequality so therefore States have no option but to prioritize growth. The challenge of the growth formulation will be to capitalize each citizen and guarantee their access to technology while at the same time managing the ecological ad technological risks that will inevitably result. The necessity of this growth formulation to avert the deterioration of geopolitical and geoeconomic conditions means that the State must become more important not less, according to this new growth profile.

A truck of 4 tonnes, similar to the Italian Fiat model was manufactured from 1911. It was originally Austro-Fiat, which during the First World War began to develop their own products. In 1925 the Austro-Fiat brand expired and the company became Osterreichische Automobil Fabrik AG, under the abbreviation ÖAF, with preservation of the trademark filed earlier. Also in 1925, a separate company took over sales of Italian Fiat cars, and Austro-Fiat became affiliated with Austro-Daimler and Puch. The last private car, Type 1001A, was different from the earlier Type 1001, having engines and conventional rear axles. The latest model Fiat's truck was TS 1924, equipped with a Fiat engine. The company began production of other models in Austria, which has enabled the company to begin developing its own models. The most popular submitted in 1925 was the AFN light truck AFN with 1.75 tons of payload. This truck used a 42 hp 4 Cylinder Fiat engine 2850 cc, it also used gimbals and real tires, not solid tires, which allowed for a speed of 65 km/h. In 1928, the AF2 appeared and the following year a bus called the Austro-Fiat-1001. It is from this time that the company discontinued the manufacture of passenger cars to concentrate on commercial vehicles, trucks, vans and buses. This allowed the AFL/AFY to be manufactured from 1930 to 1937. MAN acquisition Austrian Army ÖAF-sLKW truck In 1938, when Austria was annexed by the Third Reich, German MAN obtained the majority of shares owned by Fiat in ÖAF, reducing the Italian firm's share to 15%. ÖAF had begun equipping some of its trucks with diesel engines from MAN in 1934. After the Second World War, the Floridsdorf factory was in the Russian zone and the plants were used for Russian reparations. In 1955, ÖAF was released from these payments and the factory began producing trucks again. They went to Austria to build military trucks but the Austrian army eventually selected rival Steyr for its famous Pinzgauer. Only 136 examples of ÖAF's challenger, the Husar, were built between 1967 and 1969. The ÖAF Tornado was a greater success becoming the best-selling truck in Austria. In 1970, the company was privatized again; MAN then let it merge with Gräf & Stift, out of which ÖAF Gräf & Stift arose which in 1971 was fully taken over by MAN. Beginning with the Moskvitch in 1958, ÖAF also acted as Austrian importers of many Russian-made automobiles, including the Lada and the GAZ Volga. In 1982 they also took over the Škoda agency, which they held until 1992 when new owners Volkswagen replaced them. In 1988 they begun importing American Chrysler automobiles, but as of July 1993 the company sourced out automotive imports to a new company. In 2001 MAN renamed the ÖAF Gräf & Stift company MAN Sonderfahrzeuge AG, as part of reorganizations following its June 2001 acquisition of Neoplan. In 2004 the company was renamed MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Österreich AG. All MAN vehicles in Austria could be ordered with an ÖAF-badged grille until 2008, when the ÖAF marque was finally abandoned. MAN continues to manufacture trucks at the former Liesing ÖAF site though, but the company is now named MAN Truck & Bus Österreich GesmbH and manufactures and sells all its products as MAN.

It consists of an area of 90 km2, 3,910 inhabitants and is 200 m above sea level. The two main towns are A Pontenova (Galicia) and Taramundi (Asturias). Geography The Turia Valley is a range of small mountains, ancient oak forests and rivers. It is dotted with small stoned hamlets and villages and is only 25 minutes from the sea and remote beaches. The climate in the region is pleasant throughout the year. As with the rest of northern Spain (or the Green Spain), the climate is more variable than the southern parts of Spain and is characterised by an Atlantic climate. The average temperature in summer is usually around 26 °C. The average temperature in winter is 8 °C (12 °C in the day and 4 °C at night). The Turía River (250 m altitude) gives its name to the valley. The Turia Valley is surrounded by hills and mountains, including, Sierra de Piedafita (900 m), Sierra de Ouroso (1033 m), Sierras de Dendin (900 m), Sierra de Teixedais (900 m) and Sierra de Eirua (700 m). The patrimony of the Valley has more than 60 religious buildings and places of worship, such as the church of San Martin de Tarimundi founded in the 18th century or the Santuario de Santa María de Conforto founded in the 16th century. UNESCO Biosphere Reserve The Turia Valley is part of the Eo River, Oscos and Buron lands Biosphere Reserve. A Biosphere Reserve is an international conservation designation given by UNESCO under its Programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB). The World Network of Biosphere Reserves is the collection of all 531 biosphere reserves in 105 countries (as of May, 2008). Biosphere reserves are created to promote and demonstrate a balanced relationship between humans and the biosphere. The area included in the Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 158,883 hectares of which 215 km2 belong to the area of the Turia Valley. Agriculture, fish farming and tourism are the principal areas of growth for the region. Although there has been a fall in the primary sector in recent years and an increase in the service sectors as rural tourism, agriculture still remains the largest economic activity of local economy. The 14 councils which are part of the below Reserve in Asturias and Galicia register a total of 11,408 jobs. The average income in the area is close to the average regional and national figure. Micro businesses and family run businesses are very characteristic of the region. Construction, commerce, hotels and rural tourism also account for a high percentage of local business. Rural tourism is now a growing activity in all the Reserve, at present there are about 170 establishments catered for rural tourism. Location The Turia Valley is located on the western border of the Cantabrian Mountains in the northwest of Spain and is divided by two counties: Asturias and Galicia (43°33' North and 6°42' West). The valley has two principal towns, A Pontenova (Galicia) and Taramundi (Asturias). The nearest city is Ribadeo (Galicia) and the nearest city is Lugo (Galicia) where all services, including hospitals, can be found. * The Turia Valley is 28 km from Ribadeo and the closest beaches are a 25 minute drive away. * Ribadeo is 95 km from Asturias International Airport (45 minutes when the new road is ready) * Ribadeo is 130 km from Gijon and Oviedo (1 hour) * Ribadeo is 305 km from Santander port with ferries to Plymouth every week (3:10 hours) * The Turia Valley is 190 km from the closest ski resort in the Picos de Europa (2:20 hours) * The Turia Valley is 54 km from Lugo (45 minutes) and 180 km from Santiago de Compostela (2:10 hours) References * Infoasturias.com Electronic tourism brochure edited by the Asturias Council Tourism Department.  http://Taramundi.es Taramundi official website External links * www.turiavalley.com Category:Valleys of Spain Category:Landforms of Asturias Category:Landforms of Galicia (Spain) ","title":"Turia Valley"},{"id":"24119158","text":"Chaungtha ( ) is a town and beach resort located in Ayeyarwady Region, Myanmar.

Biography Born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Wells was a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral Choir School. He became interested in jazz after coming across a recording by Dizzy Gillespie, which he found \\"very exciting\\". He took up playing drums in his early teens: \\"I suppose the thing that really knocked me out about jazz was the rhythm, so I thought if I'm going to be in a jazz band I want to be the drummer.\\"Peter Vacher, \\"Priest who plays, drummer who prays\\", Jazz UK, 77 (October/November 2007), pp. 23–24. He later had lessons from former Miles Davis drummer Philly Joe Jones, who lived in London in 1967–69, and Wells was also very influenced by another of Davis's drummers, Tony Williams. Wells read Greats at Oxford University, where he put together a quartet with tenor player Pat Crumly and pianist Brian Priestley that played with visitors including saxophonists Bobby Wellins, Tony Coe and Joe Harriott, and blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon. In 1968 Wells began a PhD course in philosophy at London University, living in a house that was also home to bass player Ron Mathewson, alto sax player Ray Warleigh, trombonist Chris Pyne and pianist Mick Pyne. Mathewson was then playing in the quartet of tenor player Tubby Hayes, and asked Wells if he would be interested in joining the group. He arranged an audition with Hayes and guitarist Louis Stewart, at which \\"We played a blues, and Tubby looked at Ron and Louis and then said, 'Do you want the job?' Want the job. With the greatest jazz quartet in England?\\" Wells abandoned his PhD and became a professional musician. The pianist Gordon Beck has stated that in his opinion: \\"The union of Ron Mathewson and Spike Wells in Tubby's quartet with Stewart is the single greatest rhythm section in all of British jazz.\\" In 2004 Wells reflected on his hiring by Hayes: > It was an intuitive thing, a bit like people say about Miles Davis. He hired > you because he heard something about your playing that he wanted, and as > long as you provided it, he let you do what you wanted.… There were new > freedoms opened up in the concept of how to play together rather than just > accompanying. We were all spinning ideas off each other in a rather more > democratic way and that was what Tubby liked to get into at that point. I > think he was intent of freeing up the overall concept. And he found that > inspired his own playing.\\"Spike Wells\\", on Woodville Records website. As well as playing with Hayes, in both his quartet and his big band, until the saxophonist's death in 1973, he spent a year in Humphrey Lyttelton's band, and also worked with many visiting soloists at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, including Stan Getz (with whom he toured Scandinavia), Roland Kirk, Art Farmer, Johnny Griffin and James Moody. After five years' study Wells qualified as a solicitor, and then practised law for 22 years, eventually working as in-house legal adviser for Lloyds Bank. He had drifted away from his faith in his teens, but in his early forties he had a \\"reconversion experience\\" and then developed a strong sense of vocation that led him to become a deacon in the Church of England when he was 49 and a year later to take early retirement from the bank and become a stipendiary curate at St Peter's Church, Brighton. As his music-making was still important to him, he later went into non- stipendiary ministry, and now works as both a priest and a musician.

Background Born in (Germany) and orphaned at any early age, he ran away at the age of 15 to escape being forced into priesthood. He came to America as a deck hand on a German vessel. He sacrificed two months’ pay to obtain his freedom and then went on to sail on American ships for three years. For a fourteen-month period in 1905–1906, he worked as a model and general handyman for artist Arthur Burdette Frost. He went to Paris in October 1906 and studied for two years with Jean Paul Laurens at the Academie Julian, spending summers painting landscapes in Normandy. Fischer returned to New York City in January 1908. After being influenced by Howard Pyle, he moved to Wilmington, Delaware where he established a studio at 1110 Franklin Street. Pyle helped him transform his firsthand knowledge into pictorial drama, but had little success in enlivening his lead-colored palette. He freelanced in \\"subject pictures,\\" or illustrations telling a human interest story that were in popular magazines of the day. During World War II he was made the artist laureate of the United States Coast Guard. Fischer married Mary Ellen (\\"May\\") Sigsbee (1877–1960) following her divorce from fellow artist William Balfour Ker (1877–1918). Sigsbee, Balfour Ker and Fischer were all artist and former students of Howard Pyle. After marriage, he adopted his wife's son from her first marriage, David (1906–1922). They first lived in Bushnellsville, New York before moving to a house near the intersection of Elmendorf Street and Ten Broeck Avenue in nearby Kingston. The house still stands today and has a large north facing window that gave Fischer the light he needed to paint. In 1914, the couple had a child of their own, Katrina Sigsbee Fischer (1914–1998). The family eventually settled into a house off Glasco Turnpike in Woodstock, New York just prior to World War II., September 24, 2011 Career as an illustrator After moving back to New York City in 1910, Fischer sold his first illustration to \\"Harper's Weekly\\", then illustrated an \\"Everybody's Magazine\\" story by Jack London, for whom he would illustrate many books and magazine stories until London's death in 1916. Also in 1910, Fischer began illustrating for \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\", a relationship that would last for forty-eight years. He illustrated such stories as Kyne's \\"Cappy Ricks,\\" Gilpatrick's \\"Glencannon,\\" as well as serials by Kenneth Roberts, and Nordoff and Hall. From 1909 to 1920 he created more than one-thousand illustrations featuring women and babies, pretty girls, dogs and horses, sports, the Navy and the sea. He later went on to illustrate Tugboat Annie in 1931. He confessed his favorite character was \\"that old reprobate Glencannon,\\" with the big broom moustache. at saturdayeveningpost.com, April 25, 2009 U.S. Navy Commander Lincoln Lothrop had once written to the artist: “My two lads, one of whom is now a twenty-two- year-old lieutenant in the Navy … used to cut out your pictures and pin them on the walls of their rooms. … You are responsible for recruiting many a seagoing lad.” His work on seas scapes got Fischer an invitation to lunch with Vice Admiral Russell Waesche, Commandant of the Coast Guard for the purpose of recruiting at the height of World War II. The January 9, 1943, Post described a good encounter with the Vice Admiral. Although Waesche knew Fischer was born in (Germany) and anti-New Dealer, but by late that same afternoon, Fischer was sworn in as a lieutenant commander in the Coast Guard. He was charged with putting on canvas some of the heroic deeds of the Merchant Mariners and Coast Guardsmen, then considered at the time the least publicized men of the armed forces. His drawings are archived in the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. Also known for illustrating books such as Moby Dick, Treasure Island, and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Anton Otto Fischer died far from his beloved sea in the Catskill Mountains of Woodstock, New York, in 1962 at the age of 80. The Friends of Historic Kingston hosted a lecture featuring Fischer's great-nephew, Andre Mele, in September 2011. Mele remembered 'Uncle Otto' with a heavy German accent who often enjoyed playing the piano and smoking cigars. He could frequently be found gardening or listening to the New York Yankees on the radio through his headphones. Fischer was often sought after for his investment advice and amassed a $2 million fortune during his lifetime.

The seminary was founded in 1858 in Rochester, New York, and was known as the German Department of the Rochester Theological Seminary. Its purpose was to train pastors for German-speaking people in North America. In 1931, the seminary became known as the German Baptist Seminary, and in 1945, it changed its name to North American Baptist Seminary. In 1949, the seminary relocated to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in order to be more centrally located to its constituents. The name was changed from North American Baptist Seminary to Sioux Falls Seminary on May 18, 2007. In July 2009, the seminary moved into a new, environmentally friendly campus in central Sioux Falls, nestled on the eastern edge of the Augustana University campus. Sioux Falls Seminary offers several Master's level degree programs which include a Master of Divinity, as well as Master of Arts degrees in Christian Leadership, Bible and Theology, Counseling, Marriage and Family Therapy, and Christian Leadership. In addition the seminary oversees a Doctor of Ministry degree, graduate level certificates, and non-graduates certificates. The school is known for contextual learning, an approach that allows students to gain ministry experience while earning their degrees.

It is regarded as extinct, and is known from only three museum specimens, one of which is held by the Manchester Museum,The Manchester Museum specimen is not on show due to its fragility. Anyone interested can, however, arrange to see it. one by the Natural History Museum, London, and the type, which is in the Curtis Collection at Museum Victoria. At first placed in Pancalia or Schiffermuelleria, in 1864 it was separated in a monotypic genus Hamadryas by Clemens. However, his proposed genus name had already been used in 1806, when J. Hübner gave it to the cracker butterflies; Clemens' name was thus a junior homonym and invalid. To replace it, A.R. Grote in 1878 erected the current genus, Euclemensia, honoring Clemens' effort. This too was monotypic at first, and while the relationships of the Manchester tinea are now difficult to study in sufficient detail to determine if such a separation is appropriate, it does still indicate that a quite distinct and peculiar lineage was lost with the extinction of this moth. Discovery The type specimen, in the Melbourne Museum In 1829 an amateur insect collector named Robert Cribb collected a series of about fifty small yellow and brown moths from a rotting alder on Kersal Moor in Salford, near Manchester. These turned out to be a previously unknown species of moth, but they were mistakenly attributed to a friend of Cribb’s, the collector R. Wood, who had asked the entomologist John Curtis to identify them. The moths were named by Curtis as Pancalia woodiella in Wood's honour. > P. Woodiella Curt. Brit. Ent 304—The only specimen I have seen of this > beautiful Moth, which is larger than the others, is a female; it was taken > on Kersall-moor the middle of last June by Mr. R. Wood, of Manchester, to > whom I have the pleasure of dedicating it;—a most zealous and successful > naturalist, to whose liberality I am indebted for many valuable insects. > \\\\- John Curtis see also http://delta-intkey.com/britin/images/text3041.gif Manchester Museum's fragile specimen Enraged by this, and by accusations of fraudulently passing off foreign moths as British, Cribb gave up collecting and left the rest of the collection with his landlady as security for a debt. Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum, Victoria differ as to whether it was Cribb's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings, but either way the result was the same. The debt was not paid on time and when Cribb went back for the moths, which he had already sold to another collector, his landlady had burnt them. Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the moths were unsuccessful, and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species.

Career Gillingham Born in Bermondsey, London, Rooney joined Gillingham as an apprentice professional in 2007. He forced his way into the first team squad in early December 2008 and was an unused substitute in the FA Cup second round replay at Stockport County. In early 2009 he was loaned out to Lewes of the Conference National, where he made six appearances. He turned full-time professional with Gillingham at the start of the 2009–10 season and made his first team debut against Plymouth Argyle in the first round of the Football League Cup. His first Football League appearance was in the 3–0 home win over Exeter City on 5 September 2009, in which he scored his first ever goal for the Gillingham senior team. On 15 March 2010, Rooney joined Conference National side Eastbourne Borough on loan until the end of that season, and made a scoring debut in the 1–1 draw with Grays Athletic. He made his senior debut as a second-half substitute in the 2–1 Football League Cup defeat of Plymouth Argyle and marked his League bow with a goal in the 3–0 win over Exeter City. Soon after he doubled his tally for the campaign with a curling strike from the right edge of the box against Southampton at St Mary's Stadium. He continued his development throughout the season, making a further 23 league appearances, either side of another loan stint at Eastbourne. The highlight of his campaign was a 25-yard drive which snatched a late point for Gillingham in the 1–1 draw with Torquay United at Plainmoor. The midfielder made a goalscoring start to the 2011–12 campaign, netting Gillingham's second in the 3–0 defeat of Plymouth Argyle at Priestfield before scoring from the spot to clinch a point in the 1–1 draw with Accrington Stanley. His third goal of the campaign came in the 5–2 win at Torquay United in October. In total, Rooney made 20 appearances for Gillingham, scoring three times. Swindon Town On 6 January 2012, Swindon Town made a 'six-figure sum' offer for Rooney, which was eventually turned down by the Kent-based club. On 16 January 2012 a new undisclosed offer was made and accepted by Gillingham. On 17 January he signed a two and a half-year deal with Swindon. Rooney made his Swindon debut on 21 January 2012 in a league match at home to Macclesfield Town as a substitute, coming on in the 52nd minute. He made an instant impact providing the cross for Paul Benson to head home the only goal of the game. Rooney scored his first goal for the club in the 3–0 win against promotion rivals Crawley Town. Rooney joined Crawley on loan until January 2014 on 6 August 2013. Following the completion of this loan, he joined Maidstone United on non-contract terms. Luton Town On 21 March 2014, Rooney joined Luton Town on a contract until the end of the 2013–14 season. He played in six games as Luton won promotion to the Football League. In July 2014, Rooney signed a six-month contract extension with Luton. After playing in 12 games, scoring five goals, Rooney's contract was extended until the end of the 2014–15 season. However, he only played in only one more game before his contract was mutually terminated in March 2015. Subsequent career In March 2015, Rooney joined Ebbsfleet United of the Conference South on a contract until the end of the 2014–15 season. He played in six matches before being released. Rooney signed for Crawley Town on 23 June 2015 on a free transfer on a one-year deal. On 8 March 2016, Rooney signed for Phoenix Rising FC in the USA.http://www.crawleytownfc.com/news/article/luke-rooney-crawley- town-2995184.aspx On 14 February 2018, Rooney signed for Billericay Town. At the start of the following season he appeared in pre-season for Southern Counties East League league side Stansfeld. In December 2018, he joined National League South side Welling United, making his debut on 22 December in a 1–1 draw with Hemel Hempstead Town.

The Castrol International Rally drew huge crowds to the forests around Canberra and in the late 1970s was second only to the famous Southern Cross Rally in prestige. The event attracted leading rally drivers and teams from Australia and New Zealand and in its heyday the Castrol International lured world rally champions Ari Vatanen and Stig Blomqvist to compete.

Health Informatics in Canada is run provincially, with different provinces creating different systems, albeit sometimes under voluntary Pan-Canadian guidelines published by the federal body Canada Health Infoway. eHealth Ontario was created in September 2008 out of a merger between the Ontario Ministry of Health's electronic health program and the Smart Systems for Health Agency (SSHA), with a mandate to create electronic health records for all patients in the province by 2015. It has been plagued by delays and its CEO was fired over a multimillion-dollar contracts scandal in 2009. Today eHealth employs approximately 700 people. Drug Profile Viewer System The Drug Profile Viewer System tracks the prescription drug claims information of 2.5 million Ontario Drug Benefit Program and Trillium Drug Program recipients. This system is in use in hospitals throughout Ontario and access is being expanded to health care providers outside of the hospital setting. ePrescribing eHealth Ontario created a pilot project through which some doctors are now able to electronically send prescriptions to participating local pharmacies instead of having to manually write down the prescriptions on paper. That pilot project is ongoing. Consulting and contracting controversies In May 2009, there were opposition calls for Ontario Health Minister David Caplan's resignation after it was revealed that eHealth Ontario CEO Sarah Kramer had approved about $4.8 million in no-bid contracts during the first four months of the agency's operation, while also spending $50,000 to refurnish her office, and paying consultants up to $300 an hour. One consultant earned about $192,000 in five months. Additionally, nine senior eHealth employees had been fired in a four-month period, some reportedly for challenging the agency's tendering practices. Kramer was later forced to resign in June 2009, amid questions surrounding a $114,000 bonus paid to her. She received a $317,000 severance package with benefits for 10 months. eHealth Ontario argued that the no-bid contracts were necessary due to the rapid transition process to eHealth from its predecessor Smart Systems for Health Agency, while Caplan defended Kramer's bonus as part of her move from another agency. The opposition argued that the government of Premier Dalton McGuinty spent five years and $647 million on the forerunner of eHealth Ontario: the Smart Systems for Health Agency, which used 15 per cent of its $225-million annual budget on consultants despite employing 166 people with annual salaries exceeding $100,000, before the project was shut down and restarted as eHealth Ontario. In a public statement, Kramer argued that when she took over as CEO of eHealth Ontario, she \\"was charged with turning around a failing behemoth - SSHA - which had already run through more than $600 million dollars with hardly anything to show for it in terms of moving Ontario closer to the goal of eHealth, and modernizing and improving the quality and safety of health care for Ontarians.\\" Journalists have argued that Sarah Kramer received a \\"trial by media\\" and that the province of Ontario will be at a loss with her departure, as delivery of eHealth initiatives will be slowed. Marcus Gee from the Globe and Mail writes, \\"what happened at eHealth may or may not qualify as scandalous. What happened to Ms. Kramer certainly does. This was media lynching. A good woman and a first-rate civil servant has been hounded from public life, and all of us will suffer for it.\\" Journalists and former health policy advisors have noted that this media attention detracted from the organization’s mandate and ability to deliver on much needed eHealth initiatives and healthcare reform in the province of Ontario. One past policy director for a former Ontario Minister of Health, argued that the public’s focus should be on holding the government accountable for mitigating the problems that have resulted and demanding progress on eHealth. André Picard, a Canadian public health reporter, argued that the public’s focus should be on the delivery of electronic health records and not \\"disingenuous tsk-tsking about the hiring of consultants.\\" He writes, \\"the true scandal in Ontario is the utter failure of the Ministry of Health to create electronic health records, which will ultimately lead to better and more efficient patient care.\\" Picard argued that Ministry of Health bureaucrats are powerless when it comes to making real change in healthcare, as their political boss’s only vision for healthcare is not irritating the public so they can be re-elected. The result is change and innovation can, seemingly, only come from independent agencies or outside consultants. Two inquiries were launched, but in August 2009, the independent review of eHealth Ontario had been dropped, with Caplan saying it would duplicate the work of Ontario's auditor general. On October 6, 2009, David Caplan resigned, one day before the release of the report into spending scandals.

Joaquín Carrillo's brother-in-law General Vallejo, was a critical factor in obtaining the grant. Joaquín Carrillo located and applied for the grant as early as 1844. In 1846 he built an adobe house on the western end of the rancho, within Analy township, near present-day Sebastopol. Joaquín Carrillo was alcalde of Sonoma in 1846, and was taken prisoner during the Bear Flag Revolt. Joaquín Carrillo was the owner of two Sebastopol hotels (the Analy and the Pioneer), a saloon and a boarding house.The Western Sonoma County Historical Society, 2003, Sebastopol, Arcadia Publishing, He was first married to Guadalupe Carrillo (1831–1874), but they were divorced in 1870. Joaquin married Mary Springer of Bodega Bay in 1875. About six weeks later, his son was arrested for shooting his father, Joaquin Carrillo. The shooting was said to be the result of a long-standing family quarrel. Joaquin Carrillo survived the shooting by his son and continued to be a resident of Sebastopol until he died in 1899.Early Sebastopol by John Cummings With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

As a medical student at Lomonosov Moscow State University, he became involved with revolutionary activity and joined the illegal Marxist Rabochiy soyuz (\\"Workers' Union\\"). He was first arrested in 1897. The following year he was exiled to Tula, then Podolsk, where was put under police supervision (equivalent to modern probation). As his brother's renown grew, he endured countless arrests. In 1900 he became a correspondent of Iskra. The following year he graduated from the medical school of the University of Tartu. As a doctor and a Marxist, Ulyanov sought to apply his medical training to the revolutionary struggle. During the Revolution of 1905 he provided medical aid to strikers in Simbirsk. He became a trusted cadre of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party and was a delegate to its 2nd Congress. He served as the representative of the Central Committee in Kiev. His duties carried him throughout Russia and Ukraine, first to Serpukhov, then to Feodosiya and Crimea. At the beginning of the First World War, Ulyanov was mobilized into the army. He served as a medical officer in Sevastopol, in Odessa, and on the Romanian front, continuing his revolutionary activities on the side. In 1916 he married Antonia Ivanovna Neshcheretova. He had a son, Viktor, and a daughter, Olga. Ulyanov remained in Ukraine during the aftermath of the October Revolution and the Civil War, working to strengthen the party apparatus in Crimea and was chairman of the short-lived Crimean Socialist Soviet Republic.Alan W.

In 1921 he moved to Moscow, where he worked at Narkomzdrav (People's Commissariat of Public Health), at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, in the health research department of the Kremlin, and at the V. I. Lenin Central Museum. During the 1930s, he collaborated with his sister Maria (who was named after their mother) to write reminiscences about their famous brother, which were published in serial form. He was a delegate to the 16th and 17th Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He died in Gorki Leninskiye and was buried in Moscow.

Listed at tall and , Schaive batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Springfield, Illinois. Schaive spent 14 years in baseball as a player, manager, coach and scout. He signed with the Chicago White Sox in 1952 and started his career in their minor league system. In 1955, he led the Class D PONY League in four offensive categories. The next season, he attended spring training with the Sox' big league camp, but he had to spend two seasons in military service. When Schaive got back to baseball, he contended he was not the player he once had been and was released by Chicago. Nevertheless, he spent five seasons in the American League, playing from 1958 through 1960 with the original Washington Senators and for the expansion franchise Washington Senators in 1962 and 1963. In a five-season career, Schaive was a .232 hitter (75-for-323) with seven home runs and 32 RBI in 114 games, including 25 runs, 18 doubles, and one triple without stolen bases. A .291 hitter in more than 1,100 minor league games, Schaive hit .293 on the Double-A level and .282 in five Triple-A seasons. During his long minor league career, he served as the player-manager of the expansion Senators' York White Roses farm club of the Double-A Eastern League from late May through September 1963. Schaive even did some pitching. He was 2–3 in 13 appearances as a 20-year-old for the Decatur Commodores of the Mississippi–Ohio Valley League in 1954. Then in 1963 with York, he was 2-1 in eight appearances. Eventually injuries caught up with Schaive, who ended his career in 1966 as a player-manager for the Sultanes de Monterrey of the Mexican League. When his playing days were over, Schaive came back to Springfield, where he helped raise his family. He coached the Springfield Caps of the Central Illinois Collegiate League in the 1970s and became the head coach when Sangamon State University fielded a baseball team. Although he never officially worked as a scout for any professional organization, Schaive served as an area scout for his many friends in baseball. He also was one of the founding fathers of the Springfield Sports Hall of Fame and a charter member in 1991. Scheive died in his hometown of Springfield at the age of 75.

It is currently located at Navy Information Dominance Forces (NIDF) Headquarters, in Suffolk, VA as an independent directorate.  Background  The demand for a focus on EW is greater than ever before. Recent operations throughout the world, and in particular Iraq and Afghanistan, have highlighted the crucial EW support required by the Joint Force Commander. These challenges have a direct application on the ability to perform Navy missions. The impetus for the establishment of the FEWC began in 2005 when the Chief of Naval Operations offered Navy EW expertise to Army leadership to counter a growing, deadly threat from Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIEDs) to the Joint fight in Iraq. This resulted in the formation of Joint CREW (Counter RCIED Electronic Warfare) Composite Squadron ONE (JCCS-1). The Navy has deployed hundreds of EW-qualified Sailors on Individual Augmentation (IA) assignments to Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom with significant success. This successful application of EW into the fight highlights the positive impact that EW has on the battlefield, and just as importantly, how a lack of EW capability could impair US combat capability. In May 2007, NNWC conducted the Navy EW Study to provide a foundation for the development of a strategic implementation plan. The study gave a comprehensive overview of the organizational challenges facing Fleet EW and some of the negative consequences incurred as a result of those challenges. Over 40 interviews were conducted with Fleet EW stakeholders from Echelon I, II, III, and IV commands including operational commands, resource sponsors, acquisition and procurement, research & development, doctrine development, fleet training and individual training. These stakeholder interviews also involved all major warfare communities - Air, Surface, Submarine, Expeditionary, and information warfare. The results of the Navy EW Study culminated in the development of a value chain focusing on the following areas: Fleet EW Integration, EW Capabilities & Requirements, EW Training, EW Force Management, and EW Doctrine/TTP & Policy. This value chain and the results of the stakeholder analysis led to the development of a series of strategic goals, objectives, and initiatives as well as the formation of the FEWC whose sole mission is focused on the improvement of Fleet EW readiness.  Purpose  The FEWC has three major roles: #Consistently maintain visibility and current, accurate information on EW and Spectrum challenges. #Perform the management functions required to enable the EW Readiness Group (EWRG) to resolve deficiencies and, through the Commander, Navy ID Forces, advise the Fleet Commander. #Act as the Fleet's EW/Spectrum \\"DC Central\\" to thoroughly coordinate answers to emergent requirements from higher echelon commanders for all Fleet operational EW. The coordination spans across all naval platforms—air, surface, subsurface and expeditionary—and across doctrine, organization, training, material, leadership and education, personnel and facilities (DOTMLPF). The FEWC also provides for operational control of the Navy and Marine Corps Spectrum Center to handle operational spectrum issues in the electromagnetic battlespace across the globe.  FEWC and EWRG structure  To effectively organize the FEWC, NIDF, as the Operational Agent for EW, leads Fleet EW stakeholders into a cohesive team by facilitating coordination and collaboration efforts among the organizations that influence Fleet EW readiness. To that end, NNWC previously established the EW Integration & Improvement Program (EWIIP), which is the formal process to identify Fleet-centric EW issues and deficiencies and generate an annual EW Integrated Priority Capabilities List (IPCL) to prioritize operational Fleet EW requirements to improve Fleet EW readiness. Navy Cyber Forces (NCF) modified the original structure by establishing the EW Readiness Group (EWRG) to focus on specific elements of EW readiness. The EWRG consists of Fleet EW stakeholder command or organization representatives who are responsible for identifying and promulgating Fleet EW priorities through EWRG members' familiarity with their command's or organization's EW capabilities and requirements. The ultimate goal of the EWIIP is to improve the capability, capacity and readiness of Fleet EW. The EWRG will identify EW capability gaps across doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) and provide readiness recommendations and mitigating actions in support of the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process. These EW capability gaps and recommendations are then reviewed for their applicability to resolve operational Fleet EW requirements. Currently there are four standing EWRGs: # Doctrine & Tactics (D&T;), which develops recommendations for changes to existing doctrine and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) and for new doctrine and TTP in response to emerging threats and technology. # Training & Exercises (T&E;), responsible for identifying unit and strike group Fleet Response Training Plan (FRTP) training and exercise readiness shortfalls and identifying solutions to existing and emerging training and exercise capability/capacity gaps. # Equipment & Experimentation (E&E;), tasked to review EW material capability, maintenance and facility gaps, and determine utility and maturity of emerging/enabling technologies in response to threat based assessments of emerging threat technology. # Workforce Development (WD), responsible for identifying EW manning and leadership/education shortfalls and solutions to existing and emerging manning and leadership/education capability/capacity gaps. ERGs meet during the Fall EWIIP Symposium, focusing on assessing the state of EW and spectrum capabilities and potential gaps in capabilities. This assessment provides the analytical rigor supporting follow-on DOTMLPF changes which address operational capability and capacity gaps in the EW IPCL.

Originating from a tropical depression near Jamaica on October 30, the system initially featured non-tropical characteristics as it tracked northward. By November 2, the system began producing gale-force winds around the low pressure area; however, winds near the center of circulation were calm. By November 3, the system intensified into a tropical storm and was named Greta. Steadily strengthening, Greta attained hurricane intensity on November 4, eventually reaching a peak intensity with 100 mph (155 km/h) winds. Shortly after, Greta began to gradually weaken as it tracked over cooler waters. The storm eventually became extratropical on November 7 over the central Atlantic. Although Greta did not directly impact land as a tropical storm or hurricane, it generated large swells that impacted numerous areas. One person was killed in Puerto Rico and coastal damages from the waves amounted to roughly $3.6 million (1956 USD). Meteorological history Hurricane Greta originated out of a tropical disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Jamaica on October 30, 1956. A Navy reconnaissance plane recorded sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and found an area of low pressure. Around this time, the system was classified as a tropical depression. Although a ship near the system discovered a cold- core circulation—a feature of non-tropical cyclones—it was classified as tropical. By October 31, the depression passed near the western edge of Haiti and later crossed the eastern tip of Cuba before entering the Atlantic Ocean. By the afternoon of November 1, the depression had moved through the central Bahamas and turned towards the northeast. By this time, the central pressure of the depression had decreased to 998 mbar (hPa; 29.47 inHg) and gale-force winds were recorded over a large area, and the system was upgraded to a tropical storm that morning. The system was compared to that of a Kona low, a large-scale subtropical cyclone that forms near Hawaii. Early on November 2, the storm turned northwest in response to an area of high pressure over the central Atlantic. Later that day, the first scientific mission into a hurricane with two planes took place when two research aircraft flew into Greta. During the day, an Air Force B-50 aircraft and NHRP B-47 high altitude jet flew into the storm. The storm executed a counter-clockwise loop, ending on November 3, during which time numerous reconnaissance missions were flown into the system. By this time, the storm had also begun a southeastward track. Continuing to gradually intensify, Greta attained hurricane status on November 4 and later that day it attained Category 2 status on the modern day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.The Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale was not created until 1971; storms prior to that year were called tropical storms or hurricanes After reaching this intensity, the hurricane turned northeastward and accelerated, although it did not intensify further. A reconnaissance mission around this time recorded a minimum pressure of 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Around the time it first reached peak intensity, Greta was an extraordinarily large hurricane, with the gale-diameter of the storm extending roughly 1,200 mi (1,930 km). After attaining its peak intensity, the storm began to move over cooler waters, resulting in the circulation becoming elongated, however it did not weaken over the next couple days. On the morning of November 6, Greta transitioned into an exceptionally large and intense extratropical cyclone. Preparations and impact Although Greta did not directly track over land as a tropical storm or hurricane, the size of the system contributed to large waves, exceeding in height over a large expanse of the Atlantic. Impacts from the storm were felt as far away as the eastern United States. The National Weather Bureau warned ships in the vicinity of the system to take precautions. St. Croix was nearly isolated and stressed into an emergency due to Greta after the storm's swells destroyed docks and prevented ships carrying food from reaching the island. Several light vessels were destroyed by Greta's gale-force winds and only schooners with little carrying capacity were able to make it to the island. Along the coast of Jacksonville, Florida alone, coastal structures sustained roughly $1.2 million (1956 USD; $9.6 million 2009 USD) in damages. In Puerto Rico, waves up to caused significant damage and resulted in the death of one person after he did not evacuate his home. Swells up to were recorded in the Virgin Islands. In Guadeloupe, 80% of the port installations were destroyed by rough seas. In all, damages from Greta amounted to roughly $3.6 million (1956 USD; $ USD).

Therefore, Macedonian was an umbrella term covering Bulgarians, Turks, Greeks, Vlachs, Albanians, Serbs, Jews, and so on. Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Historical Dictionaries of Europe, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , Introduction.During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift. Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Ethnologia Balkanica Series, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2010, , p. 127.At first the revolutionary organization began to work among the Bulgarian population, even not among the whole of it, but only among this part, which participated in the Bulgarian Exarchate. IMRO treated suspiciously to the Bulgarians, which participated in other churches, as the Greek Patriarchate, the Eastern Catholic Church and the Protestant Church. As to the revolutionary activity among the other nationalities as Turks, Albanians, Greeks and Vlahs, such question did not exist for the founders of the organization. This other nationalities were for IMRO foreign people... Later, when the leaders of IMRO saw, that the idea for liberation of Macedonia can find followers among the Bulgarians non-Exarchists, as also among the other nationalities in Macedonia, and under the pressure from IMRO-members with left, socialist or anarchist convictions, they changed the statute of IMRO in sense, that member of IMRO can be any Macedonian and Adrianopolitan, regardless from his ethnicity or religious denomination “Борбите на македонския народ за освобождение”.

Biography Ivan Naumov was born in the village of Oraovec, Veles region, in a poor family.Iliustratsia Ilinden., Tomove 1–3, Ilindenska organizatsia (Sofia, Bulgaria) 1927, str. 27. Because of the lack of finances, he was not able to study and went to work in Thessaloniki. There he learnt about the ideas of the revolutionary organization IMARO and in 1900 he was invited to join the organization by Mihail Apostolov Popeto. He worked as a grocer in Drama and Kavala. Stoyan Avramov described Ivan Naumov as follows: In 1902 he killed a Turk and escaped to Sofia. The same year, he returned as a freedom fighter in the regions of Odrin and Pashmakli. From the beginning of 1903, he was an organizational leader in the region of Krushevo. During the Ilinden- Preobrazhenie Uprising, he headed one of the sections that participated in the burning of the police station in Krushevo. The revolutionary band of Ivan Naumov Alyabaka After the uprising, he went back to Bulgaria. In 1904, he was arrested in Sofia, together with Mamin Kolyu, after the unsuccessful attempt to murder the Turkish consul. They were arrested for six months because of this action in which the consul’s bodyguard was wounded. Afterwards, he entered Macedonia again as a leader of a revolutionary band. When certain disagreements happened in the IMARO, he was among the supporters of Boris Sarafov.Революционната дейност в Кумановско (спомени), Кръстю Лазаров As a leader of a revolutionary band, he toured the regions of Veles, Prilep, Kičevo and Porečje, but because of his conflict with Stefan Dimitrov, who was a leader of a revolutionary band operating in the Veles region, he was ordered not to return there. Ivan Naumov had battles not only with the Turkish military, but also with the Serbian armed propaganda. In 1904, his and Bobi Stoychev’s band were destroyed by the Turkish military, when 16 of his 20 freedom fighters were killed. The same year, a skirmish between his band and Stefan Dimitrov’s band occurred, but fortunately they agreed on the misunderstandings without causing casualties. In 1905, Ivan Naumov's band expelled Dimitar Chupovski from Macedonia, who came to Veles to spread the Misirkov's ideas, which were considered as \\"pro-Serbian\\" and \\"anti- Bulgarian\\".Cărnušanov, Kosta (1992) (in Bulgarian).

In the summer of 1907, Alyabaka entered Macedonia as a leader of one of the largest revolutionary bands, which had 60 freedom fighters, mostly soldiers of the Bulgarian army. Konstantin Kyurkchiev was among its members. This band participated in the Battle of Nozhot (the Knife) and Popadiski Chukari together with the bands of Tane Nikolov, Mihail Chakov, Hristo Tsvetkov, that came from Bulgaria, as well as with the regional bands of Gyore Spirkov and Mircho Naydov, from Prilep, and the village bands of Sekula Oraovdolski and Velko Popadiyski.

He went to save the girl and the ordinary skirmish with the bandits soon turned into a battle with the Turkish military, which came in the meantime. Ivan Naumov was killed in this battle and the inhabitants of Belica buried him beneath the altar of the local church. Notes * Енциклопедия България, том 4, Издателство на БАН, София, 1984.

It is centred on the road of the same name and includes the adjoining streets. Cape Hill starts at Waterloo Road near Shireland Collegiate Academy and ends at the High Street near Victoria Park. Cape Hill finishes at the start of the Dudley Road which forms the boundary with Birmingham and leads to Birmingham City Centre. Cape Hill is Smethwick's busiest shopping area. History The area began to be developed in the latter part of the 19th century. Henry Mitchell bought a large plot of land alongside the road and built his brewery there in 1879. This became Mitchells & Butlers Brewery when he entered into partnership with William Butler in 1897. The brewery grounds even included a county standard cricket pitch where Worcestershire CCC played an annual match.Maxam, Andrew and Harvey, David \\"Smethwick\\". Tempus Publishing, 2007, p21 During the 19th and early 20th centuries the area became a thriving industrial and commercial area and in the 1950s and 60s it was a centre of immigration from the Commonwealth. Facing each other on opposite corners of Durban Road are Cape Hill Primary School and the building which was once the local dispensary. Both were constructed in red brick with terracotta facings, the dispensary in 1888 and the school in 1890. Neither building has changed its exterior appearance to any significant extent. The school is still providing education for the local children but the dispensary is now an \\"at risk\\" Grade II Listed Building. There have been plans to turn the building into an emergency refuge for asylum seekers, a casino and a restaurant but none of these has come to fruition. Smethwick as a whole had several cinemas which had all closed by 1970. The earliest was the Cape Electric Cinema, built in 1911. Just off Cape Hill, on Windmill Lane, was the Gaumont Cinema. The site originally held a skating rink, built in 1909. This was sold and converted into a cinema, named the Rink Picture House, in 1912. In 1928 it was taken over by Denman Picture Houses, the old building demolished and the current building erected. This was the named the Gaumont cinema which lasted until 1964, when it became a bingo hall eventually taken over by the Mecca Bingo chain. The bingo club closed in 2005, but the building still survives in use as the Victoria Suite. Shopping It is a busy shopping area of mainly mostly Asian small businesses, but which also includes Windmill Retail Park including an Asda, Matalan, Iceland and other high street branded stores and various chain fast food restaurants.

Coming from humble origins, she gradually made her way up through the organisation of the labour movement. She served two non- consecutive periods in parliament (1927-30 and 1933-36), but died shortly before she could be elected for a third term. She has been called the Labour Party's foremost female politician in the interwar period. Early life and career Karlsen was born in Oslo (at the time called Kristiania), to rail road engineer Karl Arnesen (1860 - 1923) and Hilda Alette Torgersdatter (b. 1855). It seems as if though her mother died while Helga was still young, and the girl had to go into foster care; in early records she appears under the name of Helga Pettersen. She started working at the age of fourteen, first as a maid, later in a café and in a candy factory. She then worked at a trading company for three years before entering into politics. Karlsen had been involved in the labour movement since she first joined their theatre group in 1899. In the early 1920s she was elected to the city council for the Labour Party. Here, among other things, she argued against municipal funding for the building of the so-called Markus Church on Grünerløkka, on the basis of the acute shortage of housing in the city. Karlsen was also deeply involved in the party's organisation of children's groups. Member of Parliament In 1927 she was elected to Parliament as the first female representative of the Norwegian Labour Party. It was during this period that she was fined the sum of NOK 500, for donating money to striking construction workers. After a poor election for the party in 1930, she lost her position, but regained it in 1333. In the meanwhile she was, as the first woman ever, elected chairman of Oslo Arbeidersamfunn (Oslo Workers' Society) in 1932. In 1935 she participated at the International Labour Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Here she delivered a well-received speech in favour of the 40-hour week. In 1936, while running for a third term in Parliament, Karlsen fell ill. She was rarely unwell, but the busy schedule of the campaign had taken a great toll on her. She died only four days before the election. Karlsen was buried from the People's Houses in Oslo, where the eulogy was delivered by Martin Tranmæl. She was survived by her husband, Fredrik Emanuel Karlsen (1873 - 1942), whom she had met through the labour movement.

Belgrade) is a Serbian and former Yugoslav synthpop band, notable as one of the pioneers of the former Yugoslav electronic music scene.  History   Early career (1980-1981)  The band was formed in Belgrade on late 1980 by Slobodan Stanić \\"Gricko\\" (synthesizer) and Ljubodrag Bubalo \\"Ljuba\\" (bass guitar, synthesizer), the latter being a former member of Uliks (the embryonic Zana) and Rulet, whom, influenced by Kraftwerk and Ultravox, decided to form a synth-oriented band. The two then invited the Električni Orgazam keyboard player Ljubomir Đukić to join the band, but the deal eventually fell through. During the following year, the duo was joined by Ljubodrag's brother Milan Bubalo \\"Mića\\" (rhythm machine, electric drums) and Dejan Stanisavljević (synths, vocals). In the meantime, the band had recorded their newly written material on a four-channel Teac cassette recorder. Beograd had their first live performance at the Belgrade Dadov Theatre where they performed with an additional member who had sequenced the rhythm machine behind the stage. On their latter live appearances, the band continued the trend of adding another member, usually the U Škripcu drummer Miloš Obrenović, mainly performing in Dadov and KST. At the time, Stanić had left the band, and after a two-month break, the band continued working as a trio. Intending to replace Stanić's playing with music samples, previously recorded by the band themselves, the band used the backing tracks on their live performances.  Success and breakup (1982-1983)  During the Spring of 1982, the band released the first Yugoslav electronic music single, \\"Sanjaš li u boji\\" (\\"Do You Dream In Color?\\") with the song \\"TV\\" as the B-side. The single, featuring Dejan Stanisavljević as the author of both music and lyrics, arranged and produced by Saša Habić, was released through Jugoton.\\"Sanjaš li u boji?\\" / \\"TV\\" at Discogs Because it had been released in 500 copies only, the single is today considered a rarity and a collector's item. From August until November 1982, the band had been recording the material for their debut album at the PGP RTB studio V. The following year, the label released their debut album Remek depo (a pun for the term Remek delo which means A Masterpiece, here addressing the word Deposit), featuring a combination of synthpop and brass instrument-oriented soul. The album was produced by Saša Habić and featured saxophonist Paul Pignon, trumpeter Stjepko Gut and timpanist Borislav Pavićević \\"Bora Longa\\" as guest performers. The album reached the fourth position on the Džuboks magazine top ten Yugoslav rock albums list in March 1983, and remained on the top ten list for twelve weeks. After the album release, on mid-1983, Stanisavljević left the band and thus Beograd disbanded.  Post-breakup (1983-2011)  After the Beograd disbandment, the three members continued working in similar musical directions with other bands. Slobodan Stanić, with the Defektno Efektni and Urbana Gerila members, formed the band Berlinen Strasse, influenced by the British post-punk and gothic rock scene and the German krautrock scene, performing songs with lyrics in German language. As Berlinen Strasse, with the song \\"Maske\\" (\\"Masks\\"), the band appeared on the various artists compilation Ventilator 202 demo top 10 in 1983. The band also appeared in the movie Nešto između (Something In Between) performing the song \\"Achtung America\\" (\\"Attention America\\"). Ljubodrag Bubalo made a guest appearance on the Berlinen Strasse song \\"Maske\\" as the rhythm machine sequencer. During the same year, he had also appeared as the rhythm machine sequencer on the U Škripcu second studio album O, je! (Oh, Yeah!), on the track \\"Ples žutog lista\\" (\\"A Yellow Leaf Dance\\"). He formed a synthpop band Haj'mo (C'mon) which released the 1984 EP Irina (Irene) before disbanding. Haj'mo also featured Milan Bubalo on drums and rhythm machine. The two brothers, signed as the Bubalo Bros, appeared on the Bebi Dol nationwide hit single \\"Rudi\\" (\\"Roody\\") as drum machine programmers. Milan Bubalo joined the band Laki Pingvini (The Easy Penguins), with whom he released the highly successful EP Šizika (Crazyca), released in 1983, and the studio albums, Muzika za mlade (Youth Music), released in 1984, and Striptiz (Striptease), released in 1985, before the band disbandment in 1989. He had reunited with Laki Pingvini in 1994 at the unplugged festival Bez Struje, organized at the Belgrade Sava Centar, from which the recording of the unplugged version of \\"Šizika\\" appeared on the festival compilation album Bez struje (Unplugged), as special guests at the Delča i Slkekovi concert in March 2006, and as an opening act for the Duran Duran Belgrade concert held on October of the same year. He had made guest appearances as the drum machine programmer on the U Škripcu second studio album O, je!, on the hit song \\"Siđi do reke\\" (\\"Come Down To The River\\"), on all the tracks of the VIA Talas only studio album Perfektan dan za banana ribe (A Perfect Day for Bananafish), and the Jakarta debut single \\"Amerika\\" (\\"America\\"), all released in 1983. Dejan Stanisavljević had worked with Du-Du-A with whom he released the 1996 album Ritual, and appeared on the Bez struje compilation album with an unplugged version of the song \\"Era Vulgaris\\". He had appeared as the keyboard player on the Bebi Dol album Ruže i krv, released in 1984. Stanisavljević later lived and worked in Canada as an Electronic Arts animator. In October 2011, it was announced that the German record label Anna Logue Records would release a 7\\" EP TV, featuring both tracks from the band's debut single, the song \\"Mrak\\" (\\"The Dark\\"), from the album Remek depo, as well as instrumental demo versions of the songs \\"TV\\" and \\"Mrak\\", recorded during the band's demo phase on ORWO cassettes.  Reunion (2012-present)  In August, 2012, the band, consisting of the original members Dejan Stanisavljević (synthesizer, vocals) and Milan Bubalo (Ableton Live sequencer), with the new members, Sana Garić (synth, vocal), Igor Panić \\"Ziggy\\" (guitar, pedals) and Miroslav Ćatić (drums), reunited, holding their first performance at the Belgrade club 20/44 on September 9, 2012. The band performed, beside their own songs, several songs by Garić's band Xanax. In June 2015, the band released their comeback album, Pola/pola (Fifty/Fifty).\\"Povratak grupe Beograd – Novi album i reizdanje “Remek depo”-a\\", balkanrock.com The album cover was designed by famous comic book artist Aleksa Gajić.

The album was split into two sections, based on the tracks' pitch standard, the 440 Hz and the 432 Hz section. The second section featured songs in which the band experimented with Oriental music elements.

Trophy Kids stars Ryan Eggold, David Gallagher, Tahyna Tozzi, Nathan Lee Graham, Tibor Feldman, Tania Raymonde, David Thornton, Chris Beetem, Adam Grupper, Eleanor Reissa, and Isiah Whitlock, Jr. The film's title refers to the generation of Americans also known as \\"Millennials,\\" who grew up receiving trophies and other praise just for participating and not necessarily for excelling. They were rewarded to improve their self-esteem. As a result, trophy kids feel confident and accomplished, but the coddling has led them to feel entitled with often unrealistic expectations about their jobs and life in general. Plot To win the celebrity and self-made wealth he craves, an aimless, twenty-something Manhattan playboy devises a film based on his party-boy, club-going lifestyle, and hires a self-destructive aspiring playwright to ghost the feature script. As the mismatched pair struggles to complete the script and get a handle on their misdirected lives, they reveal the sometimes comedic, sometimes tragic behaviors of 'Generation Y'- a generation taught to believe each was incomparably special and messianically gifted. Though they begin to vie for the affections of the same girl, and their chance at success and happiness threatens to crumble, they ultimately each find their own, unique life truths. Production Trophy Kids was filmed in New York City and wrapped principal photography in early July 2009.

It was used for cropdusting and air charter operations, with no scheduled commercial services. The airport is no longer used and is in a state of total abandonment. The Gila River Tribal Police routinely patrol the area and issue civil trespassing citations to people caught on the property.http://www.ecollegetimes.com/all-abandoned-8-forbidden-forgotten- spots-around-arizona https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/criminal-trespass-on- gila-river-reservation-at-wha-2894723.html History Gila River Memorial Airport was built in 1942 as Williams Auxiliary Army Airfield #5, one of several satellite airfields for Williams Army Airfield. After the war, it was renamed Goodyear Air Force Auxiliary Airfield, with its original triangular configuration modified to accommodate early jet aircraft of the 1950s. During the 1960s, it passed on to civilian control as Goodyear Airport, then as Memorial Airfield. No hangar space existed at the airport until the late 1970s, when the airport began playing host to older piston-engined transport aircraft, many of which had been converted for use as air tankers. The majority of the converted aircraft were operated by Biegert Aviation. By the 1990s, it had become an aircraft boneyard. By 2007, the Gila River Indian Community had assumed control of the airfield, renaming it Gila River Memorial Airport, and all commercial tenants were evicted from the property in the hopes of turning the airfield into a casino. In 2008, numerous aircraft were still present, including C-54s, DC-4s, DC-7s, PV-2s, and a Howard 500. Many of them have since been removed, with some of the old airport outbuildings dismantled, with further plans to expand and develop the airport still in progress.  Facilities and aircraft  Facilities Gila River Memorial Airport covers and has two asphalt runways: * 03/21 is * 12/30 is The last recorded aircraft operations were for the 12-month period ending November 16th, 1983. These statistics show that the airport had about 25,550 aircraft operations, an average of 70 per day. These statistics show that the traffic was made up of 98% general aviation aircraft and 2% military aircraft. Aircraft 61 aircraft were based at this airport: 31 single-engine and 30 multi-engine.

It is the only organization in the world dedicated to women heads of state and government. In August 1996, she co-founded the Council with President Vigdís Finnbogadóttir of Iceland. The work of the Council expands the understanding of leadership, establishes a network of resources for high-level women leaders, and provides a forum for the group to provide input and shape international issues important to all people. The Council's mission is to promote good governance and enhance the experience of democracy globally by increasing the number, effectiveness, and visibility of women who led at the highest levels in their countries. The Council is an affiliate of the United Nations Foundation and is currently chaired by President Dalia Grybauskaitė of Lithuania. From 1992-1996, as director of the Women's Leadership Project, Liswood identified global leadership contributions by women heads of state. She interviewed 15 current and former women presidents and prime ministers, which is chronicled in her book and video documentary, Women World Leaders (1996, 2007 and 2009, HarperCollins). Her quest was to find out what it would take for a woman to become President of the United States. In 1997, Liswood co-founded The White House Project, which is dedicated to electing a woman President of the United States. Her work with women presidents and prime ministers was the inspiration for the Project, which seeks to change the cultural message in the United States about women as leaders. In 2001, Liswood was named Managing Director, Global Leadership and Diversity for Goldman Sachs, a premier global investment bank. Then from 2002 to 2015, Liswood held the position of Senior Advisor at Goldman Sachs, a global investment bank.

She received the Westinghouse Award of Excellence for her contributions to women and minorities in the workplace. She has held management positions in the airline industry, including general manager for Pacific Northwest and for TWA.  Publications  Liswood is the author of Serving Them Right (Harper Business 1991). Liswood's latest book, The Loudest Duck, is a business guide that explores workplace diversity and uses practical stories to offer an alternate, nuanced approach to diversity to create a truly effective workplace for all (Wiley & Sons, November 2009).  Experience  Liswood, a nationally recognized speaker, author, and advisor, has contributed to leadership and diversity in the women's community for more than 20 years as a member of the International Women's Forum, Leadership America, the board of the First Women's Bank of California, and the Washington Women's Political Caucus. Former commissioner of the City of Seattle's Women's Commission, Liswood was the owner/publisher of Seattle Woman and is the founder of May's List, a bipartisan political donor network emphasizing women's leadership in the political arena. In 2000, the U.S. Secretary of Defense appointed her to a three-year term on the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS). After the events of September 11, 2001, Liswood joined the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department reserve police force, and recently retired as a Sergeant.

Brooker claimed that it would attempt to prove that video games can be just as engaging as television and just as dumb. He said to \\"Expect pixels, joypads, some of the world's weirdest games, celebrity cameos and the occasional sound effect.” In the show, Brooker reviews Wolfenstein, 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand and The Beatles: Rock Band. The show also contains contributions from Dara Ó Briain, Robert Florence, Ryan Macleod, Larry Bundy Jr, Rebecca Mayes and Graham Linehan. Reception The debut airing of Gameswipe drew 361,000 viewers, outdoing the typical performances of both Screenwipe and Newswipe. UK video games trade magazine MCV said of the show: \\"It’s fair to say that the reaction from the industry to last night’s TV debut of Charlie Brooker’s Gameswipe was mixed. But if its intention was to offer an informed, reasoned and mature take on the games industry of both past and present, then it’s hard to regard the show as anything other than an overwhelming success.\\" The future In October 2009, Brooker told MCV that he would consider working on either a further episode of Gameswipe or, potentially, a brand new series, though he added that he himself may choose not to present the show.

Downstream and return-path transmission use different wavelengths to share the same fiber (typically 1550 nm downstream, and 1310 nm or 1590/1610 nm upstream). The return-path wavelength standard is expected to be 1610 nm, but early deployments have used 1590 nm. Using 1590/1610 nm for the return path allows the fiber infrastructure to support both RFoG and a standards-based PON simultaneously, operating with 1490 nm downstream and 1310 nm return-path wavelengths. Advantages RFoG delivers the same services as an RF/DOCSIS/HFC network, with the added benefit of improved noise performance and increased usable RF spectrum in both the downstream and return-path directions. Both RFoG and HFC systems can concurrently operate out of the same headend/hub, making RFoG a good solution for node-splitting and capacity increases on an existing network. RFoG allows service providers to continue to leverage traditional HFC equipment and back-office applications with the new FTTP deployments. Cable operators can continue to rely on the existing provisioning and billing systems, cable modem termination system (CMTS) platforms, headend equipment, set-top boxes, conditional access technology and cable modems while gaining benefits inherent with RFoG and FTTx. RFoG provides several benefits over traditional network architecture: * More downstream spectrum; RFoG systems support 1 GHz and beyond, directly correlating to increased video and/or downstream data service support * More upstream bandwidth; RFoG's improved noise characteristics allow for the use of the full 5–42 MHz return-path spectrum. Additionally, higher-performance RFoG systems not only support DOCSIS 3.0 with bonding, but also enable 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) upstream transmission in a DOCSIS 3.0 bonded channel, dramatically increasing return-path bandwidth. * Improved operational expenses; RFoG brings the benefits of a passive fiber topology. Removing active devices in the access network reduces overall power requirements, as well as ongoing maintenance costs that would normally be needed for active elements (such as nodes and amplifiers). Both cost savings and increased capacity for new services (revenue generating and/or competitive positioning) are driving the acceptance of RFoG as a cost-effective step on the path towards a 100-percent PON-based access network. Implementation As with an HFC architecture, video controllers and data-networking services are fed through a CMTS/edge router. These electrical signals are then converted to optical ones, and transported via a 1550 nm wavelength through a wavelength- division multiplexing (WDM) platform and a passive splitter to a fiber-optic micro-node located at the customer premises. If necessary, an optical amplifier can be used to boost the downstream optical signal to cover a greater distance. The fiber-optic micro-nodes – which are also referred to as RFoG optical-networking units (R-ONUs) – terminate the fiber connection and convert traffic for delivery over the in-home network. Video traffic can be fed over coax to a set-top box, while voice and data traffic can be delivered to an embedded multimedia terminal adapter (eMTA), which connects to analog telephone lines over the subscriber’s internal phone wiring and to PCs via Ethernet or WiFi. The return path for voice, data, and video traffic is over a 1310 or 1590/1610 nm wavelength to a return path receiver, which converts the optical signal to RF and feeds it back into the CMTS and video controller. Although RFoG is providing a capacity increase, one undesired effect of the system is that more than one R-ONU can have the optical return path activated at the same time and on the same wavelength (for instance, one R-ONU falsely triggered by ingress); thus, an optical collision may occur (optical beating). R-ONUs convert optical signals into electrical ones. This is done in place of the same function traditionally performed back at the higher-level serving area nodes in the HFC network. The RF infrastructure remains in place; the difference is that the fiber termination is moved from a fiber node to the customer's premises. The R-ONU can be located in any type of premises: a home, a business, a multi-tenant dwelling (MTU/MDU), or apartments in an MTU. When the network is upgraded, the RFoG elements can remain in place while the provider rolls out the necessary components (OLTs and ONTs) for a full PON implementation. Standards The Society of Cable and Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) has approved SCTE 174 2010, the standards for RFoG. The standard has been approved by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI). Status Cable service providers (also known as MSOs) have generally responded favorably to the technology and the benefits it brings to their networks. Many have tried the technology, and some have begun to deploy RFoG. Following positive experience with smaller deployments in newly built housing and with the finalization of the standard, it is expected to become more widely adopted.

Life She was born in Cloona House in Dunmurry, County Antrim, Ireland into a well-to-do family. She was educated privately, at Victoria College, Belfast, in Caen, France, then Bedford College, London and Queen's College, Belfast and never graduated, though it was later claimed she had been a lecturer in Classics at Bedford Women's College. Her family were members of the Church of Ireland, but she converted to Catholicism after leaving home. She worked for various shipping companies and then as a freelance journalist in Dublin. At the height of the Bicycle Craze she contacted Richard J. Mecredy, the proprietor of the Dublin-based Irish Cyclist, expressing her interest in cycling and journalism. in 1891 she became a contributor to the magazine and two years later she became sub-editor. She then took over the magazine's sister publication, the Social Review, which she edited until 1903. But she had long harboured a desire to see the Pacific Ocean, and in 1904 she was engaged by the (London) Daily Graphic to report on the Pacific islands, reportedly sailing around the Pacific islands in her own cutter. She was commissioned to write publicity for Cook Islands, Fiji, Niue, Samoa, and Tonga. In 1907 she sailed to Papua on a commission from The Times and the Sydney Morning Herald, but remained for twenty-seven years, much of the time at Rona Falls.Duncan, Joyce. 2002. Ahead of Their Time: A Biographical Dictionary of Risk-taking Women, pp. 171-172. Greenwood Publishing Group. She became a close friend of Sir Hubert Murray and his unofficial publicist. She joined exploration parties and managed plantations, including one with her brother Ramsay. She also corresponded with Alfred Deakin- Australia's second, fifth and seventh Prime Minister regarding her work in the Pacific. In 1936, in company with brothers Ramsay and Osborne she retired to Kelso, New South Wales, where she remained for the rest of her life.

Career Born in Holly Hill, South Carolina, Eddie Sweat was one of nine children of a sharecropper. Holly Hill was where future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer Lucien Laurin maintained a Thoroughbred horse farm. Laurin offered Sweat a job after he saw the wide-eyed teen frequently peeking at the horses through a fence to the property. In 1957, at age eighteen, Sweat accepted the offer of full-time work as groom for the Laurin stable of racehorses with a small fixed salary plus 1% of the horse's earnings. One of the first highly successful horses placed in Sweat's care was the 1958 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly Quill. In 1966, Sweat was part of the Laurin stables' first American Classic win when Amberoid captured the Belmont Stakes. Six years later, Sweat gained national media attention for his abilities in handling Thoroughbreds when sportswriter William Nack spent many hours with him during 1972 and 1973 outside the Laurin stable stalls of Kentucky Derby winner Riva Ridge and Secretariat. In a Sports Illustrated feature article, Nack said he took notes compulsively, endlessly, feeling for the texture of the life around the horse.Nack, William. June 4, 1990. \\"Pure Heart\\". Sports Illustrated. Retrieved August 30, 2009. Secretariat was voted the 1972 American Horse of the Year, an extraordinary feat for a two-year-old, and leading up to and through the horse's winning of the 1973 Triple Crown, all of the key people involved with Secretariat received massive national and international attention. Interviewed and photographed countless times, Sweat appeared on television and was on the covers of both Ebony and Jet magazines. Eddie was also the first groom to ever have groomed Kentucky Derby winners two years in a row, Riva Ridge in 1972 and Secretariat in 1973. Following Lucien Laurin's retirement, Sweat worked for his son, Roger Laurin, and in 1984 once again received considerable national media attention with Chief's Crown. The colt won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, was voted the Eclipse Award as American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, and was the betting favorite for all three of the 1985 Triple Crown races. Death Sweat made his home in St. Albans, Queens, New York, a short drive from the Belmont Park racetrack. After 41 years in the business, he died of leukemia in 1998. Legacy Widely recognized for his talent, dedication, and important contributions to Secretariat's racing career, Sweat was the subject of a 2006 book by Lawrence Scanlan, titled The Horse God Built: Secretariat, His Groom, Their Legacy.Langston, Patrick.

He was born in London in 1943Saved by the book. The Guardian, 5 August 2008. to Irish immigrant parents in London's Kentish Town. Leaving school at the age of 14, he spent his formative years in the army, where he had a successful boxing career. Dishonourably discharged for drunkenness and going absent without leave, Healy began a downward spiral that brought him into the subculture of London's homeless street drinkers. He spent fifteen years as a homeless alcoholic and was convicted of many petty crimes during this time.  Chess  During one of his prison stretches he learned the game of chess from a fellow cellmate, Harry 'the Fox'. Finding that he had a special aptitude for the game, he decided to give up drinking and with the help of his Probation Officer, Clive Soley (now Clive Soley, Baron Soley), he made his first moves back into normal life. He has remained sober since. His chess career continued for ten years and despite the ravages of his years spent on the streets he became a highly rated player, capable of conducting several games concurrently. In 2010, his booklet \\"Coffeehouse Chess Tactics\\" was published by the well-known chess publishing house New in Chess, and was shortlisted for the Guardian Chess Book of the Year.  The Grass Arena  Having given up his ambition of becoming a Grandmaster, Healy retired from tournament chess and began to write his life story, which was published in 1988 by Faber and Faber. The Grass Arena was instantly recognised as a classic of the memoir genre, and won many awards including the J. R. Ackerley Award for Literary Autobiography. His second book, the novel Streets Above Us, fared less well and is currently out of print.  Film  In 1990 The Grass Arena was filmed, and the film, also titled The Grass Arena, won many awards, principally the inaugural Michael Powell Award for Best British Feature at the Edinburgh Film Festival. A documentary about Healy's life and work, titled Barbaric Genius, directed by Paul Duane and produced by Screenworks Film and TV premiered at the Jameson Dublin International Film Festival in 2011.  Dispute  Following a dispute with Faber and Faber in 1991, the book went out of print in the UK, and remained so until 2008. It remained in print, however, in France, where it is published by Gallimard. The Grass Arena was republished in 2008 with a new introduction by actor Daniel Day-Lewis.

Its primary objective is to rehabilitate orphaned elephant calves for ultimate release back into the wild. History Sri Lankan elephants (Elephas maximus maximus) are an endangered species and their survival in their natural habitats is threatened due to human activities. Elephants in the wild are constantly being killed, and many elephant calves become orphaned. In order to support these orphaned elephants, the Department of Wildlife Conservation set up the Elephant Transit Home within Udawalawe National Park with help from the Born Free Foundation. The facility was established under the 29th Amendment to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance Part II. As of 8 February 2009, 39 orphaned elephant calves were being looked after. The elephant calves are released to the jungle after they become strong enough to survive in their natural habitats. As of 2008, sixty- five elephants had been released to the jungle. Facilities and care The main objective of this facility is rehabilitation of orphaned baby elephants to ultimately release them back into their natural habitat. Up to three elephants per week are killed in Sri Lanka due to conflicts with humans, often leaving behind orphan calves. The elephants are kept at part of the Udawalawe National Park to maintain familiarity with their habitat, but have access to both food and medical care. All care at the facility is by trained staff, and efforts are made to minimize contact between elephants and humans to keep the elephants from becoming acclimated to humans. Although visitors can watch the elephants being fed, they are not allowed to touch or otherwise interact with them. There is also an Information Centre set up and maintained by Dilmah Conservation at the facility. The centre houses an extensive collection of information on elephants, from their origins and evolution to their social behavior and threats. It was established to give visitors a better understanding of elephants and their plight. Additionally, a solar heater was set up at the facility by Dilmah Conservation to heat the water used to make the milk fed to the orphaned elephants. Foster parent scheme Since caring for elephants is expensive, the Department of Wildlife Conservation created a foster-parent program to help pay for the required food and medicine. Individuals and groups that foster an elephant are entitled to certain privileges, including: * Naming the elephant. * Taking photographs of the elephant. * A free circuit bungalow in Udawalawe National Park for two days per year. * Publicity for the foster-parent * The foster-parent and elephant's name displayed at the Elephant Transfer House and the head office of the department. * Involvement in the release when the elephant is returned to the wild. Release program thumb While at the center, contact with humans is deliberately minimized so that the elephants will not acclimate to humans. Elephant calves are looked after until they are 5 years old, when they are released into the wild. The elephants are fitted with radio collars to help wildlife officials monitor their movements, behavior and progress. To erase any residual human smell and help ensure their acceptance among their wild cousins, the elephants are given a bath in diluted elephant dung before being released.

Life   Family  Overbeck was the son of the lawyer (and consultant to Schonenfahrer Company) Georg Christian Overbeck (1713-1786) and his wife Eleonora Maria Jauch (1732-1797), and also grandson of the superintendent Caspar Nikolaus Overbeck (1670-1752). He was the nephew of the rector of the Katharineum, Johann Daniel Overbeck (1715-1802). Overbeck's son was the painter Friedrich Overbeck (1789-1869), and his grandson was the archeologist Johannes Adolph Overbeck (1826-1895). In 1781 Overbeck married Elisabeth Lang (1753–1820), whose family was originally from Nürtingen and shared ancestors with Friedrich Hölderlin and Ludwig Uhland.Sellheim (siehe Literatur), S. 262, Anm. 63  Education  He studied at the Katharineum of Lübeck, of which the rector was his uncle Johann Daniel Overbeck (1715-1802), and then from 1773 to 1776 studied law at the University of Göttingen, meanwhile attending lectures on philosophical, mathematical, scientific and historical subjects. Overbeck had many friends in the Göttinger Hainbund, but was never a member. In 1788 he acquired his doctorate and from then on prefixed his name with \\"Dr.iur.utr.\\"  Professional career  Christian Adolph Overbeck. Portrait by Rudolph Suhrlandt, 1818 Overbeck's career began with a failed attempt in 1776 to found a school, the Erziehungsanstalt für Knaben, in Bremen, after the example of Joachim Heinrich Campes. In the same year he began his legal career as a barrister in Lübeck, and in 1779 he was appointed Supreme Court procurator. In 1792 he became assistant general counsel of the cathedral chapter of Lübeck, and in 1799 a consultant to the Schonenfahrer Company, the so-called Schütting, just as his father had been. In 1800 this was followed by his appointment to the Senate of Lübeck. In 1804 he was a representative of Lübeck in St Petersburg, and in 1808-9, 1810 and 1811 a representative of Lübeck in Paris, when he attended the wedding of Napoleon I of France with Marie-Louise of Austria. During Lübeck's occupation by France he filled the office of Receveur de la caisse communale. In 1814 he finally became Burgomaster of Lübeck.  Other responsibilities  On 16 October 1776 Overbeck joined the Freemasons' lodge Zum goldenen Zirkel in Göttingen and on 31 March 1777 became a member of the Lübeck lodge Zum Füllhorn, where from 1791-1797 he served as chairman five times. In 1779 he became Mitstifter at another Lübeck lodge, Zur Weltkugel. He was an Illuminatus under the name Anacreon.Matrikel der Loge zum goldenen Zirkel im Geh.

The novel follows the life of Leopold Bloom King in Charleston, South Carolina. It ranges from his troubled childhood to his adult life with his close group of friends. Plot summary The story is divided into five parts. Part one focuses on introducing the reader to Leopold Bloom King (Leo), his family, and his set of friends who he meets on a fateful Bloomsday (June 16, 1969). Leo is the narrator of the story who gradually reveals his troubled childhood which was traumatized by the sudden and unforeseen suicide of his older brother Steve. He reveals himself to be a paper-boy for the South of Broad delivery area, thus introducing the reader to the Charleston neighborhood. Hints at a previous run-in with the law are given and he will exit his parole period that summer. He then introduces the reader to his loving father and strict mother and how their life stories shaped their characters. An influential Catholic priest named Monsignor Max is also introduced, and he proves to be lifelong companion to Leo's mother after Leo's father passes away. On Bloomsday, 1969, Leo performs a series of tasks that leads him to meet his soon-to-be friends. He bakes cookies for his new dramatic neighbors Sheba and Trevor Poe and their alcoholic mother. He then meets the two orphans Niles and Starla who he finds tied down to chairs and wins their confidence by untying them. He then appears with his mother at a gathering at the Charleston yacht club where he meets Chad, Molly, and Fraser; three affluent teens, two of whom were kicked out of their respective private schools. Lastly, he meets his new high school football coach (the coach is black and will coach the first ever integrated team at Peninsula High) and later will meet Ike, the coach's fiery and talented son who will co-captain the team with Leo. Eventually, all the characters (including Betty, another orphan) will meet each other and become friendly, despite the major differences and cultural struggles between black and white, city and country, and rich and poor. Part two of the story occurs twenty years later, when Leo (who is now a newspaper columnist) is interrupted from work by Sheba Poe, who is now a famous actress who flew back to Charleston from Hollywood. After a series of embarrassing moments and behavior for Sheba during which time Leo's old high school friends unite, Sheba reveals that she has lost contact with her brother Trevor, whom she suspects is dying of AIDS in San Francisco at the height of its outbreak among the gay community. Leo, who had since that time married and separated from a mentally-ill Starla, reveals his love for Molly, who has grown apart from her philandering husband Chad. Part three is set in San Francisco, where Leo and his friends go to find Trevor. After volunteering with a food bank, the characters discover the shocking conditions of people with AIDS and the devastating effects the virus has on its victims. A tip from an unlikely source results in a daring rescue attempt to find Trevor, who is found close to death and trapped in a crumbling building in the Tenderloin area. The friends then return to Charleston with Trevor, but not after a frightening encounter with Trevor and Sheba's father, who terrorizes the friends with his mystery and his violent antics. Leo and Molly become increasingly close to one another. Part four is a flashback to 1969 which follows the success of Peninsula High's football team and retraces Leo and his friends' ever-strengthening friendships. A series of incidents involving Chad's behavior stretches the friendships at times and reveals hints at future problems and character flaws for several characters. The histories of Sheba, Trevor, Niles, and Starla are revealed and are emotionally damaging. Leo reveals a positive story from his life: his luck when a lonely antique store shopkeeper he cared for during his parole died and left Leo with a home on Tradd Street and a large fortune from the inheritance. Part five returns to Charleston in 1989, where the friends' success in finding Trevor is darkened by increasing fears because of threats made by Sheba and Trevor's father through terrifying correspondence. Sheba informs Leo that she is seeking a normal life and begs him to marry her. Meanwhile, Starla returns to Charleston and in a severe moment informs Leo that she had aborted two fetuses that would have been Leo's children. It is in that moment that Leo decides after years of steadily clinging to his marriage due to Catholic vows that he and Starla can no longer be a husband and wife. Leo later finds out from police that a pregnant Starla has committed suicide. In spite of increasing fears for her safety and security due to her father's threats, Sheba refuses to leave her teenage home and her dementia-crippled mother, though Leo convinces her to let Trevor live with him. Soon, Sheba is found murdered one morning with her mother appearing to be the assailant (it is later determined that her father was the murderer). Following a massive funeral, the friends must turn their attention to the menacing Hurricane Hugo which is headed for Charleston. Following the catastrophic storm, the friends soon discover the remains of a person who had been hiding out in a shed behind Niles and Fraser's house. It is later discovered to be Sheba and Trevor's father, who had the intention of killing the group during the hurricane but wound up drowning due to the storm surge. As the city recovers and rebuilds, Leo and Molly go out to Sullivan's Island together to find Molly's grandmother's house in ruins, though they rescue a porpoise. During that moment, Leo and Molly reach the conclusion that they can never be together romantically and that their relationship would remain platonic. In the months following the hurricane, Leo continues to take care of Trevor, who seems healthy but continues to lose weight. Trevor reveals a desire to get back to San Francisco. Leo's mother decides to return to a nun's convent and Leo begins to experience a normalizing of relations between mother and son. Just as it appears Leo's life is coming together, Trevor reveals a most damaging revelation - in his pornographic video collection, Trevor finds an old tape inside a sealed case that shows a young Monsignor Max raping Steve around the time of his suicide. Enraged, Leo confronts a dying Monsignor Max the night before the priest passes away. After a week of tributes, Leo writes a detailed column revealing Max's criminality before entering a mental hospital at the recommendation of a psychiatrist. The story ends with a series of dreams Leo has about his deceased family and friends who encourage him to live his life, even if it must be an act of normalcy. He awakens from the dreams to befriend a female nurse as he prepares to leave the institution and the traumatic experiences of his life, looking boldly into the future. Reception Reception for South of Broad has been mixed, though generally more positive than negative. The Washington Post called the book \\"a big sweeping novel of friendship and marriage\\" with \\"passages in the novel that are lush and beautiful and precise.\\" The St. Louis Post-Dispatch called it \\"brilliant\\", evoking \\"anger, joy, and sorrow\\". The New York Times praised Conroy as \\"[a] magician of the page\\" but found Conroy's technique to be \\"constricting\\" for the novel. The Dallas Morning News called it a \\"gushy mess\\",http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/books/stories/DN- bk_broad_0809gd.ART.State.Edition1.4bbce59.html while the Los Angeles Times suggested that \\"[p]art of the problem is the pacing of the story... tragic twists just appear, lacking the kind of buildup that makes them work.\\" Charleston's Post and Courier dubbed the novel \\"South of Absurd\\" and suggested that \\"at nearly every point, Conroy is either trying too hard or not hard enough.\\" At the time of its launch, reviewers were split on the literary value of South of Broad, but Kirkus Reviews managed to make sense of its parallel running plots: “First novel in 14 years from the gifted spinner of Southern tales (Beach Music, 1995, etc.)—a tail-wagging shaggy dog at turns mock-epic and gothic, beautifully written throughout. The title refers, meaningfully, to a section of Charleston, S.C., and, as with so many Southern tales, one great story begets another and another. This one starts most promisingly: 'Nothing happens by accident.'” Booklist noted that \\"Conroy fleshes out the almost impossibly dramatic details of each of the friends’ lives in this vast, intricate story, and he reveals truths about love, lust, classism, racism, religion, and what it means to be shaped by a particular place, be it Charleston, South Carolina, or anywhere else in the U.S. The combination of all these disparate elements bears the unmistakable makings of a spirit- shaping saga.” According to Conroy's literary agency, soon after the book was released, the publisher remarked: \\"South of Broad hit all possible best seller list[sic] and is selling at a pass never seen 'this side of Tom Clancy' so to speak. Therefore it’s going back to press, it already has, for a few tens of thousands more copies.\\" References Category:2009 American novels Category:Bloomsday Category:Books by Pat Conroy Category:Culture of Charleston, South Carolina Category:Doubleday (publisher) books Category:Novels set in South Carolina ","title":"South of Broad"},{"id":"24120225","text":"Yakub or Yaqub (, also transliterated in other ways, including Yaqoob, Yaqoub, Yaqub, and Yakup) is a male given name.

QuakeFinder operates as a project of aerospace engineering firm Stellar Solutions, and by subscriptions and sponsorships from the public.Note however that, according to IRS Publication 78 (\\"Cumulative List of Organizations described in Section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\\" ) Quakefinder is not a tax-exempt organization. In the 1970s, scientists were optimistic that a practical method for predicting earthquakes would soon be found, but by the 1990s continuing failure led many to question whether it was even possible.; , §2.3, p. 427; , p. 261. Extensive searches have reported many possible earthquake precursors, but, so far, such precursors have not been reliably identified across significant spatial and temporal scales.. Based on the results of this research, most scientists are pessimistic and some maintain that earthquake prediction is inherently impossible.; . See also Nature Debates; . \\"...at the present stage, the general view on short-term prediction is overly pessimistic. There are reasons for this pessimism because mere conventional seismological approach is not efficient for this aim. Overturning this situation is possible only through multi-disciplinary science. Despite fairly abundant circumstantial evidence, pre-seismic EM signals have not yet been adequately accepted as real physical quantities.\\" QuakeFinder has deployed a network of sensor stations that detect the electromagnetic pulses the team believes precede major earthquakes. Each sensor is believed to have a range of approximately 10 miles (16 km) from the instrument to the source of the pulses. As of 2016, the company says they have 125 stations in California, and their affiliate Jorge Heraud says he has 10 sites in Peru. Using these sensors, Heraud says that he has been able to triangulate pulses seen from multiple sites, in order to determine the origin of the pulses. He said that the pulses are seen beginning from 11 to 18 days before an impending earthquake, and have been used to determine the location and timing of future seismic events. However, insofar as a verifiable prediction would require a publicly-stated announcement of the location, time, and size of an impending event before its occurrence, neither Quakefinder nor Heraud have yet verifiably predicted an earthquake, much less issued multiple predictions of the type that might be objectively testable for statistical significance. Background In 2010, QuakeFinder researchers said that they had observed ultra low frequency magnetic pulses emitted by the earth near the 2007 M5.4 Alum Rock earthquake near San Jose ́ California, starting two weeks prior to the event. Researchers from the USGS studied similar phenomena during the Parkfield earthquake experiment. These researchers did not find evidence of electromagnetic earthquake precursors. QuakeFinder advisor Friedemann Freund suggests that slip along a fault activates charge carriers and underground electrical currents, producing electromagnetic pulses that can be detected with magnetometers. The underground currents may also cause air- conductivity changes and ground heating. QuakeFinder says that an infrared signature of the Alum Rock earthquake was detected by NASA's GOES weather satellite. The QuakeFinder team believes that the effects they are trying to study are localized in time and space, and aim to eventually be able determine \\"the time (within 1-2 weeks), location (within 20-40km) and magnitude (within +/- 1 increment of Richter magnitude) of earthquake greater than M5.4.\\" There is no independent verification of their results so far.

It can be extended if there is an endangerment to the woman's life or the life of the fetus. During the ten weeks, an abortion is allowed for the following reasons: the pregnancy threatens the woman's mental and/or physical health, the fetus would be physically or mentally impaired, if the conception occurred through rape or incest, and economic or social reasons. The woman's consent is required. If the woman is under the age of 18, then parental consent is required. If the woman is married, the consent of the husband is also required. Single women over the age of 18 can choose to have an abortion on their own. Despite issues, the understanding and education about abortion has improved, and the procedure has become safer since its legalization in 1983. The legalization followed a period of high mortality rates among pregnant women seeking unsafe abortions due to the lack of access to the legal, professional procedure. History In 1983, abortion was legalized in Turkey (it was passed in 1982 during a military government). In the past, abortions would happen in secret and were usually done in harmful and unsafe ways. Finally, in 1983 Turkey decided to legalize abortions, as they do in Tunisia, during the first trimester no matter what circumstances the mother faces. Out of all the countries in the Middle East region, Turkey and Tunisia are the only two countries in this region that allow abortions under any circumstances during the first trimester. The rest of the Middle East only allows abortions if it affects the health of the woman. Because abortions were done in secret, they were done in harmful ways. It was one of the major reasons for the death of women at this time. Statistics show that deaths of women caused by harmful abortion methods stood at 50% in the 1950s. Also, in 1974, there were \\"208 maternal deaths for every 100,000 births.\\" Protest In 2012, thousands of people went out to protest against the anti-abortion law plan that the then prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had in mind. A total of around 3,000-4,000 protesters went out to voice their opinions and speak against Erdoğan's decision. His decision angered many after giving two speeches against abortion and cesarean births, causing the protest. The protest included women of all ages and they held banners including phrases such as, \\"My body, my choice\\" and \\"I am a woman not a mother, don't touch my body.\\" Issues with Public Hospitals Thanks to the legalization of abortions, the number of maternal deaths caused by unsafe abortions is only 2% as opposed to the 50% in the 1950s. Also, in 2013, the number of maternal deaths was reduced to \\"20 maternal deaths for every 100,000 births\\" as opposed to the 208 in 1974. Although this holds true and abortions are legal, being able to get non- emergency terminations at public hospitals is difficult. It's shown that \\"only three out of thirty-seven public hospitals in the country\\" are allowing non- emergency terminations. A law in 2012 came up that stated doctors had the right to refuse to perform abortions if that's what their conscience is telling them and could make waiting periods that would be mandatory. The law didn't pass, but the influence and idea of it has caused health professionals to enact it on their own anyway. They are making it difficult form these women to get abortions. Some hospitals have created a policy to inform fathers of the pregnancy of their daughters. There are also some that don't allow abortion services if the woman isn't married or she is more than six weeks pregnant, although the law allows for abortions no matter the circumstance up until the tenth week of pregnancy.

S. Ranga based on Ch. Venkataramaiah's stage play of the same name. Produced for the banner Vikram Productions, it stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, N. T. Rama Rao, V. Nagaiah, Bhanumathi Ramakrishna and Jamuna in key roles. Ranga handled the cinematography with his brother-in-law B. N. Haridas while P. G. Mohan edited the film. Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy composed the soundtrack and background score. Written by Samudrala Raghavacharya, Kannadasan and Murugadasa, Tenali Ramakrishna narrates the story of the 14th century Telugu and Sanskrit poet and scholar of the same name, and his life as a member of the court of Krishnadevaraya, the king of the Vijayanagara Empire. Using his wits, Ramakrishna manages to save Krishnadevaraya from attacks by the Bahmani Sultanate, which tries to invade the Vijayanagara Empire. The rest of the film is about Ramakrishna's efforts to save Krishnadevaraya from courtesan Krishnasani, a spy, and convincing Emperor Babur against extending support to the Sultanate in the war. Produced as a trilingual film shot simultaneously in the Telugu, and Tamil languages, and Kannada with a slightly altered cast, Tenali Ramakrishna was filmed in and around Revathy Studios at Madras. It was released on 12 January 1956 to mixed reviews from critics who criticised the historical inaccuracies portrayed in the film. Tenali Ramakrishna was a commercial success, won the President's Silver medal for the Best Feature Film in Telugu and the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film at the 4th National Film Awards. Its Tamil version, titled Tenali Raman, featured Sivaji Ganesan as the protagonist and was released on 3 February 1956. Tenali Ramakrishna was later remade into Kannada as Hasyaratna Ramakrishna in 1982 by Ranga; it was a commercial failure.  Plot  Ramakrishna is a poet and scholar in the Telugu and Sanskrit languages whose talent is not recognised in his hometown Tenali. To earn a living, he migrates to Hampi with his wife Kamala and son Madhava. On his way to Hampi, he stops at a Kali temple. He is initially terrified looking at the goddess' idol and the animal sacrifices made to please her. That night, Kali appears before him and grants a boon: he must choose either wisdom or wealth. Ramakrishna opts for both, which angers Kali. She warns him that he might end up as a Vikatakavi (clownish poet) whose wisdom is useful solely for entertaining others. Ramakrishna accepts this as a blessing and asks Kali to save him from further dangers. The goddess agrees and disappears. Ramakrishna reaches Hampi and approaches Tatacharya, the royal priest of the Vijayanagara Empire, to find employment in the court of King Krishnadevaraya. Neither Tatacharya nor his assistants help him, and he leaves dejected. However, he finds an opportunity when Krishnadevaraya is unable to distribute 17 elephants among three brothers as instructed in their deceased father's will. Ramakrishna solves the problem and Krishnadevaraya appoints him as a member of court. With his wit and loyalty, Ramakrishna soon earns the respect of all the court's members with the exception of Tatacharya who sees him as a problem. The Deccan sultanates of Berar—Ahmednagar, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda—decide to wage a war on the Vijayanagara empire with united military forces. They send Kanakaraju, a spy, to Hampi where he meets Ramakrishna, who happens to be a distant relative. A few days later, Kanakaraju tries to assassinate Krishnadevaraya and Tatacharya blames Ramakrishna for giving shelter to a spy. As Ramakrishna is about to be executed on the King's orders, he overhears a conversation between another spy and the court's astrologer. The spy bribes the astrologer to influence Krishnadevaraya to postpone the war on Bijapur so they have time to make proper preparations. Ramakrishna escapes and meets Prime Minister Timmarusu who helps him reveal the astrologer's intentions. The astrologer is killed and Tatacharya, who believed in him in good faith, is accused of trying to backstab the king. Ramakrishna intervenes and Tatacharya is saved, improving their relationship. The Bahmani Sultanate then sends the courtesan Krishnasani to Hampi. With her acclaimed dancing skills, she manages to attract the attention of Krishnadevaraya, who finds himself besotted by her wit and sensuousness. He issues orders that anyone who enters his private chamber will be beheaded and spends time with Krishnasani for months. Timmarusu and Ramakrishna learn that the Sultans are planning to take advantage of the King's inaccessibility and will soon launch a combined attack on Hampi. Worried at the state of affairs, Ramakrishna ignores the King's order and enters his abode dressed as a woman, but he is ignored and expelled from the kingdom. Meanwhile, Krishnadevaraya's wife Tirumala Devi falls seriously ill, and he finally realises his mistakes. Once the King is back at his palace, Ramakrishna manages to enter Krishnasani's chamber again, this time under the guise of a saint. He catches her red-handed with her gang of spies, and signals to the hidden soldiers to surround her. She kills herself preferring a dignified death. Ramakrishna wishes to leave for Delhi to convince Emperor Babur not to send his elephantry to support the Sultanate in the war. Ramakrishna reaches Delhi and meets Babur in the guise of an aged fakir. He sings his praises until he empties all the gold coins Babur has. Babur invites him to his palace to gift him properly. Ramakrishna goes to Babur's palace. He introduces himself as one of the innocent citizens of the Vijayanagara empire who will suffer if Babur extends his support to the unjust Sultanate. Babur is convinced and calls his elephantry back. Dismayed at the sudden turn of events, the Sultanate calls off the war. Krishnadevaraya learns about Ramakrishna's efforts in stopping the war from Timmarusu. Remorseful, Krishnadevaraya invites Ramakrishna to rejoin the court; he gladly agrees.

S. Ranga wished to produce and direct a historical film based on the life of the 14th century Telugu poet and scholar Tenali Ramakrishna, one of the Ashtadiggajas (a collective title given to the eight Telugu poets in the court of Krishnadevaraya, which literally translates as \\"eight great elephants\\"). He planned it as a multilingual film to be filmed simultaneously in the Telugu and Tamil languages as well as Kannada but with a slightly altered cast. Ranga collaborated with Samudrala Raghavacharya, Kannadasan and Murugadasa on the basic script for all the versions. They decided to adapt Ch. Venkataramaiah's Kannada-language stage play Tenali Ramakrishna into the film, instead of following H. M. Reddy script for the 1941 Telugu directorial of the same name. Ranga titled the film Tenali Raman in Tamil, while Tenali Ramakrishna was chosen for the other versions. Venkataramaiah's play was comical in nature, and focused on the life and times of Ramakrishna. Fearing it would fail to translate on-screen effectively, Raghavacharya and Kannadasan decided to incorporate political elements during the rule of Krishnadevaraya. While Raghavacharya focused on the administrative aspects of Krishnadevaraya, Kannadasan opted to \\"humanise\\" the king by writing scenes related to his personal life and preferences. Tenali Ramakrishna was filmed in and around Revathy Studios in Madras, due to the floors of Ranga's production company Vikram Studios still being under construction. V. S. Rangachari, the film's associate director, assisted Ranga in directing the Telugu version.  Cast and crew  Ranga cast Akkineni Nageswara Rao to play Ramakrishna in Telugu, with Sivaji Ganesan and Rajkumar replacing him in the Tamil and Kannada versions respectively. N. T. Rama Rao and V. Nagaiah were signed to play Krishnadevaraya and his minister Timmarusu. Mukkamala played the role of Tatacharya, the kingdom's royal priest. He was replaced by M. N. Nambiar and Balkrishna in the Tamil and Kannada versions. Ranga approached Bhanumathi Ramakrishna to play Krishnasani. Initially disinterested, Bhanumathi accepted the offer because of Ranga's association as a cinematographer for films produced by her production company Bharani Pictures. Tenali Ramakrishna is the only film where Bhanumathi shared the screen with both Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao at once. Vangara Venkata Subbaiah, Sandhya, Raavu Balasaraswathi, Jamuna, Lakshmikantha, Venkumamba and Master Venkateshwar were cast in key supporting roles. Kamaraju appeared as Emperor Babur, and Mikkilineni made a brief appearance as Ramakrishna's relative Kanakaraju. Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy were signed to compose the soundtrack and background score for the three versions. Ranga's brother-in-law B. N. Haridas worked as the cinematographer. However, Ranga was credited as the film's director of photography with Haridas. P. G. Mohan edited the film. Vali and Ganga were the art directors, and V. K. Srinivasan was the film's production manager. Chopra and Gopalakrishnan choreographed the dance sequences.  Music  Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy composed the soundtrack and background score, with Raghavacharya penning the lyrics for the songs and poems. Ghantasala, Madhavapeddi Satyam, P. Leela, P. Susheela, Balasaraswathi and A. P. Komala were the soundtrack's playback singers. Bhanumathi provided vocals as the playback singer for the songs featuring her. The song \\"Chesedi Yemito\\" was composed using the Sindhu Bhairavi raga. \\"Neevega Raja Neevega\\" and \\"Jhan Jhan Kankanamulu\\" are based on the Shanmukhapriya and Shuddha Saveri ragas. The song \\"Chandana Charchita\\", an ashtapadi adapted from Gita Govinda written by the Sanskrit poet Jayadeva, was composed using the Mohanam raga. When Ghantasala refused to take money for the 14 poems he sang, Ranga went to his home and gave his wife Savithri Ghantasala one hundred rupees for each poem. Ramakoti, who played a washer man in the film, sang the song \\"Akathayipilla Mooka\\". The soundtrack, marketed by HMV Records, was released on 1 December 1956. The songs received positive reviews from the critics after the film's release. A review dated 27 January 1956 in Swatantra said: \\"The songs help the film greatly, with all the singers performing very well, though the ones sung by Bhanumathi could have been much better[sic]\\". The reviewer also found the background score \\"generally effective\\", and \\"exceptional\\" at times. Zameen Raithu, in its review dated 10 February 1956, praised Raghavacharya for adapting Jayadeva's ashtapadi and other complicated poems and not \\"compromising\\" for the common audience to understand. However, the reviewer was critical of the grammatical and pronunciation errors made by the singers and actors in the film. The songs \\"Theerani Naa Korikale\\", \\"Chandana Charchita\\", \\"Jhan Jhan Kankanamulu\\" and \\"Gandupilli Menumarachi\\" gained popularity post release. Track listing  Release  Tenali Ramakrishna was released on 12 January 1956, with an approximate total length of in 20 reels, with a running time of 169 minutes. Navayuga films distributed the film in the Vijayawada, Guntakal, and Madras areas. The Nizam area distribution rights were acquired by All India Corporation Limited. Due to technical issues, the film had a delayed theatrical release on 13 and 14 January 1956 in 13 centres across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Tenali Raman was released on 3 February 1956, with both versions being commercially successful.  Reception  The film received mixed reviews from critics. Swatantra, in its review dated 27 January 1956, wrote, \\"The film is paced evenly until the end ... Raghavacharya's writing is one of the biggest strengths of the film\\". The reviewer praised Nageswara Rao's performance and dialogue delivery, but was critical of Rama Rao and Bhanumathi, noting that the latter was very \\"ill at ease\\" playing Krishnasani which was \\"surprising\\" given that the role was in her comfort zone. Zameen Raithu gave a negative review, writing that the film was \\"disappointing\\" and criticising the climax as the film's \\"weakest link\\". In its review dated 10 February 1956, Zameen Raithu wrote, \\"Ranga has a great vision which cannot be ignored, and an eye for subtle and innuendo-free comedy. Raghavacharya's writing and screenplay are praiseworthy\\". The reviewer added that the characterisations were ill-developed, with Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao \\"salvaging the film to an extent\\", though Bhanumathi \\"struggled in portraying the grey shades with authenticity\\". The film was also criticised for being historically inaccurate. Swatantra pointed out that Ramakrishna is given credit for solving the problem of distributing 17 disputed elephants among three brothers, though this was actually done by Timmarusu. Zameen Raithu was very critical of the portrayal of Ramakrishna as a staunch Sri Vaishnavite, while he was a Telugu Shaivite Brahmin with the alternate name Ramalinga. The reviewer noted that the depiction of the clean-shaven Ramakrishna, a 6000 Niyogi Brahmin by birth, was inaccurate for the period as Niyogis always sported a moustache in the 14th century.  Accolades  Tenali Ramakrishna won the President's Silver medal for the Best Feature Film in Telugu and the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film at the 4th National Film Awards.  Remake  Tenali Ramakrishna was remade by Ranga into the Kannada language again in 1982 as Hasyaratna Ramakrishna, starring Anant Nag and Srinath in the lead roles as Ramakrishna and Krishnadevaraya. Unlike the original, the remake was a commercial failure with critics specifying that the audience did not accept Ramakrishna dominating Krishnadevaraya throughout the film.

As a result, co-premier Hun Sen ousted the other co-premier Norodom Ranariddh. Dozens of people were killed during the conflict.  Background  On March 16, 1992, the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), under UNSYG Special Representative Yasushi Akashi and Lt. General John Sanderson, arrived in Cambodia to begin implementation of the UN Settlement Plan, that was concluded as a result of the Paris Peace Accords of 1991. Free elections were held in 1993. The Khmer Rouge or Party of Democratic Kampuchea (PDK), whose forces were never actually disarmed or demobilized, barred some people from participating in 1993 elections in the 10-15 percent of the country (holding six percent of the population) it then controlled. Altogether, over four million Cambodians (about 90% of eligible voters) participated in that May election. Prince Norodom Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC Party was the top vote recipient with 45.5% vote, followed by Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (ex-communist) and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (of Son Sann), respectively. Despite the victory, the FUNCINPEC had to enter into coalition talks with the Cambodian People's Party, led by Hun Sen, who refused to relinquish power. After talks, Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen became First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively, in the Royal Cambodian Government.  Factional fighting  In 1997, long tensions between the two governing parties broke into factional fighting between FUNCINPEC supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh and of Hun Sen, resulting in a number of casualties. This event was generally treated by the press, as well as by some scholars, as a \\"bloody coup by strongman Hun Sen\\", without much serious and neutral investigation into its causes and its development. Among the very few who attempted to look at evidence from both sides at the time were Australian ambassador to Cambodia Tony Kevin, and journalist Barry Wain, who wrote, \\"in circumstances that remain disputed, Mr. Hun Sen's military forces... defeated Prince Ranariddh's troops in Phnom Penh\\". Thomas Hammarberg, the United Nations Special Representative on Human rights in Cambodia, made it clear in his October 1997 report to the UN General Assembly: the events of July 5–6 were a \\"coup d'état.\\" In retrospect, the following issues have been identified as the causes of the violent events: the 'dual power' accorded by the 1993 power sharing formula allowed the CPP to retain control over power structures; while officially a ruling party, the FUNCINPEC concluded an alliance – National United Front – with the opposition Sam Rainsy Party; the opposite sides accused each other of trying to integrate former Khmer Rouge fighters, who had been/were defecting. Thus, Hun Sen alleged that Ranariddh had been planning a take-over with the help of Khmer Rouge fighters, supposedly smuggled into the capital (on the other hand, Hun Sen's army included a number of ex-Khmer Rouge fighters as well). On 5 July 1997, CPP troops led by General Ke Kim Yan surrounded a military garrison belonging to Nhek Bun Chhay in Kampong Speu Province. Ke Kim Yan attempted to coax Nhek Bun Chhay to disband his garrison, but failed.Peou (2000), p. 299 At the same time, military police aligned to the CPP approached the residence of another FUNCINPEC general, Chao Sambath, and demanded FUNCINPEC troops surrender their weapons.Peou (2000), p. 300 Nhek Bun Chhay responded by ordering FUNCINPEC troops to resist the advances made by the CPP's troops and military police,Widyono (2008), p. 258 and heavy fighting broke out at the Taing Krassang military base and Phnom Penh International Airport, where most of FUNCINPEC troops were based. Hun Sen quickly returned from his vacation at Vung Tau.Mehta (2013), p. 255 The following day, Hun Sen deployed his bodyguard units to the regular forces fighting FUNCINPEC troops. FUNCINPEC troops initiated two attempts to attack CPP troops, but were quickly repulsed by Hun Sen's bodyguards and regular troops, suffering heavy casualties in the process. FUNCINPEC troops subsequently retreated from their positionsMehta (2013), p. 257-8 and fled to O Smach in Oddar Meanchey Province.Widyono (2008), p. 254 After the royalist resistance was crushed in Phnom Penh, there was indeed some joint resistance by FUCINPEC-Khmer Rouge forces in the Northern provinces, where the fighting against Hun Sen's offensive lasted until September 1997. Following the seizure of power by Hun Sen, Prince Ranariddh went into exile in Paris. Some FUNCINPEC leaders were forced to flee the country, many were shot and Ung Huot was elected as the new First Prime Minister. FUNCINPEC leaders returned to Cambodia shortly before the 1998 National Assembly elections. In those elections, the CPP received 41% of the vote, FUNCINPEC 32%, and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) 13%. Many international observers judged the elections to have been seriously flawed, claiming political violence, intimidation, and lack of media access. The CPP and FUNCINPEC formed another coalition government, with CPP the senior partner.

It marked the return to the BBC drama department, for the first time in six years, of writer Terry Nation. His last completed piece of work for the BBC before this, had been his work on the Doctor Who story The Daleks' Master Plan in 1965. After that he had worked for ITV/ITC film series including The Avengers, The Saint, The Baron, The Champions and Department S. The pilot episode was entitled \\"Never Come Night\\" and was produced by Anthony Coburn, and directed by Cyril Coke. The drama was described as 'Victorian Gothic Suspense'. Robert Baldick, played by Robert Hardy, was an eccentric dilettante scientist/detective, possessed of a personal steam locomotive, The Tsar, originally built for Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, complete with armour plating, bulletproof glass and an on-board laboratory. The programme was scheduled to be shown on Wednesday 6 September 1972 but, in the immediate aftermath of the Munich massacre, the production was removed at the last moment.

Early life He is the son of the artist and poet Julian Trevelyan (1910–1988) and his first wife, the potter Ursula Darwin (later Mommens) (1908–2010). Trevelyan was educated at Bryanston School and the Fine Arts Dept of Kings College, Newcastle. Later, he attended an MA course at the Royal College of Art (Dept of Film & TV).  Film career  While at the RCA, he directed and edited the film Lambing (1964, 20 mins, 16mm, black and white), which was awarded the National Nature Film Festival 1st prize and was broadcast on BBC TV. His second film was The Ship Hotel, Tyne Maine (1966, 35 mins, 16mm, black and white), a documentary centred on a Tyneside pub, concentrating on a group of people who go there every Sunday to drink and sing. This was awarded a silver medal by the Royal College of Art. His third film as director was The Farmer's Hunt (1968, 40 mins, 16mm colour), a BBC film of stag hunting on Exmoor. His fourth film was The Moon and the Sledgehammer (1971, 65 mins 16mm colour). His next film was Big Ware (1971, 16mm colour 40 mins), a TV documentary about George Curtis, a traditionalist potter. Between 1972 and 1974, he directed seven titles of the series Portraits of Places, written by and featuring Ray Gosling. In 1976, Trevelyan was hired to direct a dramatised film about the Mongols and the building of Isfahan, to be produced by David Frost, however the Iranian Revolution curtailed the project. His next film was co-director and editor of a film entitled Basil Bunting (1979, 16mm colour, 60 mins), which was shown at London and Cannes. K.491 (1979, 16mm colour 60 mins) was an exploration film about Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24. His last film was in 1985, Surrealism in Liverpool (with commentary by George Melly), a Granada TV film celebrating Surrealism and the arrival of an international exhibition as the new Tate Liverpool.  Farming  In 1974, the Trevelyans bought a hill farm, Hill Top Farm in Spaunton, North Yorkshire. The farm was certified organic by the Soil Association in 1985, and they aim to follow sustainable farming practices. They farm Swaledale sheep to produce shearlings primarily for meat that is sold locally but also for wool. Rabbits, a pest are killed and also sold for meat. The farm has wind turbines and solar panels to generate electricity, which is used to power freezers for meat and a Kewet electric car. In 1997, Trevelyan founded the \\"Lazy Dog Tool Company\\", which specialises in handmade hand tools for \\"chemical-free weed control\\". The tools are instead designed for weeding by the traditional, but labour intensive, practice of removing individual plants (RIP). The tools are ergonomically designed and are manufactured from stainless steel at the workshop, on the farm. The tools are popular with organic farmers (who have restrictions on the use of herbicides), conservation groups (who have volunteer labour), and horse owners (who need to remove poisonous common ragwort from fields with horses in). This has featured on Gardeners' World (2002). In 2003, it was awarded a Green Apple Award by The Green Organisation. In 2005, Trevelyan also started a flour milling company Yorkshire Organic Millers, to mill locally-grown organic wheat. On 23 January 2008, Hill Top Farm was visited by HRH The Prince of Wales. In 2013, Trevelyan published a book entitled Julian Trevelyan: Picture Language, a pictorial exploration of the life of his father Julian. Andrew Lambirth, writing in The Daily Telegraph, commented that the book \\"is an anecdotal and appreciative account of [Julian Trevelyan's] art. It makes riveting reading, but the real surprise is the richness and variety of the illustrations, many previously unknown.\\" An exhibition was held at Bohun Gallery in Henley-on-Thames, in association with the publication of the book.http://www.hugofox.com/events/julian-trevelyan-picture-language-25178 Personal life In 1974, he married Amy Eleanor Pryor (known as Nelly), youngest daughter of the entomologist M.G.M. Pryor and his wife Sophie, herself granddaughter maternally of George Darwin (a son of Charles Darwin). The Trevelyans have two sons, Jack (born John Robert Trevelyan in 1977) and Matthew Robert (born 1979), and a daughter, Susannah (born 1987), an independent film maker.Burke's Peerage and Baronetage  References  External links * https://web.archive.org/web/20090514040718/http://www.themoonandthesledgehammer.com/phil.html * https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1749015/bio Category:1943 births Category:People educated at Bryanston School Category:Living people Category:British farmers Category:British film directors Category:British film editors Category:British television directors ","title":"Philip Trevelyan"},{"id":"24120739","text":"A give-and-go, or one-two, is a fundamental maneuver in many team sports which involves two players passing the ball or puck back and forth.

They are capable of diving up to 7,000 meters, covering 99.8% of the oceanic floor of the world. Two units of this class are planned, with derivatives to follow and are used by both the civilian and military establishments in China. Design Sea Pole class bathyscaphe is designed by the 702nd Research Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation. The general designer is Mr. Xu Huangnan (), a professor of School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering() of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SHJTU), who also designed many other Chinese submersibles and unmanned underwater vehicles. The first deputy general designer is Mr. Cui Weicheng (), and the deputy general designer was Mr. Zhu Weiqing (), all of the three are academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. There are two mechanical arms with associated tools that enable the bathyscaphe to perform a various tasks at its maximum operational depth, and this pair of mechanical arms with 7 degrees of freedom (7-DOF) are mounted on the right and left sides of the vehicle, which is powered by 110 kWh (110 V, 800 Ah) silver oxide – zinc batteries. The Sea Pole bathyscaphe is equipped with various communication systems, but the data transfer rate remains a bottleneck, with the transmission rate only being 80 kbit/s, compared to 100 Mbit/s in the usual internet transmissions. As a result, the transmission of an ordinary color image from the bathyscaphe to the mothership takes approximately half a minute. The pressure hull is built of titanium alloy, and the manufacturing method for the pressure hull involves producing two hemispherical parts by tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding six-side plates to a top plate, followed by heat treatments and polishing by machining; the two halves are then TIG welded together to form a complete sphere. The plate thickness is 76 – 78 mm, with deviations of ±4 mm in the completed radius, and sphericity is 0.4% or less. Pressure testing of the pressure hull was performed in Russia, and included a one-hour test at a water pressure equivalent to 7,700 meters, or a 10% greater depth than the vessel's, 7,000 m maximum operational depth, a continuous hour-long test at water pressure equivalent to 7,000 m, and a test simulating 0 to 7,000 m ascent/descent of the submersible, which was repeated six times. There were no problems reported in any of these tests, and the pressure hull passed with flying colors. All viewports of Sea Pole class bathyscaphe have a circular truncated cone shape. There is a large viewport with diameter of 20 cm mounted in the bow, and this central view port is the same type of that of Russian Mir class bathyscaphe. The two additional smaller side viewports of 12 cm diameter are mounted on portside and starboard side, closer to the front than other bathyscaphes. The advantage of this arrangement is that it enables navigation while both the pilot and the scientists simultaneously observe an objective in front of the vehicle. However, the side views have limited field of vision. There are two onboard life supporting system based on that of Shenzhou 6 spacecraft, and additionally, there are two onboard oxygen generating systems independent of life supporting system for additional safety. The pressure hull is built of titanium. Sea Pole class bathyscaphe has a teardrop shape tapering toward the stern and four tail fins which form an X shape. The main thruster system is based on the same design principle as that of the Russian Mir class bathyscaphe. Four main thrusters inclined in a narrowing shape are mounted in the spaces between the four fins. One horizontal thruster is mounted on the top of the bow, and thrusters for vertical / horizontal turning and auxiliary propulsion are provided on the two sides of the hull. Parallel movement in the horizontal direction is achieved by using a combination of the horizontal thruster on the bow and the right and left stern thrusters, while vertical movement uses a combination of the bow side thrusters and the top and bottom stern thrusters. Sea Pole 1 Sea Pole 1 (Hai Ji Yi Hao, 海极一号) or Sea Pole #1, was the first Sea Pole class bathyscaphe. Due to the high standard of design requirement, the Chinese industrial capability was not adequate enough to meet the requirements, and as a result, the titanium pressure hull was built in Russia, the mechanical arms were built in the US, and the buoyancy system was built in the UK. Sea Pole 1 begun its sea trials in October 2008, and reportedly entered service in 2009. Trials were mostly conducted with a mother ship named (Da Yang Yi Hao, 大洋一号), a modified research ship. Although Sea Pole class bathyscaphe was designed to carry an operator and two scientists, Chinese authorities have announced that in the near future, Sea Pole 1 will carry three operators and no scientists for test and evaluation purposes. The unit price of Sea Pole 1 is around 180 million ¥, or roughly 25 million US dollars. Sea Pole 2 Sea Pole 2 (Hai Ji Er Hao, 海极二号) or Sea Pole #2, was the second Sea Pole class bathyscaphe, and possibly the last unit of this class. Unconfirmed Chinese reports (mostly on the internet) have suggested that previous deals China signed with foreign contractors for Sea Pole 1 included technological transfer, and Sea Pole 2 would utilize more domestically produced components once Chinese manufacturers mastered the technologies transferred, but such claims have yet to be confirmed by independent or official sources. One of the most important upgrade of Sea Pole 2 is to increase its communication capability by boosting the data transmission rate via fiber optics. Based on the experience of sea trials of Sea Pole 1, it was recommended that a class of dedicated mother ships be built, with the first one being Great Ocean II (Da Yang Er Hao, or 大洋二号). Specifications The specification for Sea Pole 2 bathyscaphe is not yet publicized, but it is reportedly differs from that of Sea Pole 1 slightly. The specification of Sea Pole 1 is listed here. *Length: 8.2 meters *Width: 3 meters *Height: 3.4 meters *Inner diameter of the pressure hull: 2.1 meters *Mass: 24 tons in air *Payload: 220 kg *Maximum speed: 2.5 kt *Cruise speed: 1 kt *Worst weather condition for deployment: Sea state 4 *Crew: 3 *Endurance: 12 hr *Maximum operating depth: 7,000 meters *Never to exceed depth: 7,100 meters *Crash depth: 7,700 meter *Life support: 3 x 12 hr Dragon class bathyscaphe Dragon (Jiao Long, 蛟龙) class bathyscaphe is developed from Sea Pole class bathyscaphe, claimed to be an indigenous design by the Chinese government. Designed by the 702nd Research Institute of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, Dragon class bathyscaphe is slightly smaller than its predecessor, with overall length slightly reduced to 8 meter from the original 8.2 meter of Sea Pole class. Other external difference included the reconfiguration of the support skid: instead of a single large skid on each side totaling a pair in the Sea Pole class, the support skid system of the Dragon class consists of two smaller ones on each side, totaling four. The propulsion system of the Dragon class is also different than that of the Sea Pole class: while the propulsion system at the stern remain unchanged, the smaller thrusters at port side and starboard side on board Sea Pole class is replaced by a pair of much larger thrusters on the Dragon class, with one on each side. Furthermore, these two larger thrusters are protected by frames that are not present on the Sea Pole class. Other dimensional and performance parameters remain the same. Harmony class bathyscaphe Harmony (He Xie 和谐) class bathyscaphe is a further development of the original Sea Pole class, and looks very similar to the Dragon class bathyscaphe. The main external difference between the Dragon class and the Harmony class is in the number of search lights: instead of three on the port and starboard sides as on the Sea Pole and Dragon classes, there are four on the Harmony class, and instead of four above the main observation window on the Sea Pole and Dragon classes, there are five on the Harmony class. Deployment Sea pole class bathyscaphes are deployed on the mothership, Chinese research ship Xiangyanghong (向阳红) No. 9, the only ship right now capable of handling these bathyscaphes. More ships need to be built or converted if every bathyscaphe is to have its own mothership. At least one specially built mothership was requested by scientific research establishments in China, designated as Great Ocean No. 2 (Da Yang Er Hao, 大洋2号). However, in an interview in March 2009, the general engineer of the 702nd Institute, Mr. Yan Kai (颜开) revealed that there was insufficient funding and as a result, the program was significantly slowed down, with the work on the follow-on units postponed. Meanwhile, the first unit completed a 300-meter dive test on Sept 20th 2009. In early Oct 2009, they reached a depth of 1109 meters during a test dive. On May 31, 2010, 3000 meter dive tests began, and concluded on Jul 18, 2010, with a test dive reaching a depth of 3757 meters on Jul 9th 2010. More testing is planning on the availability of additional funding. Should enough funding is provided for all units planned, only one unit would be operating at any given time, while the second unit is in transit, the third is being maintained, and the fourth being used for training.

Political career In November 1917, Orr was elected on the Socialist ticket to the New York State Assembly (Bronx Co., 4th D.), and sat in the 141st New York State Legislature, being one of 10 members of the Socialist Party which were elected to the Assembly of 1918, the high-water mark of the party's fortunes in the state. In November 1919, Orr was re-elected to the Assembly, but on the first day of the session of the 143rd New York State Legislature he was called before the Speaker along with four of his Socialist colleagues — Louis Waldman, Charles Solomon, Samuel A. DeWitt, and August Claessens. The five were charged with being unfit for membership in the Assembly through their membership in the Socialist Party and were suspended from their seats by a vote of 140 to 6.The complete text of the resolution appears in State of New York, Proceedings of the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly in the Matter of the Investigation by the Assembly of the State of New York as to the Qualifications of Louis Waldman, August Claessens, Samuel A.

All five were re-elected at a special election on September 16, and appeared to take their seats at the beginning of the special session on September 20. The next day, Orr and DeWitt were permitted to take their seats, but Claessens, Solomon and Waldman were expelled again. Protesting against the re-expulsion of their comrades, DeWitt and Orr resigned their seats. Samuel Orr was re-elected to the State Assembly in November 1920, and took his seat in the 144th New York State Legislature for the session of 1921. In 1922, Orr ran in the 22nd District for the New York State Senate, but lost. He ran again in 1928 in the same district, without success. In 1933, Orr ran in the 21st District, and lost once again. Orr ran for US Congress in the 23rd District of New York in 1926, and again in 1930 and 1934. He lost each time. He was appointed a New York City Special Deputy Controller in 1938.

The disease is found worldwide. Two syndromes of CAE occur. Adult goats develop a chronic progressive arthritis, whereas young goats develop a neurological syndrome, with signs of paresis or paralysis. Less commonly, mastitis or pneumonia may occur. Infection is life-long, and it may be years before signs of the disease occur. The reason for the long (and variable) period of dormancy of the virus is not known. In goats which develop arthritis, the joints become inflamed and swollen, and the goats will slowly lose condition. In some cases the goat will not be able to stand. In goats which develop the neurological form of the disease, the onset of signs is gradual over several weeks. The hind legs are most often affected. The goat will be uncoordinated, and unable to place its feet properly, so that it \\"knuckles\\", that is, it stands with the front of its fetlock on the ground, rather than its hoof. The goat has increased difficulty standing and eventually is unable to stand. The disease is spread to goat kids when they drink colostrum or milk from infected goats. Separating goat kids from infected goats, and feeding the kids with cow's milk, or pasteurized goat milk, will prevent infection. The disease can be spread from goat to goat via direct contact and body fluids, such as saliva. Blood testing goats for CAE virus before moving them into a new herd will prevent the spread of the disease. There is no known cure. To prevent spread of the disease, infected animals are separated from non-infected goats, or culled.

She was scrapped in 1968. Construction and commissioning Walsh was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Walsh (DE-601) on 27 February 1945 by Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Inc., at Hingham, Massachusetts. She was reclassified as a Crosley- class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-111 during construction, and was launched on 27 April 1945, sponsored by Mrs. John J. Walsh. Walsh was commissioned on 11 July 1945 with Lieutenant Commander Phillip J. Tiffany, USNR, in command.  Service history  After shakedown out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, from 1 August 1945 to 29 August 1945, during which World War II ended on 15 August 1945, Walsh visited Norfolk, Virginia, and then took part in smoke screen experiments in the Chesapeake Bay as part of Task Group 23.19. On 4 October 1945, she moved north for training exercises in company with PT boats out of Melville, Rhode Island. She later participated in Navy Day festivities at Portland, Maine, in late October 1945 before departing Portland on 30 October 1945 bound for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to begin the process of inactivation. At Philadelphia, Walsh secured her sonar gear at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and received hull repairs. She departed Philadelphia on 13 November 1945 bound for Hampton Roads, Virginia, and arrived at Norfolk on 14 November 1945. She then unloaded all ammunition and turned in registered publications before proceeding on to Jacksonville, Florida. Decommissioning and disposal Decommissioned on 26 April 1946 at Green Cove Springs, Florida, Walsh berthed initially with the Florida Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet there. Later, she was moved to the Texas Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, where she remained until stricken from the Navy List on 1 May 1966. She was sold for scrapping in July 1968.

This complex was the headquarters of the first twelve Franciscan friars headed by Martín de Valencia who came to Mexico after receiving the first authorization from the Pope to evangelize in New Spain. In the early colonial period, this was one of the largest and most influential monasteries in Mexico City. It was built on the site of where Moctezuma II’s zoo once was. At its peak, the church and monastery covered the blocks now bordered by Bolivar, Madero, Eje Central and Venustiano Carranza Streets, for a total area of 32,224 square meters. In the patio of the first cloister, there was a cross that was reputedly taller than the highest tower in the city and made from a cypress tree from the “Chapultepec Forest”, meaning the forested area to the west of the Zocalo, where San Francisco was built. The church and monastery saw a number of historic events in its time. A funeral mass for Hernán Cortés was here when it was thought that he died in Central America. In 1629, the Marquis of Gelves arrived in disguise to hide after quarreling with the archbishop. In 1692, the Count of Galve and his wife were granted refuge there due to a large-scale rebellion in the city. The end of the Mexican War of Independence was celebrated with a Te Deum at the monastery as the Trigarante Army of 16,000 troops marched past on Madero Street headed by Agustín de Iturbide. After the Reform War, the monastery of San Francisco, like many others, was disbanded and most of the property seized by the government. Much of the old monastery was demolished for the construction of new roads. Other parts of the old building are now a Methodist church facing Gante Street and a Panadería Ideal bakery. Where the bakery is now on 16 de Septiembre Street used to be the De Profundus Room, and the church is housed in the old cloister. On the corner of Venustiano Carranza and Eje Central are what used to be the Calvario and San Antonio chapels. These buildings still exist only because it was more expensive to demolish them than to leave them standing. All that is still left in church hands is the church itself. The church standing today is the third to be built on the site. The first two sunk into the soft soil underneath Mexico City and had to be torn down. This church was built between 1710 and 1716. Although the entire building is known as the San Francisco Church, the entrance on Madero Street is actually the entrance to the Balvanera Chapel. In front of this is an atrium with several sets of stairs leading down to the church building because it, too, is sinking. The church’s main facade, dating from 1710, is walled in and cannot be seen. Entrance is now through the side door into the Balvanera Chapel, then into the main church. The facade of the chapel was constructed in 1766 and it is not sure who constructed it but most think it was the work of Lorenzo Rodríguez, best known for his work on the Metropolitan Tabernacle. The chapel’s statues were removed when the chapel was in the hands of an Evangelical sect, but it kept other decorative elements such as volutes, sculpted leaves and flowers and the estipite (inverted truncated pyramid) columns with medallions. Inside there is an 18th-century altarpiece dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe as well as the entrance to what was once the Chapel of the Second Station of the Stations of the Cross. In the main church, there is a large gilded main altar, which is one that replaced the original Baroque one. This original one has been reconstructed because Neoclassic artist Jerónimo Antonio Gil left a drawing of it. Only the walls of the original De Profundis Room remain, the rest is remodeled into a bakery. The old cloister on Gante Street has fared a bit better. It is now a Methodist church, where inside both floors of the cloister have been well preserved. It can be visited only with prior authorization.

Biography He was born in Moravia, then part of Austria-Hungary, and trained as an architect in Vienna. In Prague, in the 1920s, he worked as a cartoonist for newspapers and as a commercial artist doing advertising. His posters are on display at the Prague Museum of Applied Arts, where reproductions are on sale as posters and even as miniatures on matchbox covers. Weiss also worked as an architect. His style was Art Deco, severely geometrical, with rounded corners, un-decorated, handcrafted of finest materials. All went fine until the Depression and then Hitler destroyed that whole world. In 1938 he sought refuge in Britain, but was denied a working permit until the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, whereupon his status changed from visitor to refugee. His personal version of English and his European drawing style made it difficult to find work so at 1943 he started from zero. Due to the difficulty of finding jobs, he accepted most offers, including making wartime propaganda posters, illustrations for Czech publications, and portrait sketches for the Daily Telegraph. He then met Rose Fyleman, author of children's books and poetry, who was doing a serial for the children's page of the Christian Science Monitor in Boston. He illustrated the weekly segments for her and that led him to Saville Davis, then the Monitors London correspondent, who appointed him their London visual reporter. There he covered international events such as the 1946 conference in Lancaster House where the United Nations was born. In 1948 he emigrated to the US and became the Monitors artist-reporter covering national events and politicians both on assignment as well as freelance until his death in 1965. One of his favorite haunts was the UN in New York, where he was often mistaken for a delegate, with his gracious old-world manner, bow tie, and homburg hat. Thus diplomatically camouflaged, he blended into the background, where he would scribble surreptitious notes on any scrap of paper he found in his pocket. Incredibly quickly he caught and pinned down the personal characteristics of his distinguished subjects by their stance and body language. He then scooted back to his studio where he deftly traced the scribbles using his unique dry- brush technique of ink on vellum paper… identified the scene in his somewhat inventive spelling… tossed it in an envelope and rushed to catch the Monitor’s Boston pouch. The drawings bear the working notes of an artist-reporter under deadline. It was not a highly lucrative profession, but he loved its immediacy, its glamor, and the fun of revealing people. His portrait gallery of some thousand drawings of international personalities is a historic microcosm of the mid-20th Century. Some drawings are straight reportage, some slyly satirical, all expose his victims’ singularity. Aside from his portraits, the Monitor published pages’-worth of his article-illustrations as well as sketches from his travels—many from Austria—for which The President of Austria awarded him their Golden Badge of Honor in 1964. Illustrator of some 40 children's books (originals now in the Kerlan Collection of the University of Minnesota Library) he illustrated Harper & Row’s young readers’ edition of JFK’s Profiles in Courage; Emily Neville’s 1964 Newbery medal winner It’s like this, cat, Harper & Row, 1963. He was author of My Studio Sketchboook, Marsland, London 1948; with Karla Weiss the children's cookbook Let's have a party, Bruce, London, 1946; as well as Slavische Märchen, Schweizer Druck und Verlagshaus, Zürich, 1952. A gentle, funny, trusting, hopelessly impractical humanist, he was also childishly superstitious: believed that if you pronounced the name of a medicine with a Latin accent, its effective strength increased. For lower back pain he advised a sheet of red flannel folded in half and draped over a string that wrapped around the waist. Any other color than red was useless. Tucking it inside the pants would shield the wearer from “looking like a truck with a red flag waving behind.” Fortunately his wife, Karla, graduate of the Prague Music Academy, was more practical. She enabled him to do what he simply had to do: to draw. He was never without a pencil in his hand unless he was holding his brush, in which case the pencil was held in his mouth. He is buried in Mt.Pleasant Cemetery, Hawthorne, New York.

Families can search for their missing loved ones by simply registering onto REFUNITE's family tracing platform. The REFUNITE family reconnection platform allows users to register, search for and message their missing loved ones that have also signed up on the platform. REFUNITE works through partnerships with like-minded individuals, organizations, corporations, and humanitarian agencies. The headquarters are located in Copenhagen, Denmark with the main technology development lab and operations being based out of Kampala, Uganda. History REFUNITE was founded in 2008 by two Danish brothers, David and Christopher Mikkelsen, after their personal journey trying to reconnect a young, Afghan refugee with his family. In their search, the two brothers discovered that existing family tracing programs lacked cross-border, collaborative technology and the process of family tracing was also often tied to cumbersome procedures and paperwork. This is what prompted David and Christopher to develop an global, centralized and free platform that would allow refugees and other Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to search and reconnect with their missing family and loved ones. REFUNITE empowers refugees and separated families to search, connect and communicate with family and friends they have lost along the way. The organization provides the family reconnection service, but puts it in the hands of its users to conduct the actual search, thus democratizing access to family tracing. Out of the 68 millionhttp://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a- glance.html forcibly displaced people worldwide, many do not have access to Internet and have very basic and simple mobile phones. REFUNITE focuses on making their service available to as many users as possible and through various touch points, from the very low-end, basic technology to the more sophisticated one. Together with Ericsson, REFUNITE has partnered with a global coalition of mobile network operators. Through these partnerships, the organization is able to communicate directly with millions of forcibly displaced people through SMS and make access to the platform free of charge. So far, over 1 million people registered on the REFUNITE platform and keep searching for their missing loved ones every day. Thousands of new users are coming on to the REFUNITE platform every week from all over the world. Part of the organization's effort to make this service available to all is making sure that it is available in as many languages as possible. REFUNITE is constantly adding new languages to the platform, with its web service currently being available in twelve languages, including English, Swahili, Somali, Arabic, French, Congolese Swahili, Hindi, Urdu, Pashto, Kurdish, Dari, and Tagalog.  REFUNITE's Technology  REFUNITE Outreach Volunteer helping a beneficiary register via mobile phone  Web  The family reconnection platform can be accessed through the official website. The search tool is available in twelve languages, including English, Swahili, Somali, Arabic, French, Congolese Swahili, Hindi, Urdu, Pashto, Kurdish, Dari, and Tagalog. The website can be accessed by anyone with Internet connection.  Data collection and Privacy  Users provide only the information they feel comfortable and safe enough to share, which gives them the option of staying anonymous. While providing a phone number is necessary to sign up, this number is kept hidden and only used for signing in via our web service or to receive messages straight to your phone. While REFUNITE encourages users to provide as much information as possible, they understand that sharing certain information causes a safety concern for some. Therefore, users choose what public information they want to share, giving them the option to, for example, have their profile show personal information that only their family or closest friends would recognize, e.g. birthmarks, favorite foods, or other person-specific information.  Outreach Volunteers  REFUNITE's Outreach Volunteers help beneficiaries register, search, and even share their reconnection story with the organization. REFUNITE works with outreach volunteers in Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. The organization has teamed up with UNHCR as well as other aid organizations operating in camps in order to train local refugees on REFUNITE’s technology, so these refugees can help others sign up. Many of the outreach volunteers, who are refugees themselves, are still looking for their own families as well, and are helping others while waiting to be reconnected. They walk around the camps promoting REFUNITE’s service and help anyone interested to register and search. They are some of the most important people to REFUNITE, as they are instrumental in advocating the service and help foster trust between the organization and its beneficiaries in the camps.

It is best known for having been the home of Admiral Raphael Semmes, captain of the Confederate sloop-of-war CSS Alabama. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 26, 1970. History The Raphael Semmes House was built by its first owner, Peter Horta, in 1858. The structure was purchased in 1871 by the citizens of Mobile and presented to Raphael Semmes. Semmes lived here until his death in 1877. In the mid-twentieth century Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Linyer Bedsole purchased and restored the house, donating it on April 22, 1946 to the First Baptist Church of Mobile situated next door. It was given in memory of their son, Lt. Joseph Linyer Bedsole, Jr., who was killed in action over Germany during World War II. Architecture The overall exterior design of the two- story brick townhouse is in a simple Federal style, with a Greek Revival entrance doorway and surround. The front (south) facade is adorned with a full-width cast iron porch across the ground floor, added in the 1870s. The ironwork features a floral design motif. Due to the narrow city lot upon which it was built, the house is much longer than it is wide. The main body of the house measures approximately wide by deep. A two-story rear ell is attached to the northwest corner of the main house and measures approximately wide by deep, extending the entire depth of the house to . The ell served as the service wing and was fronted on the courtyard side by wooden galleries on both floors that adjoined the matching rear galleries of the main house. The interior layout features a stair hall on the west side of the house, on both floors. The stairway is mahogany with turned spindles. The stair hall opens onto a parlor and dining room on the first floor and three bedrooms on the second floor. The parlor and dining room both retain their original black marble mantles. The service ell contains a kitchen and storage room on the first floor and two servant rooms on the second.

It is meant primarily for creative agencies and in-house creative teams to manage multiple facets of their operations. It competes against Wrike, Basecamp, Workfront, among others. It also competes tangentially against accounting software such as QuickBooks and CRM software such as Salesforce.com  Features  Workamajig is designed as an ERP and agency management software. The software shows different dashboards to users based on their defined roles. Creative resources see a list of assigned tasks and to-do lists. Project managers see different project management tools such as Gantt charts, work breakdown structures, and reporting tools. Project managers can plan projects from templates and assign tasks to different users. They can gather data on the project's progress create auto-generated reports from existing templates. Users can share files and initiate conversations about tasks and projects. They can track their time spent on individual tasks, prepare status reports, share drafts with clients and gather feedback. Sales features let you bring in marketing data into Workamajig and turn it into a CRM. Sales people can use it to track opportunities and estimate new projects .

The nursery sells plants native to Southern Ontario, within a 150 km radius of their location on Pigeon Lake. In April 2009, the organization name was changed from 'Gamiing Centre for Sustainable Lakeshore Living' to 'Gamiing Nature Centre'.http://www.thepost.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1593651 Gamiing raises funds through various grants as well as by many successful events like their golf outing and Summer Lakeshore Music Festival.http://www.planetfriendly.net/calendar/events.php?id=11021http://www.thepost.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1704054 In September 2009, Gamiing hosted a 'Green Golf Tournament', one of the first of its kind in Canada.http://turfhugger.blogspot.com/2009/08/for-love-of- gamiing.html Gamiing also facilitates many career transitioning positions in the fields of parks and recreation, ecosystems management, and marketing for post-secondary youth.http://www.barrydevolin.ca/news/2009/052609.htm The organization also dedicates itself to conserving wildlife along the shores of Pigeon Lake, and in association with the Trent Severn Waterway, Gamiing helped restore habitat for the threatened Blanding's turtle.http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1589396 Community Programs Gamiing's Buckthorn Removal Project:http://www.gamiing.org/index.php?nShow=47 Buckthorn is a lovely shrub with dark green glossy leaves that do not fall off until late November. The branches are covered with berries. However, this species is not native to the area and is very invasive. It was introduced to Ontario in the early 1800s when farmers came from Scotland, Ireland and England to our area and brought these shrubs with them to fence their newly created farms fields. Once it is established it will crowd out native species such as maple and oak. Gamiing worked with ten almost-graduates of the Eco System Management Technician Program of Fleming College as a work placement to help eradicate the non- native species.

She was a first lieutenant (porucznik) in the Polish Armed Forces. She died together with her father in the controversial 1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash. Biography Zofia Leśniowska, born on 2 March 1912, was the daughter of Lt. Gen. Władysław Sikorski and , whom Sikorski married in 1909. On 30 September 1936 she married engineer Lt. Stanisław Leśniowski (1904 - 11 December 1987). She was active in the Polish Red Cross, and known for her passion for horse riding. After World War II broke out, on 7 September 1939 Lt. Gen. Sikorski ordered her to organize a resistance movement. Her apartment on Górczewski's Street in Warsaw was used for a conspiracy movement. In January 1940 she was called as an emissary to France, and travelled as an underground courier, smuggling various documents. She was her father's personal secretary, coder, interpreter and advisor. She was decorated with the order of the Polish Red Cross; this was her only war time distinction. From 16 November 1942 to 18 February 1943 in London she was a superintendent of the Women's Auxiliary Service. She was killed, together with her father and nine others, when their plane crashed into the sea 16 seconds after takeoff from Gibraltar Airport at 23:07 on 4 July 1943. Her body was never found. Death and remembrance The deaths of General Sikorski and Zofia remain something of a mystery. Her presence alongside the General in those tragic days is associated with controversy and misunderstandings. It has been speculated that instead of dying in the crash, she was abducted and imprisoned in the Soviet camps near Moscow, and later in the interior of the country where she was allegedly seen by Polish officers, including special agent Tadeusz Kobyliński. Such speculations, however, remain in the realm of conspiracy theories, and as noted by Roman Wapiński in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, it is presumed Zofia died alongside her father in what was just an unfortunate accident.

Plot Hank Salko (Gabriel Dell), a member of the Eastside youth gang in New York, is initiated into the world of adult crime when two gangsters, Mike (Joe Kirk) and Butch Brocalli (Maxie Rosenbloom), hire him to stand watch while they rob a bank. When Hank tries to share some of his ill- gotten money with the East Side Kids, they suspend him from the club, and Hank is then arrested by Joe Reagan (Roger Pryor), the local policeman. While playing baseball in the street, the Kids accidentally send a ball crashing through the window of the apartment in which Butch and Mike are hiding. Butch emerges and refuses to give the ball back, so Danny (Bobby Jordan) runs after him. When Joe recognizes Butch, he chases him and Danny trips the criminal, who is then arrested along with Mike. Danny is awarded $200 for capturing the criminals and plans to buy baseball uniforms for his friends. They are unaware of his plans, however, and, thinking he is keeping the money to be selfish, steal it from him and ban him from the club. Danny's sister Ruth (Gale Storm) calls Joe, who is her boyfriend, and he has the Kids arrested for thievery. The arrest deepens the Kids's resentment of Danny, even though Danny insists that they be released. Once free, the Kids buy an old car with the $200. A month later, Hank breaks out of jail with Butch and Mike and warns Mugs (Leo Gorcey), the leader of the Eastside Kids, and the rest of the group that the gangsters are after Danny for getting them arrested. The gang responds immediately out of deeply rooted loyalty for their friend, but are too late and find him severely beaten in a warehouse, where Butch and Mike have left him. When they learn that only ace brain surgeon Ormsby (Walter Woolf King) can save their friend, they go to Ormsby's house and plead for their friend's life, offering their beat-up jalopy as payment. Ormsby is touched by their concern and agrees to forgo a conference in order to operate on Danny. The surgery is successful and Ormsby refrains from charging for it, but Danny does not rally to recover. Joe reveals to the East Side Kids Danny's real intentions for the $200, and the remorseful boys go to his bedside and, after inviting him back into the club, urge him to recover. Ruth is later taken hostage at her apartment by Butch and Mike, but the gang sneaks into the apartment and attacks the thugs. Hank is instrumental in knocking Mike out, and after the gangsters are arrested, Hank is released from his sentence. The East Side Kids reunite in Danny's hospital room with the new baseball uniforms that they bought after selling the car. Notes The film features appearances by Gale Storm and Marie Windsor. Stanley Clements is given an \\"Introducing\\" credit. In the film he irritates Muggs by imitating him; Clements later replaced Leo Gorcey as leader of the gang when Gorcey left the series. Clements' character inexplicably vanishes during moments of the film.

Biography Born in Provița de Sus, Prahova County, he left school after the sixth grade in 1943. Until 1947, he was an apprentice at a foundry in Moreni, subsequently working there as an iron lathe operator until 1951. He joined the Romanian Communist Party's (PCR; later PMR and then PCR again) Union of Communist Youth (UTC; later UTM) in 1945, a year after the King Michael Coup brought the party out of illegality. From 1950 to 1951, he was secretary of his factory UTM committee; from 1954 to 1956, he was first secretary of the Câmpina raion UTM committee; and from 1956 to 1959, he was secretary of the Ploieşti regional UTM committee. From 1956 to 1960, he belonged to the UTM's central committee for revision. In 1959, he became an adjunct member of the bureau of the UTM's central committee, also serving as head of its organisational section; he became a full member of the bureau in 1962. Additionally, he sat on the UTM's central committee from 1960 to 1964.Neagoe, p.595 Postelnicu furthered his education at the cadre school of the UTM's central committee, finishing in 1954; at the Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy, which he graduated in 1967; and at the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, where he took equivalence examinations and entered the doctoral programme in 1977. After joining the PMR in 1953, Postelnicu was promoted through its ranks. He first became an instructor at its mass organisation section; holding the same job at the central committee's organisational section from 1964 to 1969. He was secretary of the Olt County party committee from 1969 to 1971, and then from 1971 to 1976 secretary of the Buzău County party committee. From 1976 to 1978, he was first secretary in the same county, and president of the executive committee of its people's council (equivalent to today's county councils). From March 1978 to October 1987, Postelnicu headed the country's secret police, the Securitate, holding ministerial rank as a secretary of state.Neagoe, p.596 In this capacity, he orchestrated a campaign against the dissident writer Paul Goma, who had left the country in 1977, with the goal of discrediting him in Romania and abroad. The aim was to depict Goma as an agent of foreign powers and Hungarian irredentists, while among Iron Guard circles in Western Europe and the United States, Goma would be presented as being under Mossad influence obtained through his Jewish father-in-law. Following his Securitate stint, he served as Interior Minister in the Constantin Dăscălescu cabinet. In November 1979, he joined the PCR's central committee, and was a supplementary member of its political executive committee (CPEx) from November 1984 to December 1989. He also sat in the Great National Assembly for Teleorman and then Prahova County from March 1980 to December 1989. Political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu describes him as part of a group of \\"deeply subservient\\" and \\"utterly incompetent\\" figures with whom dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu surrounded himself in the 1980s.Tismăneanu, p.258 Postelnicu was arrested during the 1989 Revolution, on the night of 22-23 December. Tried at the Bucharest Military Tribunal, he was sentenced in February 1990 to life imprisonment and confiscation of all his personal property, for complicity in genocide. The well-publicised proceedings have been described as a \\"show trial\\"; Postelnicu and three other prominent defendants pleaded guilty after delivering rehearsed, self-critical testimony that they later renounced.Roht-Arriaza, p.132-33 The phrase he used to explain his actions became famous: \\"Am fost un dobitoc!\\" (\\"I was an idiot\\"). Cristina Răduţă, \\"Cei mai de temut şefi ai Securităţii\\" (\\"The Most Feared Securitate Bosses\\"), Adevărul, 19 June 2013; accessed June 20, 2013 In April 1993, upon a request by the state prosecutor, the Supreme Court of Justice annulled the earlier sentence, instead convicting him of complicity in aggravated manslaughter and attempted manslaughter, and reducing his sentence to seven years' imprisonment and eight years' deprivation of civic rights. That month, a new trial began; he and eight others were charged with carrying out Ceauşescu's orders for the summary execution of three people who attempted to hijack a bus to the West in 1981. The Bucharest Military Tribunal convicted all nine in 1993.Roht-Arriaza, p.138 In 1994, the court accepted his personal request for conditional release on grounds of health.Neagoe, p.596 He was again incarcerated from January 1998 to October 1999, when he was granted conditional release a second time. \\"Tudor Postelnicu şi alţi opt foşti ofiţeri de Securitate şi Miliţie îşi aşteaptǎ sentinţa\\" (\\"Tudor Postelnicu and Eight Other Former Securitate and Militia Officers Await Their Sentence\\"), Gazeta de Sud, 21 February 2002; accessed August 26, 2009 Postelnicu died in a Bucharest hospital in 2017, following a long illness that left him attached to a ventilator near the end of his life. \\"A murit Tudor Postelnicu, unul dintre cei mai de temut şefi ai Securităţii de pe vremea lui Ceauşescu\\" (\\"Tudor Postelnicu Dead, Among the Most Feared Ceauşescu-era Securitate Chiefs\\"), Adevărul, 12 August 2017; accessed August 12, 2017 Notes References *Stelian Neagoe, Oameni politici români, Editura Machiavelli, Bucharest, 2007, *Naomi Roht-Arriaza, Impunity and Human Rights in International Law and Practice, Oxford University Press US, 1995, *Vladimir Tismăneanu, Stalinism for All Seasons: A Political History of Romanian Communism, University of California Press, 2003, Category:Romanian communists Category:Members of the Great National Assembly Category:Romanian Ministers of Interior Category:Romanian politicians convicted of crimes Category:People of the Romanian Revolution Category:Romanian prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Romania Category:People from Prahova County Category:1931 births Category:2017 deaths ","title":"Tudor Postelnicu"},{"id":"24121449","text":"To Serve Them All My Days is a British television drama series, adapted by Andrew Davies from R. F. Delderfield's 1972 novel To Serve Them All My Days. It was first broadcast by the BBC over 13 episodes in 1980 and 1981. It was broadcast in Australia in 1981 by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and in 1982 by PBS in the United States as part of their Masterpiece Theatre anthology series. Plot As in the novel, the protagonist is David Powlett- Jones (John Duttine), a coal miner's son from South Wales, who has risen from the ranks and been commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the First World War. In 1918, after being injured and shell-shocked, he is hired to teach modern history at Bamfylde School, a fictional public school in North Devon, in the southwest of England, where he wins the respect and acclaim of colleagues and pupils. He serves under headmaster Algy Herries (Frank Middlemass), forms a friendship with Ian Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and marries Beth (Belinda Lang). He engages in a long bitter rivalry with the jingoistic science master Carter (Neil Stacy) but the two of them later become friends. Powlett-Jones is eventually appointed headmaster. Production The series was filmed over 11 months in 1980, with Devon and Dorset locations including Milton Abbey School in Dorset. Besides the exterior filming, indoor scenes were filmed on a soundstage.

NWRA’s mission is to engage and mobilize volunteers in building support for refuges, educate decision-makers in Washington, and lead diverse conservation partnerships designed to amplify the impact that refuges have in protecting wildlife habitat both within and beyond their formal boundaries. Founded in 1975, by former National Wildlife Refuge System managers and employees, the NWRA is the only national advocacy organization dedicated to promoting and protecting the National Wildlife Refuge System.  Advocacy in Washington, D.C.  The NWRA is a leading voice for the Refuge System in Washington, D.C., and informs decision-makers about legislation and policies that benefit or threaten wildlife refuge habitat. NWRA is the chair of the Cooperative Alliance for Refuge Enhancement (CARE), a diverse coalition of 22 sporting, science and conservation organizations that includes the National Rifle Association and Defenders of Wildlife. The coalition spearheaded efforts in 2009, to secure $200 million for wildlife conservation programs through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and ensured a $39 million increase in annual Refuge System funding that year.  The Refuge Friends movement The NWRA mobilizes thousands of volunteers and refuge friends groups across the country to proactively address the challenges refuges face. The NWRA has led thousands of Refuge Friends volunteers to Capitol Hill and hosted the 2009 National Refuge Friends Conference, and the annual Refuge System Awards. NWRA has also led efforts to stop construction of a road through federally designated wilderness in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, publishing its \\"Road to Nowhere\\" report in 2008. Conservation programs  The NWRA leads science-based and partner-driven conservation initiatives to protect ecologically rich wild land surrounding national wildlife refuges. By facilitating partnerships among land trusts, refuge friends groups, conservation organizations, recreation groups and federal and state agencies, NWRA maximizes funding and expertise in these conservation programs. NWRA's conservation programs have led to partnerships to protect habitat for endangered West Indian manatees at Crystal River NWR, Florida, created strategic plans for acquiring, restoring and conserving key habitats in the Lower Mississippi River valley, and forged key partnerships to protect desert tortoises in southern Nevada and seabirds in coastal Oregon.

It is the precursor to the antibiotic tabtoxinine β-lactam. Tabtoxin is a monocyclic β-lactam produced by P. syringae pv. tabaci, coronafaciens, and garcae. Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, the causal agent of the wildfire of tobacco, produces the phytotoxin tabtoxin. tabtoxin-producing bacterium, P. syringae BR2, causes a disease of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) similar to tobacco wildfire. This organism is closely related to P. syringae pv. tabaci but cannot be classified in the pathovar tabaci because it is not pathogenic on tobacco. Tabtoxin has been shown to be a dipeptide precursor that must undergo hydrolysis by a peptidase to yield the biologically active form, tabtoxinine-p-lactam (TβL). Tabtoxin is required by BR2(R) for both chlorosis and lesion formation on bean. All mutations that affected tabtoxin production, whether spon- taneous deletion or transposon induced, also affected lesion formation, and in all cases, restoration of tabtoxin production also restored pathogenic symptoms. Other factors may be required for BR2 to be pathogenic on bean, but apparently these are in addition to tabtoxin production. Protein Tabtoxin resistance protein (TTR) is an enzyme that catalyzes the acetylation of tabtoxin rendering tabtoxin-producing pathogens tolerant to their own phytotoxins. According to the structure based detoxification mechanism of TTR, three site- directed mutants Y141F, D130N and Y141F-D130N were constructed and overexpressed in E. coli. The products were then purified and their properties were analyzed by CD and DLS. The crystal structure of TTR complexed with its natural cofactor, acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), to 1.55 Å resolution. The binary complex forms a characteristic “V” shape for substrate binding and contains the four motifs conserved in the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily, which also includes the histone acetyltransferases (HATs). There are reports that TTR possesses HAT activity and suggest an evolutionary relationship between TTR and other GNAT members. The dipeptide toxin contains tabtoxinine-β-lactam (TβL) linked by a peptide bond to threonine produced, the chlorosis-inducing activity occurs only after hydrolysis of the peptide bond by aminopeptidases of plant or bacterial origin. Cleavage of the peptide bond in tabtoxin releases TβL, the toxic moiety. TβL is located at the N terminus, and Thr is at the C terminus, resulting in TβL-Thr. TβL-Thr is hydrolyzed, and the resulting TβL irreversibly inhibits glutamine synthetase, causing characteristic chlorosis in plants. TβL is spontaneously isomerized to tabtoxinine-δ-lactam (TδL), and TblF did not recognize TδL as a substrate, yielding no TδL-Thr. Some characteristics were also provided by them, but only from the perspective of tabtoxin biosynthesis. βL-Thr is observed, but Thr- TβL, whose sequence is the reverse of that of tabtoxin, is not. The effects of carbon, nitrogen sources and amino acids on growth and tabtoxin production by pv. tabaci, were examined by varying the components of a defined basal medium, which contained the following nutrients per liter: sucrose (10 g), KNO3 (5 g), MgSO(4).7H2O (0.2 g), CaCl(2).2H2O (0.11 g), FeSO(4).7H2O (20 mg), NaH2PO(4).2H2O (0.9 g) and H2PO(4).3HO (1 g). Both growth and quantity of tabtoxin synthesized were significantly affected by carbon source, nitrogen source and amino acid supplements. Sorbitol, xylose and sucrose proved to be the best carbon sources for tabtoxin production. Specific toxin production was very low using glucose as a single carbohydrate source, although bacterial growth was well supported by glucose. Amount and type of nitrogen sources (NH4Cl or KNO3) affected the growth of pv. tabaci and quantities of tabtoxin produced. Nitrate is the best of these two forms of nitrogen for production of tabtoxin. Biosynthesis and Regulation The biosynthetic precursors of tabtoxin were identified by the incorporation of 13C-labeled compounds and shown to consist of L-threonine and L-aspartate for the side chain and pyruvic acid and the methyl group of L-methionine for the β-lactam moiety. A biosynthetic model for the formation of TβL resembles that of lysine, where the first dedicated step is the DapA-catalyzed condensation of aspartic acid semialdehyde with pyruvate to form L-2,3-dihydropicolinate (DHDPA). Tabtoxin biosynthesis branches off from the lysine biosynthetic pathway before the formation of diaminopimelate (DAP). TabA is a gene, which is essential for tabtoxin production. The discovery of this gene provided the first experimental data to support the hypotheses that the precursors for tabtoxin originate from the lysine biosynthetic pathway. The deduced amino acid sequence of tabA showed significant relatedness to lysA, which encodes DAP decarboxylase in bacteria. Although tabA was not required for lysine biosynthesis, the deduced product of a tabB, also located in the TβL biosynthetic region, showed relatedness todapD, a gene encoding THDPA succinyl-CoA succinyltransferase (THDPA-ST). DapB is essential for both lysine and tabtoxin biosynthesis and THDPA may be an intermediate in both pathways. Three genes have been characterized in the 31-kb region which contains all genes necessary for TβL synthesis and tabtoxin resistance: tabA, tabB, and tblA. Although there is no obvious relationship between TblA and known polypeptides, TabA has significant sequence homology to LysA from E. coliand P. aeruginosa whereas TabB shows relatedness to DapD. Some progress has been made on elucidating factors that regulate tabtoxin biosynthesis in P. syringae. In a subsequent study, zinc was shown to be required for the aminopeptidase activity, which hydrolyzes tabtoxin to release TβL.

It is dedicated and named after a species of Falcon found in the mountains of Pakistan. The Shaheen I is also designated Hatf IV. Description Codename The JS HQ officially adopted the codename of the missile as \\"Hatf–IV. It has been reported that it was Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who suggested the name \\"Shaheen\\" by taking a cue from philosopher Iqbal's poetic symbol Shaheen Falcon. After being test fired in 1999, JS HQ officially codenamed the missile as \\"Hatf–IV Shaheen. Though its variants are now known as Shaheen-I and Shaheen-IA. Shaheen 1 Shaheen I is a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) with an optimal range of 750 km and propelled by a two-stage solid-fuel rocket motor. The Shaheen I can deliver either a conventional or a nuclear payload much faster than liquid fuelled missiles such as the Ghauri because it does not need to be fuelled before launch, reducing deployment time significantly. The Shaheen I is believed to be very accurate; Pakistani military sources state a CEP of 25 to 50 m can be achieved, partly due to a \\"post-separation attitude correction system.\\" This system would allow the missile to modify its trajectory, improving accuracy and, along with the stealthy warhead shaping, giving some capability to evade missile defence systems. It is based on terminal guidance system technology, which improves warhead accuracy by firing small thrusters to adjust the warhead's trajectory and uses satellite navigation systems to help find the target. Such systems would allow the Shaheen to be used against strategic targets without requiring a nuclear warhead to ensure the target's destruction. According to other sources, the CEP of Shaheen I is 200 meters. Shaheen 1A (Hatf IV) On 25 April 2012, Pakistan successfully test- launched an upgraded Shaheen I called Shaheen 1A. The military said in a statement that the Shaheen 1A is a medium-range ballistic missile. It is an improved version of the Shaheen 1 with better accuracy and double the range of its predecessor. The Pakistani military initially did not publicly reveal the range of the missile which led to media speculation of the true range of the missile. According to a defense analyst in Islamabad, this missile could be equipped with warheads designed to evade missile defense systems. The speed of the Shaheen 1A also provides an extremely high impact speed for nearby targets, enabling it to avoid any anti-ballistic missile defenses that may develop in the immediate region. A western official in Islamabad mentioned that the Shaheen 1A missile seems to have an improved ability to strike at its targets. It also has a more powerful engine, which means that it travels at scramjet speeds and can strike at longer distances than Shaheen-1. On 25 April 2012, the ISPR revealed more information about the missile. The missile weight is approximately 10,000 kg, slightly heavier than its predecessor and can carry a single 1000 kg warhead. In addition, the Shaheen IA primarily contains sophisticated automated refueling and advanced stealth technology features that were not present in its previous version to avoid detections from radars. All three Shaheen missiles, Shaheen I, Shaheen 1A and Shaheen II are reportedly equipped with the latest PSAC (Post-Separation Altitude Correction) system. This is a unique feature which consists of small thrusters that can adjust the warhead trajectory for greater accuracy and evading anti-ballistic missile defence systems. The features of the missile could also serve as a testbed of features which could be implemented on the yet to be deployed Shaheen III. Shaheen-1 A ( Hatf IV), with a range of 900 km, was test-fired on 17 November 2014.http://www.dawn.com/news/1145070 Operational history Development on Shaheen program began in 1995 and the program went to National Development Complex bureau of the National Engineering and Scientific Commission (NESCOM). The program was put under Dr. Samar Mubarakmand– a nuclear physicist and a fluid dynamicist who delegated the program to country's scientists and engineers. Necessary fundings for the program were secured by the military, and the development on rocket engine and its eventually testings began to be utilized by the Space Research Commission. In the memoirs of scientists who worked on the program maintained that \\"Shaheen was a very difficult program and the development of this system has given maximum accuracy– a 100% capability of destroying its target.\\" The program's original goal was to developed a supersonic missile that it would be impossible for any missile defense system could intercept it. Solid-fuel systems for the guided missiles are very difficult to develop and Pakistani scientists closely monitored the Indian development of the Agni-II missile. The Space Research Commission continued to modifies the designs, and repeatedly tests the Solid-fuel rocket engines on multiple occasions. The Shaheen-I was test fired on 15 April 1999 by a joint team of NDC and SRC led under Dr. Samar Mubarakmand from the Sonmiani Test Range, which was termed as \\"highly successfully\\". At the height of military standoff with India in 2002, another test took place and it was quoted by Information minister Nisar Memon as \\"part of technical requirements\\" and unrelated to the military confrontation in Kashmir. On 8 October 2003, the Shaheen-I was again test fired for a third time from an undisclosed location, as the ISPR stated: \\"The test is part of the ongoing series of tests of Pakistan's indigenous missile systems.\\" A batch of Shaheen I missiles, enough to equip one regiment/battery, was handed over to the Pakistan Army in 2003 along with mobile launchers. Another was tested on 8 May 2010http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn- content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-pak-missiles-test-qs-05 The Shaheen 1A was test fired on 25 April 2012.

The substances studied are high production volume (HPV) chemicals, which are manufactured or imported in quantities of more than 1000 tonnes per year for any single OECD market. The list of HPV chemicals is prepared by the OECD Secretariat and updated regularly. As of 2004, 4,843 chemicals were on the list.. Of these, roughly 1000 have been prioritised for special attention, and SIDS are prepared for these chemicals,. usually by an official agency in one of the OECD member countries with the collaboration of the UN International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS). The procedures for investigating the risks of an HPV chemical are described in the OECD Manual for Investigation of HPV Chemicals.. The initial stage is the collection of existing information (either published or supplied by manufacturers) on the chemical. If the existing information is insufficient to make an assessment of the risks, the chemical may be tested at this stage to collect more data. The initial report of the investigation is discussed at a SIDS initial assessment meeting (SIAM), which includes: *representatives of OECD member countries *experts nominated by the IPCS, the OECD Business and Industry Advisory Committee, Trade Union Advisory Committee, and environmental organizations * representatives of companies which produce the chemical * secretariat staff from OECD, IPCS, and UNEP chemicals The SIAM can either accept the draft report or call for revisions (including further testing). Once the comments and discussion of the SIAM have been taken into account, the report is published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The possibility of new testing to complete the study is what distinguishes SIDS reports from similar studies such as Concise International Chemical Assessment Documents (CICADs). In this sense, SIDS are similar to European Union Risk Assessment Reports (RARs). The distinction is that the SIDS programme is specifically aimed at HPV chemicals, while the chemicals selected for EU RARs are chosen more on the basis of a hazard profile, so include chemicals with much lower production volumes.

Blue-green algae can be helpful in agriculture as they have the capability to fix atmospheric nitrogen to soil. This nitrogen is helpful to the crops. Blue-green algae is used as a biofertilizer. A biofertilizer (also bio-fertilizer) is a substance which contains living micro-organisms which, when applied to seeds, plant surfaces, or soil, colonize the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant. Biofertilizers add nutrients through the natural processes of nitrogen fixation, solubilizing phosphorus, and stimulating plant growth through the synthesis of growth-promoting substances. The microorganisms in biofertilizers restore the soil's natural nutrient cycle and build soil organic matter. Through the use of biofertilizers, healthy plants can be grown, while enhancing the sustainability and the health of the soil. Biofertilizers can be expected to reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, but they are not yet able to replace their use. Since they play several roles, a preferred scientific term for such beneficial bacteria is \\"plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria\\" (PGPR).  Biofertilizers today  Biofertilizers provide \\"eco-friendly\\" organic agro-input. Biofertilizers such as Rhizobium, Azotobacter, Azospirilium and blue green algae (BGA) have been in use a long time. Rhizobium inoculant is used for leguminous crops. Azotobacter can be used with crops like wheat, maize, mustard, cotton, potato and other vegetable crops. Azospirillum inoculations are recommended mainly for sorghum, millets, maize, sugarcane and wheat. Blue green algae belonging to a general cyanobacteria genus, Nostoc or Anabaena or Tolypothrix or Aulosira, fix atmospheric nitrogen and are used as inoculations for paddy crop grown both under upland and low-land conditions. Anabaena in association with water fern Azolla contributes nitrogen up to 60 kg/ha/season and also enriches soils with organic matter.seaweeds are rich in various types of mineral elements (potassium, phosphorus, trace elements etc) hence they are extensively used as manure by people of coastal districts. Seaweed - manure also helps in breaking down clays. Fucus is used by Irish people as manure on a large scale. In tropical countries bottom mud of dried up ponds which contain abundant blue green algae is regularly used as manure in fields. The mixture of seaweeds and blue green algae may serve as ideal fertilizer.  Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria  Other types of bacteria, so-called phosphate-solubilizing bacteria, such as Pantoea agglomerans strain P5 or Pseudomonas putida strain P13, are able to solubilize the insoluble phosphate from organic and inorganic phosphate sources. In fact, due to immobilization of phosphate by mineral ions such as Fe, Al and Ca or organic acids, the rate of available phosphate (Pi) in soil is well below plant needs. In addition, chemical Pi fertilizers are also immobilized in the soil, immediately, so that less than 20 percent of added fertilizer is absorbed by plants. Therefore, reduction in Pi resources, on one hand, and environmental pollutions resulting from both production and applications of chemical Pi fertilizer, on the other hand, have already demanded the use of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria or phosphate biofertilizers. Benefits # Biofertilizers are means of fixing the nutrient availability in the soil. Generally Nitrogen deficiencies. # Since a bio-fertilizer is technically living, it can symbiotically associate with plant roots. Involved microorganisms could readily and safely convert complex organic material into simple compounds, so that they are easily taken up by the plants. Microorganism function is in long duration, causing improvement of the soil fertility. It maintains the natural habitat of the soil. It increases crop yield by 20-30%, replaces chemical nitrogen and phosphorus by 30%, and stimulates plant growth. It can also provide protection against drought and some soil-borne diseases. #It has also been shown that to produce a larger quantity of crops, biofertilizers with the ability of nitrogen fixation and phosphorus solubilizing would lead to the greatest possible effect. #They advance shoot and root growth of many crops versus control groups. This can be important when implementing new seed growth. #Biofertilizers also promote healthy soil, leading to greater farming sustainability.  Groups of biofertilizers #Azolla-Anabena symbiosis: Azolla is a small, eukaryotic, aquatic fern having global distribution. Prokaryotic blue green algae Anabena azolla resides in its leaves as a symbiont. Azolla is an alternative nitrogen source. This association has gained wide interest because of its potential use as an alternative to chemical fertilizers. #Rhizobium: Symbiotic nitrogen fixation by Rhizobium with legumes contribute substantially to total nitrogen fixation. Rhizobium inoculation is a well-known agronomic practice to ensure adequate nitrogen. #Streptomyces grisoflavus #Unigrow (UniGrow): a commercial bio fertilizer that is currently in use. It is made with a by-product of palm oil production and it contains a microbial element It has been shown to have promising results in studies.  Areas in need of improvement  Biofertilizers have been shown to have varying effects in different environments, and even within the same environment. This is something that many scientists have been working on, however there is no perfect solution at this time. They however, have been shown to have the most profound effects in drier climates. In the future, it is hoped that biofertilizers effects will be better controlled and regulated in all environments.

Initially constructed by the Santa Fe Railway Company as a reservoir for their steam engines, the lake is now used for recreation. History The lake was built in 1915 by the Santa Fe Railway Company (ATSF: Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe) as a holding reservoir for water to supply steam engines on the nearby railway line, which ran roughly 3.5 miles west of Lake Merritt at Bozar; “Merritt” was most likely the name of an ATSF railroad engineer. After the demise of the steam engine, the lake was sold to a group of private investors who purchased the lake property as a recreational project, the Mills County Hunting and Fishing Club. Although the lake was intended for the exclusive use of Club shareholders, there was little enforcement, and local residents, especially teenagers, frequented the lake for fishing and swimming. Potential water source In the 1960s, the Goldthwaite city council considered Lake Merritt as the city's main water supply; however, after consulting an engineering firm, the council abandoned the Lake Merritt proposition and chose the Colorado River instead. Brown's Creek Although Lake Merritt is listed on some maps (such as ACME Mapper 2.0) as Brown's Creek (the creek to which it connects), the lake's official name has been Lake Merritt since its construction.

Duria Antiquior, a more ancient Dorset, was the first pictorial representation of a scene of prehistoric life based on evidence from fossil reconstructions, a genre now known as paleoart. The first version was a watercolour painted in 1830 by the English geologist Henry De la Beche based on fossils found in Lyme Regis, Dorset, mostly by the professional fossil collector Mary Anning. De la Beche had the professional artist Georg Scharf produce lithographic prints based on the painting, which he sold to friends to raise money for Anning's benefit. It was the first depiction of a scene from deep time to see even limited publication. The print was used for educational purposes and widely circulated in scientific circles; it influenced several other such depictions that began to appear in both scientific and popular literature. Several later versions were produced.  Origin of the painting and the lithograph The lithographic print made by Georg Scharf based on De la Beche's original watercolour. By 1830 Mary Anning was well known to the leading British geologists and fossil collectors for her ability to spot important fossils in the Jurassic limestone and shale formations around the resort town of Lyme Regis on the Dorset coast, and for her knowledge and skill in collecting, reconstructing and preparing them. William Conybeare’s scientific description of some of the marine reptile fossils she had found, including the first ichthyosaur skeleton to be recognized for what it was and the first two plesiosaur skeletons ever found, had created a sensation in scientific circles.McGowan 2001 pp. 9–24, 67–75 William Buckland credited Anning with two key observations about certain odd fossils, that they were sometimes found in the abdominal regions of ichthyosaur skeletons, and that they often contained fossilized fish scales and bones (and sometimes the bones of small ichthyosaurs), which led him to conclude that coprolites were fossilized faeces.Rudwick 2008 pp. 154–158 This discovery led Buckland to write a vivid description of the Lias food chain. It was this description that motivated the geologist Henry De la Beche, who had worked with Conybeare describing the marine reptile fossils, to create a pictorial representation of life in ancient Dorset. Despite her renown in geological circles, in 1830 Anning was having financial difficulties due to hard economic times in Britain, and the long and unpredictable intervals between major fossil finds. Impressed by the positive reaction from his friends to his initial watercolour painting, De la Beche decided to assist Anning by having the professional illustrator Georg Scharf, who had earlier done lithographs of Conybeare's sketches of plesiosaur and ichthyosaur skeletons, create a lithographic print based on his original. He then sold copies of the print to friends and colleagues at the price of £2 10s each and donated the proceeds to Anning.Rudwick 1992 pp. 42–47 Prior to Duria Antiquior Georges Cuvier had published drawings of what he believed certain prehistoric creatures would have looked like in life. Conybeare had drawn a famous cartoon of Buckland sticking his head into a den of prehistoric hyaenas in honour of his well- known analysis of the excavation at Kirkdale Cave, but Duria Antiquior was the first depiction of a scene from deep time showing a variety of prehistoric creatures interacting with one another and their environment based on fossil evidence. Composition Many of the creatures are depicted in violent interaction. The central figures are a large ichthyosaur biting into the long neck of a plesiosaur. Another plesiosaur is seen trying to surprise a crocodile on the shore, and yet another is using its long neck to seize a pterosaur flying above the water. This emphasis on violent interactions in nature was typical of the Regency era.McGowan 2001 p. 74 De la Beche translated Conybeare's verbal description of marine reptiles into pictorial form. Several of the ichthyosaurs are depicted seizing various fish whose scales and bones had been found in coprolites and a couple are shown excreting the faeces that will become the coprolites of the future. In addition to the vertebrates there were several invertebrates shown including belemnites depicted as squid-like and an ammonite represented as a floating creature along the lines of a paper nautilus. There are also more recognizable empty ammonite shells on the sea bottom, and some stalked crinoids (sea lilies), of which some very finely preserved fossils had been found at Lyme Regis, are depicted in the lower right corner. One of the features of the painting that has most struck historians is the split level view that shows action both above and below the surface of the water. This is known as an aquarium view, and Duria Antiquior is the first known example; the style would not become common until the Victorian aquarium craze a couple of decades later.  Circulation, use and influence The prints proved quite popular, and at some point the lithograph was redrawn and a larger run printed; in some of the later versions the figures were numbered. William Buckland kept a supply of the prints on hand and circulated them at his geology lectures. Copies were soon sent to geologists outside Britain, including Cuvier in France.Gordon 1894 pp. 116–118 In Berlin, Leopold von Buch, presented the lithograph on 4 February 1831 to an audience, praised the then recent developments in British Geology and raised new questions about the processes of geohistorical change. A print also apparently reached Georg August Goldfuss, as in 1831 he included a similar drawing, clearly influenced by De la Beche's work, of a scene out of the Jurassic based on fossils from the Jura Mountains in the latest chapter of the serial publication of his Fossils of Germany. Buckland wrote to De la Beche urging him to create more scenes before the Germans used up all the best ideas. De la Beche didn't produce any other scenes on such a scale, but he did include several much smaller and simpler scenes of prehistoric life in the second edition of his Geological Manual (1832). Such scenes didn't remain confined to scientific circles. In 1833 the geologist John Phillips produced a wood cut of an elaborate prehistoric scene, that was obviously influenced by both Duria Antiquior and Goldfuss's Jurassic scene, for publication in the popular Penny Magazine, and another illustration which borrowed elements from Duria Antiquior appeared in a French illustrated dictionary of natural history in 1834.Rudwick 1992 pp. 51–63 Such scenes from deep time vividly illustrated advances in palaeontology, and helped convince scholars and even the general public that the deep past could be understood with a reasonable degree of confidence.Rudwick 2008 p. 159 Later versions of the scene The large oil on canvas painted by Robert Farren circa 1850 based on earlier versions by De la Beche and Scharf. The Swiss professor of geology Francois Jules Pictet de la Rive had a small version of Duria Antiquior redrawn for inclusion in the last volume of his Elementary Treatise on Paleontology (1844–1846). It was an accurate copy of the De la Beche–Scharf lithograph except that it omitted the faeces. This was the first version of the image to be published in a book.Rudwick 1992 pp. 88–90 Sometime around 1850 Robert Farren painted a large version of the scene in oil on canvas for Adam Sedgwick. Sedgwick may have used it as a prop in his geology lectures at Cambridge. In 2007 the Lyme Regis artist Richard Bizley worked with David Ward to produce an updated version of the scene that reflected modern scientific knowledge of the creatures depicted. In Lyme Regis Museum there is a large three-dimensional diorama based on Duria Antiquior, created by artist Darrell Wakelam in partnership with local children.

The fourth tropical system and third named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Danny developed on August 26 from the interaction between a westward-moving tropical wave and an upper-level trough while situated east of the Bahamas. The storm never fully matured, and resembled a subtropical cyclone. It meandered generally northwestward before being absorbed into another weather system on August 29. Danny had only minor effects on land. However, it triggered high surf and rip currents from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states, leading to the death of a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina. The cyclone's remnants contributed to widespread rainfall in the northeast United States. At one point, some weather forecasts predicted Danny to rapidly strengthen, and hit Nantucket as a Category 1 hurricane, although this never occurred. Localized flooding was reported, particularly in Pennsylvania. It later caused heavy precipitation and power outages in Atlantic Canada. Meteorological history Danny originated in a tropical wave that exited the west coast of Africa on August 18. Convective activity associated with the system briefly began to organize on August 22, but wind shear soon halted further development. On August 24, thunderstorms once again increased as the disturbance interacted with an upper-level trough. On August 25, a Hurricane Hunters mission into the system revealed a broad area of tropical-storm force winds, but no closed circulation center. However, around 0900 UTC on August 26, satellite imagery and QuikSCAT data indicated that a closed low had formed. While situated about east of Nassau, Bahamas, the feature was declared a tropical storm—skipping the tropical depression stage. Due to the interaction of the initial wave and the upper-level trough, Danny maintained a \\"non-classical\\" structure resembling that of a subtropical cyclone. Even after its designation as a tropical storm, the storm was highly disorganized. Little or no deep thunderstorm activity surrounded the center, and the highest winds were confined to a rainband in the northern semicircle of the cyclone. The storm moved erratically northwestward throughout the day on August 26, strengthening only slightly. Danny's center reformed several times, making it difficult to determine its direction of movement. By early on August 27, the tropical storm became slightly better organized, although the most intense winds were still removed from the center. Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before reinvigorated shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft found that it was barely a tropical storm. After stalling during the afternoon, the center resumed a north or north-northwestward drift. Tropical Storm Danny sheared by vertical wind shear on August 28 A strong upper-level trough moving through the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward. It also triggered the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated that it did not have the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275 mi (445 km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter. Impact In advance of the cyclone, a tropical storm watch was posted for North Carolina from Cape Lookout to the town of Duck at 2100 UTC on August 27. It was discontinued on August 29. As the storm remained offshore, its effects were limited. However, it generated strong rip currents and high waves along the U.S. East Coast which may have resulted in the drowning death of a 12-year-old boy near Corolla, North Carolina, on August 28. On September 1, the Currituck County Sheriff's Office reported that the boy's body was found on the beach about north of where he went missing. Farther south, swells reached Florida's Atlantic coast.

The remnants of the storm interacted with a frontal boundary, triggering widespread precipitation across numerous states. In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, torrential rainfall produced flash flooding that trapped one family in their basement. A creek near Philadelphia overflowed its banks and caused minor flooding. Several roads in Lehigh County, including one lane of U.S. Route 222, were closed due to flood waters. Flooding also took place in New Jersey; numerous basements were submerged and motorists in Camden County had to be rescued from their vehicles. In Maryland, rainfall peaked at .

The top is tall enough to stand under, and provides shade and rain protection for 2 or more passengers at the boat's helm. The T-Top is distinguished from other boat tops in that the entire structure is attached to the center console area, with no support brackets or straps connected to the outside of the boat, thereby providing 360-degree access around the boat for fishing and water activities. Generally, t-tops are constructed from a high quality marine aluminum extrusion which is anodized for appearance longevity. The anodized aluminum extrusion requires a specific welding machine to assemble, usually a welding machine with pulse and square wave capacity. Marine extrusion is the lightest and most durable material for t-top construction. Stainless steel is also an optional material for construction. It is much heavier, more difficult, and costly to build, and may not have the structural durability or flexibility of its aluminum counterpart. However, it is often seen to be much more attractive.

Founded in 2004, it aims to foster and develop entrepreneurship among university and high school students. It has offices in Vancouver, Calgary and Waterloo, Ontario. To fulfill its aim, Impact has a number of different programs and initiatives to promote youth entrepreneurship and leadership, both at the local and national level. The organization currently consists of over 100 student volunteers across Canada. Origins Impact was founded in 2004 by Kunal Gupta, who was a first-year software engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Gupta, along with his classmate Gaurav Jain and three others, envisioned a non-profit, student-run organization promoting entrepreneurship among Canadian youth in order to advocate entrepreneurship among high school, university, and college students. Current Initiatives Impact organizes many local events and programs, mainly in Southern Ontario. Its national initiatives include the following: EntrepreneurHub A new initiative launched in 2011, EntrepreneurHub.ca is a website built to connect startups to students and recent graduates who are looking for employment opportunities in startups. The website is also used by entrepreneurs to connect with each other to form partnerships. I Am My Ambition I Am My Ambition is a series of short videos released by Impact, in which entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and politicians share their experiences, successes and failures. The aim of this project is to showcase these people in a way that youth can easily relate to, and in a way that would inspire youth.Shulman, Lena (2010, Spring/Summer). Youth Entrepreneurship. Canadian Student Magazine. 40-47. Impact Apprentice Based on the successful reality show The Apprentice, Impact Apprentice is an annual nationwide business competition between student teams from universities across Canada. Although over 1000 individuals apply to Impact Apprentice each year, only about 32 students are chosen to participate in the competition. Factors taken into account during the application process include business knowledge, leadership talents, and their entrepreneurial experience. In the Impact Apprentice competition, the teams are placed under high-pressure situations, where they are required to make key decisions in their business. Thus, the competition aims to test not only the students’ academic knowledge, but also their ability to face realistic business challenges. For example, the students will be asked to manage real profits and budgets and face challenges in sales, consulting, management, and advertising. However, unlike the reality show that it was based on, no candidates will be \\"fired\\" if they fail a task, but instead, points are awarded based on the teams’ success. In the end, the winning team shares $10 000 in grand prizes. Past competitions were professionally filmed and were uploaded onto the Internet, where the episodes reached over 4000 views in less than three months. Impact Gala Starting in 2011, Impact Gala will be an annual event that brings together entrepreneurs, industry leaders, top students, and Impact members and partners to celebrate the entrepreneurial community. Impact Gala will feature networking opportunities, keynote addresses, and an awards ceremony. Impact Microcredit Impact Microcredit is a national competition in which teams of students from high schools across Canada are given $100 to launch a business idea and make as much money as possible within a week. Proceeds from the competition are donated to charities chosen by the winners. The teams are judged based on their creativity of their business plans, the effectiveness of their execution, as well as their profits. The winning teams are awarded scholarships, admission to the Encounters With Canada program, cash prizes, as well as various scholarships and grants.

Eliza Jane's May 16, 2005 death from AIDS at the age of three and a half sparked a social and legal controversy over her mother's decision not to take precautions during pregnancy and breastfeeding to prevent transmission of the virus, and her parents' decision to not have her treated for HIV infection during her life. AIDS diagnosis and death In 1992, Eliza Jane's mother, Christine Maggiore, tested positive for HIV. She subsequently became involved in volunteer work for a number of AIDS charities, including AIDS Project Los Angeles, L.A. Shanti, and Women at Risk. However, following an interaction with prominent AIDS denialist Peter Duesberg in 1994, she began to question whether HIV causes AIDS. Maggiore came to believe that her positive test may have been due to flu shots, pregnancy, or a common viral infection. Maggiore chose not to take antiretroviral drugs or other measures which reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during her pregnancies.Given the known and unknown risks of antiretroviral use in pregnancy, National Institutes of Health guidelines state that the final decision regarding their use \\"should be made by the woman after discussion with her health care provider about the known and unknown benefits and risks of therapy\\" in a \\"noncoercive\\" environment; see Maggiore also breast-fed her children, despite evidence that breast-feeding can also transmit HIV from mother to child. Her younger child, Eliza Jane, was never tested for HIV, nor did she or her older brother Charlie receive any of the recommended childhood vaccines. (Maggiore later reported Charlie to have tested HIV-negative three times.) Maggiore discussed her beliefs as an AIDS dissident on Air America Radio in March 2005, stating that \\"...our children have excellent records of health. They've never had respiratory problems, flus, intractable colds, ear infections, nothing. So, our choices, however radical they may seem, are extremely well-founded.\\" Several weeks after this interview, in April 2005, Eliza Jane became ill with a runny nose. She was seen by a physician from the family's pediatric practice, who documented a normal physical exam. Several days later, Maggiore took Eliza Jane to see another pediatrician, Jay Gordon, who felt she had a mild ear infection. Reportedly, Gordon was aware of Maggiore's HIV status, but did not have Eliza Jane tested for HIV. According to the hospital report, filed just after Eliza Jane's death and based upon an interview with Maggiore, Eliza Jane \\"had been diagnosed with pneumonia\\" in the weeks preceding her death. (2.29 MiB) When Eliza Jane failed to improve, Maggiore took her to see Philip Incao, a holistic practitioner and board member of Maggiore's AIDS-denialist organization Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives. Incao stated that Eliza Jane appeared \\"mildly ill... no way I considered her in danger... she did not act as a patient acts if she's severely ill or in danger.\\" On May 14, 2005, Incao prescribed amoxicillin for a presumed ear infection. The following day, Eliza Jane became lethargic and vomited several times. While Maggiore was on the phone with Incao, Eliza Jane collapsed and stopped breathing. She was rushed by ambulance to Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, California. Physicians attempted to resuscitate Eliza Jane, but were unsuccessful. According to the hospital report, a \\"chest x-ray revealed pneumonia,\\" and Eliza Jane was pronounced dead at 5:40 AM on May 16, 2005. Cause of death An autopsy was performed. The senior deputy medical examiner for the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office found that Eliza Jane was markedly underweight and underheight, consistent with a chronic illness, and that she had pronounced atrophy of her thymus and other lymphatic organs. Examination of her lungs showed infection with Pneumocystis jirovecii, a common opportunistic pathogen in people with AIDS and the leading cause of pediatric AIDS deaths.HIV Infection in Infants and Children; thebody.com; July 2004 Accessed 20 July 2007. The post-mortem examination of Eliza Jane's brain showed changes consistent with HIV encephalitis; protein components of HIV itself were identified in Eliza Jane's brain tissue via immunohistochemistry. Based on the clinical information, the immunohistochemical documentation of HIV in Eliza Jane's brain, the evidence of pronounced immunosuppression, and the isolation of the opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis jirovecii from Eliza Jane's lungs, the coroner concluded that Eliza Jane had died of Pneumocystis pneumonia in the setting of advanced AIDS. This conclusion was described by the coroner as \\"unequivocal\\". Maggiore rejected the coroner's conclusion, ascribing it to political bias and attacking the personal credibility of the senior coroner, James Ribe.Justice For E.J. , website maintained by David Crowe of the Alberta Reappraising AIDS Society, accessed 5 September 2006. Maggiore retained a board member of the organization she founded named Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives, toxicologist Mohammed Al-Bayati, to review the autopsy report. Al-Bayati holds a B.S. in veterinary medicine from the University of Baghdad, an M.S. from the University of Cairo, and a Ph.D. in comparative pathology from UC Davis. He is a pseudoscientist.Seth C. Kalichman, Denying AIDS: Conspiracy Theories, Pseudoscience, and Human Tragedy, p. 181, Springer Science & Business Media, 2009. He is not a physician nor is he board-certified in human pathology.Nicoli Nattrass, The AIDS Conspiracy: Science Fights Back, p. 121, Columbia University Press, 2013. He is the author of a book entitled Get All The Facts: HIV Does Not Cause AIDS. Al-Bayati released a report concluding that Eliza Jane had not died from AIDS or pneumocystis pneumonia, but from an allergic reaction to amoxicillin.Mohammed Al-Bayati's review of Eliza Jane Scovill's autopsy, accessed 5 September 2006. Maggiore embraced Al-Bayati's conclusion that a reaction to amoxicillin was responsible, stating, \\"I believe the unfortunate irony in this situation is that the one time that we were asked to and that we complied with mainstream medicine, we inadvertently gave our daughter something that took her life.\\" Al-Bayati's report has been dismissed as both biased and medically unsound.Christine Maggiore: AIDS naysayer, accessed 5 September 2006.Rebuttal to Dr. Mohammed Al-Bayati's report, by Nicholas Bennett, accessed 5 September 2006.Nicoli Nattrass, The AIDS Conspiracy: Science Fights Back, p. 122, Columbia University Press, 2013. Both the L.A. Times and ABC PrimeTime Live consulted independent experts in pathology about Eliza Jane's case; these experts agreed unequivocally with the coroner's conclusion that AIDS and resultant Pneumocystis pneumonia were the cause of death, and rejected Al-Bayati's report. Criticism and controversy Following Eliza Jane Scovill's death, Maggiore's beliefs and advocacy became points of controversy. Maggiore had held fast to her belief that HIV does not cause AIDS, and that Eliza Jane died of a reaction to amoxicillin. She submitted a letter to the LA Times alleging factual errors and omissions in their articles on Eliza Jane; the Times did not print the letter, stating that \\"If facts in an article are wrong, a correction would be published. However, no correction is warranted in this case.\\"Maggiore's view of the L.A. Times article, accessed 5 September 2006. Others point to the evidence which indicates that Eliza Jane acquired AIDS from Maggiore perinatally or via breast feeding, that Eliza's HIV infection might have been prevented had Maggiore taken antiretroviral drugs or avoided breast feeding, that Eliza Jane's death was due to complications of AIDS, and that her death may have been preventable with proper medical care. John Moore, a prominent HIV/AIDS researcher speaking at the 16th International AIDS Conference, described Eliza Jane's death as a concrete example of the human harm that can result from pseudoscientific beliefs such as AIDS denialism: Maggiore's inclusion as an exhibitor at the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa has been criticized by AIDS activists.Criticism of Maggiore's inclusion in the 13th International AIDS Conference Maggiore's influence on Thabo Mbeki's decision to block funding of medical treatment of HIV-positive pregnant women was criticized following her death, with medical researchers noting a Harvard study which estimated \\"330,000 lives were lost to new AIDS infections during the time Mbeki blocked government funding of AZT treatment to mothers.\\" The journalist and AIDS denialist Celia Farber wrote an article in June 2006 in the independent paper Los Angeles CityBeat, arguing Maggiore's case and alleging incompetence, conspiracy, and coverups on the part of the coroner, the mainstream AIDS community, the mainstream media, and the medical community. In particular, Farber's article claimed that the coroner's office had not disclosed the records of Eliza Jane's HIV serology test, and quoted another denialist who claimed Eliza Jane's total lymphocyte count was elevated at the time of her death.Celia Farber, A Daughter's Death, A Mother's Survival, Los Angeles City Beat. Legal ramifications The death of Eliza Jane was investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Department of Child Protective Services as a possible case of medical neglect or child endangerment. On September 15, 2006 the LA County District Attorney's office announced that it would not file charges against Christine Maggiore, noting the difficulty in proving negligence given that Maggiore did take her sick child to several physicians. In September 2006, the Medical Board of California filed charges of gross negligence against one of these physicians, Paul Fleiss, who was Eliza Jane's pediatrician, alleging a failure to test Eliza Jane for HIV (or to document her parents' refusal of testing), a failure to counsel Maggiore to avoid breast-feeding at any time during the three years Maggiore breast-fed her daughter, given the risk of transmitting HIV, and similar violations of standard medical practice in Fleiss' care of a second HIV-positive child. In September 2007, the Medical Board of California issued its decision in the Fleiss case, effective October 8, 2007. The Board revoked Fleiss' medical license, but stayed this action in favor of a 35-month probation period during which Fleiss must submit to regular monitoring, pay costs, notify insurance and hospitals of the decision against him, and take continuing medical education (CME) classes and record-keeping courses. He is not permitted to supervise Physician Assistants and has affirmed the practice of referring HIV-positive patients to a specialist. In an admonition letter dated September 13, 2007, an Inquiry Panel of the Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners issued its finding that Philip Incao's \\"care and treatment and lack of timely documentation\\" in the case of Eliza Jane Scovill \\"falls below the generally accepted standards of medical practice\\". The Panel warned Incao that any further instances of such behavior could result in \\"formal disciplinary proceedings against your license to practice medicine\\".State of Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners letter to Dr. Philip F. Incao, M.D. Accessed 04 May 2008. Maggiore and her husband, Robin Scovill, sued Los Angeles county in 2007 for allegedly violating their daughter's civil rights and privacy by releasing her autopsy report, which indicated that she was HIV- positive. A $15,000 settlement was reached in 2009. References External links *A Mother's Denial, A Daughter's Death: from the Los Angeles Times. *Did HIV-Positive Mom's Beliefs Put Her Children at Risk?

Background O'Brien was the son of Sir Edward O'Brien, 2nd Baronet and his wife Mary Hickman, inheriting the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1765. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and entered the Middle Temple in 1753, later becoming a barrister. Career In 1761, he entered the Irish House of Commons as the member for Ennis, sitting until 1768. Subsequently O'Brien successfully ran for Clare, a seat previously held by his father, holding it until 1776. He was then again elected for Ennis, but following the unseating of Hugh Dillon Massy as Member of Parliament for Clare, O'Brien returned to represent that constituency in 1778. In the election of 1783, he became the representative for Tuam. O'Brien was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1786. He served for the latter constituency until 1790, when he was re-elected for Ennis. He held this seat finally until his death in 1795. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1773. In 1787 he was appointed a Privy Counsellor and from 1788 to 1795 was Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper in the Irish Chancery. Family O'Brien married Anne French, the daughter of Robert French, in 1768 and had by her seven children, three sons and four daughters. He was succeeded in the baronetcy as well as in the constituency of Ennis by his oldest son Edward. His grandson James FitzGerald (1818–1896) was a prominent politician in New Zealand.

The company was acquired by HelpSystems in June 2016. Mid-sized companies, large enterprises and government entities use Linoma's (now HelpSystems's) solutions to protect sensitive data and comply with data security regulations such as PCI DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, SOX, GLBA and state privacy laws. Linoma's solutions run on a variety of platforms including Windows, Linux, UNIX, IBM i (iSeries), AIX, Solaris, HP-UX and Mac OS X. History Linoma Group, Inc. (the parent company of Linoma Software) was founded in 1994. The company was started in Lincoln, Nebraska by Robert and Christina Luebbe. Throughout most of the 1990s, the Linoma Group performed consulting and contract programming services for organizations in the Nebraska/Iowa area. Linoma Software was formed in 1998 to address the needs of the IBM AS/400 platform (now known as IBM i) by developing productivity tools to help IT departments and end users. These tools were sold throughout the world and helped Linoma establish itself as an innovative software company. In 2002, Linoma released Transfer Anywhere, which was a solution for automating and managing file transfers from the AS/400. Over the next 2–3 years, Linoma added encryption capabilities to Transfer Anywhere including support for Open PGP encryption, SFTP and FTPS. These encryption capabilities helped organizations protect sensitive data transmissions such as ACH Network payments, direct deposits, financial data, credit card authorizations, personally identifiable information (PII) and other confidential data. Linoma expanded into other platforms when it completely redesigned Transfer Anywhere into an open OS solution with a graphical browser-based interface, renaming it GoAnywhere Director. Released in early 2008, GoAnywhere Director included comprehensive security controls, key management, trading partner wizards and detailed audit trails for compliance requirements. In 2009, Linoma released GoAnywhere Services as a collection of secure file services including an FTP Server, FTPS Server, SFTP Server and HTTPS server. GoAnywhere Director and Services were merged in 2015 to become GoAnywhere MFT. GoAnywhere MFT merged the workflow automation capabilities (adapted from GoAnywhere Director) with secure FTP server and collaboration features (adapted from GoAnywhere Services). This provides a unified browser-based interface, centralized logging and reporting. GoAnywhere MFT is in the Managed File Transfer software category of products, but can also be used for ETL functions. GoAnywhere Gateway was released in 2010 as an enhanced reverse proxy to protect the DMZ and help organizations meet strict compliance requirements. GoAnywhere Gateway was enhanced in 2011 to provide forward proxy functions. Linoma Software also performs encryption of data at rest on the IBM i (iSeries) platform with its Crypto Complete product. This product also includes key management, security controls and audit trails for PCI compliance. In June 2016, Minneapolis, Minnesota-based HelpSystems acquired Linoma Software. In March 2019, GoAnywhere MFT, in combination with Clearswift’s ICAP and adaptive redaction product, was named a Security Solution of the Year finalist for the European IT & Software Excellence Awards 2019.

It provides a single point of control with security settings, detailed audit trails and reports. Data transfers are secured using protocols for FTP servers (FTPS, SFTP, and SCP) and Web servers (HTTPS and AS2). It supports popular encryption protocols and offers a NIST- certified FIPS 140-2 Validated Encryption module. GoAnywhere MFT's interface and workflow features help to eliminate the need for custom programs/scripts, single-function tools and manual processes that were traditionally needed. This improves the quality of file transfers and helps organizations to comply with data security policies and regulations. With integrated support for clustering, GoAnywhere MFT can process high volumes of file transfers for enterprises by load balancing processes across multiple systems. The clustering technology in GoAnywhere MFT also provides active-active automatic failover for disaster recovery. A secure email module is also available that allows users to send messages and files as secure packages. Recipients receive an email with a unique link to each package that allows them to view or download the files via a secure HTTPS connection. There is no limit on file size or type, and each package can be subject to password protection as well as other security features. GoAnywhere agents are lightweight applications that automate file transfers and workflows on remote and on-premises systems throughout the enterprise. Agents are managed by a central deployment of GoAnywhere MFT, allowing users to configure and schedule agent file transfers and business processes from the browser-based interface. For integration with cloud and web applications, GoAnywhere offers Cloud Connectors, built-in integrations that help users automatically move data to and from applications like SharePoint or Salesforce. A designer interface in the software also makes it possible for users to build custom connectors. GoDrive by GoAnywhere  GoDrive is an on-premise solution that provides Enterprise File Sync and Sharing (EFSS) services for employees and partners. GoDrive files and folders can be easily shared between users with advanced collaboration features including file revision tracking, commenting, trash bin, media viewing and synchronization with Windows and Mac devices. GoDrive is an alternative to cloud-based file sharing services. It provides on-site file storage with localized control, end-to-end encryption, and detailed audit trails. If an end-user device is lost or stolen, its GoDrive data can be deactivated and wiped remotely. GoAnywhere Gateway GoAnywhere Gateway provides an additional layer of network security by masquerading server identities when exchanging data with trading partners. The application does not store user credentials or data in the DMZ / local network. When using a reverse proxy, inbound ports do not need to be opened into the private network, which is essential for compliance with PCI DSS,PCI DSS 1.3 HIPAA, HITECH, SOX, GLBA and state privacy laws. The current version is 2.0.1. A reverse proxy is used by the application for the file-sharing services (for example, FTP/S, SFTP, HTTP/S servers) it front-ends in the DMZ. GoAnywhere Gateway's service broker binds file transfer requests to the appropriate service in the private network through a secure control channel. GoAnywhere Gateway makes connections to external systems on behalf of users and applications in the private network. Routing outbound requests through a centralized point helps manage file transfers through a firewall. This method keeps inbound ports closed. The forward proxy hides the identities and locations of internal systems for security purposes. GoAnywhere OpenPGP Studio GoAnywhere OpenPGP Studio is a free desktop tool that protects sensitive files using the OpenPGP encryption standard. Documents can be encrypted, decrypted, signed and verified from a PC or workstation using this tool. An integrated key manager allows users to create, import, export and manage OpenPGP keys needed to encrypt and decrypt files. GoAnywhere OpenPGP Studio will run on almost any operating system including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and UNIX. Crypto Complete Crypto Complete is a program for the IBM i that protects sensitive data using strong encryption, tokenization, integrated key management, and auditing. This software encrypts database fields, can automatically encrypt IFS files. The application also locatesFind Database Fields - IBM Systems Magazine sensitive information that should be encrypted using the FNDDBFLD utility, which is available at no cost to IBM i users.FNDDBFLD The current version is 3.3.0. The key management system is integrated within the Crypto Complete policy controls, encryption functions and auditing facilities. Along with the integrated security native to the IBM i, access to key maintenance/usage activities is controlled to help meet compliance requirements. The backup encryption component encrypts the data written to tape devices. Crypto Complete encrypts the backups of any user data in IBM i libraries, objects, and IFS files. The field encryption registry works with IBM's Field Procedures and remembers which fields in a database should be encrypted. This process can be automated whenever any data is added to the field. When the data is decrypted, the returned values are masked or displayed based on the authority of the user. Tokenization is the process of replacing sensitive data with unique identification numbers (tokens) and storing the original data on a central server (typically in encrypted form). Tokenization can help thwart hackers and minimize the scope of compliance audits when it is stored in a single central location. Tokenization is used to protect sensitive data like credit card personal account numbers (PAN), bank account numbers, social security numbers, driver's license numbers and other personally identifiable information (PII).

Ibars was the great-niece of Francisco Palau and a friend and confidante of Saturnino López Novoa. Her dedication to the old and ill was noted and also the work of her sisters in Spain and later abroad. Her beatification was celebrated under Pope Pius XII on 27 April 1958 in Saint Peter's Basilica while Pope Paul VI later canonized her as a saint in 1974. Life Teresa Jornet Ibars was born on 9 January 1843 in a small town in Lleida to the farmers Francisco José Jornet and Antonieta Ibars. One sister was María and another was Josefa who became a Vincentian religious in Havana. Her brother Juan married and had three daughters who later joined her congregation. Her great-uncle was Blessed Francisco Palau – the brother of her maternal grandmother. She was baptized on 10 January 1843 and received her Confirmation in 1849. In her childhood she demonstrated a strong concern for the plight of the poor in her area and she often took them to the home of her maternal aunt Rosa so that proper aid could be provided to them. She later moved elsewhere in Lleida to live with another aunt of hers and soon after, at the age of nineteen, began teaching Argençola. As she felt called to the monastic life, Ibars applied for admission to the Poor Clares near Burgos in 1868 but the anti-clerical laws at the time prevented her from embracing the religious life, and so in 1870, she became a member of the Secular Carmelites. The death of her father and a severe illness she contracted later confined her to her home for a prolonged period of time. Father Pedro Llacera introduced her to Saturnino López i Novoa, who became her spiritual director. He encouraged her to aid the old of the region who needed proper attention. On 11 October 1872 she and her sister, Maria, moved to Barbastro with their friend Mercedes Calzada i Senan, and opened the first house. Ibars founded a religious congregation, taking the religious name \\"Teresa of Jesus\\" in honor of Teresa of Ávila. She was vested in the habit on 27 January 1873, and appointed the congregation's first superior. The motherhouse opened in Valencia on 8 May 1873. She was confirmed as the superior in 1875 and went on to make her perpetual profession on 8 December 1877; in 1887 she was appointed as the superior general for the entire order. On 14 June 1876 the papal decree of praise for the order came from Pope Pius IX while Pope Leo XIII issued formal approval to the order on 24 August 1887. The general chapter for the order opened at Valencia on 23 April 1896 and she was re-elected as superior general despite begging the sisters not to elect her once more. Cholera broke out in 1897 across the nation and she tended to the victims before the exhausted Ibars retired to the order's house at Liria where she remained for the next few months. She met Novoa for the final time on 15 July 1897. Ibars died due to tuberculosis on 26 August 1897 in Liria and her remains were housed in Liria until their transferral on 1 June 1904 to Valencia; on 25 August 1913 the remains were reinterred in the same location. As of 2019, there were more than 2,000 religious in a total of 204 houses throughout 21 countries in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. Canonization The beatification process opened in Valencia on 23 April 1945 and concluded on 7 March 1946 at which point theologians collated all of Ibar's writings and approved them as being in line with official doctrine in a decree issued on 4 April 1948; the informative process later received the validation from the Congregation of Rites on 25 June 1954. The formal introduction to the cause came on 27 June 1952 and Ibars was titled as a Servant of God. On 22 January 1957, Pope Pius XII named her Venerable upon the confirmation that Ibars led a life of heroic virtue. Pius XII beatified Ibars in Saint Peter's Basilica on 27 April 1958 upon the acknowledgement of two miracles attributed to her intercession while the confirmation of another two in 1973 allowed for Pope Paul VI to canonize her as a saint on 27 January 1974.

Currently, it has a length of . The highest point of the tunnel, which is also the highest point in all of the railway line, is at above sea level. The tunnel's north entrance is at Böckstein in the valley of Bad Gastein in the state of Salzburg, the south entrance near Mallnitz in Carinthia. Construction South portal, about 1911 Plans for constructing an interconnection railway line between the terminus of the Austrian Western Railway at the city of Salzburg and Villach leading to the Southern Railway already existed in the 1880s. This line would be especially important for the transportation of goods between the industrialised north of Austria-Hungary and Trieste, then the monarchy's main port on the Adriatic Sea. It was only after the Austrians had watched their neighbours, the Swiss, obtain a remarkable achievement, as they managed to finish their Gotthard Tunnel, as early as 1881. Planning for the Tauern railway line and tunnel started in the early 1890s. Tunnelling began in July 1901 from the north side, work on the south side started in October of that same year. The work was supervised by Civil Engineer Karl Wurmb (1850-1907), whilst most of the backbreaking labour was performed by an Italian workforce. Despite many difficulties, construction was finished in 1906. The official opening took place on 5 July 1909 in presence of Emperor Francis Joseph, along with the rest of the Tauern Railway line. Although many other parts of the line were single track, the tunnel was equipped with two tracks from the beginning. Old and new north portal Between 1925 and 1935, the tunnel was electrified, along with the rest of the line. With steam locomotives having been replaced by electric ones, the air intakes, formerly needed to supply the tunnel with extra fresh air, were no longer necessary. Between 2000 and 2004, the tunnel underwent extensive renovation works. During the works, the northern tunnel entrance was altered. There used to be a rather notorious curve near this entrance, in which many trains used to derail. The first part of the tunnel, which was not very deep underground, was dug open, moving the tunnel entrance 179 metres back, shortening the tunnel's length from 8,550 to 8,371 metres.ÖBB Infrastruktur Betrieb: Eisenbahnatlas Österreich. Verlag Schweers \\\\+ Wall, Cologne 2005, . The old tunnel entrance remained in its original place, now serving as a memorial arch. Also during the renovation, all the rails and power lines were replaced, damaged sections of the tunnel wall were repaired, and fire detection systems were installed.  Autoschleuse  Autoschleuse train in Mallnitz Ever since the First World War, motor vehicles are being transported by train from one side to the other. The Autoschleuse or Tauernschleuse, known in English as Tauern Motorail consists of a specially adapted car shuttle train, with the possibility to load and unload many cars in a short amount of time. Since the safety rules were sharpened, the train also consists of several passenger carriages and passengers travel within them.Institut für Österreichkunde (Hrsg.): Österreich in Geschichte und Literatur. ÖGL. Mit Geographie. Band 41. Braumüller, Vienna 1997, Permalink Österreichischer Bibliothekenverbund, p. 180. Safety issues After a large number of serious accidents, in Austria (Tauern Road Tunnel, 29 May 1999) as well as in other countries, (Mont Blanc Tunnel, 24 March 1999, Gotthard Tunnel, 24 October 2001), the Austrian government expressed its concerns about the safety in tunnels, not only in road tunnels, but also in railway tunnels, considering the large amounts of dangerous goods being transported through them. With the scheduled renovation came the installation of extensive systems for fire detection, emergency report systems and escape route indications. The car transport system was also adapted to new safety regulations. Formerly, passengers using the Autoschleuse were allowed to stay in their cars during the 11-minute journey. Nowadays, all passengers have to get into a passenger carriage directly behind the locomotive. Special fire extinguishing trains are located at both ends of the tunnel. History 1947 Train Bombing On August 12, 1947, a bomb exploded under a British military train carrying 175 people from London to Villach. The bomb exploded under the baggage compartment and injured one soldier. A second bomb failed to explode, they were intended to derail the train over a steep cliff.

High School. C.A. McMillen High School, commonly known as McMillen High School, McMillen, or MHS, is a secondary school serving grades nine and ten, located in the East Cluster of the Plano Independent School District. Murphy Middle School and Armstrong Middle School feed into McMillen. Students graduating from McMillen will attend Plano East Senior High School for the eleventh and twelfth grades. In 2015, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency. McMillen Lions  History  C.A. McMillen High School is named in honor of Comfort Allen McMillen, a farmer who owned large tracts of land in what is now the city of Murphy, Texas and founder of the Corinth Presbyterian Church. McMillen High School's inaugural year was 2011-2012, with doors opening in August 2011. It is Plano Independent School District's sixth (and last) 9-10 high school and was built to relieve overcrowding at nearby T. H. Williams High School. The first principal, George King, helped to plan and oversee the design and construction of the campus.  Design and construction  The 282,000 square-foot two-story high school was designed by the SHW architectural firm, and the construction of the school was given to the Cadence McShane Companies, who completed the project under-budget at $37,074,743. Situated on the same site as Murphy Middle School and Tom Kimbrough Stadium, McMillen High School was designed to complement the architectural style of the adjacent facilities. The high school's exterior façade is composed of structural steel, masonry, and cast stone. McMillen has a total of 67 classrooms, 10 science laboratories, band and music spaces, library, competition and practice gymnasiums, an auditorium, and a full- service cafeteria and kitchen. The campus also has several athletic venues, such as a practice softball and baseball field, batting cages, a running track, and practice football fields. McMillen athletes compete at the adjacent Tom Kimbrough Stadium in sports such as football and track. The school also has a parking lot with 224 parking spaces.http://cadencemcshane.com/properties/mcmillen-high-school/ Because McMillen was built in 2011, the campus features many unique design and architectural aspects that are not found at any other school in the district. SHW Group designed the 278,800 SF building to include a series of both formal and informal learning spaces. Each education wing is intended to promote collaboration between students and teachers in both the \\"pod\\" (an innovative learning and gathering area featuring whiteboards, study tables, and chairs) and the classrooms surrounding it. The pods were designed to provide flexibility and additional space for instruction, discussion, and project work. The campus also features comfortable seating areas and café tables for the students. Instead of having dry erase boards, each classroom at McMillen has one wall coated in IdeaPaint, which allows the whole wall, from floor to ceiling, to be written on. The \\"board\\" also doubles as a projection screen and allows teachers and students to write on the images shown on the wall. http://starlocalmedia.com/planocourier/news/new-technology-abounds-at- mcmillen-high/article_ab096d9c-4654-59aa-bf89-e2c772b03df6.html One of the campus's learning centers. The main hallway of McMillen. The library.  Principals  Brian Lyons is the current head principal, being so since the start of the 2013-2014 school year. He replaced George King, who is now the current head principal of Plano East Senior High School. Current assistant principals are Eric Lockett, Tracie Langford, and Brittany Drake. Students The current enrollment at McMillen is about 1,220.http://www.pisd.edu/schools/secondary/mcmillen/index.shtml In the 2015-2016 school year, McMillen High School, along with two other Plano ISD 9-10 campuses (Jasper High School and Shepton High School), piloted a block lunch program, in which all students are on lunch at the same time during the day. \\"Lions Lunch\\" at McMillen is 72 minutes long and was designed as an opportunity for failing students to attend tutorials. In Spring 2016, McMillen instituted mandatory academic tutorials during the first half of \\"Lions Lunch\\" for students failing 2 or more classes. A small handful of middle school students (often from adjacent Murphy Middle School) take 7th period mathematics courses at McMillen that are not offered at their middle school. These courses include Geometry and Algebra 2. Exceptional mathematics students also have the option of sitting in on one of McMillen's Pre-Calculus classes. School hours are 9:00 AM–4:15 PM, with doors opening at 8:00 AM in the morning and the building usually remaining open until about 5:30 PM for after school activities. McMillen High School is a closed campus, meaning that all students must remain inside the building during school hours. Academics Like most other Plano ISD 9-10 high schools, McMillen offers 3 AP (Advanced Placement) classes; AP Human Geography, AP World History, and AP European History (elective). Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, McMillen will offer AP Computer Science Principles as a new course open to both freshmen and sophomores as an elective credit. AP students at McMillen can choose to take the AP exam for their corresponding classes, offered each May by the College Board. Students earning a 3, 4, or 5 on the AP exam may be eligible for college credit. Like the other five Plano Independent School District 9-10 high schools, McMillen offers a Humanities class for gifted-and-talented (GT) students as a continuation from the elementary school and middle school PACE (Plano Academic Creative Education) program. Humanities is a one-period class that students take for two years. Though both 9th and 10th grade students are sitting in the same classroom and learning the same content, 9th grade students earn a Pre-AP English I credit (4.5 GPA) and 10th grade students earn an AP World History credit (5.0 GPA). The Humanities course curriculum follows the AP World History course but is split between two years (Humanities I and Humanities II). In addition to the AP courses McMillen High School offers, the campus also has a range of On-Level and Pre-AP (Honors) courses for students to choose from, as well as various electives such as Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), Peer Assistance and Leadership (PALs), fine arts, art, engineering, and computer technology. McMillen students can choose from a variety of foreign language classes, including Spanish, French, German, Latin (available online), Chinese, and American Sign Language. Extracurricular activities McMillen offers band, choir, orchestra, theater, PALS, athletics, Student Senate, HOSA Future Health Professionals, National Honor Society (NHS), Library Teen Advisory Board, Drill Team, and Marching Band (named the Golden Roar Marching Band). Other organizations have been founded by McMillen students in recent years, including COBALT (Corporation of Business and Law Technology), Mock Trial and McMillen UNICEF. Athletics The school colors are navy blue and gold, and the school mascot is the Lion. The McMillen Lions compete in the following sports: * Baseball * Basketball * Drill Team (the McMillen Dazzlers) * Football * Soccer * Tennis * Volleyball * Wrestling Athletes in select sports, such as swimming, must travel to Plano East Senior High School to compete. Students with stellar athletic ability may choose to compete with the Plano East athletic teams instead of with the McMillen athletic teams. The 2015-2016 McMillen marching band practices its marching routine in the summer months. Music programs McMillen offers Band, Orchestra and Choir classes. Their marching shows over the past years were Pirates of the Caribbean (2012), Arabian Nights (2013), Frozen (2014), Holst's The Planets (2015), New World Symphony (2016), Time (2017), and Blend (2018) The bands, orchestras, and choirs perform in University Interscholastic League (UIL) festivals, as well as local music contests, such as the Choice Music Events. McMillen also hosts the Plano Independent School District East Cluster Solo & Ensemble Festival each spring for orchestra students.

Tantric Buddhism was practiced at this site. Together with the Ratnagiri and Udayagiri sites not far away, Lalitagiri is part of the \\"Diamond Triangle\\". It used to be thought that one or all of these were the large Pushpagiri Vihara known from ancient records, but this has now convincingly located at a different site. Location Full view of the chaityagriha stupa complex in Lalitgiri Lalitagiri is a major center of Buddhism hemmed between the Parabhadi and Landa sandstone hills in the standalone Assian hill range. It is situated in the Mahanga Tahsil in Cuttack district. Bhubaneswar, the state capital of Odisha, is from the site, while Cuttack, the former state capital is away; Udaigiri is from Lalitagiri and Ratnagiri is away. Cuttack is well connected by road, rail and air services with the rest of the country. History Lalitgiri Ruins The first identification of archaeological antiquities from the Diamond Triangle sites was conducted in 1905 by M.M. Chakravarty, the then Sub Divisional Officer in Jajpur. Later, in 1927 and 1928, R.P. Chanda of the Indian Museum in Kolkata documented the site in the Memoirs of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). In 1937, the site was officially declared a protected monument by the central government. In 1977, some excavations were done at the site by the Utkal University. Detailed excavations by the Bhubaneswar Circle of the Archaeological Survey of India were conducted between 1985 and 1991. From these investigations, it has been inferred that Lalitgiri, one of the earliest Buddhist sites in Orissa, maintained a continuous cultural sequence starting from the post Mauryan period (322–185 BC) till 13th century AD. It is also inferred that this site maintained a continuous of presence of Buddhism, unbroken, from 3rd century BC to 10th century AD. In 1985, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) started excavation at Lalitgiri to locate Pushpagiri, an important Buddhist site mentioned in the writings of the Chinese traveler Xuanzang. The excavation led to several important archaeological discoveries, but none of these confirmed the identification of Lalitgiri with Pushpagiri. Later, excavations at Langudi Hill suggested that Pushpagiri was located there. Archaeological finds Lalitgiri Mahastupa The excavations carried out by the ASI at Lalitgiri have unearthed remnants of a large stupa on the hill. Within the stupa, two rare stone caskets were found with relics of Buddha; this was the first such find in Eastern India. The stone caskets, like Chinese Puzzle boxes, made of Khondalite stone, revealed three other boxes within them, made of steatite, silver and gold respectively; the gold casket, which is the last one, contained a relic or dhatu in the form of a small piece of bone. Another interesting find is that of an east facing apsidal chaityagriha, built of bricks, in size with -thick walls. This edifice, the first such Buddhist structure found in Odisha, contains a circular stupa at its center. Also found were a series of Kushana Brahmi inscriptions made on shells with cuts on moonstone at the periphery of the edifice. Another find is a piece of a pillar railing with a lens-shaped decoration with the theme of a half lotus medallion. From these finds it is inferred that such structures belonged from the early Christian era to 6th–7th century period. Entrance to one of the monasteries Lalitgiri Central structure Also found were remnants of four monasteries. The first and the largest monastery, facing east, a two storied structure measuring , has at its center a square open space; it is dated to 10th–11th century AD. Adjoining the monastery at the rear end is a rainwater cistern built of bricks. The second monastery, in the northern extremity of the hill, is believed to have been built when Buddhism was losing its importance in Lalitgiri. The third monastery faces south-east and has dimensions of with a central open space of and represents the end stages of apsidal chaitya. The fourth monastery, , in size, has many large sized Buddha heads deified in the sanctum sanctorum. A terracotta monastic seal with the inscription \\"Sri Chandraditya Vihara Samagra Arya Vikshu Sanghasa\\" is dated to the 9th–10th century AD. The antiquities unearthed include a plethora of images of Buddha in different meditative forms from the Mahayana Buddhism period. The finds also include a gold pendant, silver jewellery, stone tablets with imprints of Ganesha and Mahisasurmardini, a seal matrix-cum-pendant, and a small image of Avalokiteśvara. Images of Tara in the form of Tara Kurukulla or Kurukulla Tara have been reported in Lalitgiri and also from Udayagiri and Ratnagiri, including an emanation form of Amitabha seated in a lalitasana posture. Images of Hariti have also been found in Lalitgiri and also in Udayagiri and Ratnagiri. These images portray the goddess in a seated position, breast feeding a child or with the child seated in its lap. Hariti was once a child abductor, but Buddha persuaded her to become the protector of children. Also found are potsherds with inscriptions dated from the post Mauryan period to 8th–9th century AD, which indicate that Buddhists belonging to the Hinayana and Mahayana sects lived here. The last period of occupation is identified as belonging to Vajrayana, the Tantric period of Buddhism during the reign of Bhaumakaras (9th–10th century AD). Museum Initially, a makeshift enclosure housed the sculptures unearthed from the site for display. Now the permanent museum established houses sculptures of Buddha from the Mahayana period. The huge stone statues, with inscriptions on some of them, are of Buddha, Boddhisattva, Tara, Jambhala and many others. The statues of Buddha, portrayed in a standing position and attired with a drape adorned from shoulder level to the knee, is reflective of the Gandhara and Mathura schools of sculpture. The relic caskets recovered from the stone stupa on the hill are also on display.

She was a principal dancer of The Royal Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Teatro alla Scala and K-Ballet. She is currently Director of Dance at English National Ballet School and Artistic Director of Viviana Durante Company, with which she occasionally performs. Early career Durante was born in Rome and started ballet there at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma aged six. Spotted by ballerina Galina Samsova, she joined the lower school of the Royal Ballet School at White Lodge in Richmond Park, London. A year later, she featured in a Thames Television documentary entitled I really want to dance. Shortly after graduating to the upper school, aged 17, she joined the Royal Ballet Company. Two years later, she attracted national attention when she took over as Odette/Odile in mid- performance, never having been taught the role. At 21, she became the company's youngest principal dancer, and a year later, in 1990, she became the youngest artist to receive the Evening Standard Ballet Award. Royal Ballet At the Royal Ballet, Durante danced all the main roles in ballets by Sir Kenneth MacMillan (Manon, Romeo and Juliet, Mayerling, Different Drummer, My Brother, My Sisters, Requiem, Elite Syncopations, Gloria, The Prince of the Pagodas and Anastasia, for which she was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award), Sir Frederick Ashton (Cinderella, La fille mal gardée, Rhapsody, Ondine, A Month in the Country, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Symphonic Variations, Les Patineurs, Birthday Offering, Scènes de ballet, Thaïs pas de deux) and from the classical repertory (Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, Giselle, The Sleeping Beauty, La Bayadere, Don Quixote, Les Biches, Raymonda, Diana and Actaeon, Sylvia pas de deux). She created roles in many new works including MacMillan's The Judas Tree and Winter Dreams (based on Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters); Wayne McGregor's Fleur de Peux; Ashley Page's Pursuit, Piano, Bloodlines, ...now languorous, now wild... and Cheating, Lying, Stealing; Will Tuckett's Present Histories; David Bintley's Tombeaux; and Amedeo Amodio's Cabiria. In 1992, Durante and her fellow principal Darcey Bussell were the joint subjects of a South Bank Show documentary Two Ballerinas at the Royal Ballet (UK: Two Royal Ballet Dancers), and the following year both were invited by the New York City Ballet for the Balanchine Celebration at the New York State Theater. In 1995, she appeared in the title role of a ninety-minute version of Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty, which was telecast on Great Performances by PBS during the Christmas season. In 1998, Durante made a return to the Rome stage as a guest artist in Prokovsky's production of the Tchaikovsky ballet, one of many international guest appearances. Durante appeared on the cover of Cosmopolitan and Harpers and Queen magazines and was profiled in many publications including Vogue,British Vogue, October 1991. Elle, and Hello. She modelled for photographic shoots for Karl Lagerfeld and Valentino and for catwalk shows by Maison Gattinoni, and featured in commercials for Toyota. In 1999, a disagreement between Durante and The Royal Ballet, reportedly following her request for a cast change after she was dropped by a partner, blew up into a national media storm. After what the media called a 'dazzling 12-year career' as one of British ballet's major stars, Durante left the company in 2001 to pursue a freelance career. Subsequent career Durante joined American Ballet Theatre as a principal dancer for the 1999 spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York City. She subsequently appeared as a guest artist with major international ballet companies including La Scala Milan, Tokyo Ballet and Dresden Semperoper Ballett. From 2003 to 2012, she was the leading ballerina of Japan's K-Ballet, founded by fellow Royal Ballet alumnus Tetsuya Kumakawa. Continuing to perform the classics, she also took roles in ballets including Bintley's Cyrano de Bergerac; George Balanchine's Apollo, Ballet Imperial, Stravinsky Violin Concerto, Who Cares? and Symphony in C; Rudolf Nureyev's Laurentia; Tetley's La Ronde; Uwe Scholz's The Red and the Black; Roland Petit's Coppelia, Carmen and Duke Ellington Ballet; and André Prokovsky's Anna Karenina. Durante is a patron of The Hammond School and New English Ballet Theatre. She is a regular juror at competitions including the Prix de Lausanne and the Beijing International Ballet Competition. In 2010, a work choreographed by Durante premiered at Dance Base, Edinburgh, and the same year she collaborated with Richard Eyre on a dance adaptation of the film Truly, Madly, Deeply. Durante holds diplomas in dance education from the Royal Ballet School and Trinity College, London. In 2016, she returned to The Royal Ballet as a regular guest coach. In 2017, she founded Viviana Durante Company which debuted with Kenneth MacMillan: Steps Back in Time at the Barbican Centre. Durante was the consultant and wrote the foreword for the 2018 DK book Ballet: The Definitive Illustrated History. She was appointed Director of Dance at English National Ballet School in 2019. Critical reviews Critics noted Durante's combination of immaculate technique and acting ability, often describing her as a blend of Latin passion and British coolness. Her Anastasia was widely appreciated, her Manon (with Russian dancer Irek Mukhamedov as Des Grieux, in particular) has been called the definitive interpretation, and the recording of her performance in The Sleeping Beauty has been perhaps most influential. Critics called her 'the most dramatic of dancers', and an 'unsurpassable actress' (The Independent). Personal life Durante married the British author and journalist Nigel Cliff in June 2009. They have a son, and live in London.

It is composed of major stupas and monasteries (viharas). Together with the nearby complexes of Lalitgiri and Ratnagiri, it is part of the \\"Diamond Triangle\\" of the \\"Ratnagiri-Udayagiri-Lalitgiri\\" complex. It used to be thought that one or all of these were the Pushpagiri Vihara known from ancient records, but this has now convincingly located at a different site. Per epigraphical artifacts found at the site, Udayagiri's historical name was \\"Madhavapura Mahavihara.\\" This Buddhist complex, preceded by the Ratnagiri and Lalitgiri sites, with their monasteries, is believed to have been active between the 7th and the 12th centuries. Location Udayagiri is situated in the foothills, to the north-east from Bhubaneswar, and north-east of Cuttack in Jajpur district. As the crow flies, Ratnagiri and Udaygiri are about 11 km apart, and both about 7 km from Lalitgiri. The site now recognised as Puspagiri is some 18 km distant from Udaygiri, the closest to it of the \\"triangle\\" sites. Findings Numerous excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have been conducted at Udayagiri since 1958. The Udayagiri Site 1, the first site to be excavated, is in a depression between two valleys. In the excavations done during the period between 1985–86 and 1989–90, at the Udayagiri Site 2, the antiquities exposed consisted of a Buddhist Monastic complex enclosed within a compound wall, including a stupa of height with four images of dhyani Buddhas fixed at its four cardinal points. On the basis of the epigraphical evidence archaeologist have inferred that this site is \\"Madhavapura Mahavihara\\". During the large excavation from 1997 to 2000, a second part of Udayagiri-2 was discovered with additional stupas and monasteries. These antiquities consist of two eighth century monastic complexes, statues of Buddha, Tara, Manjusri, Avalokiteśvara, Jatamukuta Lokesvara and many terracotta (earthenware) seals. A stepped stone well with epigraphic inscriptions has also been discovered. Also seen near one of the entry gates at the site is a human figure swinging on a rope, with eyes closed, in a state of perfect happiness. During the recent investigations conducted between 2001 and 2004 the antiquities unearthed included a stone finish flooring in the foreground of the excavated monastery, the main drain of the monastery flowing out to the north, a large stone raised platform in size built in seven layers with ashlar masonry accessed through a series of steps, and marked in its northern end by a chandrashila (moon rock). Also found were apsidal chaitya-grihas (an old one replaced by another built in brick) facing east with a stupa diefied in it, built with stone and bricks, founded on the raised platform, and remnants of stone jali embellished with the theme of a three-hooked snake inferred as gavakshas (horse-shoe arches). Buddha, flanked by Manjusri (left), holding an upraised sword (his attribute) and a chauri, partially broken off. To the right is Avalokiteshvara, holding a lotus and chauri. Images of Tara in the form of Tara Kurukulla or Kurukulla Tara have been reported from Udayagiri and also from Lalitgiri and Ratnagiri; these are an emanation form of Amitābha seated in a lalitasana posture. Images of Hariti have been found in Udayagiri and also in Lalitgiri and Ratnagiri. This image portrays the goodess in a seated position breast feeding a child or with the child seated on its lap. Hariti was once a child abductor, but Buddha persuaded her to become the protector of children. Also seen in the western, southern and northern parts of the chaitya-griha are remnants of a number of stupas in three groups, built in stone with only their plain plinths seen in a preserved state. An important discovery in the precincts of the chaitya-griha, is of statues of Avalokiteswara, Tathāgata, Bhikruti-Tara and Chunda embedded in niches, marking the four cardinal points. Other findings are of 14 stupas (built in brick with mud mortar) dated between the 1st and 12th centuries, and also many 5th- to 13th-century epigraphs. Votive stupas, made of stone, are also seen along a stone paved path. At the eastern part of the chaitya-griha are residential houses consisting of six rooms with artifacts of domestic goods. Though located only away from Ratnagiri, the site has not revealed any artifacts which could provide a link to the Vajrayana tantric cult found at Ratnagiri.

An incident of footballing insubordination at a time when strike action and other forms of civil resistance were intensifying in communist Poland, it caused a domestic press storm, which led first to the suspension of several prominent players, then the resignation of the team manager, Ryszard Kulesza. Józef Młynarczyk, the team's goalkeeper, was hungover when the time came to leave the hotel for the airport, having not been to sleep following a night on the town with a friend. Kulesza and one of his assistants, Bernard Blaut, decided to leave Młynarczyk behind, much to the indignation of some players, including Stanisław Terlecki, Zbigniew Boniek, Włodzimierz Smolarek and Władysław Żmuda. Terlecki, a stridently pro-Western intellectual with a reputation for mocking the communist establishment, was particularly angered, and himself drove Młynarczyk to the airport, where the players continued their protests. Kulesza eventually relented and allowed Młynarczyk to travel with the team. The Polish media took hold of the story and vociferously attacked the rebellious players over the following days. Meanwhile, Terlecki again defied the communist authorities by arranging for the players to meet Pope John Paul II. The Polish Football Association sent Terlecki, Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda home and imposed various bans preventing them from playing at the international and club level over the next year. Terlecki and Boniek in particular were condemned by the association as insubordinate \\"rabble-rousers\\". Smolarek received a more modest, suspended ban. Kulesza resigned in protest at the sanctions imposed on the players, saying they were too harsh. Most of the banned players were reinstated during 1981, but Terlecki was not—he emigrated to the United States in June that year and although he returned home five years later, he never played for Poland again. Background Poland football players at the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany|alt=Football players in white shirts and dark shorts celebrate together In June 1976, a series of protests took place across communist Poland soon after the government announced plans to increase sharply the fixed prices charged nationwide for many basic commodities. Violent incidents occurred in Płock, Radom and Ursus as the protests were forcibly put down, and the planned price hikes were cancelled. These demonstrations and the events surrounding them brought the Polish workforce and intellectual political opposition together, and by 1980, a campaign of civil resistance for political change was intensifying strongly. Industrial strike action in Lublin in July 1980—the so-called Lublin July—preceded the formation of Solidarity (Solidarność) in the port city of Gdańsk during the following months. This was the first non-communist trade union in an Eastern bloc country. The government took several steps to obstruct Solidarity's emergence, enforcing press censorship and cutting off telephone connections between the coast and the hinterland, but despite these efforts four out of every five Polish workers were members of the union by late 1980. Poland's national football team, managed by Ryszard Kulesza, was then regarded as one of the world's best, having finished third at the 1974 World Cup. In November 1980 it was ranked sixth in the world by the Elo rating system. Late that month, the team was preparing for a 1982 World Cup qualifying match away against Malta on 7 December. The squad's departure was scheduled for 29 November, 10 days before the game, so the players could attend a training camp in Italy, then contest a warm-up match against a team representing the Italian league. One of Poland's key players at the time was Stanisław Terlecki, a forward whose club was ŁKS Łódź. The son of university lecturers, Terlecki held a degree in history from the University of Łódź, as well as fervent anti-communist political views and a strident attitude regarding their display. He was known for openly mocking the establishment with subversive abandon, and regularly made jokes in public about communist authority figures and organisations, prompting the ire of the Polish Football Association (PZPN) and the Warsaw police force. The first Polish international player with a university degree in anything other than physical education, he eschewed the Polish sports magazines read by many of his teammates on road trips in favour of Western news journals such as Newsweek and Time. Like many Polish intellectuals, he sympathised with movements such as Solidarity; following their example, he twice attempted to unionise Polish footballers during the late 1970s. The PZPN blocked both attempts, banning Terlecki from all organised football each time; first for six months, then for a year. Incident Main incident alt=A moustachioed gentleman with a suit and tie Late on 28 November 1980, the night before the team's departure for Italy, goalkeeper Józef Młynarczyk and forward Włodzimierz Smolarek, both of Widzew Łódź, left the team hotel in Warsaw, the Hotel Vera, without permission. According to Smolarek they did this to get some dinner because they did not like the food at the hotel. They met a friend of Młynarczyk's, sports journalist Wojciech Zieliński, at the Adria nightclub. According to Andrzej Iwan, another member of the team, the main topic of conversation was Zieliński's estranged wife, who had been caught prostituting herself around Warsaw, and had since moved to Italy. Several Poland players knew her, and Młynarczyk had just been to Italy to play for Widzew Łódź against Juventus. According to Iwan, the journalist encouraged Młynarczyk to drink as they talked, hoping the goalkeeper might have news of her. Smolarek left the club around 02:00, but Młynarczyk and Zieliński stayed until about three hours later. A senior national team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, said he saw the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined the rest of the players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind. Smolarek, Terlecki and two other Polish players—Zbigniew Boniek and Władysław Żmuda, both of Widzew Łódź—angrily objected and nearly came to blows with Blaut. Grzegorz Lato, one of the team's forwards, did not join the protest but later said that he had not thought Młynarczyk drunk enough to warrant exclusion. The team eventually left without Terlecki or Młynarczyk. Terlecki, whose own car was to hand, drove himself and Młynarczyk to the airport, where the confrontation continued. Terlecki tried to stop the many pressmen at the airport from photographing Młynarczyk by running around, yelling, and snatching cameras and microphones from their hands. Meanwhile, the other players attempted to talk Kulesza around, telling him that Młynarczyk had serious personal problems. Kulesza eventually relented and allowed the goalkeeper to travel with the team. Press storm; players meet the Pope alt=Pope John Paul II Among the journalists at the airport were Jacek Gucwa of Polish Television, Bogdan Chruścicki of Polish Radio, and Remigiusz Hetman of the weekly football journal Piłka Nożna. News about the incident quickly spread across the country, partly because of Terlecki's outlandish actions in the reporters' presence—Iwan later reflected that Terlecki had \\"made so much commotion it was impossible to sweep everything under the carpet\\". Boniek corroborates this version of events: \\"Terlecki was massively to blame. He brought Młynarczyk to the airport in his own car, then pulled the plug powering a TV camera out of the wall.\\" Grzegorz Majchrzak, a historian of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, questions Boniek's words, positing that he might have distorted events in an attempt to distance himself from Terlecki. The government attempted to use the scandal as a popular distraction, aiming to deflect attention from the strikes and other industrial action. A number of journalists attacked the players who had supported Młynarczyk; the Przegląd Sportowy sports magazine ran the headline \\"No Mercy for Those Guilty of the Scandal at the Airport\\" while Tempo, another journal, was similarly severe, proclaiming \\"This Cannot Be Tolerated\\". Piłka Nożna condemned the \\"magnificent men ... who think they can do what they want\\", but at the same time questioned the conduct of the team's non-playing staff. In the Italian capital, Terlecki continued to defy the establishment. The players were under strict instructions not to associate with the Vatican while in Rome, but Terlecki arranged for them to meet Pope John Paul II, who was himself Polish. Seeing this as a second act of defiance, the PZPN promptly sent Terlecki, Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda home, escorted by General Marian Ryba of the Polish Army, who was also the football association president. Lech Poznań's Piotr Mowlik replaced Młynarczyk for the match against Malta, which Poland won 2–0. Aftermath Hearings and suspensions alt=A smiling man in a suit and tie Ryba announced on 1 December 1980 that he intended to bar the dissenting players from the Poland squad. When the rest of the team returned to Poland, Terlecki once again attempted to form a footballers' union. Securing the support of 16 other Poland international players, he wrote a letter to the PZPN declaring their intention to do so, leading the authorities to order them to face a tribunal. Only Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk continued to endorse the letter when challenged in court. On 15 December, PZPN officials attempted to reconstruct the night's events, asking various players and staff to give accounts of what had happened. Several journalists were present. The stories told contradicted each other in several places, notably regarding how much Młynarczyk had had to drink. The team's technical staff said that he had been obviously intoxicated when they had seen him, while the goalkeeper insisted he had taken only \\"three glasses of champagne and a sip of beer\\" with his friend. Another point of contention regarded the conversation at the airport, which had caused Kulesza to yield. It was generally agreed that the players had talked the manager around by telling him that Młynarczyk had personal problems, but the non-playing staff now accused them of emotional blackmail. The players said their intention had been to explain the goalkeeper's off-field issues to help the manager make a more informed decision. Terlecki's answers at this meeting under the questioning of General Ryba, a former military prosecutor, were typically provocative; when the general asked what time Terlecki had left the hotel on 29 November, the ŁKS forward said 08:00. \\"Are you sure it was 08:00?\\" Ryba pressed—\\"Are you sure it wasn't 08:02?\\" The player replied that he wasn't: \\"No. Maybe it was even 08:03. I don't know this time exactly, because I have one of your Russian watches.\\" alt=A bespectacled, middle-aged man in a suit and tie A week later, the PZPN announced its final verdict. The only versions of events accepted for consideration were those recounted by Kulesza and Blaut; those of all the players and of the team physiotherapist and sport psychologist were dismissed. Żmuda and Młynarczyk were barred from playing for either Poland or their clubs for eight months, and Terlecki and Boniek for twelve. Smolarek received a two-month ban, which was suspended for six months. Citing their previous records of insubordination and misconduct, the PZPN called Terlecki and Boniek \\"rabble-rousers\\". Reactions Kulesza left his job soon afterwards; according to Majchrzak, he resigned in protest at the players' punishments, which he thought were too harsh. Officials at Widzew Łódź accused the PZPN of bias, saying the association had not supervised the players properly and should shoulder some of the blame. Directors at Widzew and ŁKS Łódź briefly considered resigning their PZPN memberships and organising their own league championship, but did not. The national team players' council, at that time comprising Marek Dziuba, Paweł Janas and Wojciech Rudy, wrote an open letter expressing surprise at what they saw as excessive sanctions against Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk. They admitted the goalkeeper's conduct had been far from exemplary, but contended that the incident was only minor, and had been exacerbated by disproportionately prominent and negative press coverage. Despite being without some of their top players, Widzew Łódź were crowned champions of Poland at the end of the 1980–81 season. Ryba left his post in April 1981, along with a number of his contemporaries, described by Stefan Szczepłek, a sports journalist and football historian, as \\"honest officials, together with some football-friendly Polish Army officers\\". In their place came a number of communist officials, most prominently Włodzimierz Reczek, an erstwhile Politburo member, who took over as head of the football association despite a reputation for not liking the sport. Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda had their bans cancelled early. Żmuda and Młynarczyk returned in the 1–0 home win over East Germany on 2 May 1981, and Boniek was reinstated four months later. The players' recall was partly due to the efforts of Kulesza's replacement, Antoni Piechniczek, to secure their return. According to Majchrzak, Boniek and Żmuda apologised for their actions before the General Committee for Physical Culture and Sport of the Polish People's Republic, the PZPN's governing body, but kept this from Terlecki, who appealed to have his ban lifted several times, but to no avail. Legacy Terlecki openly participated in students' strikes at his old university in Łódź and across Poland over the next few months, providing food to the students by the car-load. ŁKS cancelled his registration in early 1981. Majchrzak stresses that Terlecki was the only player involved in the incident not to regain his place in the Poland team, and claims that this was down to an intense grudge held against him by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Secret Police (SB). Terlecki developed his own theory that the media circus following the airport incident had been deliberately engineered by the SB to head the players off forming their own trade union. There were several other incidents of drunkenness involving Młynarczyk, Majchrzak writes, but this was the only occasion when any player was punished for it. In October 1981, when the team travelled to Argentina, Młynarczyk arrived at Okęcie \\"completely drunk\\", according to Iwan, but far from reprimanding him, team staff gave him even more alcohol during the flight to help ease the pain of his broken finger. Poland qualified for the 1982 World Cup with a perfect record, and performed strongly in the competition, losing to Italy in the semi-finals but beating France in a play-off to claim third place. Kulesza became the manager of Tunisia, and later founded a coaching school in Warsaw. Saying he was \\"being treated like a leper\\", Terlecki emigrated to the United States in June 1981, and joined the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League. He pursued a new life in America with great vigour. Terlecki's on-field displays in the U.S. were widely praised—in three seasons with Pittsburgh he became the club's all-time top goalscorer—but managers reportedly had trouble \\"harness[ing] Terlecki's fiery temper\\", and his wife Ewa became intensely homesick. Terlecki announced his intention to move back to Poland in 1985, saying that he believed the political situation had improved and that he wished to reunite his family. He returned home the following year,; and resumed his career in Polish club football. He expressed a desire to play for the national team again, but was never selected.

The Asian Liver Center (ALC) was founded in 1996 to spearhead educational outreach and advocacy efforts in the areas of hepatitis B and liver cancer prevention and treatment, serves as a resource for both the general public and health practitioners, and implements clinical and research programs. History The Asian Liver Center was founded in 1996 by Dr. Samuel So. Since its establishment in 1996, ALC has become a national and international leader in the fight against hepatitis B and liver cancer. It uses the help of a network of governmental and nongovernmental agencies, state and federal legislators, private corporations and foundations, and community partners. Outreach and education The key to winning the fight against hepatitis B and liver cancer is prevention, and prevention begins with outreach and education. The Asian Liver Center is dedicated to serving the Asian community through a variety of outreach and education programs. A HBV safe and effective vaccine is available, offering protection from the hepatitis B virus (HBV), but many API are not vaccinated because they are not aware of the problem and its prevalence in their community. ALC participates in community events throughout the Bay Area, providing screenings and low-cost vaccinations, hosting educational booths and games, speaking to health care providers and developing workshops to spread awareness about hepatitis B and liver cancer. The outreach section of the ALC website gives details of screenings, conferences, community events, advocacy efforts, partnerships, ongoing projects, and contests. The education section of the site includes information about hepatitis B, liver cancer, vaccination and blood tests as well as patient testimonials and resources for health care providers. Advocacy ALC supports the expansion of the Jade Ribbon Campaign. In California, the Asian Liver Center is working with Assemblywoman Fiona Ma to pass Assembly Bill 158, which will provide care for all uninsured and under- insured people who are chronically infected with hepatitis B, with no raise in taxes. Nationally, the Asian Liver Center worked with Congressman Mike Honda co-sponsored a bill early in 2006 to designate the first National Hepatitis B Awareness Week in May 2006. In April 2004, the Jade Ribbon Campaign was launched by the ALC in China in partnership with the China Foundation for Hepatitis Prevention and Control at the China National Hepatitis Conference. The Asian Liver Center advocates for laws that prevent hepatitis B discrimination, strategies to provide access to affordable screenings, vaccinations and treatment, and partnerships to unite against HBV and liver cancer. Research Research in liver cancer has generally received low priority for federal funding in this country, contributing to the lack of effective treatment for chronically infected individuals. The ALC research program is looking for novel approaches to increase the efficacy of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment through the development of a liver cancer research program with an emphasis on liver cancer genomics, biomarkers, molecular targets, and investigational anti-tumor agents. ALC is working on a perinatal hepatitis B prevention initiative to design and implement strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B in Alameda and Santa Clara counties, where the combined population of about 3.2 million experiences some of the highest rates of chronic HBV and liver cancer in the US. Jade Ribbon campaign The Jade Ribbon Campaign (JRC) was launched by the Asian Liver Center (ALC) at Stanford University in May 2001 during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month to help spread awareness internationally about hepatitis B (HBV) and liver cancer in Asian and Pacific Islander (API) communities.The Jade Ribbon Campaign. The objective of the Jade Ribbon Campaign is to eradicate HBV worldwide; and to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with liver cancer. Considered to be the essence of heaven and earth, Jade is believed in many Asian cultures to bring good luck and longevity while deflecting negativity. Folded like the Chinese character “人” (ren) meaning \\"person\\" or \\"people,\\" the Jade Ribbon symbolizes the spirit of the campaign in bringing the Asian and global community together to combat the epidemic. Since the campaign's founding, the Asian Liver Center (ALC) has been spearheading the Jade Ribbon Campaign through public service announcements in media such as newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, billboard, and buses targeting communities with large API populations. The ALC holds seminars for health professionals and the public, cultural fairs, conferences, and HBV screening/vaccination events.

Renard. A three-engined low-winged monoplane with retractable undercarriage, the R.35 was destroyed in a crash on its first flight. Development and design In 1935, Alfred Renard, chief designer and co-founder of the Renard company, started design of a pressurised airliner for use by SABENA on its routes to the Belgian Congo. Renard designed a low-winged monoplane of all-metal construction, powered by three engines as required by SABENA, and received an order for a single prototype on 3 April 1936.De Wulf 1978, pp. 147-148. The R.35 had a circular section fuselage, housing a pressurised cabin which accommodated twenty passengers and a flight crew of three. It was intended to be powered by a range of radial engines with the 950 hp (709 kW) Gnome-Rhône 14K preferred by Renard, but the prototype was fitted with 750 hp (560 kW) Gnome-Rhône 9K engines.De Wulf 1978, p.148. The R.35 was completed early in 1938. On 1 April 1938, it was planned to carry out high-speed taxiing trials at Evere airfield in front of an audience of visiting dignitaries and journalists. After carrying out a single taxi-run, however, the R.35 took off during a second run, and while attempting a circuit to return to the runway, the R.35 dived into the ground and was destroyed, killing the pilot Georges Van Damme.

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He played college football at Mississippi State. He was previously the head football coach at St. Lucie West Centennial High School in Port St. Lucie, Florida. Early years Chaney attended St. Lucie West Centennial High School, in Port St. Lucie, Florida, where he starred as a linebacker and defensive end on defense and tight end on offense. His senior season was cut short to just six games by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which both made direct hits near Port St. Lucie in September 2004. Chaney still managed to compile 65 tackles and 10 quarterback sacks and added eight pass receptions for 150 yards and three touchdowns at tight end. In his junior year, he tallied 120 tackles with six sacks, a school-record 22 tackles for loss and five caused fumbles. He set West Centennial's career record with 31 quarterback sacks. Considered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Chaney was listed as the No. 29 outside linebacker prospect in the nation. He originally committed to the University of Georgia, but was denied admission because the Georgia admissions department thought his 1260 SAT score was far higher than someone with a 2.9 GPA should achieve. He was released from his scholarship and chose Mississippi State over Florida, and among others. College career As a true freshman at Mississippi State, Chaney played in all 11 games, earned three starting calls at weakside linebacker, and totalled 31 tackles on the season. By his sophomore year, he ranked at the top of the depth chart at WLB and played in all 12 games. He finished the 2006 season with 66 total tackles, including seven and one-half for loss (minus 27 yards), two and one-half of which were quarterback sacks (minus 17 yards). For his junior campaign, Chaney was switched to the middle linebacker position, where he played all 13 games for the Bulldogs. He led the team with 89 total tackles, including three and one-half for loss (minus 5 yards). Chaney tied for 15th in the SEC in tackles per game (6.8) and earned Second Team All-SEC honors by the league’s coaches. In Mississippi State's 2008 season opener Chaney registered a team-best 12 tackles, his third career double-digit tackle performance, but suffered a leg injury on the next-to-last snap of the game. X-rays later confirmed a broken fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle, and he later received a medical redshirt for the season to regain his final season of eligibility. Rivals.com listed Chaney as the most underrated player in the Southeastern Conference in 2009. Chaney was invited to participate in the 2010 Senior Bowl on January 30, 2010. In the game, he made eight tackles and recovered a fumble, and was named the Defensive Player of the Game for the South team. Professional career Pre-draft Chaney worked out in Miami, Florida with trainer Pete Bommarito to improve his speed in the 40-yard dash; at the NFL Combine, he ran the distance in 4.54 seconds, the fastest among all linebackers. According to NFL draft analyst Chris Steuber, Chaney's experience playing outside earlier in his career could help him play on the strong side or as a 3-4 middle linebacker in the NFL. Philadelphia Eagles Chaney was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the seventh round (220th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft. He was signed to a four-year contract on June 4, 2010. After starting middle linebacker Stewart Bradley suffered a disclocated elbow in the second quarter of a week 14 game against the Dallas Cowboys on December 12, Chaney filled in for him and led the team with seven tackles. Chaney made his first NFL start against the New York Giants, and he recorded 16 tackles, 12 of them being solo tackles. After his start, NFL analyst Brian Baldinger said Chaney was, \\"already one of the best middle linebackers in the league\\", and that he's \\"phenomenal in all phases of the game\\". On August 25, 2013, Chaney was released by the Eagles. Atlanta Falcons He was signed on the Atlanta Falcons' roster on September 17, 2013, along with former Eagles teammate Omar Gaither. He was then released on October 22, 2013. Denver Broncos Chaney, along with seven other players, were signed to future contracts with the Denver Broncos on January 22, 2014. The Broncos released Chaney on August 24, 2014. Oakland Raiders Chaney was signed by the Oakland Raiders on October 8, 2014 after Nick Roach was put on injured reserve. Coaching career After retiring from the NFL, Chaney became the head coach of his alma mater, St. Lucie West Centennial High School, where he went 11-8-1 and coached the team to its first playoff appearance in seven years. Chaney left St. Lucie West in 2019 to become the Assistant Director of Player Personnel for High School Relations for the Mississippi State Bulldogs football team.

It is known mainly for its school and a former station on the Drammen Line. History, geography and transportation The name Ramstad is based on the men's given name Ravn, meaning raven. It is taken from the local farm, which dates from the Scandinavian Iron Age. As most farms in the region it belonged to the Church of Norway, but the crown usurped the property following the Protestant Reformation. The first private owner was Knud Frantzen in 1668, who at that time owned Nesøygodset. Various owners followed, and in 1772 the farm was parted in two; Upper and Lower Ramstad. The parts were reunited in 1903. Around the same time, the district was being built up with residences. The owner of Ramstad from 1895, Hans Kristoffer Ramstad, started this process by selling lots between the Drammen Line railway (opened 1872) and the road Drammensveien (now: the European route E18). The road was built in 1859, and cut across the large field named Ramstadsletta, located south of the farm. Today, Ramstadsletta is an area of commerce, and has a large market garden, a gas station and a Scandic Hotel, among other things. Buses traffic the European route E18. The district was also served by the railway station Ramstad on the Drammen Line, which existed between 1931 and 1978 (with no passenger traffic from 1973). The hill Ramstadåsen north of the farm was built up around 1900 as well. The former cotter's farms are Kokkerud and Nygård, north of the farm, were absorbed in this development. The district south of Ramstadsletta, near the Oslofjord, was sold in 1877 and built up with villas after 1890 under the name Solvik. Now, only the immediate surroundings of the farm Ramstad has been spared from residential and other building. Reportedly, Josef Terboven tried to confiscate a residence in Solvik in 1940, but gave up since the owner was German-born, and took residence at Skaugum instead. Before the major residential development, a creek ran southwards through the district. The creek was a part of the Bekkestua Watershed, which originated north of Ringstabekk and ran southwest via Bekkestua (giving this settlement its name), Gjønnesmyra and Ballerud. Parts of the former waterway around Bekkestua were used for Kolsås Line tracks. Near Nybråtan the creek turned more straight southwards. This section of the creek was named Ramstadbekken. At Ramstadsletta there was a confluence with a small creek that ran northwards. From Ramstadsletta it followed a path west and slightly south. A part of this path is identical to the current European route E18, but after passing what is today the market garden it turned more distinctly southwest before reaching its mouth in the Oslofjord at Solvik. Today, the entire Bekkestua Watershed has been led underground through a pipe system. Education and sports Ramstad is known to many due to its lower secondary school of the same name. It was erected between 1962 and August 1963, on the property Nybråtan south of Ramstadåsen. Before the school building was finished, pupils were tutored at the schools Gjettum and Blommenholm. Between 1964 and 1972 it was a combined lower and upper secondary school. By 2005 it had 520 pupils and a staff of 65. The school is noted for having an adjacent swimming pool, very uncommon in schools in the region. Ramstad Lower Secondary School serves the districts of Ramstad, Solvik, Høvik, Høvik Verk, Blommenholm, Løkeberg, parts of Haslum, Ekeberg, Gjønnes and Ballerud. The only local sports club is the gymnastics club Ramstad Turn, founded in 1965. Non-gymnasts tend to practice sports in the multi-sport clubs Høvik IF or Haslum IL.

She was awarded an MA from Oxford in 1981. From 1974 through 1981, she worked as a Beirut-based correspondent for news outlets including The Christian Science Monitor, The Sunday Times, ABC News, and the BBC. In 1982 she moved to the United States to take up a research fellowship at the Harvard University Center for International Affairs, where she wrote her first book, The Palestinian Liberation Organisation. It was published in English in 1984, was translated into Arabic and several other languages, and remains in print. Since then she has published six additional books: three others on questions of Middle East war and peace, and three on other international issues. Her seventh book, Re-engage! American and the World After Bush was published in 2008. Rep. Lee H.

In March 2010, she founded Just World Books. Over the eight years that followed, the company published 38 original titles on Middle Eastern and other international issues. In early 2018, the company entered a hiatus from issuing new titles though it keeps the existing titles in print and sells subsidiary rights for them. Cobban then spent more time running Just World Educational, which she served as Executive President. In Spring 2019, she resumed her writing career. She is a member of Charlottesville Friends Meeting in Charlottesville, Virginia. Cobban used to be a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and formerly sat on the Middle East Advisory Committee of Human Rights Watch. In 2007–08 she was a 'Friend in Washington' with the Friends Committee on National Legislation. She is married to William B. Quandt, who is the Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia. Contributions to Middle East studies Through her reporting and analytical work, Cobban has made notable contributions to the study of Palestinian politics, Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, Lebanese politics, Israeli-Syrian peacemaking, the US war in Iraq, and the broader study of the Middle East: Palestinian politics For her 1984 book The Palestinian Liberation Organisation: People, Power, and Politics she interviewed many founders and leaders of the PLO and used much original material gathered during her reporting work in Beirut in the late 1970s. In the book she concluded that the center of gravity of the Palestinian national movement was shifting toward those Palestinians living inside their homeland, a diagnosis that proved correct when the First Intifada broke out in 1987. The book was heavily criticised in a review that Daniel Pipes wrote for the Washington Post.Pipes, Daniel, The Palestinian Liberation Organisation: People, Power and Politics by Helena Cobban, and The PLO in Lebanon: Selected Documents, by Raphael Israeli, a reviewed in The Washington Post (25 March 1984), accessed 8 September 2009. Between 1984 and 2000 Cobban published numerous articles and book chapters on Palestinian political developments. Since 2001 she has published several lengthy essays on the topic in Boston Review, including two essays on HamasCobban, Helena, \\"Hamas's Next Steps,\\" Boston Review, accessed 27 August 2009. Originally published in the May/June 2006 edition of BRCobban, Helena, \\"Breakout: Hamas and the end of the two- state solution,\\" Boston Review, accessed 27 August 2009. Originally published in the May/June 2008 edition of BR that drew on original interview material with Hamas leaders, including Khaled Meshaal and Ismail Haniyeh. In June 2009 she conducted another interview with Meshaal, in which he said, \\"I have said I accept a Palestinian state if Israel withdraws to the pre-1967 line. That doesn't annul the historical fact of the Israeli occupation of 1948, but Hamas and the other factions have all accepted this solution of a Palestinian state at the 1967 line.\\"Cobban, Helena, \\"Hamas Leader to Obama: Deeds, Not Words,\\" IPS, Damascus, 5 June 2009, accessed 27 August 2009. Over the years she has published interviews with numerous other Palestinian (and Israeli) leaders and analysts. Israeli–Palestinian peacemaking She has authored numerous articles, book chapters, and blog posts about issues in this field, arguing in particular that the United States and other sponsors of the peace diplomacy should aim rapidly at securing a final peace agreement rather than losing time and political capital chasing interim deals. This has involved challenging the reliance on pre-agreement confidence-building measures as championed by Dennis Ross and others. Cobban has helped to lead, or participated in, several Track II diplomacy programs between Israelis and Palestinians and has developed some nuanced assessments of the potential benefits and pitfalls of such efforts. In 2009 and 2010 she served as Executive Director of the Council for the National Interest. Lebanese politics In her 1985 book, she analysed Lebanese politics as being the result of complex interactions among the country's different population groups, which she divided—based on an analysis by Fuad Khuri —into \\"sects\\" and \\"minorities.\\" The book, which also built on considerable on-the-ground reporting, identified and analysed the rise of the country's previously marginalised Shiite community. She made numerous reporting trips back to Lebanon after 1999, and has published two notable articles about the rise of Hezbollah.Cobban, Helena, \\"Hizbullah's New Face,\\" Boston Review. Accessed 2 February 2007. Originally published in the April/May 2005 issue of Boston Review.Cobban, Helena, \\"The 33-Day War: Hizbullah's victory, Israel's choice,\\" Boston Review. Accessed 25 August 2009. Originally published in the November/December 2006 issue of Boston Review. Syrian–Israeli peacemaking Her 1991 book tracked the entanglement of the Syrian–Israeli relationship in broader Cold War concerns. Zbigniew Brzezinski described it as a \\"perceptive and cool dissection of a truly complex issue.\\" In a 1997 monograph,Syria and the Peace: A Good Chance Missed (7 July 1997) she started to look at the surprisingly fruitful peace diplomacy that had taken place on this track since the 1991 Madrid Conference. She expanded on that work in her 2000 book,The Israeli-Syrian Peace Talks: 1991–96 and Beyond (United States Institute of Peace Press, January 2000) described by Raymond Hinnebusch as \\"A must-read for anyone with interest in the Middle East or the dynamics of peace negotiations in general.\\" Contributions to Transitional Justice Studies Cobban's 2006 book Amnesty after Atrocity?: Healing Nations after Genocide and War Crimes studied the outcomes—according to a broad range of social indicators—of the very different policy choices that by South Africa, Rwanda, and Mozambique made in the early to mid-1990s, as they attempted to deal with the tragic legacies of atrocities committed during earlier period of civil war and mass violence. This was one of the first attempts to adopt an essentially utilitarian approach to the challenge of transitional justice, a topic that had been approached by most earlier researchers in a more strictly deontological way. One of her most notable findings was that the average cost of trying a perpetrator at the ICTR was $42.3 million, while the average cost of processing each accused atrocity perpetrator in South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was $4,290 and the cost of demobilising and reintegrating into society each former fighter from the civil wars in South Africa and Mozambique—many of whom had committed atrocities—was under $1,100.Cobban, Helena, Amnesty After Atrocity?, Paradigm, 2006 (http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=143456), accessed 27 August 2009, p.209. During and after her work on the book, she conducted interviews and documentary research in the three countries studied; at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia; and in Northern Uganda. She published field notes and reflective essays from most of these trips on her Just World News blog and on the specially created Transitional Justice Forum blog.

The court operates under summary procedure and deals primarily with less serious criminal offences. History The commission of the peace was originally instituted in Scotland in the 16th century. Initially, justices were given the task of administering the county within which they resided until this work passed to the county councils with their establishment in 1888. Justices of the peace were then left with jurisdiction in the licensing board and minor criminal cases.Review of the Summary Justice System: District courts were introduced in 1975 as a replacement for burgh police courts and sat in each local authority area under summary procedure only.A history of Justices of the Peace: The Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 enabled the Scottish Ministers to replace district courts by \\"justice of the peace courts\\".\\"The Scottish Ministers may by order establish courts of summary criminal jurisdiction to be known as justice of the peace courts.\\" The justice of the peace courts are managed by the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service. Responsibility for the courts was transferred from the local authorities in a rolling programme of court unification that concluded in February 2010. The district courts were replaced by justice of the peace courts as follows: *Sheriffdom of Lothian and Borders, 10 March 2008 Circular JD/1/2008 *Sheriffdom of Grampian, Highlands and Islands, 2 June 2008 Circular JD/5/2008 *Sheriffdom of Glasgow and Strathkelvin, 8 December 2008 Circular JD/9/2008 *Sheriffdom of Tayside, Central and Fife, 23 February 2009 Circular JD/2/2009 *Sheriffdom of North Strathclyde, 14 December 2009 The Justice of the Peace Courts (Sheriffdom of North Strathclyde) etc. Order 2009 SSI 2009/331 *Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries & Galloway, 22 February 2010 The Justice of the Peace Courts (Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway) etc. Order 2009 SSI 2009/332 Stipendary magistrates in Glasgow In Glasgow only, some JP courts were presided over by a legally qualified stipendiary magistrate, and these officeholders can be classed as having the same powers and responsibilities. However, the maximum sentence that a stipendiary magistrate may impose is twelve months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding £10,000, which is the same as that of a sheriff sitting alone.Scottish Court Service: The option of appointing a stipendiary to a busy lay court has reportedly existed since the end of the 19th century and their powers were extended soon after their introduction to match those exercised by a sheriff dealing with summary criminal business. The 2007 Act, and its predecessor legislation continues to make such arrangements available.Review of the Summary Justice System: The Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 will abolish the office of stipendiary magistrate.Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014, section 128. Remit and jurisdiction JP courts deal with many minor offences, including breach of the peace, minor assaults, petty theft, and offences under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. JP Court Bench Book: JP courts have the power to sentence imprisonment for any period not exceeding sixty days; a fine not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale; to find caution (in lieu of or in addition to such imprisonment or fine) for good behaviour for any period not exceeding six months and to an amount not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale; or failing payment of such fine or on failure to find such caution, to impose imprisonment in proportion to the amount of the fine, etc. They also have the power to make the same orders following conviction as the sheriff court, such as a disqualification order under section 40 of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006, and can disqualify a person from driving.JP Court Bench Book: Since these powers were enlarged in 2007, JP courts have been involved in increasingly serious cases, where their powers are considered appropriate. Their judgments can be appealed to the High Court of Justiciary in the same way as any other criminal court. Justices acting personally can have a role in signing duties, for example in granting search warrants and emergency child protection orders.Judicial Studies Committee, 2007. Guidance Notes on Signing Duties of Justices of the Peace in Scotland. Edinburgh: Judicial Studies Committee Judges and office holders The individuals who sit in a justice of the peace court are known as justices of the peace, justices or JPs. Generally they are not legally qualified. A legally qualified person can become a justice of the peace, but cannot act in any proceedings in a justice of the peace court within their own sheriffdom. Justices are appointed for a five-year renewable term by the justices of the peace advisory committees for each sheriffdom, acting on the basis of standards set by the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland. The Appointment of Justices of the Peace: There is no precedence between justices; all are equal. However, a minority of JP courts operate with a bench of three justices, as opposed to a sole justice, in which circumstances a chair is appointed by those sitting on that day. They are collectively represented by the Scottish Justices Association.Scottish Justices Association: References External links *Justice of the Peace Court *Scottish Justices Association  UK legislation  * Category:Courts of Scotland Category:Scottish criminal law Category:16th-century establishments in Scotland Category:Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service Category:Justices of the peace Category:Courts and tribunals established in the 16th century ","title":"Justice of the peace court"},{"id":"24122537","text":"Robert Fabre (21 December 1915 in Villefranche-de-Rouergue, Aveyron - 23 December 2006 in Villefranche-de-Rouergue, Aveyron) was a French politician and pharmacist.

For a general discussion about U.S. health care see Health care in the United States. Medical centers in the United States are conglomerations of health care facilities including hospitals and research facilities that also either include or are closely affiliated with a medical school. Although the term medical center is sometimes loosely used to refer to any concentration of health care providers including local clinics and individual hospital buildings, the term academic medical center more specifically refers to larger facilities or groups of facilities that include a full spectrum of health services, medical education, and medical research. The major medical centers represent the crown jewels of health care in the United States. They vary greatly in their organization, the services they provide, and their ownership and operation.  Overview  In the United States, ownership of the health care system is mainly in private hands, though federal, state, county, and city governments also own certain facilities. Many major hospitals, generally the backbone of any medical center, are non-profit and many of these have their origins in religious organizations. Despite their non-profit status, affiliation with private ventures and major medical schools often allows them to maintain state-of-the-art facilities and services. The non-profit hospital's share of total hospital capacity has remained relatively stable (about 70%) for decades. There are also privately owned for-profit hospitals as well as government hospitals in some locations, mainly owned by county and city governments. Major medical centers provide many specialized services, some even containing multiple specialized hospitals and clinics each dedicated to specific types of patients and/or services. Additionally, they are centers of medical education, centers of medical research, and incubators for medical innovation and technology. A given medical center may include a medical school in the same complex as the rest of the facilities or may be closely affiliated with a medical school on a nearby campus. Similarly, a given medical school may be closely associated with multiple tightly linked hospital campuses which function to some degree as a unit though the group may not be referred to as a single medical center (e.g. the Harvard Medical School network of teaching hospitals). There are about 1,100 teaching hospitals in the United States. Approximately 375 of the larger institutions belong to the Association of American Medical Colleges’ Council of Teaching Hospitals and Health Systems (COTH). COTH teaching hospitals train about 75 percent of residents yearly and provide more than 40 percent of all hospital charity care in the nation.  Major medical centers  Although any rankings of medical centers are highly subjective, this section describes some of the largest and most prominent centers in the nation. Note that the rankings and importance of individual hospital facilities may be different from the medical centers that they belong to. Arizona  Banner University Medical Center Tucson  This medical center not only includes the University Hospital in Tucson, but various associated centers and institutes, including centers specializing in children's health, venom (mostly spiders, snakes, and scorpions), and cancer. Specifically, the Arizona Cancer Cancer, an NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, is located in the campus. In 2018, The University of Arizona received a total of $126.3 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health.  Phoenix Healthcare Cluster  The Phoenix area is home to a large medical cluster of major hospitals, research institutes and medical centers all located within 2.5 miles of each other in Downtown Phoenix.

It has clinical, research, and educational facilities in Rochester, Minnesota, in addition to Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona, and Jacksonville, Florida. Mayo Clinic partners with a number of smaller clinics and hospitals in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, an organization known as the Mayo Clinic Health System. Mayo Clinic pays medical doctors a fixed salary that is unaffected by patient volume. This practice is thought to decrease the monetary motivation to see patients in large numbers and increase the incentive to spend more time with individuals. Salaries are determined instead by the marketplace salaries for physicians in comparable large group practices. The Mayo Clinic campuses in Rochester form the largest integrated medical center in the world.http://www.mayoclinic.org/rochester/ Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN New York  NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital  NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell campus.

Her reporting \\"revolutionised\\" United Kingdom traffic news with the addition of live reports from motorists on mobile phones and lorry drivers on CB radio. Boazman presented her last weekday traffic reports for Radio 2 on Friday 8 August 2014, and she now broadcasts travel news at weekends. Career Following a brief foray into acting, Boazman took a post in the current affairs department of London Weekend Television where she worked as a secretary for the future BBC Director General Greg Dyke. After later working as a traffic news announcer for the Automobile Association she went on to present traffic reports for a number of local radio stations before moving to Classic FM. Her first presenting role was for the British Forces Broadcasting Service after which she worked for the BBC World Service and commercial radio. She spent some time away from broadcasting following the birth of her son, Harry, but returned later to become Chief Travel Reporter for BBC GLR. She joined BBC Radio 2 as the network's first official travel news presenter in 1998, presenting travel updates during the afternoon and early evening. She has worked alongside Johnnie Walker, later Chris Evans and Simon Mayo on their respective Drivetime shows, Steve Wright during the afternoon, and Jeremy Vine at lunchtime. Boazman continues to provide traffic news at weekends for BBC Radio 2. In 2007, Boazman was described by Autotrader UK as the \\"sexiest voice on the radio\\" and by veteran broadcaster Steve Wright as a 'national treasure' who changed the way traffic reporting was done. Her fans have named a thoroughbred race horse after her, as well as lorry trucks. Books, records, and activities In 2003 she narrated the poem Crawl of The Light Brigade for the CD recording Guide Cats for the Blind. In 2007 she wrote the book The Sally Traffic Handbook and narrated a CD for the Highways Agency called Hear When the Going's Good, providing advice to lorry drivers. TomTom navigation has a Sally Traffic voice available for its GPS units. Proceeds from purchase of the voice driving set go to the charity BBC Children in Need Appeal. From 10 to 19 November 2007, she cycled across 400 km of Kenya's Rift Valley to support charity Transaid. In 2009 she presented the Gold level Sony Radio Academy Award for drivetime entertainment to her fellow broadcaster Chris Evans, while in 2007 the Gold level Entertainment award honoured the Chris Evans Drivetime show and staff, of which Boazman was part. She also won the Truck & Driver Driver's Choice award for Best Traffic Information in 2009. On 29 October 2011, she presented The Road to Nowhere for BBC One in London and South East England, a documentary celebrating the 25th anniversary of the M25.

It was a historic precursor of two present-day reform bodies: the international umbrella organisation the IU and the UK think tank the Henry George Foundation. The object of the League was > the taxation for national and local purposes of the 'unimproved value of the > land', ie the value of the land apart from the buildings or other > improvements in or upon it. The League actively support[ed] all proposals in > Parliament for separate valuation of land, and for making land values the > basis of national and local taxation. The organisation was established on 16 April 1883 as the Land Reform Union, inspired by social reformer Henry George's first UK lecture tour in 1883–4, and his book, Progress and Poverty.Edwards 1909, p. 77 Early members of the group included John Charles Durrant, Stewart Headlam, James Leigh Joynes, Sydney Olivier, William Saunders, George Bernard Shaw, Henry Cary Shuttleworth, John Elliotson Symes, Helen Taylor, T. F. Walker and Philip Wicksteed. Initially, it focused on issuing leaflets explaining George's ideas. It also agreed to fund a second speaking tour of England for George. At the organisation's first annual meeting, in May 1884, it renamed itself as the English Land Restoration League (ELRL). Frederick Verinder was appointed as the league's secretary, and Saunders became its first treasurer. George's tour went ahead later in the year, running into 1885, with speeches also made by Michael Davitt. Durant and Saunders took up the cause in Parliament, and the group worked with the London Municipal Reform League to put up agreed candidates for the London County Council election, 1889, many of whom were elected. During the 1880s, the league organised regular meetings in Trafalgar Square. In 1887, its meeting was the last one prior to Bloody Sunday. Ending in chaos, Saunders was arrested and charged with riot, but he was acquitted. In 1891, the league instituted a \\"red van\\" campaign, in which a group of speakers travelled in a van around various villages in Suffolk. It ran the tour in conjunction with the Eastern Counties Labour Federation, which claimed to have recruited 5,000 members as a result. Deemed a great success, it ran five vans in following years, and in the winters instead organised lecture series in London. As a result, in Victorian England \\"the principles for which the...League stood were made widely known, and found acceptance both in town and country\\".Edwards 1909, p. 78 The Liberty and Property League was formed in an attempt to counter the ELRL's ideas, while the Land Nationalisation Society worked closely with the ELRL. In 1902 the ELRL changed its name—\\"which involved no change of front nor change of principles\\"—to the English League for the Taxation of Land Values.Land Values vol. IX, no. 100, September 1902, p. 60 The League was a constituent part (as one of the three national members), and 1907 founder, of the United Committee for the Taxation of Land Values, which became the Henry George Foundation:Edwards 1907 p. 73 as co- organiser of the 1926 International Conference in Denmark (and its 1923 precursor in Oxford, England), the League was a partner in the foundation of the International Union for Land Value Taxation and Free Trade, which became known simply as the IU.Land&Liberty; vol. 33, no. 388, p. 179 The United Committee and the IU became the principal vehicles for the League's work.

He was also known as Li Feiyu, Li Nengran, Li Laonong, and Li Neng Jang. He was also nicknamed \\"Divine Fist Li\\". He learned the internal martial art of Xinyiquan (Heart and Intention Boxing) from Dai Wenxiong, son of Dai Long Bang, and later modified the style into Xingyiquan (Form and Intention Boxing). In 1836, he already excelled in the martial arts of Tongbei and Gongliquan. However, he wanted to learn Xinyi, so, he traveled to Shanxi, because he had heard of Master Dai Wenxiong, son of Dai Longbang, one of the two famous Dai brothers, the other being Dai Linbang, who were teachers of Xinyi. Over a period of time, Dai Wenxiong refused to teach the newcomer. But such was Li's determination to become a student, that he found a plot of land and started a farm so he could stay in town. In the farm he grew vegetables, and every day he would deliver his product to market, but to the Dai family, he would deliver it free of charge. This display of determination and sincerity finally persuaded Dai Wenxiong to take him on as a student. Li Luoneng practiced with Master Dai for ten years, and went on to become one of the best-known Xingyi Masters of his time, as well a popularizer of the art. Li Luoneng introduced a number of variations to the style he learned from his teacher. He replaced the splitting fist piguaquan with a palm strike. He also changed the name xinyi (Heart and intention boxing) to xingyi (Form and intention boxing). Later he had a number of students, the most famous of which was Guo Yunshen. Guo Yunshen in turn was the teacher of Wang Xiangzhai, who popularized the qigong exercise known as zhan zhuang (post standing). The legacy of Li Luoneng is a rich and varied martial art that emphasizes practicality and effectiveness. His fame is perpetuated by his numerous famous students.

Plot The film Soleil Ô, shot over four years with a very low budget, tells the story of a black immigrant who makes his way to Paris in search of “his Gaul ancestors”. This filmic manifesto denounces discrimination: The immigrants desperately seek work and a place to live, but find themselves face to face with indifference, rejection, and humiliation, before heeding the final call for uprising. The title refers to a West Indian song that tells of the pain of the black people from Dahomey (now Benin) who were taken to the Caribbean as slaves.

It received a Golden Leopard award at the 1970 Locarno International Film Festival. In his Family Guide to Movies on Video, Henry Herx wrote that the film's \\"use of ironic humor and lively music keeps the plight of the black emigrant worker from becoming totally depressing.\\" In The New Yorker, Richard Brody wrote that \\"Making friends among France’s white population, [the main character] finds their empathy condescending and oblivious, and his sense of isolation and persecution raises his identity crisis to a frenzied pitch. Hondo offers a stylistic collage to reflect the protagonist’s extremes of experience, from docudrama and musical numbers to slapstick absurdity, from dream sequences and bourgeois melodrama to political analyses.\\" Restoration In 2017, Soleil Ô was given a restoration by the Cineteca di Bologna with the supervision of Med Hondo.

FEP is best known for their flagship Quest marker and associated upgrades. The company was created in 2004 and has existed as medium-sized entity since that time with the intention of supporting a limited array of products and services. The company was disbanded in 2007, but later resurrected under new staff in 2009. As of 2009, FEP Sports is currently involved in an internal restructuring to accompany their development phase related to their new upcoming products.  Products  Quest marker FEP is a medium-sized manufacturer of paintball products, thus most FEP products are geared for a specific market. The Quest paintball marker is FEP's main product and has been the basis for the company. The Quest marker was designed to compete with similar markers of the era, including the Dye DM4, Smart Parts Shocker SFT, and others. Quest markers originally sold for $925 (factory direct) but the price was reduced to $700 as the marker gained popularity over the next few months. To support the Quest, FEP also sold a line of upgrade accessories. Examples of these items include a locking feedneck, adjustable bottomline rail, replacement bolts (also featuring upgraded performance), and assorted factory replacement parts such as ASA mounts and grip panels. FEP also produces a line of promotional \\"soft goods\\", including but not limited to T-shirts, hats, posters, and digital goods. FEP partnered with several industry distributors including National Paintball Supply (currently KEE Action Sports) in order to distribute their own products as well as offer a variety of popular generic accessories produced by other developers. These include loaders, tanks, and similar items required to play the game. The entirety of the FEP product line was virtually discontinued in 2007 when the company disbanded. Some of the more popular items are said to be returning under the new 2009 lineup. Currently the main supporter of FEP products is California Paintball Supply who acquired the majority of closeout parts in order to support classic Quest markers in anticipation for the 09 product line.  Dissolution and Reincorporation into FEP Sports  In 2007 FEP was in the process of redesigning the Quest marker into a newer model; the running name for this marker was \\"Q8\\". It was similar internally to the original Quests however featured some changes to the support systems (eye covers, frame layout, LPR, front reg mount, notably). This marker was slated for release in 2008 however it never became available due to the company disbanding shortly thereafter. Some proshops and stores located near to the FEP offices continued to support the Quest, largest of which being Critical Paintball. The company leadership had parted ways, however many of them still wished to release the Q8 marker as their own. Dave Palmer, one of the original owners of the company, eventually reincorporated FEP into the new company FEP Sports in July 2009 with the intention of releasing a new product line similar to what had been envisioned. The new products centrally revolve around a new marker codenamed K1 which is tentatively scheduled for release in 2009.

The third tropical cyclone of the annual season, it developed from a tropical disturbance in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June 22\\\\. Gradual strengthening occurred, with the depression becoming Tropical Storm Candy on the following day. The storm reached its peak intensity of later that day and made landfall Port Aransas, Texas on June 23\\\\. Candy weakened into a tropical depression only hours after moving inland. However, the system remained a designated cyclone until June 26, at which time it completed extratropical transition over the state of Michigan. Due to rainfall from a trough for several days, combined in some areas from Candy itself, flooding occurred in eastern Texas; there was minor damage to crops, roads, and bridges. Agricultural losses alone were slightly less than $2 million (1968 USD). Storm surge along the coast of Texas caused \\"cuts\\" on Padre Island. The storm spawned 24 tornadoes, though only one caused significant impact. Candy and its remnants dropped rainfall in 24 other states, reaching as far north as New Hampshire. Overall, the system caused $2.7 million in damage and no fatalities. Meteorological history Between mid- to late June, satellite imagery indicated above normal amounts of shower and thunderstorm activity over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. By June 22, the system developed into a tropical depression just off the coast of Mexico in the Bay of Campeche. The depression, which initially had an elongated structure, moved north to north-northwestward at roughly . On June 22, three separate and distinct circulation centers were noted in weather radar images from Brownsville, Texas. Later that afternoon, a United States Navy reconnaissance aircraft investigated the depression and recorded sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Therefore, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Candy at 1800 UTC on that same day. Late on June 23, Candy made landfall near Port Aransas, Texas. Despite moving ashore, Candy attained its peak intensity at 0000 UTC on June 24, with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Both were observations from a weather station in Austwell, Texas. The storm quickly weakened inland, falling to tropical depression status early on June 24\\\\. In advance of a cold front, Candy curved northeastward on June 25 and began to accelerate. While moving across the Midwestern United States, the storm began to lose tropical characteristics due to the presence of cold air. At 0000 UTC on June 26, Candy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated over southern Michigan. The remnants continued eastward for several more hours before dissipating over western New York. Impact and aftermath Rainfall totals for the storm Gale-force winds were reported from Corpus Christi to Galveston, Texas. Sustained winds were above for more than an hour at Austwell, Texas. The peak wind gust of was measured at Port Aransas, Texas, where the storm made landfall. Storm surge was highest in San Antonio and Corpus Christi Bays, at , and was along the rest of the Texas coast. However, damage from the storm surge was confined to the formation of \\"cuts\\" along Padre Island and to coastal oil refinery equipment. Prior to the formation of Candy, a trough had brought eight to ten days of rainfall throughout Texas which helped the heavy rainfall from the storm produced damage to crops, roads, and bridges throughout eastern Texas. The rains from Candy also caused flooding on many middle and upper coastal rivers with significant damage confined to the eastern and western forks of the San Jacinto River. The highest recorded rainfall was at Point Comfort, Texas. Elsewhere in southeast Texas, precipitation amounts were generally . Impact from winds was mostly minor, except at the public fishing pier in Port O'Connor, which was severely damaged by 65 mph (100 km/h) winds. Ten towboats and barges, as well as several other small vessels, received minor impacts at Hopper's Landing on San Antonio Bay. Outside of Texas, of rain was reported in eastern Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, central Missouri, and northern Illinois. Precipitation in Michigan exceeded in some areas, contributing to the ongoing flooding event in Ann Arbor. Flash flooding was reported in western New York, due to precipitation amounts up to in Buffalo during a 24-hour period. As a result, streams overflowed their banks, inundating many basements, sewers, and underpasses. While tropical, Candy spawned 19 tornadoes or funnel-clouds to form between June 23 and 25. Ten were reported in Texas, five in Arkansas, three in Louisiana, and one in Missouri. Five additional tornadoes, which were associated with the extratropical remnants of Candy, were reported on June 25 in eastern Ohio. Despite the amount of tornadoes, only one caused significant damage. That tornado \\"nearly demolished\\" a school in Morning Star, Arkansas. The total property damage from the storm was \\"conservatively\\" estimated at $1 million, while losses to agriculture in eastern Texas approached $2 million. No deaths were reported in relation to the storm. Candy made 1968 only one of four years to have three named storms in June, with the others being 1886, 1936, and 1959.

A sturdy tripod is always brought along, but it might just as well be placed on a tabletop. It has equally sized rectangular front and back panels on a full- width double-extension baseboard that is hinged near the front. The front panel, holding the lens plate, has horizontal and vertical movements, while the back is tilt-suspended on brass standards running on brass tracks on either side of the baseboard, providing rack and pinion focusing on the film plane. An almost non-tapering calico double-extension bellows is employed; allowing the projected image to freely reach the photographic plate regardless of lens offset position. The camera folds flat, after the back panel is brought forward to the lens panel, by folding the hinged base board up, and thus conveniently protecting the focusing screen. For insertion of the wooden dark slide plate cassette, the hinged focusing screen is swung up and away. The Reisekamera was made available for several plate sizes; most common are the 13×18 cm, 18×24 cm and 24×30 cm versions. Shutter and lens were normally not part of the original delivery. However, some were made available with a spectacular focal-plane shutter, recognisable by the brass mechanisms either side of the back panel. The Reisekamera might be considered the portable version of the studio camera, to be used outside the professional photographic studio, on assignment at location, for architectural work or documentation away from the studio, in homes or museums. It is collapsible, yet not small, and it is much too cumbersome and large for the travelling amateur to bring along. The bellows extension would allow a selection of focal length lenses to be employed covering the required field of view. The back panel may be tilted and turned slightly, and at the front, the lens plate may slide vertically and horizontally to control perspective and distortion. The Reisekamera would be one of several cameras suitable for field assignments. A black cloth is required to keep stray light out while observing the image on the ground glass focusing screen. When the image is composed and focused, the focusing screen is replaced by the plate holder. The lens cap is placed on the lens, the dark slide removed from the plate holder, and the lens cap is removed for the required exposure time and replaced. If an auxiliary shutter is present, it may perform the function of the lens cap. After the exposure the dark slide is replaced to protect the exposed plate from stray light. The plate holder is either turned for a second photo, or brought to the darkroom for plate development and copying. The camera would be supplied with a number of plate holders, each usually holding two plates, one on either side. The Reisekamera was a popular wooden bellows view camera of the tailboard design, manufactured in large quantities in specialised cabinetmaker's workshops of the eastern regions of Germany from about 1860, but reaching peak popularity in the decades around 1900. These cameras would be distributed through well-known camera manufacturers situated in cities like Görlitz or Dresden, but would also emerge elsewhere and abroad, sometimes nameless and sometimes with the distributor or warehouse names attached, a fact causing considerable confusion with regard to origin. The Reisekamera is, regardless of the maker, quite similarly built and of almost standardised design, often without maker's identification. The collector's usual practice to identify some of these cameras by its name plate, if present, or even by the lens attached, results in almost identical cameras being attributed to more than one brand name. The original designer or manufacturer has not been ascertained, but it is thought to originate in the Saxony region of Germany around 1860, and in fact, many Reisekameras came from Dresden or Görlitz in particular. This region had a highly specialised woodwork industry well suited for camera manufacture. As the type became popular, manufacture of similar cameras took place worldwide, but these are more often than not clearly marked with the manufacturer's name. Possibly the best known Reisekamera is the Globus, manufactured by Ernst Herbst & Firl, Görlitz for the camera manufacturer Heinrich Ernemann in Dresden. 100px References Category:Cameras ","title":"Reisekamera"},{"id":"24122781","text":"The Harley-Davidson Model 7D of 1911 was the first successful v-twin from Harley-Davidson, inaugurating a motorcycle engine configuration that has continued unbroken from the Milwaukee motor company ever since.

She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in January 1981 before being scrapped in 2005. History USS Admiral H. T. Mayo (AP-125) Built at Alameda, California to the Maritime Commission's P2-SE2-R1 design, she was commissioned in April 1945. After shakedown she steamed to the Atlantic and, in June, carried 5,819 released prisoners of war from Le Havre, France, to Boston. Her next voyage took her to Marseilles, France, where she embarked 4,888 quartermaster and engineer troops and transported them to Okinawa, arriving in September. Admiral H. T. Mayo then began the first of several \\"Magic Carpet\\" trips, bringing servicemen home from the Western Pacific. The ship completed the last of these voyages in November 1947 from Jinsen Korea and sailed for New York, where she was decommissioned and transferred, via the Maritime Commission, to the U.S. Army. USAT General Nelson M. Walker USAT Admiral H. T. Mayo: Serving as an Army transport circa 1947. The Army soon renamed her USAT General Nelson M. Walker. The Army operated the ship with a civilian crew as part of its water transportation service and soon renamed her General Nelson M. Walker. In mid-1948 she received upgraded accommodations for military dependents. First Return to Navy Service Returned to the Navy in March 1950 when most of the Army's larger ships became part of the newly created Military Sea Transportation Service. Still civilian-manned and retaining her \\"General\\" name, the ship made numerous crossings of the Pacific in support of the Korean War. To increase her troop capacity, in early 1952 she was refitted as an \\"austerity\\" transport, with most amenities removed. Later in 1952 she carried Greek and Turkish troops from their homelands to Korea, and in August 1953 she brought the first group of 328 returning American prisoners of war home from Korea. General Nelson M. Walker continued to operate in the Pacific until January 1957, when she transited to the Atlantic and carried out a single round trip voyage to Bremerhaven, West Germany. Placed in ready reserve status in February 1957, she was berthed in the Maritime Administration's Hudson River reserve fleet from June 1957 to June 1958 and again after January 1959, when she was transferred to the Maritime Administration and stricken from the Navy List. Second Return to Navy service In August 1965 the Navy reacquired the General Nelson M. Walker, reinstating her on the Navy List with the prefix USNS to support the buildup of U.S. forces in Vietnam. On January 4, 1966, the 2nd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division of Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, boarded the General Nelson M. Walker for deployment to Vietnam. arriving in Vung Tau on January 18, 1966. The day after arriving in Vung Tau, troops boarded LSTs and were transported to shore, where they were airlifted by C-130 to Tan Son Nhut Air Base, and from there by ground convoy transport to Cu Chi. On 21 July 1966 the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment of Ft. Lewis Washington, boarded the General Nelson M. Walker for deployment to Vietnam. After seventeen days at sea she docked at Naha, Okinawa. On 6 August 1966, the General Nelson M. Walker dropped anchor in Qui Nhon harbor in South Vietnam. The 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment were ferried to the beach aboard LVMs (naval landing craft capable of carrying both vehicles and troops), and then was airlifted to Pleiku by C-130 and by ground convoy transport to the 4th Infantry Division advance party location near Dragon Mountain, later renamed Camp Enari.History of 1/22 Infantry USNS General Nelson M.

Inspired by the Boston Tea Party and the calls for tea boycotts and the resolutions of the first North Carolina Provincial Congress, 51 women, led by Penelope Barker, met on October 25, 1774, and signed a statement of protest vowing to give up tea and boycott other British products \\"until such time that all acts which tend to enslave our Native country shall be repealed.\\" Organized by women The Edenton Tea Party was a landmark, not because of the stances taken—boycotts were common across the Thirteen Colonies—but because it was organized by women, who at this time were very much absent in politics, the Tea Party was one of the first instances of political action. Despite their usual absence at political gatherings, women played a significant role in the running of the household and were therefore crucial to boycott efforts instigated by men. Barker believed their action would be noteworthy in England and sent a copy of the declaration to the British press. She said at the time, “Maybe it has only been men who have protested the king up to now. That only means we women have taken too long to let our voices be heard. We are signing our names to a document, not hiding ourselves behind costumes like the men in Boston did at their tea party. The British will know who we are.” While the reaction in England was mostly derogatory and dismissive (i.e. engraver Philip Dawe's satirical depiction of the event), in the colonies it inspired many others to take up the boycotts and their actions were praised by many patriots. The Edenton tea party had 50 women, or 51 including Penelope Barker. The signers of the declaration include Abagail Charlton, Mary Blount, F. Johnstone, Elizabeth Creacy, Margaret Cathcart, Elizabeth Patterson, Anne Johnstone, Jane Wellwood, Margaret Pearson, Mary Woolard, Penelope Dawson, Sarah Beasley, Jean Blair, Susannah Vail, Grace Clayton, Elizabeth Vail, Frances Hall, Mary Jones, Mary Creacy, Anne Hall, Rebecca Bondfield, Ruth Benbury, Sarah Littlejohn, Sarah Howcott, Penelope Barker, Sarah Hoskins, Elizabeth P.

Synopsis The main subject of the doctrinal part of Edwards sermon is the free grace of God in man's salvation, especially in regards to justification by faith alone. Edwards examines the context of Romans 3:19 in which the Apostle Paul chastises the Jewish people for their literal observance and interpretation of the Law and then proceeds to condemn them for it. Edwards affirms, and then elaborates upon, Paul's original assertion. Analysis Edwards preached the sermon during the First Great Awakening (c. 1730–1755) in a series of sermons entitled \\"Justification by Faith Alone\\" in 1734. The result of Edwards' preaching was the beginnings of a great revival in Northampton and along the Connecticut River Valley in the winter and spring of 1734-5. During this same period, more than three hundred of Edwards' congregation made professions of faith. \\"The Justice of God in the Damnation of Sinners\\" was preached against the principles of Arminianism, namely the disabling effects of original sin, free will and the tendency to make morality the essence of religion. History and impact While not as popular as some of his other works, modern day Calvinists such as John Piper refer to Edwards' teaching often and use his works extensively in their own ministries.

The name to be given to the proposed breakaway state was \\"Jinnahpur\\", named after Mohammed Ali Jinnah. In 1992, the Pakistani military had found maps of the proposed Jinnahpur state in the offices of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (now renamed Muttahida Qaumi Movement). The government of Nawaz Sharif chose to use it as the basis for the military operation against the MQM, known as Operation Clean-up.The MQM of Pakistan: Between Political Party and Ethnic Movement, Mohammad Waseem, in Political parties in South Asia, ed.

This concept floated as a political bargaining tool by the leader of Muttahida Qaumi Movement, Altaf Hussain for the creation of a Muhajir province for the Muhajir-majority areas of Sindh, which would be independent from Sindh government. The political deprivations of MQM became the major causes leading towards the demand of a separate province. Mahajir people are held back not giving government jobs or any part on policy making. Most of the mahajir areas are ignored for any development, infrastructure. Various other names have been suggested by Altaf Hussain to refer to proposed new province such as Sindh 1 and Sindh 2.

It has a mass equal to 10 Jupiter masses, just below the boundary line between planets and brown dwarfs, about 13 Jupiter masses. Due to tidal deceleration, it is expected to spiral towards and eventually merge with its host star, WASP-18, in less than a million years. The planet is approximately 3.1 million kilometres (1.9 million miles) from its star, which is about 410 light-years from Earth. It was discovered by a team led by Coel Hellier, a professor of astrophysics at Keele University in England. Scientists at Keele and at the University of Maryland are working to understand whether the discovery of this planet so shortly before its expected demise (with less than 0.1% of its lifetime remaining) was fortuitous, or whether tidal dissipation by WASP-18 is actually much less efficient than astrophysicists typically assume. Observations made over the next decade should yield a measurement of the rate at which WASP-18b's orbit is decaying. The closest example of a similar situation in the Solar System is Mars' moon Phobos. Phobos orbits Mars at a distance of only about , 40 times closer than the Moon is to the Earth,Johnson, John Jr.; Astrophysicists puzzle over planet that's too close to its sun, Los Angeles Times (August 27, 2009). and is expected to be destroyed in about eleven million years.

He was born in Connecticut Farms, in Union Township, New Jersey, and is most widely known as the father of writer Stephen Crane. Early years Crane was the son of William Crane (1778-1830) and Sarah Townley (1776-1830), who both died when he was 11 years old.Crane Family Genealogy. Accessed 25 August 2009. He was subsequently apprenticed to a trunk maker in Newark.Stanley Wertheim, \\"Jonathan Townley Crane,\\" A Stephen Crane Encyclopedia. Greenwood Press, Westport CT, 1997, pp. 71-2. Although raised in the Congregational church, he rejected its deterministic teachings. Accidentally, in 1838, he wandered into a Revival meeting, and was converted to Methodism. Education He graduated from the Princeton Theological Seminary in Princeton, New Jersey in 1843 and in 1844 was licensed to preach, after which he was admitted to the New Jersey Annual conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1845. Dickinson College conferred upon him the Doctorate of Divinity in 1856.Wertheim, p. 71.  Career  Throughout his career as an educator, pastor and writer, Crane was active in local temperance movements, and strongly supported abolitionist causes. Ministry In 1846, he was stationed as pastor at Hope Township, Warren County, New Jersey, and in 1847 at Belvidere, New Jersey. In 1848–49, he was the pastor at Orange, New Jersey, and in June 1849, was elected principal of the Conference school and seminary at Pennington, New Jersey, the post from which he resigned in 1858 to become pastor of Trinity Church in Jersey City, New Jersey. From 1863–65, he was the pastor of another large and important church, the Methodist Episcopal Church in Morristown, New Jersey. In 1868–72, he was the presiding elder of the Newark, New Jersey district, during which time his son Stephen was born.Wertheim, p. 71-72. Crane was a delegate to the General conferences of 1860, 1864, 1868, and 1872 while he was the elder of the Newark (1868-1872) and Elizabeth districts (1872–76). He rejected the mid-19th century Holiness Movement of Christian perfection as unattainable and unreasonable; Crane's opposition subsequently limited his advancement as an administrator in the Methodist Episcopal denomination and drew the wrath of his father-in-law, Bishop George Peck.Christopher Benfy, \\"Stephen Crane's Father and the Holiness Movement.\\" Courier, 25:1 (1990), 25-36. After his administrative career ended, he returned to parish work, serving at Cross Street Church in Paterson, New Jersey, and then to Drew Methodist Episcopal Church in Port Jervis, New York.Wertheim, p. 72. Writer As a religious writer, his contributions appeared largely in the periodical literature of his denomination. Most notably, he wrote \\"Essay on Dancing \\" (1848) in which he expounded its evils; despite his own personal lack of experience with dancing, he claimed he understood its evils.Ann Louise Wagner, Adversaries of Dance, From the Puritans to the Present, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1997, p. 151. His books, The Right Way, or Practical Lectures on the Decalogue (1853) and Popular Amusements (1869), in which he described how even the most apparently innocent amusements led people into sin were aimed at juvenile audiences. In Arts of Intoxication (1870), he wrote against alcoholic beverages of any kind and advocated temperance. He also wrote theological tracts Holiness, the Birthright of all God's Children (1874) and Methodism and its Methods (1875).Appleton's Encyclopedia. \\"Jonathan Townley Crane.\\" 2001. Crane's literary works traditionally have been used as a foil for his son's urban grittiness, but more recent scholarship posits his writing as a critique of nineteenth century social failures to address problems of poverty, disease, education, and employment.James Rowan, \\"Stephen Crane and Methodism's Realism: translating spiritual sympathy into urban experience.\\" Studies in American Fiction, Fall 2008, 1-19, p. 2. In his \\"Christ and the Painters,\\" which was published in the Sunday School Times in 1877, he criticized the sentimental piety of contemporary painters who depicted Jesus blessing a clutch of rosy cheeked children; such \\"specimens of infantile innocence and grace\\" as were portrayed in these paintings were \\"perhaps just such a lot of little wretches as the modern traveler in that same region sees crawling out of their mud huts, dirty, unkempt, ragged, or without even a rag, to stare at him with their sore eyes.\\"Rowan, p. 3. He rejected his contemporaries overly simplistic sentimentality that desensitized people to the real and abject problems of their fellow beings.Rowan, p. 4. The poison of sectionalism, he further explained in Methodism and its Methods, had distracted Christians from the real work of the Gospel, which was living the Word.Rowan, p. 5.

It is very closely related to Nasutitermes ephratae. The species has been studied relatively intensively, particularly on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. These studies and others have shown that the termite interacts with many different organisms including a bat that roosts in its nest and various species of ants that cohabit with the termite. Description The nests of N. corniger are dark brown on the surface and have small bumps over their exterior. When small (less than 20 cm in diameter) they tend to be spherical but as they grow they become more elliptical. There may also be localised lobes on the surface of the nest. The queen lives in a chamber located in the centre of the nest, (often near the tree trunk or branch to which the nest is attached), that is up to 8 cm wide and 1 cm high and heavily reinforced. The thickness of the walls in the nest decreases away from the queen and towards the exterior although if the nest is attacked by predators then the walls will be reinforced. In one study of their nests the heaviest nest identified weighed 28 kilograms and measured 68 cm by 46 cm by 34 cm. Fertile individuals of N. corniger have black wings, dark bodies, and ocelli which are located relatively far from the eyes. Social behavior Termite colonies are examples of eusocial insects. Eusocial insects are animals that develop large, multigenerational cooperative societies that assist each other in the rearing of young, often at the cost of an individual's life or reproductive ability. Such altruism is explained in that eusocial insects benefit from giving up reproductive ability of many individuals to improve the overall fitness of closely related offspring. Hamilton's rule is the key to explaining this phenomenon, where altruism is justified evolutionarily when the benefit to the individual receiving the help, weighted by the relatedness to said individual, outweighs the cost to the organism being altruistic. In most cases, termites included, individuals specialize to fill different needs that the overall colony may have. These are called castes. In Nasutitermes as well as most other termite species, there are three main castes: reproductive alates, workers, and soldiers. Fortress defense The benefits to being altruistic come in two ecological modes: “life insurers” and “fortress defenders”. Most Hymenoptera, the large majority of social insects, are life insurers, where eusociality is adapted as a safeguard from decreased life expectancy of offspring. Termites, as fortress defenders, benefit from working together to best exploit a valuable ecological resource, in the case of Nasutitermes corniger a vast wood gallery. Fortress defense is sufficient to evolve eusociality when three criteria are met: food coinciding with shelter, selection for defense against intruders and predators, and the ability to defend such a habitat. Termite colonies are generally large enclosed nests or mounds that house large supplies of wood for the termites to exploit, fulfilling the first criteria for fortress defense. In N. corniger, the soldier caste has had their heads modified to spew a noxious, sticky liquid when under attack from Tamandua anteaters. The secretion contains pinene, limonene and other high molecular weight compounds that deter the anteater from returning. The termites then remain on guard near the breach for several minutes. This adaptive morphology and defense of the habitat are sufficient for satisfying the second two criteria for fortress defense. The fortress defense strategy necessitated the evolution of soldiers first, which has resulted in the unique specialization of the nasute termites. Recognition Nasutitermes corniger exhibits a large amount of aggression to rival conspecific colonies. This implies that there is a method of kin recognition among N. corniger that allow it to distinguish between its colony and the next. While specific studies have not been done in N. corniger, similar species in Microcerotermes and many other termites show that they are able to detect scent on each other. It has been shown that some separate colonies display relatively low aggression to each other and oftentimes result in colony fusion. It is of note that these colonies will show massive aggression towards other colonies, indicating it is not a loss in aggressive behavior but a failure in recognition. It has been shown that colonies that exhibit this nonaggressive behavior have a relatively low average within-colony relatedness of .35, whereas colonies that retained mutually aggressive behavior had a higher relatedness average of .55. The nonaggressive colonies often had polygamous reproductive individuals, and may have a broader template of acceptable odor clues, leading to recognition of other colonies. Reproduction The number of fertile individuals produced by colonies of N. corniger varies widely. Mature colonies with between 50,000 and 400,000 infertile workers generally produce between 5,000 and 25,000 alates. In some years large colonies do not produce a fertile brood. Alate nymphs develop through five instars and spend between 5 and 8 months within the colony before leaving to mate. When the alates are mature they typically account for 35% of the colony's biomass. More males than females are produced from each colony but because females are heavier (by between 20 and 40%) the energy investment in each sex is similar. Newly formed colonies tend to have multiple queens and kings all living in the same royal chamber. Slightly older colonies tend to consist of multiple queens (up to 33) but only one king, in these cases the species can be considered polygynous. Over several years the species turns to being monogamous, having only one queen and one king. Being polygynous in the early stages of the colony is advantageous as it allows the colony to produce many workers in a short period of time and allows the production of female alates more quickly than if they were monogamous from the start. Range N. corniger have been found in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Trinidad, Tobago and Bolivia and more recently in Florida. Interactions Associations Numerous species of ants cohabit the nests of N. corniger or colonise them once the termites have abandoned them. Some species prey on the termites but others do not. Studies with radioactive tracers have shown that when cohabiting nutrients flow both ways between the ants and the termites. Monacis bispinosa, also known as Dolichoderus bispinosus is one of the most common ant species to cohabit with the termites but is susceptible to their chemical defences and cannot prey on live termites. Camponotus abdominalis associates with termites less often but is an aggressive predator of the termites. Camponotus species and Dolichoderus diversus have been found to inhabit N. corniger nests that have been abandoned. Crematogaster brevispinosa rochai is one subspecies of ant whose interaction with N. corniger has been studied. C. b. rochai lives in areas of caatinga in Brazil. No queens of the ant have been found in the nests but their larvae of all castes and sexes have been. Nests that contain C. b. rochai do not have a termite queen in either. It can therefore be concluded that both the ants and termites are members of polydomous colonies that each have numerous nest sites. The ants and termites are segregated within the nest and do not normally come into contact with each other. C. b. rochai plug channels at the boundary of the areas they occupy to cause this segregation. On occasions when the ants and termites do come into contact with each other (e.g. if the nest is broken into) they are rarely aggressive and tend to avoid each other instead. It has been hypothesised that the hydrocarbon content of their cuticles may have changed to allow them to live together relatively peacefully. The termites are thought to benefit from the association as the ants leave debris in the nest containing nitrogen and that this increases the availability of this important nutrient in an environment where it is scarce. They may also benefit from the ants protecting the nest from predators. The ants benefit as the termite nests provide an ideal location to raise broods, particularly of reproductive castes. The climate is suitable for this and the nests are easily defended against predators. Other Nasutitermes species have been found to produce anti-fungal compounds and these would also be beneficial to the ants although it is not known if N. corniger do produce such compounds. The White-throated Round-eared Bat, Lophostoma silvicolum, roosts inside the nests of N.corniger. Males excavate the roost themselves, expending considerable energy whilst doing so. They consequently gain reproductive success as a harem of females will join them in the roost. The termite nest is an ideal temperature for raising young and provides protection from predators of the bats. N. corniger repair the damage made to the nest by the bat meaning that the males have to constantly maintain the roost. Once the bats leave the cavity is filled by the termites within a few weeks. Scientists are currently investigating how the bats are able to create the roosts without being attacked by the termites. Several bird species including trogons, puffbirds and parakeets also form nests in termite nests. These can be distinguished from those made by bats as they have a horizontal entrance whereas those made by bats have a vertical entrance at the base of the nest. Symbioses The entire gut flora of a termite very closely related to N. corniger has been analysed using metagenomics to determine the function of different microbes in their gut. Typical to all wood-feeding higher termites, bacterial gut microbiota in the guts of N. corniger are dominated by insect-specific members of TG3_(candidate_phylum), Fibrobacteres, and Spirochaetes. It has also been shown that the same bacterial lineages are preferentially enriched in the cellulolytic bacterial community that is associated with wood particles in the gut. In addition to a role in fibre digestion, Symbiotic bacteria in N. corniger have also been shown to fix nitrogen at a rate of 0.25-1.0 mg N per colony per hour. This suggests a nitrogen doubling time of 200–500 days making it possible for the whole population of the colony to be replaced once or twice each year.

He was fluent in both English and Swahili. He wrote one of the first glossaries of the Ganda language. Early life Mukasa was the son of Makabugo Sensalire, a minor chief in Buddu (in present-day Masaka District). He converted to Christianity at a young age. He suffered serious injury in the 1886 massacre of Christians by Mwanga II. As a result, he had a weak leg. Around 1898, he married Наnnаh Mаwеmukо, the daughter of a former chief minister (Katikkiro) of Buganda. Career Ham Mukasa was placed in the palace of Kabaka Mutesa I as a page at the age of nine by his father, a clan chief in Buganda. While in the palace, Mukasa at first received instruction from Islamic teachers who held sway in Mutesa's court; however, he was later drawn to the Protestants, who baptised him Ham. It was as a christian, and as a Protestant, that he took part in Buganda's religious wars of 1888-1892. Mukasa was appointed the ssaza (county) chief of Kyaggwe - known as the Ssekiboobo - in 1905, and served in the position until 1935 when he retired. Journeys in England Mukasa's book Uganda's Katikiro in England details his experiences on his journey from his homeland to the coronation of Edward VII of the United Kingdom, as secretary to Katikkiro (Prime Minister) Apolo Kagwa. It was translated into English by Ernest Millar of the Church Mission Society in Uganda. In London, Mukasa stayed at Alexandra Palace, and visited the London Hippodrome, attended a play in Drury Lane, and met with a variety of people such as writer Henry Morton Stanley and ex-governor of Uganda Harry Johnston. Ham Mukasa returned to England in 1913, this time accompanying the child Kabaka Cwa who was on an official visit.  Personal life  Ham Mukasa married his first wife, Hanna Wawemuko when he was 27 years old. They had four children together. Wawemuko died in 1919, and Mukasa remarried a year later. He had ten children with his second wife, Sarah Nabikolo.

The name was changed to the present one when Portuguese was added to the association's mission in 1944. The organization is composed of more than 8,800 members in 60 chapters across the United States and Canada.  Mission statement  The mission statement of the association is to: > promote ... the study and teaching of Hispanic, Luso-Brazilian, and other > related languages, literatures, and cultures at all educational levels. > Through an exchange of pedagogical and scholarly information, the AATSP > encourages heritage and second-language study and supports projects to that > end. AATSP Official Web site  History and organization  The Association was founded in 1917 largely through the efforts of Lawrence A. Wilkins, its first President, who worked with a number of individuals teaching in colleges, universities, and high schools along the Eastern Seaboard.AATSP History Aurelio M. Espinosa, later the first editor of Hispania, helped Wilkins to unite the previously existing east and west coast Spanish teachers' initiatives to form the national association.Walsh, Donald Devenish. Hispania, Vol. 50, No. 4, Fiftieth Anniversary Issue (Dec. 1967) p. 823-833 The AATSP was the first association in the United States devoted to the study of a specific modern foreign language, pre-dating the AATI (1923), the AATF (French) (1927), and the AATG (German) (1927). Membership has always been open to teachers of Spanish and Portuguese and all others interested in the languages. There are Honorary Members and Fellows who represent, respectively, the world of Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian scholarship and the world of letters.  Governing body  The governing body of AATSP is an Executive Council (EC) which consists of an executive director, a president, a president-elect, and the past president. There is an elected representative from the college or university and high school levels. In addition, there is a rotating body of elected members every three years of three members, one from a community college, one from Foreign Language in the Elementary Schools (FLES), and one from Portuguese. The Executive Council meets once a year face-to-face at the annual conference, through numerous conference calls, and regularly through online meetings via email. There is a business meeting at the annual conference through which all members can express their concerns to the EC. There are also standing committees for Portuguese, FLES, award selection, scholarship selection, and nominations.  Services   Annual conference  An annual conference has been held each year since 1917 with the exception of two years during World War II when government restrictions prohibited such gatherings. Each annual conference consists of a wide range of sessions, numerous workshops for members, and many social activities designed to augment the camaraderie of members. In the 21st century, meetings have been held in Albuquerque, San José, Costa Rica, San Diego, Salamanca, Spain, New York City, Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, and Guadalajara, Mexico.  Career center  The AATSP offers employment opportunity information to its members by way of an online career center. This interactive tool allows job seekers to search for jobs based on their personal criteria and allows employers from school districts, colleges, and universities to announce job openings.  Publications  Hispania is the official journal of the AATSP. From its inception, it was envisioned as a scholarly publication and also as a source of practical advice for classroom teachers. It features articles on literature, language, theoretical and applied linguistics, cultural studies, and book and media reviews. It has steadily grown in prestige and has had 12 editors through the years; the present editor is Dr. Sheri Spaine Long of University of Alabama at Birmingham. Publications are in March, June, September, and December. Hispania is a member of the Council of Editors of Learned Journals. Enlace is the AATSP's online newsletter that contains timely articles of interest to members. The Portuguese Newsletter features items of interest about the Luso- Brazilian world. They are both published in the spring and fall.  Scholarships and awards  There are three categories of scholarships AATSP offers. The first is a \\"First-Time-Attendee\\" travel stipend for the annual conference. There are ten $500 stipends offered which are distributed to faculty members and to graduate students. Applicants must be a member of AATSP at the time of application, a teacher of Spanish and/or Portuguese K-16, and a first time attendee at an AATSP annual meeting. There are also scholarships for study abroad programs in Costa Rica, Mexico, and the Andean countries of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. The study abroad programs provide scholarships and the AATSP supplements the scholarship with a $750 travel stipend. Applicants must be an AATSP member for three consecutive years, a full-time Spanish teacher for three years, and continue to teach Spanish for an academic year following the scholarship experience. The Robert G. Mead, Jr. Travel and Study/Research Stipend is a $1,000.00 travel stipend made possible through the contributions of friends of Professor Mead and his widow Harriet. Applicants must travel and conduct research in a Luso-Hispanic country and be a student member of AATSP for two years or a regular member for three years. The AATSP accepts nominations from its members for individuals who have done outstanding work in the promotion of foreign language education in Spanish and Portuguese. Awards include Outstanding Teacher of the Year, Outstanding Service, Chapter Incentive, Robert G. Mead, Jr. Distinguished Leadership, Maria Isabel Abreu, and ISE Language Matters. More information is available on the official AATSP website. AATSP Awards  Student involvement   FLES poster contest  Each year the AATSP sponsors a poster contest for all students enrolled in Spanish or Portuguese in grades K-8 of AATSP members in good standing. It is an excellent opportunity to discuss language learning with younger learners. The contest is a great classroom activity and program advocacy tool providing student recognition.  Honor Societies  The Sociedad Honoraria Hispánica (SHH) was established in 1952 as a service-oriented honors society for select students of Spanish. It has long published an official newsletter for its sponsors, ¡Albricias!, which includes poetry, short pieces, illustrations, and photography created by the students themselves. There are more than 1800 chapters and the number of initiates grows each year. A club for elementary and middle school students, the Sociedad Hispánica de Amistad (SHA), was formed in 2001. Kelly Scheetz directs the SHH and Beth Gaunce directs the SHA.  National Examinations  The National Spanish Examinations (NSE) are web- based, standardized assessment tools for Grades 6–-12, given voluntarily by over 3400 teachers throughout the United States to measure proficiency and achievement of students who are studying Spanish as a second language. National Spanish Examinations The National Portuguese Examinations (NPE) are communicative proficiency-based tools that engage the students in reading, speaking, and writing. They are intended for High School students of Portuguese.

It is whale-back- shaped and accessible for walkers, giving views over Morecambe Bay to Lancaster, Morecambe, Heysham and over the Leven estuary to Ulverston. There is an Ordnance Survey trig point at the top. Since 1906 it has been the home of Humphrey Head Outdoor Centre, currently operated by Mere Mountains http://www.humphreyhead.education. Most of the Head is a nature reserve, managed by Cumbria Wildlife Trust since 1992 although still owned by the Holker Estate. On the eastern flank is a wood with permitted rights of way. It used to be possible to walk to the end of the outcrop by walking on the sands to the west of Humphrey Head, but changes in the sands have rendered this difficult (although still possible in wellies) (2011). To the east of Humphrey Head is a marsh which forms part of Kents Bank. Humphrey Head is the traditional location for the killing of the last wolf in England, in about 1390. Folklore has it that the wolf descended the fells from near Coniston where it had caused havoc among the sheep flocks. After it attacked a child in Cark the country-folk chased it to the end of Humphrey Head where it was killed with pikes while hiding among the rocks. Below Humphrey Head there used to be house with a spring. The water was reputed to have therapeutic properties. Miners from Durham used to walk here just to take the water. All that is now left is a rusting lead pipe and a clear trickle of water. On the rock face lies a memorial to William Pedder who died in August 1857, it reads: \\"Beware how you on these rocks ascend Here William pedder met his end August 22nd 1857 Aged 10 years by permission\\". Humphrey Head is the subject of a chapter of Wainwright's book The Outlying Fells of Lakeland, although he says \\"Not by any exercise of the imagination can Humphrey Head be classed as an outlying fell of Lakeland\\" as although it is certainly \\"outlying\\", the summit is a mere and \\"a fell it is certainly not\\".

Biography The third of four sons of José Maria Bello (the son of Andrés Bello) and Ana Rosa Silva, Bello lived in Ancud, Chile as a child, due to his father's banishment after the 1891 Chilean Civil War. Disappearance In the pre-dawn hours of 9 March 1914, Lieutenant Bello was in the Lo Espejo aerodrome, where he was to take an examination to earn the designation Military Pilot. Bello and two companions had to complete the circuit from Lo Espejo to Culitrín, to Cartagena, and back to Lo Espejo, in the central region of Chile, in order to pass the exam. The total distance of the flight was 111 miles, and should have taken two hours to complete. Bello in his aircraft On the first attempt, the aviators had to return to base due to near-zero visibility caused by heavy fog. Bello damaged his aircraft during the landing, and switched to an Sánchez-Besa biplane (tail number 13, nicknamed \\"Manuel Rodríguez\\") for the second attempt. He took off together with one companion and the instructor, who had to make an emergency landing for refueling. Nevertheless, Bello continued his route and was lost among the clouds. At 09:30 hours, they undertook flight and an hour later Bello and Ponce, they were landed in Culitrín, where they agreed to wait for the conditions to continue their flight to Cartagena and then return to Lo Espejo. Bello and Ponce were in Culitrín waiting for the south wind to cease, a situation that occurred around 16:00 hours, times when they checked the engines of their planes and Bello at 4:45 p.m. and Ponce at 16:50 they en route to Cartagena. In his subsequent report on the performance of his test, Lieutenant Ponce says: \\"At 4.55 p.m. after a 10-minute test flight I departed about 5 minutes after Lieutenant Bello heading for Cartagena with a strong wind from the coast and a thick mist that prevented it from seeing clearly. Lieutenant Bello didn't miss a moment of sight, and at 6.20 p.m. about 20 or 30 kilometers to E. de Melipilla vi returning. I thought the clouds were too high, because we were shipping about 1900 meters away and I thought I'd do what I assumed Lieutenant Bello would do, go down to continue the road under the clouds. Lieutenant Bello was lost in sight and in the impossibility of continuing I went directly to the O. the wind blowing led me to very close to Angostura that I recognized for being very close to her.\\" At the school, Ponce claimed to have seen Lieutenant Bello flying in front of him, so he was presumed to have landed somewhere along the route, as information had also been received that he had landed in a camp near Llo-Lleo and was out of danger. However, the information was wrong. Search Search efforts were initiated the very day Bello disappeared. Several people claimed to have seen the aircraft land or crash, but these sightings were unsubstantiated. Various theories proposed at the time suggested that Bello had crashed into the sea or that the wrecked craft would be found in a mountain pass. Several expeditions were launched to locate a crash site, including one as recently as 1988, but no traces were found either of Lieutenant Bello or of the plane he was piloting. On 28 November 2007 an expedition set out for the commune of San Antonio, Chile. Two metal fragments belonging to an aircraft were found in the Cuncumén hills. Jaime González Colville, of the Chilean Academy of History, considered it very unlikely that the remains of Lieutenant Bello should be found near Cuncumén.Jaime González Colville, \\"Teniente Bello\\", El Mercurio, 6 December 2007, Maps section, page A-2.

He played the entire 2006 minor league season with the Rookie-Advanced Kingsport Mets, appearing in 36 games and batting .235 with one home run and 12 RBI. Thole was assigned to the Class-A Savannah Sand Gnats in 2007, and played in a career-high 117 games. While he did not hit a home run that season, he hit .267 with 36 RBI and walked more than he struck out, with 61 and 57 respectively. Thole was promoted to the Advanced-A St. Lucie Mets in 2008, where he was a mid-season and postseason All-Star. In 111 games that year, he would hit .300 with five home runs and 56 RBI. In the offseason, Thole played in 19 games for the Peoria Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League, where he was named a Rising Star, batting .319 with two home runs and 17 RBI. He was assigned to the Double-A Binghamton Mets to open the 2009 season, and hit .328 with one home run and 46 RBI in 103 games. He was named a mid-season All-Star for the second consecutive season, and established himself as a solid singles hitter. New York Mets After viewing Thole in the 2009 spring training, Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen \\"gushed\\" about Thole's catcher skills. In 2009, Thole stated, \\"My throwing is still coming along.\\" On August 31, 2009, Thole was called up to the major leagues. In his first major league at-bat, he singled to record his first major league hit. Thole would play 17 games for the Mets in 2009, batting .321 with 9 RBI. During the offseason, Thole played in 44 games for the Leones del Caracas of the Venezuelan Winter League, and hit .381 with three home runs and 28 RBI. After spending much of the 2010 season in Triple-A Buffalo, Thole was called up to the Mets in June. On July 20, 2010, Thole hit his first major league home run, a solo homer, off of Barry Enright in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field to give the Mets their first run of the game (3-1). They would lose that game 3-2. On October 1, 2010, he hit a walk-off home run off Tyler Clippard to give the Mets a 2-1 win. Thole spent the entire season with the New York Mets as a catcher. He hit .268, drove in 40 runs and hit three home runs over 340 at bats. Thole broke camp with the Mets as their starting catcher. On May 9, 2012, Thole was placed on the seven-day disabled list after suffering a concussion in a plate collision with Phillies first baseman Ty Wigginton on May 7. On June 1, 2012, Thole was reactivated and caught Johan Santana's no-hitter; becoming the first Mets catcher to participate in a no-hitter. Toronto Blue Jays Thole batting for the Mets in 2009. On December 17, 2012, the Mets traded Thole, R.A. Dickey, and Mike Nickeas to the Toronto Blue Jays for Travis d'Arnaud, Noah Syndergaard, John Buck, and Wuilmer Becerra. On January 18, 2013, the Blue Jays announced that arbitration with Thole had been avoided by signing him to a two-year contract worth $2.5 million, with a club option for the 2015 season at $1.75 million. On March 24, Thole was reassigned to minor league camp and started the season with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. He was recalled by the Blue Jays on June 7 when Henry Blanco was designated for assignment. Thole made his Blue Jays debut in the 16th inning of an 18 inning win against the Texas Rangers on June 8, going 0-2 at the plate. He finished the 2013 season batting just .175 with 1 home run and 8 RBI in 45 games. Thole began the 2014 season in Toronto, as R.A. Dickey's personal catcher. He improved upon his results from 2013, finishing 2014 with a batting average of .252 with 7 RBI in 56 games played. On November 1, the Blue Jays picked up Thole's $1.75 million option for the 2015 season. After the signing of Russell Martin in the offseason, the Blue Jays entered 2015 spring training with 3 catchers on their roster. Martin began catching R.A. Dickey early in camp, and supplanted Thole as his personal catcher. On March 31, Thole was assigned to Triple-A Buffalo. On April 23, Thole was recalled to the Blue Jays when Dioner Navarro was placed on the disabled list. He was optioned back to Buffalo on June 2. On August 23, Thole was recalled from Buffalo.

He hit his first home run of the season on April 5, in the Blue Jays 5–3 win over the Tampa Bay Rays. After the Blue Jays acquired Dioner Navarro from the Chicago White Sox on August 26, Thole's role with the team was brought into question. After catching Dickey's start on August 28, Thole was designated for assignment by Toronto, who hoped that he would go unclaimed off waivers and be released, and could be re-signed on September 1 after the Major League roster expansion. Thole elected free agency on August 30, and signed with the Blue Jays on August 31; thus maintaining his postseason eligibility. Thole played in 50 games for the Blue Jays in 2016, hitting .169 with one home run and seven RBI. On November 18, Thole cleared outright waivers and elected free agency.

The Hominy Indians were a professional American football team founded and financed by Otto and Ira Hamilton, from Hominy, Oklahoma. The team was an all Native American team, with players coming and going from twenty two different tribes. They were named State Champions in 1925. They played regionally and traveled across the country to games. On 26 December 1927. the Hominy Indians had a chance to play against the World Champions, New York Giants. The team played its last season in 1936. A docu-drama film titled \\"Playground of The Native Son\\" went into production in the winter of 2012 in Oklahoma, with a release date of 2013. The film is produced by Fully Funded Films owner, Celia Xavier and is to be co-directed by Michael P Nash and Celia Xavier. The Executive Producer was Celia Xavier, and the movie was starred in and narrated by Adam Beach. A subsequent feature film is in pre-production currently based on the Hominy Indians Football team.  History  In the early 1870s, one band of the Osage Tribe led by Blackdog were relocated by the U.S. Government from a reserve in northern Kansas to what is now Hominy, Oklahoma. This band of Osages became one of the five settlements of the Osage Nation. Hominy was located near a creek and was inhabited by extremely large natives, the majority of them taller than six foot and over 200 pounds.\\"They Might Be Giants.\\" This Land Press RSS. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Nov. 2013. The Hominy Indians were established in 1923 playing teams formed by American Legions of neighboring cities in Kansas and Oklahoma. They proved successful quickly but were always short on finances. In 1925, they were bankrolled by Dick Rusk, Harry Bigeagle, Allison Webb, and Ed LaBelle providing them with uniforms and travel expenses. They were a professional all-Indian American football team whose greatest accomplishment was defeating the National Football League champions, the New York Giants, in 1927.\\"HOMINY.\\" HOMINY. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, n.d. Web. 10 Nov. 2013.  The Team  Ira Hamilton was the leader of the football team, which was founded by a group of Osage men.They Might Be Giants According to “Hominy Indians,” the team was “all-Indian”, but was composed of teammates from many different tribes. They accomplished a 28-game winning streak during their time of play, which was ended by the Great Depression in 1932.\\"Hominy Indians.\\" Hominy Indians. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Nov. 2013. According to “Osage News,” The team was made of people from 14 different tribes but was mainly made up of players from the Haskell Institute, a famous Indian school. The Majority of the players were from the Osage tribe, because the base of the team was in Hominy, Oklahoma.\\"Filming Complete for Docudrama on Hominy Indians Team.\\" Osage News. Osage News, n.d. Web. 10 Nov. 2013.  Games/Season  Shoemaker stated, In the early years of the Hominy Indians team they played games against regional teams such as Coffeyville, Elk city, and Fredonia in Kansas; Avant, Bartlesville and Fairfax in Oklahoma, and Sarcoxie and Joplin in Missouri.Shoemaker, Arthur. Hail to the Real 'redskins' N.p.: The Coffin Corner: Vol.14, No.5, 1992. PDF. The Indians had a significant rivalry against another nearby Osage Football team located within the Osage Reservation, Fairfax. Like other members of the Osage Nation the Osages who lived in the settlement of Fairfax were wealthy due to oil revenue produced on Osage land. They loved the game of football and their wealth gave them the needed resources to start a \\"team\\". They lacked an organized club so in turn they would import local college players under assumed names to play in home games against the Hominy Indians. These local games pushed for the construction of a new stadium at the renowned Indian school in Lawrence, Kansas, the Haskell Institute.Shoemaker The Hominy Indians quickly rose to fame as they defeated other teams throughout the country. The Indians had never been defeated or even tied with another team as they entered into the biggest game of their existence against the champions of the National Football League, the New York Giants. One day after Christmas in 1927, three weeks after the Giants defeated the New York Rangers for their national title, the Giants traveled to Pawhuska, Oklahoma to face the dominating Indians. The Hominy Indians defeated the Giants by a score of 13–6 in front of what was said to be about 2,000 fans.Osage News  Finance  At the start of the teams’ career in 1923, the Indians were very successful. The only drawback the team faced was the lack of resources for traveling and equipment. This financial burden was short lived when in 1925, the team received sponsorship from four Hominy Osage members. Dick Rusk, Harry Bigeagle, Allison Webb, and Ed LaBelle gave much needed financial support that provided the team with uniform and travel expenses.They Might Be Giants  Salary  The salary for a Hominy Indian player rarely ever rose above $150 per game and there are many instances when it dropped below that average. At times, all proceeds from the games would go to ensure that the players were compensated.Shoemaker  Players  Hamilton, the founder of the Indians, resigned from his duties in order to take on the role of playing left guard for the team. Pete Big Horse, who towered over other players, played right guard for the team. Otto Hamilton, Ira's brother, played the center position. Bill Shadlow played a pivotal role on the front line.They Might Be Giants Legends say that the Hominy Indians team was made up of all- stars. One player, John Levi, was said to be able to drop kick the football, which is more round and heavier than today's standard football, through the goalposts from the 50 yard line. It is also said that he could make a 100-yard pass. Johnnie \\"Pepper\\" Martin proceeded to play baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals after his time with the Indians. Voted one of the best players in American History, Jim Thorpe was rumored to have played on the team for a couple of years.Osage News According to a magazine article titled “They might be the giants”, this rumor has proven to be false; he in fact never actually played for the Indians. Jim Thorpe did coach his own team called the Oorang Indians. Joe Pappio played for Thorpe's Oorang Indians for a short stint and then moved back to Hominy to play for the Indians. There are film records of Pappio hitting linemen so hard their helmets would fly off of their heads, allowing the teams’ running back to make huge gains.They Might Be Giants  Advertisement  The Great Depression struck in the 1930s and posed a need for more creative advertising of the games. When the Hominy team had a game far away they would dress in their traditional dancing clothes and have a \\"pow- wow\\" dance to promote the game. They could always get a big crowd with their drums, feathers, chants, and whoops.Shoemaker References Category:Defunct American football teams ","title":"Hominy Indians"},{"id":"24123955","text":"Andrés Anwandter (born 1974, in Valdivia, Chile) is a Chilean poet, known for his sound poetry.

Blanc co-wrote Britney Spears' top 40 single \\"Ooh La La.\\" Blanc has appeared on such television shows as American Horror Story: Hotel; she has also contributed writing for Vice.com, having written about a number of topics including ageism in the music industry and her experience with believing in a cult leader.

Their debut anthology short film, \\"Bleed,\\" went to Fantastic Fest and a number of other genre film festivals, also winning the Director's Award for Cinematic Achievement in a Short Film at FilmQuest. History Blanc was born in Bavaria, Germany and raised primarily on a farm in Fremont, Michigan. Brought up Mormon by a Greek-American father who was in the CIA and a motivational speaker mother, she spent much of her childhood writing songs and performing as a ventriloquist and auctioneer with her mother and brother, who performed magic and escape art. When Blanc was a pre-teen, her mother was targeted by a religious impostor posing as a true LDS prophet who played on her beliefs and lured her into his web. Blanc found their letters and believed in him too; she was temporarily separated from her mother, who was coerced into human trafficking until an accomplice who had a change of heart saved her. They were promptly reunited. Eventually Lola moved to Los Angeles, where she now resides, to pursue music full-time. Music and career Lola Blanc has written songs alongside producers and songwriters such as Sophie, Ammo, Fernando Garibay, Jimmy Harry, Jon Levine, and more. Blanc originally co-wrote Britney Spears' single Ooh La La with Fransisca Hall and producer Ammo for her own project; the title was intended to be a play on her name. When Dr. Luke heard it, he thought it'd be perfect for Spears and brought in songwriters Bonnie McKee and J. Kash to rewrite the lyrics so they would better suit Spears and The Smurfs 2. Acting Blanc has made appearances on television shows such as American Horror Story: Hotel and Life in Pieces on CBS; she has also acted in several indie features and shorts.

He was discharged and accepted an appointment as Aviation Cadet on 5 September 1939. After preliminary flight training at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base, Floyd Bennett Field, Brooklyn, New York, he was assigned advanced training at Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida. After flight school, Raven was assigned to a patrol squadron in the Pacific, where he served during World War II. On 25 June 1942, while returning from a combat mission in the Aleutian Islands and flying over Japanese- controlled waters, Raven sighted the U.S. Navy submarine USS S-27 (SS-132), which had run aground on Amchitka Island. Disregarding the danger to his life, Raven skillfully and coolly landed in a rough sea, embarked 13 of the submarines crew, and took off, all without damage to his plane. He safely returned them to Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. All of the men of S-27 were later rescued due to the information on their whereabouts provided by Raven. During the Aleutian Islands campaign, Raven conducted dangerous reconnaissance and bombing runs against Japanese-occupied Kiska Island until he was lost at sea while on a mission on 9 August 1942. Awards For the S-27 incident, Raven was awarded the Air Medal for meritorious achievement and extreme courage while effecting a rescue at sea. Posthumously, he also received the Distinguished Flying Cross for action against enemy forces during the Aleutian Islands campaign. Namesake The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Julius A. Raven (DE-600) was named for Lieutenant, junior grade, Raven. She was converted during construction into the high-speed transport USS Julius A. Raven (APD-110), and was in commission as such from 1945 to 1946.

It was built on a former slag heap in what was the Ironmasters district and represents, without any irony, the iron and steel industry that used to exist on the site and in the area. The park has its own small car park and has become something of a nature reserve. The route of the Teesdale Way passes through the park.  Sculptures  'Teessaurus' - a painted steel sculpture of a triceratops and one of two infants. The park was started as a result of entering an Art to Landscape competition organised by the Sunday Times and the Arts Council. Middlesbrough Council had commissioned a life size painted steel sculpture of a triceratops called Teessaurus from Genevieve Glatt that was fabricated by Harts of Stockton at a total cost of £16,000 and installed on a mound at the northern end of the park. The park was opened with this sculpture in 1979 and two infant triceratops were added later. From 1987 onwards, a life size brachiosaurus, brontosaurus, mammoth, stegosaurus and tyrannosaurus sculptures were added at the sides of the park. These sculptures were built by workers on the government Youth and Employment Training Scheme at Amarc Training and Safety.

She was officially declared the victim of a miscarriage of justice in December 2005. The wrongful conviction was based on false allegations by two women in their 20s, Regina Walsh (born 8 January 1978) and Patricia Phelan (born 1973). Walsh had a psychiatric history and Phelan had a history of making false allegations of rape prior to the event. Phelan subsequently admitted to having lied. Wall was the first woman in the history of the Irish State to be convicted of rape, the first person to receive a life sentence for rape and the only person in the history of the state to be convicted on repressed memory evidence. Her co-accused Pablo McCabe was a homeless schizophrenic man. In relation to one of the two rape allegations, the defence showed that McCabe could not possibly have been there on the date in question. The jury acquitted McCabe on that count, and convicted him and Wall on the second rape charge. On 1 December 2005, the Court of Criminal Appeal certified that Wall had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice. McCabe had died in December 2002. The events took place following the airing of the documentary, States of Fear. A 2005 editorial in The Irish Times suggested that the programme influenced jury members and may have played a role in the miscarriage of justice against Nora Wall.\\"Nora Wall case\\" . Alliance Support Group. 19 December 2005. Biography - Nora Wall Wall was born in 1948 into a large, well-to-do farming family in the Nire Valley area of county Waterford. She joined the Sisters of Mercy in 1967, taking the name Sister Dominic. She joined St. Michael's residential childcare centre in Cappoquin, County Waterford in 1975. It had been St Michael's industrial school but this was phased out at the end on the 1970s. Two, family style houses were built to house the children in the state's care there. She became the manager of this new St. Michael's in 1978. The children at St. Michael's came from nearby counties Waterford and Tipperary. They were from troubled families who could not cope and there were often several members of one family in the home at the same time.\\"Final conversion from monster to martyr\\", by Ann Marie Hourihan, Sunday Tribune, 1 Feb 2004 http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2004/feb/01/final-conversion-from- monster-to-martyr/ Biography - Pablo (Paul) McCabe Pablo McCabe was also a local and almost the same age as Nora Wall. McCabe was handed over to St. Michael's industrial school in 1951 when he was a baby. In 1988, McCabe addressed a gathering of the Sisters of Mercy in Gracedieu, Waterford. He spoke of being born in Dublin in 1949 to a single mother. She struggled until McCabe was three, but \\"had great difficulty in working, paying for accommodation and paying someone to look after me.\\" Thus McCabe came to live in the \\"old St. Michael’s\\", the junior industrial school run by the Sisters of Mercy in Cappoquin. His memories were \\"very happy ones of caring and interested women.\\" He then went to the Industrial School at Artane, Dublin, which he found traumatic, because it had \\"over nine hundred boys in a very strict set-up.\\" After leaving Artane, he began to drift and became involved with drugs, stealing to support his habit, and spent time in South America. He returned to Ireland in 1977, receiving treatment at St. Brendan's Hospital, though alcohol abuse remained a problem. In 1980, he came to Cappoquin again. He stated, \\"Cappoquin is my home. In Dublin I am homeless.\\" The old institution where he had been reared had been replaced with the group homes, where he first met Wall. He hoped to find information about his mother, but none existed. In 1986 his mother wrote, hoping to find him. Wall facilitated a reunion, and McCabe and his mother spent three days together in Cappoquin. She had married in England and had four more sons, but had never told her new family of Pablo’s existence.\\"Miscarriage of Justice: Paul McCabe and Nora Wall\\" by Breda O'Brien, Winter 2006 edition of 'Studies' quarterly review - Rape accusation, conviction, and appeal Charges Wall left St. Michael's in 1990, and left the congregation of the Sisters of Mercy in 1994. In 1996, she worked in a St. Vincent de Paul shelter for homeless men. In October 1996, she was arrested in Dublin and questioned about allegations made by Regina Walsh, whom she had cared for from the age of eight. Walsh alleged that McCabe had raped her, while Wall held her legs, on the occasion of her twelfth birthday on 8 January 1990. She also claimed that Wall had sexually abused her on numerous occasions. Wall was not questioned then or subsequently on a second allegation: that she had assisted McCabe in raping Walsh in a virtually identical way two years previously. This latter charge, on which neither she nor McCabe was questioned, was the one on which they would subsequently be found guilty. Wall maintained her innocence and was released without charge. She finished her contract with the St. Vincent de Paul and, after some time, got work with Sir Patrick Dunn’s Hospital, which she was forced to leave after the Gardaí informed the hospital she should not be working with people. In May 1997 she was formally charged. She had to sign on at a Garda station twice a day and lived on social welfare. Arrest and trial McCabe was arrested on the same day in October 1996. Gardaí, who interviewed at the trial, admitted to making no notes, and, under pressure of questioning from defence counsel, also admitted that McCabe did not dictate a statement as they originally suggested, but responded to questions. This is in breach of regulations, which allow only minor clarifying questions during the taking of statements. McCabe had signed two statements that were strange in the way they were formulated. For example, part of the first statement says, \\"I told Sr. Dominic what had happened the night before in Regina’s room. I told her I had intimate relationships with her, meaning Regina. She said to me I was like St. Augustine.\\" At the trial a Garda claimed that he did not know that McCabe suffered from schizophrenia, and said that he didn’t see what difference knowing whether he did or not would have made. McCabe made a further statement, concerning the night of Regina Walsh's 12th birthday party on 8 January 1990. The alleged rape on 8 January 1990 was the only charge on which McCabe was questioned. Like Nora Wall, he was never questioned on the second allegation that he had also raped Regina Walsh two years previously in 1987 or 1988, again with Wall present. In fact, neither McCabe’s nor Wall’s defence teams received notification of this second charge until 28 May 1999, only six days before hearings began, and two years after they were initially charged. After he was released after questioning, it emerged that it would have been impossible for McCabe to have been in Cappoquin on 8 January. He was living in a Dublin hostel from 7 January and his movements were fully recorded until he was committed to Mountjoy prison on 10 January. The Gardaí then returned to Regina Walsh and put it to her that McCabe could not have been in Cappoquin on 8 January. On 5 November 1996, she \\"corrected\\" her statement to state that it was not the day of her 12th birthday, but of the celebration of her 12th birthday some days before or after that date, that the alleged assault took place. At the trial, witnesses were produced to show that there was no man present at the birthday party.Breda O'Brien (2006), \\"Miscarriage of Justice: Paul McCabe and Nora Wall\\" , Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, Issue 380, vol.95, Winter 2006. Conviction On 11 June 1999 an RTÉ television news announcer stated that on the previous day > A 51-year-old former Sister of Mercy, has been found guilty of raping a > 10-year-old girl. Nora Wall, originally from the Nire Valley, had been the > victim's guardian while the child was in care at St. Michael's Centre in > Cappoquin in County Waterford. Nora Wall's co-accused, Paul McCabe, a > homeless man, was also found guilty of rape. Both have been remanded on > bail, for sentencing in July. The victim was placed in care in St. Michael's > when she was 6 years of age. When she was ten, she was raped by Paul McCabe, > a homeless man who visited Nora Wall at St. Michael's. The victim told the > jury that the nun held her legs while the man raped her. Both Paul McCabe > and Nora Wall denied the charges. The pair were acquitted of a second count > of raping the same child in 1990. The jury had heard conflicting evidence > surrounding the dates of the alleged offence. The second major charge against the two accused was that they had raped Regina Walsh in on 8 January 1990 on the girl's 12th birthday. The outcome was that the jury found the two accused innocent on that rape charge but convicted them on the other—the alleged rape that took place at least two years prior to the birthday party.Because of the non-guilty verdict, this allegation was not considered in the judgement of the Court of Criminal Appeal in December 2005. Press reaction After the conviction the media used vicious language about Wall in particular - \\"Vile Nun\\", \\"Pervert Nun\\", \\"Mercy Devil\\", \\"I was Raped by Anti-Christ\\".A programme about her on RTÉ's Would You Believe (TV series) series on 11 January 2000, gave a glimpse of some of the newspaper headlines On 11 July 1999, the Sunday World carried a front page \\"exclusive\\" by crime correspondent Paul Williams. Entitled \\"Rape Nuns Abuse Pact with Smyth\\", it claimed that > Evil nun Nora Wall, convicted for helping to rape a ten-year-old child, also > secretly provided children for sick paedophile priest Father Brendan Smyth. > The Sunday World has learned that depraved cleric regularly visited St. > Michael's Childcare Centre in County Waterford where Wall – then known as > Sister Dominic – was working.

Moreover, The Star published the names of Walsh and her \\"witness\\" Patricia Phelan for the first time. A Kilkenny businessman read the newspaper and recognised Phelan as the woman who had made a false rape allegation against him, and the defence came into possession of this evidence. Sentenced On 23 July 1999 Wall and McCabe came before Judge Paul Carney for sentencing in the Central Criminal Court. Their counsel, Hugh Hartnett, sought an adjournment or a stay on any sentence. He told the court that there appeared to have been a grave breach of non-disclosure of evidence by the state. The state had not disclosed that Walsh alleged she had been raped in London. Neither had they disclosed that Phelan's allegations against an unnamed man had been dismissed in judicial review proceedings. However Mr. Denis Vaughan Buckley for the state said that the Gardaí were not aware of these matters during their investigations, and rejected the claim that there had not been full disclosure of evidence, saying that these issues were not relevant to the case. Passing sentence, the judge spoke of Wall's betrayal of the young girl. \\"This was a gang rape,\\" he said. \\"The leader of the gang was the only person in the world who was charged with the protection of Regina Walsh. I don't think I need to say more than that.\\" He sentenced her to life imprisonment and McCabe to 12 years. The hearing was not held in camera, as he said that Walsh and Phelan had forfeited their anonymity through newspaper interviews published since the trial. Nora Wall was the first woman convicted of rape in the history of the state and now became the first person to receive a life sentence for that crime. The director of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Olive Braiden, welcomed the imposition of a maximum sentence, and said it would ensure that Nora Wall would be monitored for the rest of her life to prevent recurrence.Irish Independent, 24 July 1999, http://www.independent.ie/national-news/life-for- the-nun-who-raped-a-child-403560.html#Scene_1 Convictions quashed Four days later on 27 July 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the convictions of the two accused. Both were granted bail and it was stated that the question of a possible re-trial would be considered subsequently. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) applied to have the previous week's convictions set aside, telling the court that one witness had been called to give evidence at the trial inadvertently, despite a decision of the DPP that this person should not be called. The Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions also referred to two other additional though less central factors in the case. The first was the information that the alleged victim had made but not pursued an allegation of being raped in England. He said that whatever the significance of this information it could not be properly argued that it was not relevant. He said that the prosecution was not aware of this information until it was mentioned in court. There was also another as yet undisclosed factor relating to the alleged victim which might be considered relevant.RTÉ News, 27 July 1999 \\"Former rape nun's conviction quashed, http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0727/nun.html Reaction of Kevin Myers, July 1999 On Saturday 31 July, the Irish Times published an article by writer and journalist Kevin Myers. He was one of the very few to speak out in favour of Wall and McCabe at the time. He originally wrote a column on Monday 26 July to be published on Wednesday but it was withdrawn because what he sought to achieve was already happening – the release of the two accused. He described the trial as a \\"witch-hunt\\": > We should always beware the deeds of good men and women when there is a > public war against vice of any kind. The \\"witches\\" of Salem were not > persecuted by bad men or women; people then genuinely lived in fear of > witchcraft, just as they did of communism in the 1950s. In the witch-hunt to > remove it from public life in the US, innocent people's lives were ruined, > yet through often honourable motives (apart from those of Joe McCarthy).Nora > Wall And Kevin Myers  Reaction of Sisters of Mercy  After their conviction, the Sisters of Mercy issued a statement, which read: > We are all devastated by the revolting crimes which resulted in these > verdicts. Our hearts go out to this young woman who, as a child, was placed > in our care. Her courage in coming forward was heroic. We beg anyone who was > abused whilst in our care to go to the Gardaí. Even after the collapse of the case against the two accused, the Sisters of Mercy made no effort to apologise to Wall or to withdraw their statement of support for Walsh. One commentatoreditor of the website www.inquisition21.com which campaigns against false allegations of child abuse remarked: \\"The young woman their hearts were going out to, was the false accuser, not their own innocent nun. Our absolutist system had seduced them into identifying with the accuser and betraying their own sister.\\" Court of Criminal Appeal Four months later, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr James Hamilton, decided to seek a retrial in the case. In mid-November he released to the media a detailed six-page report dated 1 October, addressed to the attorney general, Michael McDowell, SC, which gave an account of the mistakes, failures and omissions in the offices of the DPP and Chief State Solicitor and in the conduct of the case, which resulted in a witness for the prosecution being called against the wishes of the DPP. A DPP had never previously explained himself in a specific case in the office's 25-year history. However the attorney general declared that neither Wall nor McCabe would receive an apology, saying that the issue of an apology did not arise because the convictions had been quashed.Irish Examiner, 18 Nov 1999, \\"Family of former nun want 'travesty of justice' fully investigated\\" At the Court of Criminal Appeal on 22 November 1999, the DPP accepted \\"fully and ungrudgingly\\" that former nun Wall and McCabe are entitled to be presumed innocent of all charges brought against them. At the court hearing a lawyer for the DPP said he \\"very much regrets the errors which occurred in relation to the handling of this case by the prosecution\\" which led to the successful appeal. The DPP's statement outlined the sequence of events from the decision to prosecute on 24 April 1997 up to their release by the Court of Criminal Appeal, initially on bail, in July just days after they had been sentenced to life and 12 years respectively. It explained how the prosecution came to call Patricia Phelan as witness, despite an earlier direction by the DPP made in April 1997 that she should not be called. Denis Vaughan Buckley SC, for the DPP, read a prepared statement. He said the DPP had considered the transcript of evidence that was given at the trial together with additional information obtained by the Gardaí and had concluded that it would not be proper to proceed with his application for a retrial. He added: > I am instructed to emphasise that the director's concern to defend the > propriety of the decision to charge the two accused does not in any sense > detract from the fact, which is fully and ungrudgingly accepted by the > director, that the two accused are entitled to be presumed innocent of all > the charges which were brought, not only those of which they were acquitted > by the jury but also of those which were set aside and which are not to be > the subject of further proceedings. Presiding judge Mr Justice Murray sitting with Mr Justice Smyth and Mr Justice Kelly said the court would confirm the setting aside of the convictions, with no order for a retrial. The judges confirmed that neither Wall nor McCabe would have to pay the costs of their lengthy proceedings which could total around £60,000.Irish Independent 23 November 1999, \\"Botched rape case nun is innocent says DPP\\" http://www.independent.ie/national-news/botched-rape-case- nun-is-innocent-says-dpp-391400.html At the end of the court hearing, Wall pushed her way through the throng of reporters and family to catch up with Buckley, the prosecuting barrister. She extended her hand to the man who had presented the state's flawed case against her and said \\"thank you for what had just happened in court.\\" According to Irish Independent journalist Aideen Sheehan, Buckley shook hands, looking taken aback at the unexpected gesture, so rare coming from the opposing side after such a serious criminal trial.Irish Independent, 23 Nov 1999, \\"Nora Wall departs with a remarkable lack of bitterness\\" On 1 December 2005 the Court of Criminal Appeal finally certified that Wall had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice. Aftermath  Nora Wall  After her acquittal Nora Wall was asked by journalist Kevin Moore what she planned to do with the rest of her life: > Well, I suppose to be practical and realistic people at my age are taking > early retirement and being made redundant. And you know, what employer wants > a person like me? They will ask what you have done for the last three years. > I signed on twice a day at the garda station, had 32 court appearances, had > a six-day trial in the Central Criminal Court, four days of a life sentence > in the Joy, you know, what employer wants that? Wall described how she felt after she was arrested: > I could not understand what they were saying to me at first. When they said > \\"rape\\", I said that I was never raped.

Nora Wall currently lives in a private apartment on the grounds of Cuan Mhuire (a narcotic and alcohol rehabilitation centre) just outside the town of Athy in Co. Kildare.  Pablo McCabe  Although there were two persons accused of rape, the media focused almost exclusively on Nora Wall. An exception is the detailed account of the case by Breda O'Brien in Studies Review entitled: \\"Miscarriage of Justice: Paul McCabe and Nora Wall\\". She quotes the words of Linda Loman in Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman', about her husband Wille Loman enduring humiliation at the end of his career; > \\"I don't say he's a great man... His name was never in the paper. He's not > the finest character that ever lived. But he's a human being, and a terrible > thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid.

Attention, attention must finally be > paid to such a person.\\" After his release from prison in July 1999 Pablo McCabe lived in Oak House, a hostel for homeless men in the inner city of Dublin and over the next three years lived the typical life of the homeless. Short on cash he would get drunk now and then and try to bully other men to bring alcohol into the rooms which was forbidden. At those times he would become belligerent and offensive. His physique had been broken down over the years by alcohol and poor diet and was further weakened by a stroke. When speaking to men in the hostel and nearby day centre, he always maintained his innocence of the rape, but said that the mud had stuck. His mother wrote to him from England but he did not reply to her letters. He had four stepbrothers in Liverpool but made no attempt to contact them. In November 2002 he had a seizure in the hostel and was rushed to the Mater Hospital where six weeks later after a number of other collapses he died, a few days before Christmas. His mother Helen and stepfather were informed but because of illness could not travel immediately. His remains were kept in the mortuary of the Mater until the family could travel. His mother and his stepfather attended the funeral in the Franciscan Church in Merchant's Quay, Dublin, on 14 January 2003.'Pablo' may now find peace in anonymity\\", article by Michael Sheridan in Sunday Independent 19 January 2003 http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/pablo-may-now-find-peace--in- anonymity-487947.html Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 December 2005 On 16 December 2005 the three judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal gave detailed reasons for their decision. They began by providing a summary of the legal background as follows (minor editorial changes have been made for the purpose of clarity): > On 10 June 1999, Nora Wall was convicted by the Central Criminal Court of > rape contrary to common law and of indecent assault contrary to common law > as punishable by s.10 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981. On 23 July 1999, > she was sentenced by the Central Criminal Court to imprisonment for life for > the offence of rape and to 5 years imprisonment for indecent assault. > On 27 July 1999, Nora Wall brought a bail application before the Court of > Criminal Appeal, at which point senior counsel on behalf of the Director of > Public Prosecutions (DPP) conveyed to that court the DPPs consent to the > granting of leave to appeal, and further consented that the appeal be > allowed and that a retrial be directed. This startling turn of events was > referable to (a) the inadvertent calling as a witness on behalf of the > prosecution, Patricia Phelan, a person whom the DPP had specifically > directed should not be so called at the trial and (b) matters regarding the > complainant, Regina Walsh, which had not been disclosed to the lawyers > representing the applicant prior to trial. > On 22 November 1999, counsel for the DPP indicated to the court of criminal > appeal that the DPP was not proceeding with an application for a retrial. > Counsel further indicated that the DPP “fully and ungrudgingly” accepted > that the applicant was entitled to be presumed innocent of all charges > preferred against her. The court accordingly quashed the conviction of Nora > Wall and the sentences imposed in respect thereof. In the main body of the judgement, the three judges went on to find that, due to the withholding of important information by the prosecution, including the investigating police, at the trial stage, it was not until appeal that the court heard a substantial body of significant evidence that had not been disclosed to the defence. Concerning the complainant, Regina Walsh, the evidence that had not been disclosed to the defence included that she: # had been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness and admitted to a psychiatric hospital and undergone treatment; # had a recollection of events that arose as the result of \\"flashbacks\\" and had no full memory or recall of those events; # had previously made a false allegation that she was raped; and # had previously falsely alleged that she had been assaulted. Concerning the witness Phelan, the prosecution had failed to disclose that: # prior to the trial, a direction had been made that she not be called as a witness as she was regarded as being unreliable; # she had made allegations against her late uncle and another man over an alleged rape, and that the High Court had made findings adverse to her credibility and reliability; # the police officer who had taken her statement in respect of the complainant was the same police officer who investigated the earlier false complaints made by her against her uncle and against the other man; # the DPP and the Chief State Solicitor had the carriage of the proceedings in the High Court in which the adverse findings against her had been made; # subsequent to the conviction and sentence of Nora Wall, Phelan disclosed to another nun, Sister Mona Kileen, that she had lied in her statement and that she had given false evidence against the applicant; # there was a strong risk of collusion between Phelan and the complainant Walsh. The judges noted that in her further statement of 2 April 2001, Phelan in part stated: > In the trial, held at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin, I gave evidence > on oath in the complaint against Nora Wall and Paul McCabe. In evidence, I > told the judge and jury that I saw Paul McCabe rape Regina and that Nora > Wall was present holding Regina's legs down. I gave other evidence but I > cannot remember what. At the time I gave this evidence in court, I knew it > was wrong and against the law but I just wanted to get back at Dominic (i.e. > Nora Wall). I was also afraid to pull back on my evidence because I thought > that once I had made a statement I had to give evidence in court. The reason > why I wanted to get back at Dominic was because she used to physically beat > me when I was living the Group Homes. She gave me a terrible life and I > hated her. I remember ringing Sr. Mona Kilkeen. She was a good friend of > mine for many years. It was during the trial, but I cannot remember much of > the details. The Court of Criminal Appeal found that a miscarriage of justice had occurred, and that there had been a serious breakdown in communications between the offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor, the Garda Síochána (police) and prosecuting counsel. The court made particular reference to a file note contained within the file of the DPP which was in the following terms: ;Evidence of Patricia Phelan > Local Gardaí who have dealings with her during previous investigations have > found her most unreliable.

According to Irish Independent journalist Ann O'Loughlin \\"Immediately after the court's decision, Ms Wall, with her hand outstretched, approached Ms Phelan. A tearful Ms Phelan threw her arms around Ms Wall and hugged her.\\"Irish Independent, 2 December 2005, \\"Conviction of nun for rape a miscarriage of justice\\" Criticism of the handling of the case Mr Justice Paul Carney Short-lived criticism of the judge centered not so much on his description of Nora Wall as a \\"gang rapist\\" but on the sentence of life imprisonment he imposed on her. University College Galway law lecturer Tom O'Malley said that the life sentence was completely unexpected as past cases of serial and serious child sex abuse had attracted sentences of between eight and 12 years.Irish Independent, 1 Aug 1999, \\"Ex-nun caught on a legal see-saw\\" After the Nora Wall case however, Mr Justice Carney struck some rather different notes. In 1999, Carney told a seminar in South Africa that some alleged victims of rape might be pressured into continuing with complaints they were reluctant to pursue. \\"Such pressure could come from parents, boyfriends, policemen, prosecutors, rape crisis centres and victim support counsellors,\\" he said. \\"I have no way of knowing whether such pressure exists, but I would be very concerned if it does, particularly in relation to those cases which can be profiled as unlikely to result in a conviction.\\" In April 2003, at a Women Lawyers' Association conference, Carney dismissed the claim of the director of the Rape Crisis Centre (RCC) that there was no such thing as a false sexual charge. \\"This is not the experience of the courts,\\" he said. \\"In relation to the balance of rape cases which are contested, there is a majority of acquittals.\\" The judge also criticised an RCC counsellor for suggesting in a victim impact statement that the severity of sentence imposed on a rapist would determine the degree to which the victim became \\"reconciled with the justice system\\". Carney said it was a \\"serious abuse of process\\" for the author of a victim impact report to use it to campaign for a heavy sentence. The former director of the Rape Crisis Centre, Olive Braiden, clashed with Carney at the conference. \\"He launched into a criticism of a senior counsel who was not present, and I said I regretted that he had raised the matter in her absence,\\" she said. The above examples are taken from a detailed profile of Mr Justice Paul Carney in The Sunday Business Post on 13 April 2003, written by barrister and author Kieron Wood. The article is entitled \\"Judge With One Eye On The Media\\". It includes some critical comments and notes that \\"His time on the bench was marked by controversy\\". Nevertheless, it contains no reference to the case of Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe.Judge with one eye on the media The Post  The DPP  On 6 September 1999, the Irish Independent reported the views of the Dáil (Irish parliament) opposition party Justice spokesman Jim Higgins: > The Director of Public Prosecutions faced a barrage of criticism for its > handling of the high profile case. Fine Gael's justice spokesman Jim Higgins > said it was dealt with sloppily the prosecution pursued the case \\"with > vigour and determination\\" but on the day after the convictions the DPP moved > to have them quashed. \\"There are two issues here,\\" said Mr Higgins. \\"The > first is how a witness could have been called to give evidence against the > expressed wishes of the DPP. The other is the non-disclosure of evidence. It > is common law principle that all material in possession of the prosecution > must be handed over to the defence, even if it is damaging to the > prosecution's case. We have to investigate whether that evidence was > withheld deliberately or inadvertently.\\" The issue of non-disclosure of evidence in the Nora Wall case was not followed up in Ireland but did attract some attention abroad. The Journal of the Law Society of New South Wales (Australia) for June 2006 has an article by solicitor Greg Walsh entitled \\"Criminal Law: Obligation is on prosecutors to disclose\\". This includes a detailed discussion on the Nora Wall case.This section of the article can be found on the Alliance Support website at However, there seems to be no equivalent article in the journal of the Irish Law Society.  The Gardaí and the Chief State Solicitor's Office  On 21 November 1999, Liz Allen, crime correspondent for the Sunday Independent, wrote that the Chief State Solicitor's Office which dealt with the Nora Wall case also dealt with a previous case involving a sexual assault allegation by Patricia Phelan, the woman who was later mistakenly called as a witness against Nora Wall. In the Patricia Phelan case in 1997 (in which she accused the Kilkenny businessman), Mr Justice McCracken carried out a High Court judicial review and decided that there should not be a trial. The state asked for time to consider whether it would appeal this decision, but three weeks later, the then DPP, Eamon Barnes, ordered the Chief State Solicitor's Office to return to court to say it did not wish to proceed any further with the case it was taking on behalf of Patricia Phelan and another woman. The Sunday Independent obtained documentation dated May 1997, which shows that the Chief State Solicitor's Office wrote to the solicitor for the Kilkenny businessman in the case taken on behalf of Ms Phelan, providing a list of witnesses who had made statements which the state intended to use in its case. This list included the name of Nora Wall. When details of the DPP's report on the blunders in the Nora Wall case were released by the Attorney General's office on 17 November 1999, there were no references to the documentation linking the Chief State Solicitor's Office to both cases. The report failed to explain why the DPP did not want Ms Phelan called as a witness. The DPP's statement said only that she was mistakenly called because prosecuting counsel \\"failed to recall\\" an earlier direction not to call her. In his decision in the judicial review of the original Phelan case on 5 January 1997, Mr Justice McCracken said: \\"While I have great sympathy for [the two women], I have to say that I was not particularly impressed with their evidence.\\" He added, however, that this was \\"not a deciding factor\\" in his decision to prevent the DPP from taking the man to trial. Liz Allen quoted Fine Gael's justice spokesman, Jim Higgins, as stating that the establishment of this link between the case originally taken by Ms Phelan and the Wall case merited a judicial inquiry \\"to investigate the role of Gardaí and the Chief State Solicitor's Office.\\" Higgins continued: \\"There now has to be a full inquiry into the roles of all of the agencies involved, the role of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, the DPP's Office and the Gardaí must be investigated further. We must question the ability of these people to conduct their jobs when such gross incompetence occurred in the Wall case with regard to the inadvertent calling of Ms Phelan as a witness.\\" Indeed, the close links that existed between personnel involved in the case against Nora Wall and that against the Kilkenny businessman - both involving Patricia Phelan - makes it difficult to understand how Phelan could have been called in error as a witness in the Wall case. The December 2005 judgement of the Court of Criminal Appeal underlined these links when the judges pointed out that \\"the police officer who had taken Phelan's statement in respect of Nora Wall was the same police officer who investigated the earlier false complaints made by her against her uncle and against the Kilkenny man.\\" However Jim Higgins's calls for an inquiry were ignored and this issue was quickly dropped by the media. Summary The case of Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe established a number of extraordinary precedents in Irish law. # Nora Wall was the first woman in the history of the State to be convicted of rape; # She was the first person in Ireland to receive a life sentence for rape;\\"Legal experts are baffled by the severity of the sentence given to the former nun. During the trial it was alleged Nora Wall held a 10-year-old girl while Paul McCabe raped her, yet for all the horror of the evidence, little precedent existed for the scale of the sentences. Nora Wall was given a life term, while her co-accused was given a 12-year sentence. Past cases of serial and serious child sex abuse have attracted sentences between eight and 12 years. UCG law lecturer Tom O'Malley says the life sentence was completely unexpected.\\" - Irish Independent', 1 Aug 1999, Ex-nun caught on a legal see-saw # It was the only case in the history of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that a witness was called contrary to the instructions of the DPP;\\"The DPP's letter says that it is the first time in 25 years that this type of error has occurred.\\" - RTÉ News, 17 November 1999, DPP decides against retrial in Wall-McCabe case'' # Regina Walsh said she had recalled the rapes after experiencing \\"flashbacks\\". This seems to be the only occasion a conviction was obtained on repressed memory evidence in Ireland. (However in the USA \\"repressed memory syndrome\\" has a long and contentious history).Extract from the judgement of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 16 December 2005 \\"It seems to this court that the applicant was further prejudiced during the course of her trial by evidence of which the defence had no prior notification, namely, that Regina Walsh recalled the alleged episodes of rape by reference to 'flashbacks and/or retrieved memory'. There was no scientific evidence of any sort adduced to explain the phenomenon of 'flashbacks' and/or 'retrieved memory', nor was the applicant in any position to meet such a case in the absence of prior notification thereof.\\" - British and Irish Legal Information Institute, D.P.P.-v- Nora Wall [2005] IECCA 140 (16 December 2005) Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe were convicted on 10 June 1999; Regina Walsh gave her famous interview to The Star on 17 June including her allegation about being raped in London; the Kilkenny businessman recognised the name of Patricia Phelan and contacted the defence but still the DPP remained in ignorance of the facts. At the sentencing hearing on 23 July the DPP refused the defence's application for an adjournment and denied that the newly discovered evidence was relevant. Finally Judge Paul Carney made his comments about Nora Wall and gave her an unprecedented sentence of life imprisonment.  Explanations for miscarriage of justice  Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe were originally accused in 1996 shortly after the broadcast by RTÉ of the TV documentary \\"Dear Daughter\\" in February of that year; they were convicted in June 1999 one month after RTÉ's broadcast of the States of Fear series produced by Mary Raftery. It is widely acknowledged that Nora Wall was convicted because of the atmosphere generated by the States of Fear series (see States of Fear subsection below). It is also accepted – not least by Mary Raftery herself – that \\"Dear Daughter\\" was an important predecessor to States of Fear. In the book Suffer the Little Children published in November 1999 as a follow up to her TV series, Mary Raftery and her co-author Eoin O'Sullivan wrote: > Dear Daughter concerned the experiences at Goldenbridge Industrial School, > Dublin, of Christine Buckley, who grew up there during the 1950s. She had > suffered horrific abuse, and descriptions were also given of the systematic > ill-treatment of other children by the Sisters of Mercy, who ran the school. > These included memories of children being routinely and savagely beaten, > having boiling water poured over them, being locked in a furnace room, being > forced to stand all night in a corridor as punishment, and very young > children being made to sit on potties so long that in some cases their > rectums collapsed. The authors go on to say that \\"the programme produced an enormous response, most of it horrified at the deeply shocking nature of the abuse outlined,\\" However they also acknowledge that the Sisters of Mercy had their defenders and that after the programme two sisters who were at Goldenbridge gave different accounts of one alleged episode. However they conclude that: \\"Three years later, the testimony of severe abuse in industrial schools is now so overwhelmingly consistent, that the 'false memory' line of argument has not been repeated in relation to the flood of accounts of abuse during 1999.\\"Mary Raftery and Eoin O. Sullivan, Suffer the Little Children: The Inside Story of Ireland’s Industrial Schools, New Island, Dublin, 1999, p. 240/41 Thus Mary Raftery believes that any apparent contradictions brought to light in the controversy that followed \\"Dear Daughter\\" were fully ironed out by the States of Fear programmes.  \\"Dear Daughter\\"  In February 1996 RTÉ broadcast \\"Dear Daughter\\" – Louis Lentin's TV documentary about alleged abuse in St Vincent’s residential school, Goldenbridge, Dublin, which was run by the Sisters of Mercy. It featured the story of Christine Buckley who had been there in the 1950s. The documentary concentrated on allegations made against one Mercy nun Sister Xavieria. The programme claimed that, on one occasion, Christine Buckley had been caned by Sister Xavieria so severely that the entire side of her leg was split open from her hip to her knee. She said that she was treated in the casualty department of the local hospital and believes that she received 80 to 120 stitches. No medical evidence has ever been produced to support this claim. The surgeon who ran the casualty department at the hospital has made a statement which renders it highly unlikely that such an incident ever took place. The surgeon pointed out that caning would not have caused a wound of this kind, which would have required surgical treatment under a general anaesthetic and not stitches in a casualty department.Sunday Times (Ireland), 28 April 1996, citing the views of the surgeon, J. B. Prendiville. The text of the article \\"Medical view 'inconsistent' with Goldenbridge abuse' is at http://www.alliancesupport.org/news/archives/000250.html Yet the allegations against the Sisters of Mercy were widely believed at the time. In his essay \\"States of Fear, the Redress Board and Ireland's Folly\\", UK cultural historian Richard Webster states that \\"in the wake of the broadcast, atrocity stories about Goldenbridge and other industrial schools began to proliferate\\".\\"States of Fear, the Redress Board and Ireland's Folly\\" http://www.richardwebster.net/brynestynireland.html Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe were accused by Regina Walsh within months of the broadcast of \\"Dear Daughter\\". Her \\"witness\\" Patricia Phelan accused the Kilkenny businessman of rape at about the same time. It was his testimony that would eventually cause the collapse of the case against Wall and McCabe.  States of Fear  In April and May 1999 RTÉ broadcast a much more extensive three-part documentary series, States of fear, which was written, produced and directed by Mary Raftery. The programmes portrayed the industrial schools as part of a chaotic and Dickensian child-care system, which was run by the Catholic Church and funded by the state. The programmes also featured a series of claims by former residents of the schools that they had been physically or sexually abused by members of orders such as the Christian Brothers, the Sisters of Mercy and the Sisters of Charity. References were also made to a number of unexplained deaths which allegedly took place in these schools.\\"Mary Raftery and the Death of Patsy Flanagan\\" includes media correspondence between Raftery and her critics in 1999/2000 in relation to the death of a boy in Artane industrial school in 1951 The series provoked a huge public response. As Raftery herself puts it, \\"Outrage at the crimes committed against these children was expressed continuously for the three weeks of the series, across acres of newsprint and hours of radio broadcasts all over the country.\\"Mary Raftery and Eoin O. Sullivan, Suffer the Little Children: The Inside Story of Ireland’s Industrial Schools, New Island, Dublin, 1999, p. 16 During the course of this outbreak of outrage the religious orders were demonized. The following is an extract from an article by Irish journalist Stephen Dodd on 9 May 1999, entitled \\"Church Needs Public Exorcism Over Abuse\\" > In Australia, hundreds of orphaned children were flogged, beaten and > sexually abused at a Sisters of Mercy orphanage in Queensland.

Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe were convicted of rape on 10 June. Carol Coulter, legal affairs correspondent for the Irish Times wrote on 1 December 2005 that \\"[The case] took place at a time of heightened sensitivity to the problem of the sexual abuse of children in institutions, especially those run by religious orders. The RTÉ series States of Fear had ended a month earlier, generating widespread debate and indignation.\\"The Irish Times, 1 December 2005, Handling of vulnerable witnesses crucial An Irish Times editorial on 17 December 2005 entitled \\"Nora Wall\\" stated that: > The charges were laid at a time when allegations of the abuse of children in > institutions had entered the public domain.

In addition, the opinion of the Irish Times is significant as in 1999 Mary Raftery was both a columnist for the Times and a senior producer/director with RTÉ.\\"Raftery, Mary\\" The focus on the States of Fear programmes may explain why, apart from news reports on trial days, RTÉ's coverage of the scandal was confined to a 30-minute programme in the Would You Believe series on 11 January 2000.Irish Independent, 9 Jan 2000, \\"Nora Wall Speaks Publicly About Rape Trial Ordeal\\" On 28 November 1999, the Sunday Independent published an article entitled \\"Judge reflects a nation's outrage\\" by columnist Emer O'Kelly. The title refers to the sentencing by Judge Anthony Murphy of a Brother of Charity to 36 years imprisonment for the physical and sexual abuse of children. However the article contains these words about the Nora Wall case: > When the former Mercy nun Nora Wall was vindicated, and an announcement was > made that she was not to be retried for rape, there was an outcry from some > members of the public about the way she had been vilified before her > conviction was set aside.

Soon after the Davis plant was shut down, Gary Davis was convicted on 20 of 28 counts of theft (he was acquitted on four counts of theft and four of fraud) and was sentenced to 8 months to two years in jail. Davis developed a variant for military use. The Model 494 was a Jeep-like version of the Divan with an open body. Arrangements were ongoing with the Pentagon to run tests at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland. Ultimately three 494s were built in less than a week, two of which were shipped to the Army for testing. The assets of Davis were sold for back taxes in May 1950.

The charity was founded in the UK in 1957 to support the Pestalozzi Swiss Village in Switzerland.“A Short History”, Pestalozzi International Village Trust The village was built on a estate in Sedlescombe, UK and opened in 1959. 40 children between the ages of 10 and 18 from 15 European countries were accommodated and educated according to the principles of Swiss educationist called Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Children were educated in local schools in Hastings and St Leonards-on-Sea. In later years, the trust's focus has changed to providing educational opportunities for young people aged 16 to 19 who are academically bright but financially disadvantaged. Pestalozzi Scholars studied the International Baccalaureate at Sussex Coast College Hastings. They come from different countries, live and learn together. While in the village, scholars participated in other programmes such Pestalozzi Outreach educational programmes,“Pestalozzi for Schools”, Pestalozzi International Village Trust gardening, Ecolab and others. In 2016, some of the Pestalozzi Scholars attended Claremont Sixth Form to study A Levels. Educational programme In September 2019, the scholarship programme evolved and Pestalozzi now works in partnership with United World Colleges. The Pestalozzi-UWC scholars now attend UWC Atlantic in Wales where they study the International Baccalaureate Diploma course. Pestalozzi International Foundation still works with young people from the most marginalised communities of Belize, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe as well as Tibetans in exile in India and Nepal. In many of these countries the schools struggle to meet the needs of high-achieving, low income students. These young people are passionate about using their education to make a positive difference in society. Patron and management The Duke of Gloucester GCVO is the Patron of Pestalozzi International Village Trust. The Foundation is headed by a Chair of Trustees.

The band's name is a reference to the famous Tennessee whiskey Jack Daniel's. Considered one of the most influent bands on the Brazilian classic rock music scenario, the band has five albums (four officially released), mixing autoral music with some covers. History The band was formed in 1995 from the union of two bands: \\"Blues Band\\", as the name says a blues band, and \\"Alta Tensão\\" (in English: \\"High Tension\\"), a heavy metal band. The first formation was: Alex Batata (lead singer and harmonica), Fábio Brum (guitar), Marcos Yallouz (bass guitar), and João Bosco (drums). In January 1997, Fábio Brum goes to the United States of America, and in his place enters Fábio Terra, aka \\"Corvo\\" (in English: \\"Crow\\"), bringing a more heavy style to the band. In June 1997, lead singer Alex Batata is cowardly murdered. After this episode, the band enters in a short hiatus period before coming back to the stage. Soon after, Rodrigo Tozzette enters as the lead singer and Gilson Júnior in the keyboard. In 2000, Gilson is replaced by Alex Cavalheri, aka \\"Fralda\\" (in English: \\"Diaper\\"). Style The style of the band is a mixture of blues with classic and southern rock, and its main influences are bands such as Grand Funk Railroad, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Free, Doobie Brothers, The Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Black Oak Arkansas, The Black Crowes, The Who, ZZ Top, Cream, Os Mutantes, Secos & Molhados and Casa das Máquinas.

His published works are largely devoted to the interrelationship between politics, morality, religion and science. He is a blogger for The Huffington Post.  Early life, education and career  Schweitzer was born and raised in Southern California. Schweitzer began his scientific career in the fields of marine biology and neurophysiology. He earned his Ph.D. from Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Schweitzer joined the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at the University of California, Irvine in 1984. While at U.C. Irvine, Schweitzer was selected in 1986 to participate in the Science, Engineering and Diplomacy Fellowship program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1991 Schweitzer was appointed as the Chief Environmental Officer at the State Department’s Agency for International Development. Schweitzer is the founder of the multi-agency International Cooperative Biodiversity Group Program, a U.S. Government effort to promote the conservation of biodiversity through rational economic use of natural resources. In 1992 he was appointed to the position of Assistant Director for International Affairs in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy which is an Executive Office of the President of the United States. Schweitzer was responsible for providing scientific and technological policy advice and analysis directly to Vice President Al Gore and the Director of the OSTP. He worked with President Bill Clinton’s cabinet and 22 U.S. Government technical agencies, and with countries throughout the world, in biology, physics, chemistry, geophysics, agriculture, oceanography and marine sciences. He helped establish the permanent Global Forum on Science and Technology at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to promote greater international scientific collaboration.  Politics  Schweitzer identifies with the moderate left wing of the Democratic Party. According to Schweitzer, “History has shown that Democrats offer stronger support for science than Republicans.\\" His book, Vote To Save The Planet, was a collection of short articles intended to inform voters about the benefits of electing Barack Obama/Joe Biden and the disadvantages of electing John McCain/Sarah Palin in the 2008 Presidential Election. His criticisms of McCain/Palin were also a major focus of his Huffington Post articles during that time. Schweitzer contends that the GOP is hostile to environmental regulation, and claims that Republicans and Tea Party enthusiasts have recklessly and irresponsibly attacked reasonable attempts to clean our air.  Religious views  Schweitzer describes himself as a rationalist. He rejects the use of the term atheist, which means without god, because \\"we cannot be without something that does not exist\\". He further rejects the idea that his belief system can be defined as the negative of another belief system. According to Schweitzer, \\"The world should be divided between rationalists and 'arationalists. Schweitzer argues that war, overpopulation, poverty, destruction of the environment, intolerance, and indifference to the needs and rights of other life forms all result, to a large extent, from an obsolete religious moral code. Schweitzer claims that the very foundation of our moral code is fundamentally flawed; that the current code of ethics predominant in modern societies, shaped largely by divine command theory (most religion, especially Western religion), is based on false promises of eternal salvation or threats of damnation, not on a morality inherent to the human condition.  Personal life  Schweitzer and his wife, Sally Schweitzer, live in Central Texas, moving there following his service at the White House. Schweitzer is a pilot who owns and operates his personal aircraft. He and his wife Sally are avid scuba divers, often travelling the globe to explore new wildlife.

Some of the research involving prisoners has been exploitative and cruel. Many of the modern protections for human subjects evolved in response to the abuses in prisoner research. Research involving prisoners is still conducted today, but prisoners are now one of the most highly protected groups of human subjects\\"OHRP Guidance on the Involvement of Prisoners in Research\\", https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/prisoner.htm Requirements of research involving prisoners According to the Common Rule (45 CFR 46), prisoners may only be included in human subjects research when the research involves no more than a minimal risk of harm. Prisoner consent Prisoners can consent, although their consent cannot be said to be completely voluntary due to their compromised and dependent status. Their status as imprisoned human subjects becomes even more ethically problematic when investigators offer incentives such as parole, phone calls, or objects that are normally unavailable to prisoners. Historical abuses Ancient history Herophilos of Chalcedon was reputed by Celcus, among others, to have vivisected prisoners received from the Ptolemaic kings. Second Sino- Japanese War and World War II In Japan, Unit 731, located near Harbin (Manchukuo), experimented with prisoner vivisection, dismemberment and induced epidemics on a very large scale from 1935 to 1945 during the Second Sino- Japanese War. With the expansion of the Empire of Japan during World War II, many other units were implemented in conquered cities such as Nanking (Unit 1644), Beijing (Unit 1855), Guangzhou (Unit 8604) and Singapore (Unit 9420). After the war, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur gave immunity in the name of the United States to all members of the units in exchange for a tiny part of the results, so that in post-war Japan, Shiro Ishii and others continued to hold honoured positions. The United States blocked Soviet access to this information. However, some unit members were judged by the Soviets during the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials. The effects were lasting and China is still working to counteract the effects of buried pathogen caches. United States Project MKUltra was a CIA-run human experiment program from 1953-1973 where volunteers, prisoners and unwitting subjects were administered hallucinogenic drugs in attempt to develop incapacitating substances and chemical mind control agents, in an operation run by Sidney Gottlieb. Numerous experiments were done on prisoners throughout the US. Many prisoners eventually filed lawsuits and these actions brought about many more investigations and suits against doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies. Experiments included high-risk cancer treatments, the application of strong skin creams, new cosmetics, dioxin and high doses of LSD. Many incidents were documented in government reports, ACLU findings and various books including Acres of Skin by Allen Hornblum. The Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study is one of many examples. The Plutonium Files, for which Eileen Welsome won a Pulitzer Prize, documents the early human tests of the toxicity of plutonium and uranium on people.Michael Sherry. Human Guinea Pigs.

Germany and German-occupied territory The Herero and Namaqua Genocide in present-day Namibia, in Southern Africa, resulted in a large number of prisoners in concentration camps. These prisoners were used as medical test subjects by German agents.Hitler's Black Victims: The Historical Experiences of European Blacks, Africans and African Americans During the Nazi Era (Crosscurrents in African American History) by Clarence Lusane, page 50-51 Routledge 2002Germans return skulls to Namibia 27 Sept 2011, Times Live (South Africa) During the second World War, Nazi human experimentation occurred in Germany with particular bias towards euthanasia. At the war's conclusion, 23 Nazi doctors and scientists were tried for the murder of concentration camp inmates who were used as research subjects. Of the 23 professionals tried at Nuremberg, 15 were convicted. Seven of them were condemned to death by hanging and eight received prison sentences from 10 years to life. Eight professionals were acquitted. (Mitscherlich 1992) The result of these proceedings was the Nuremberg Code. It includes the following guidelines, among others, for researchers: : Informed consent is essential. : Research should be based on prior animal work. : The risks should be justified by the anticipated benefits. : Research must be conducted by qualified scientists. : Physical and mental suffering must be avoided. : Research in which death or disabling injury is expected should not be conducted.

Hillion was a former member of Order of St. Columban, which belongs to the Celtic Orthodox Church.Renaud Marhic, Alain Kerlidou, Sectes & mouvements initiatiques en Bretagne: du celtisme au nouvel âge, Terre de brume editions, 1996 , pp. 25-29 History In his Abbey of Ker Avalenn, at a place called Les Sept-Saints, near Le Vieux-Marché, Côtes-d'Armor, then in the abbey of Run Meno built by the monks, the Monastic Order of Avallon became, under the leadership of Father Bernard Ghoul, consecrated in 1972, the largest spiritual community of Brittany in the 1970s, alongside the Cistercian abbey of Boquen led by the reformer Father Bernard Besret. The number of followers is over 500. It published Le Journal d'Avallon in the early 1970s. The growth of the Order, helped by a weak internal discipline, led to the founding of a second community in Montpellier by Paul Fournier of Brescia, but it also led to the dilution of community spirit and monastic way of life. In the 1970s, several splinter groups appeared, including the Brotherhood of Druids of the West and the Celtic missionary companions. In 1976, after the failure of a reform project initiated by Father Bernard, the Abbey of Run Meno was gradually abandoned. The Order continued to exist, outside the monastic context, within the community of Montpellier, but it had disappeared by 1993. The name of the Monastic Order of Avallon was perpetuated by one of its founders engaged in alternative medicine. Centers Arc-en-Ciel, the Institut Rennais de Gestion de la Santé, and the Institut Européen de Gestion de la Santé all belong to the group. The Order was listed as a cult in the 1995 report of French Parliamentary Commission and was classified in the category of \\"neo-pagan\\" groups. Doctrine The Order operates independently of the Celtic Church, but according to its founder monks, the apostolic lineage has nonetheless been granted, as a charismatic individual, by Celtic Bishop Michel Raoult Iltud. The Order has therefore a dual affiliation: Orthodox Christian and neo- druidism. The group says it is neither religious nor ecclesiastical and aims primarily at young people. Its statutes state that the order is \\"monastical in the etymological meaning of the word which means that everyone must take care of himself\\".Jean-Pierre Van Girt, La France aux cent sectes, Vauvenargues editions, 1997, p. 279 () In the order, a member starts as simple monk, then becomes elder, under the leadership of an abbot.Jean-Pierre Bayard, Guide sur les sectes et les sociétés secrètes, Philippe Lebaud editions, 2004, p. 55 () Judicial cases In the 1990s, institutes affiliated to the Order sued French newspaper Paris Match which in 1994 had published an article entitled \\"Sectes de la mort: la filière bretonne\\" in which it was said these institutes were part of Order of the Solar Temple. In 2005, the founder Jacques Dubreuil was part of a \\"collective group against the religious intolerance within the judicial system\\" and filed a complaint to the UN which required the dissolution of anti-cult association UNADFI. On 13 December 2005, the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris issued an unfavorable verdict to the Order. On 3 April 2007, the Court of Cassation confirmed the decision given on 29 November 2005 by the Court of Appeal of Rennes and dismissed the Order's complaint for defamation against the magazine Un Autre Finistère which, in its edition of October 2000, cited the Order in an article entitled \\"Sectes en Finistère: ce qui a changé\\", criticizing its doctrines and methods.

Fiore was a model from Santa Cruz, California, United States. Her body was discovered on August 15, 2009, strangled and stuffed into a suitcase. Her remains had been mutilated to prevent recognition; she was eventually identified by the serial numbers of her breast implants. Fiore was 28 years old at the time of her death. Her husband, a former reality TV contestant, Ryan Alexander Jenkins, was the only suspect and was formally charged with the murder. On August 23, 2009, Jenkins was found dead in a hotel room in Hope, British Columbia, Canada. He was 32 years old. Fiore's background Fiore was born Jasmine Lepore in 1981. Her parents divorced when she was eight years old and she was raised by her mother, Lisa Lepore, in Bonny Doon, California, and in her youth, she enjoyed playing football and worked for a local grocery store. Fiore was a swimsuit model who frequently worked as a body-painted model at parties for entertainment. She appeared in shows at Las Vegas casinos. Fiore had acted in commercials for adult phone lines and bathing suits. Fiore had also obtained a real-estate license and was planning to open a gym and personal training center. According to Fiore's friend of a year-and-a-half, Marta Montoya, Fiore had a longstanding but intermittently serious relationship with Robert Hasman, with whom Fiore wanted to settle down. According to People magazine, another suitor of Fiore's was Travis Heinrich, whom she met around 2005. Heinrich and Fiore had become engaged and remained so for less than half a year in 2006 or 2007; although the couple broke off this engagement, they continued to date. Marriage Fiore met real estate investor Ryan Jenkins at a Las Vegas casino shortly after Jenkins completed filming Megan Wants a Millionaire. Two days later – March 18, 2009 – the pair married at The Little White Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip.Leshchinskaya, Nastacia. \\"Grim Reality: Jasmine Fiore and Ryan Jenkins\\", TruTV, accessed June 4, 2011. According to court records, Jenkins was charged in June 2009 in Clark County, Nevada, with \\"battery constituting domestic violence\\" for hitting Fiore on the arm. Travis Heinrich, who was present, said Jenkins and Fiore were arguing over her kissing Heinrich, and Jenkins hit Fiore's arm, causing her to fall into a nearby swimming pool. Jenkins was to go on trial in December. The pair reconciled shortly before Fiore's death and were reportedly traveling to San Diego for a poker game. Lisa Lepore, Fiore's mother, claims that the two fought frequently and that Jenkins was jealous of Fiore's friendships with her ex-boyfriends. Dan Jenkins, Ryan Jenkins's father, said that Fiore was his son's only friend in California and that she would disappear for days at a time and lie about it to his son. In addition, Lepore told The Associated Press that her daughter had her marriage to Jenkins annulled in May 2009, but there are no court records of an annulment in either Nevada, where the couple was married, or Los Angeles County, where they last lived. Fiore's death Investigators reported that Jenkins and Fiore checked into the L'Auberge hotel in Del Mar, San Diego, on the evening of August 13, 2009. They were to attend a poker tournament, a charity fund-raiser for the Carma Foundation at the Del Mar Hilton. Surveillance video captured Fiore and Jenkins leaving the Hilton at about 2:30 a.m. on August 14. The couple were later seen at the Ivy Hotel, a nightclub in downtown San Diego. At around 4:30 a.m., Jenkins returned to the L'Auberge hotel alone. Fiore was not seen alive again. Jenkins left the L'Auberge hotel at around 9 a.m. that day. Fiore's body was discovered, but not identified, on August 15 at about 7 a.m., badly beaten and crushed inside a suitcase in a dumpster in an alley in Buena Park, California. According to Buena Park police, Fiore's teeth and fingers had been removed before her naked body was stuffed into the suitcase. She had also been strangled. Authorities believe the mutilation was an attempt to impede identification. On August 18, her remains were identified using the serial numbers of her breast implants. The Orange County coroner's office reported Fiore had died a couple of hours before her body was found. Fiore's white Mercedes was found abandoned in a parking lot in West Hollywood, about a mile from the penthouse Fiore shared with Jenkins in Fairfax District, Los Angeles. Police reported that there was a significant amount of blood, and some evidence of hair pulling. Jenkins reported Fiore missing on August 15 at 8:55 p.m. He told police that he last saw Fiore about 8:30 p.m. August 14 at their home on Edinburgh Avenue, Los Angeles. Jenkins said they had gone to San Diego for a poker event and that, after returning, she dropped him off that evening, left to do errands, and never returned. Jenkins's movements after Fiore's death At around 9 a.m. on August 16, 2009, the day after reporting Fiore missing and after spending some time packing, Jenkins was seen leaving their penthouse for the last time. Police said he then left Los Angeles and went to Nevada to pick up his speedboat. On August 17, when contacted by police, Jenkins said he was in Utah and was headed to Canada to resolve some immigration issues. On August 18, Fiore's body was identified and the murder first reported. On the afternoon of August 19, Jenkins called his father from Birch Bay, who informed him Fiore had been found murdered. The Whatcom County Sheriff's Department received witness reports of Jenkins's black BMW SUV towing a boat toward the Canada–US border. Police later found the BMW SUV and an empty boat trailer at a marina in Blaine, Washington; the engine was still warm. At the time Jenkins was only a person of interest in the investigation. He had not been charged, but Canadian authorities had been alerted to watch for him. U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed they had boats patrolling northwest Washington waters looking for Jenkins as early as August 19. Initial media reports were that the US Coast Guard and Canadian authorities chased Jenkins's speedboat as it crossed to Point Roberts, but officials later denied these reports. On August 19, a man matching Jenkins's description was seen piloting his boat into a marina in Point Roberts, where Jenkins's stepmother lives. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) announced that they believed Jenkins crossed into Canada sometime between August 19 and August 20. On August 20, Jenkins was charged with Fiore's murder and an arrest warrant was issued. Also on August 20, Jenkins called his detained father at the airport, but his father had to hang up the call. Jenkins's suicide At about 6 p.m. on August 20, Jenkins arrived in a silver PT Cruiser with a young blonde woman at the Thunderbird Motel in Hope, British Columbia, Canada. The car had Alberta license plates. They pulled up beside a dumpster rather than beside the rooms, which the motel manager said was strange. Jenkins stayed in the car while a young woman paid cash for three nights' accommodation. The manager described the woman as attractive, about 25 to 30 years old, and very calm, making small talk while registering. The guest in the room next door said the woman stayed for about 20 minutes with Jenkins in Room 2 and then left the motel. The woman proved to be Jenkins's half-sister Alena Jenkins. The manager saw Jenkins walking outside the motel the next day, August 21. The manager said Jenkins looked exhausted and was not recognizable from his picture on television. At 11:30 a.m. on August 23, the couple failed to check out. Having noticed very little activity over the weekend, the motel manager and his nephew decided to check on the room. Jenkins was found dead, apparently of suicide; his body was hanging from a clothes rack by a belt. No suicide note was found at the motel, , however, police found a document saved on Jenkins's computer titled \\"Last Will and Testament\\" and dated August 20, 2009. On August 27, 2009, investigators found a storage unit full of Jenkins's belongings, including a suitcase of clothes, in Washington state. Reaction by VH1 Following the announcement that Jenkins was connected with the murder of Fiore, VH1 put Megan Wants a Millionaire on indefinite hiatus out of respect for Fiore's family. It also deleted the show's page from the official VH1 website and dropped reruns of past shows from its schedule. It removed the show's archived episodes from the iTunes Store and cable video on demand services, leading to speculation that the show would never air again. It subsequently emerged that Jenkins had not only been charged with assaulting Fiore, but had been convicted two years earlier for assaulting a woman in Calgary. The latter incident had not been disclosed to either VH1 or Megan Wants a Millionaire producer 51 Minds. In a statement, 51 Minds said that it would not have allowed Jenkins on the show had it known about the 2007 incident. VH1 had hired Collective Intelligence, a private investigation firm, to perform background checks on Jenkins and the other contestants. Collective Intelligence doesn't perform background checks outside the United States, and outsourced the vetting of Jenkins to a Canadian firm, Straightline International. In 2009, Collective Intelligence sued Straightline for breach of contract. The suit alleged that Straightline had falsely told Collective Intelligence that Jenkins's record was clean, and had also failed to check Jenkins against the RCMP criminal database. Collective Intelligence claimed to have lost valuable business from Viacom (owner of VH1), NBC and ABC as a result of the damage to its reputation.Company sued over Jenkins's background check. TMZ, 2009-10-28. Collective Intelligence won their lawsuit in July 2011. The day after Jenkins's death, VH1 officially announced the show was canceled, and that it would not run the third season of I Love Money, which Jenkins reportedly won. This cannot be determined, however, because a 51 Minds spokesman said Jenkins tried to pick up his honorarium check of $5,200 a few days before Fiore's body was discovered.

History The school originally opened in January 1919 on the Avonside Drive site as a satellite campus of Christchurch Girls' High School. It became a separate school in its own right in 1928. Earthquake Following the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the school site closed, with classes operating at Burnside High School in the afternoons. Two school blocks, including the Main Block, were condemned following the earthquake and were demolished. Students returned to the Avonside site at the beginning of 2012, with relocatable and prefabricated classrooms filling gaps left by the condemned buildings, but due to significant land damage adjacent to the school site, it was clear that the school might need to close or relocate. Education Minister Hekia Parata announced on 16 October 2013 that the school would move, and be co-located with Shirley Boys' High School at a new site in east Christchurch, and on 12 Feb 2015 the site was confirmed to be the former QEII Park site – and the move was complete in April 2019.

It was Hesse's most popular book in the years before he published Demian. The novel is split up into three separate tales which are centered on the life of the main character: Knulp. Knulp, who was once a gifted and promising youth, is depicted as an amiable vagabond perpetually wandering from town to town, staying with friends. He is liked by almost everyone he encounters in the novel for his manners and charming demeanour. He often receives charity from those sympathetic with him. Synopsis The first tale, titled \\"Early Spring\\", follows Knulp just after he had been discharged from a hospital due to his waning health. An old friend of his, a tanner named Emil Rothfuss, shelters him while Knulp spends his days aimlessly. During the tale he gains the affection of the tanner's wife, though he does not welcome her advances. He attempts to court a girl named Barbra Flick who had recently arrived in the town as a household servant. The chapter culminates after Knulp convinces Barbra to abandon her post in the night and dance with him. In the last words of \\"Early Spring\\", Knulp decides to leave the town despite a commitment with the tanner and his wife scheduled the following day. The second tale, \\"My Recollections of Knulp\\", is told from the point of view of another vagrant who is not identified but is the only of the three tales written in first person giving the impression as possibly being Hermann Hesse himself. The story focuses on his interactions with Knulp as they wander through the forests and meadows of Germany. The second half of the section takes place during a day which unfolded as joy-filled and carefree. It ends, however, on the following day when Knulp has abandoned the narrator. The narrator is bewildered, wondering if possibly Knulp left him out of disgust due to his excessive drinking, the previous night. The Third tale, \\"The End\\", follows Knulp as he is taken in for a growing illness by Dr. Machold—a childhood friend from Latin school. Dr. Machold, who once learned from Knulp, is now a grown up respectable individual. He helps Knulp to recover as they reminiscent on their brief time together, during their childhood, while, Dr. Machold prepares to send him to a hospital in the town of their youth. Upon arriving, Knulp wanders around his home town remembering what once was. He greets a stone-breaker who, after recognizing Knulp from his childhood days, questions why he never put his God given gifts and abilities to good use. Towards the end of the novel, Knulp wanders into the forest. He begins a conversation with God, which poetically connects the three tales. In this conversation, Knulp asks God why he, Knulp, has not done anything of consequence in life. Knulp questions about the purpose of his life and why the longevity. Throughout the conversation, Knulp slowly comes to terms with himself and then accepts his life. \\"See,\\" said God, \\"I did not need you to be any other than you. In my name, you have wandered and have always brought the sedentary people a little homesickness for freedom. In my name you have done stupid things and made yourself a mockery; I am mocked in you and loved in you. You are my child and my brother and a piece of me, and you have tasted nothing and suffered nothing that I have not experienced with you.\\" \\"Yes,\\" Knulp said, nodding heavily. \\"Yes, it is so, I always knew it.\\"Hermann Hesse: Knulp.

In 1930, along with 18 other local educators and celebrities, he helped create a charity organization known as Nantong Poor Children’s Home, where children from poor families apprenticed in exchange for basic education. He actively supported and helped this organization until Nantong fell under Japanese occupation in 1938. During the Sino-Japanese war, he refused to cooperate with the Japanese occupation forces and their collaborators. He followed the retreating provincial government and continued to work in areas of northern Jiangsu that had not fallen into enemy hands. As the war went on, more and more schools were closed. To at least help some students go to school, in 1943, he single- handedly reopened Chongjing Secondary School in Jiangyan. He served as the principal and the chairman of the board of trustees. He invited many of his friends and well-known teachers to join him in his effort. He helped create the school curriculum and procure or develop teaching materials. He created the school motto “Self-reliance in adversity and loyalty with honesty”. He personally taught the Chinese language class, and he would lead the students every day in their morning exercises. Two years of extremely hard work took a toll on his health. He succumbed to a terminal disease in 1945 and died in a taxi boat in Rugao on his way from Jiangyan back to Nantong, a few months before the Sino-Japanese war would end. The following year, 24 local VIPs issued a proclamation and set up a memorial committee in his honor. They referred to him as a “giant man of letters and a renowned master of education”, and they called upon the government to 1. Recognize and honor his professional services and patriotic deeds; 2. Restore Nantong Poor Children’s Home and rename it after him; 3. Protect his grave and build a memorial; and 4. Financially help his widow to raise his children. They launched a fund- raising campaign to help promote these measures. Family Yi Zuolin’s father was Yi Yao (), aka Yi Qianliu (), a scholar working for the Tongzhou Naval Base. His mother was Wang Shuyan (), a graduate of Tungchou Women Teachers’ College. Both of them have died. He had four siblings: brother Chi-tang (), aka Tzu-chao (); brother Ting (), aka Chi-heng (); sister Chuan (), aka Ching- yi (); sister Mo (), aka Tsang-su (). All his siblings have died. Yi married Wu Jiejun (吳潔君, 1904–2000) in 1921. They had five children: daughter Yü (), son Tan (), daughter Lu (), son Lieh (), and son Hsi (). His wife died in April, 2000, survived by all their children. Academic work Yi Zuolin started his academic career as a young activist of the National Language Unification Movement and the New Culture Movement. He actively participated in the propagation and education of the newly established Standard Mandarin (). While teaching, he systematically studied all the phonetic and grammatical characteristics of Standard Mandarin. Rather than blindly fitting Chinese language materials into linguistic models based on western languages, he would apply principles of western linguistic science while studying these materials and make generalizations based on his observations. He was thus able to make discoveries other scholars of his time failed to see. In 1920, at the age of 23, he published his first scholarly work Lectures on Chinese Phonetics (). A year later it was designated by the Ministry of Education as a standard reference book for students learning the Mandarin phonetic system in all schools nationwide. The Chinese vowel diagrams seen in this book are the first ever created by a Chinese scholar, and they are very much comparable to the cardinal vowel diagram created by Daniel Jones three years before. In 1921, he published an important paper On Five Tones (). He argued that tones are an indispensable part of the Chinese phonetic system. For the first time ever, he created the method of describing tones with a tonal contour “based on the scale of the musical staff”. This can be seen as the precursor to Yuen Ren Chao’s invention of tone letter in 1930. His method is still widely used today in phonetic studies of tonal languages. In 1924, he published his second scholarly work Four Lectures on Chinese Grammar (). This book was ahead of its time in the classification and structural analysis of phrases, in the exposition and differentiation of sentences with seemingly identical structures, and in the recognition, classification and analysis of embedded sentences. It would be decades before analytical techniques frequently used in this book, such as analysis of semantic property, analysis of semantic orientation, transformational analysis, etc. became commonplace in the literature of Chinese syntactic research. With his respectable academic achievements, Yi became a Chinese linguist of the same caliber as Li Jinxi, Yuen Ren Chao, Lin Yutang et al. Publications * (1920).

Anjou wine is produced in the Loire Valley wine region of France near the city of Angers. The wines of region are often grouped together with the wines of nearby Saumur as \\"Anjou-Saumur\\". Along with the wines produced further east in Touraine, Anjou-Saumur make what is collectively known as the \\"Middle Loire\\" (as opposed to the \\"Upper Loire\\" which includes the wine regions of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé.J. Robinson. Jancis Robinson's Wine Course, Third Edition. Abbeville Press, 2003. pp. 180-184. . Within the Anjou wine region are several Appellation d'origine contrôlées (AOCs) responsible for a broad spectrum of wines including still red, white and rosé produced with varying levels of sweetness. Extending across the Deux-Sèvres, Maine-et-Loire and Vienne départements, the generic Anjou AOC appellation and its various sub-appellations encompasses vineyards across more than 151 communes.Wine Doctor \\"Anjou and Saumur Part 2\\". Accessed: August 26, 2009 Wine expert Tom Stevenson describes the wines of the area as being a \\"microcosm of the Loire Valley\\", featuring wines made from every grape variety and in almost every style produced in the entire Loire wine region.T. Stevenson The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia pg 282-286 Dorling Kindersley 2005 Among the wines of Anjou, Savennières is noted for its dry Chenin blanc wines and the Coteaux du Layon for its sweet dessert wines that includes the botrytized wines of Bonnezeaux and Quarts de Chaume. Various rosé wines are produced in the region under different AOC designation include Rosé d'Anjou, the most basic level made predominantly from Grolleau, and Cabernet d'Anjou which is usually made from Cabernet Franc or Cabernet Sauvignon.A. Domine (ed) Wine pg 224-226 Ullmann Publishing 2008 For most of its history, dry red wines have represented a small percentage of Anjou winemaking but in recent years the numbers have been steadily increasing—aided, in part, by the 1987 establishment of the Anjou-Villages AOC designation for red wines which can be made from only Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The Gamay grape of the Beaujolais wine region has had a long history in the Anjou with its own Anjou- Gamay AOC. Grapes from around the region can go into basic Anjou blanc and Anjou Rouge AOC wines.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 24 Oxford University Press 2006 History Angevin winemakers in the Middle Ages were one of the few Medieval producers to blend both the vin de goutte (free run juice) with the vin de presse (pressed wine) which added tannins and color to the wine. Wine made from the Chenin blanc grape can be dated to the 9th century in vineyards belonging to the Glanfeuil Abbey located just south of Angers in what is now Le Thoureil. Angevin wines have been held in high esteem since the Middle Ages but were mostly limited to local French markets. Unusual for the time Anjou was known for its unique winemaking technique of blending vin de presse, the wine extracted from pressing the grapes, with the vin de goutte or free run juice that came from the weight of gravity pressing the grape. This vin de presse added extra tannins and color to the wine but could limit the wine's appeal for being consumed young.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 124-125,144 & 188 Simon and Schuster 1989 Dutch traders in the 16th and 17th century introduced sweet wine production to the region that would feed the growing and prosperous market for such wines in Rotterdam. Anjou wines experienced some brief popularity with the English market being in demand due to their reputation for tasting \\"ripe and sweet\\". The high point of the Angevin wine industry was the early 19th century when the market demands of Paris overtook those of the Dutch and plantings flourished throughout the area. But soon the phylloxera epidemic would ravage the region's vineyards and bring this golden era to a close. In response to the devastation, growers in Anjou replanted with a wide range of grape varieties of varying qualities, including hybrid grapes. Even with this massive replanting, vineyards in the Anjou still number less than half of the acreage planted during the peak years of production. Climate and geography Located along the Loire River near the town of Angers, the region of Anjou has a mild continental climate with some maritime influences due to its close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean.E. McCarthy & M. Ewing-Mulligan \\"French Wine for Dummies\\" pg 206-210 Wiley Publishing 2001 This influence is tempered by the forests of the Vendée department to the southwest which absorbs the brunt of the rainfall and winds coming in off the Atlantic. Annual rainfall totals for the region usually hover around 19 inches (500mm). The vineyard soils close to the Loire River are composed primarily of carboniferous rock and schist. Chenin blanc, in particular, seems to do well in this soil type. The tributaries of the Loire, such as the Layon river (pictured), play an important role in viticulture of the Anjou wine region. Most of the wine regions in Anjou are located south of the river Loire, with the one notable exception of Savennières which is located on the right bank of the river just south of Angers. The tributaries of the Loire, particularly the Layon and Aubance, play significant roles in the area's wine production with vineyard planted on their right banks and sheltered from wind by nearby hill sides. The Aubance and Layon flow parallel to each other going northwest towards the Loire and when the climate is favorable can help promote the development of noble rot that is at the heart of the region's sweet wine production.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 118 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Appellations Chenin blanc is the primary grape of the dry and sweet wines of the Anjou wine region. Within the Anjou wine region are several Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC)s responsible for a broad spectrum of wines including still red, white and rosé produced with varying levels of sweetness. The region produce more variety of different wine styles, from different grape varieties than any other Loire Valley wine region. The majority of wine production in the region revolves around sweet white wines produced under their own sub-appellation including the Coteaux du Layon, Bonnezeaux, Quarts de Chaume and Coteaux de l'Aubance AOCs. Around 15% of yearly Angevin wine production goes to dry white wines made predominantly from Chenin blanc with the Savennières AOC being the most noted example and Anjou Blanc AOC being the most commonly found on the worldwide wine market. Among the rosés produced in the region are predominantly Grolleau Rosé d'Anjou AOC and the Cabernet Franc and/or Cabernet Sauvignon based Cabernet d'Anjou with the later being more widely recognized for quality than the former. Grapes from the region also go into third style of rosé known as Rosés de Loire, which can include grapes from across the Middle Loire Valley though the bulk of the production is centered around Anjou. This style of rosé is completely dry and can be made from Pinot noir, Gamay, Grolleau, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pineau d'Aunis.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 264-266 Workman Publishing 2001 The production of dry red wines has been steadily increasing since the late 20th century spurred on, in part, by the creation of the Anjou- Villages AOC in 1987 for premium red wine production. Made predominantly from Cabernet Franc, some of the most ideally situated vineyards located south of Angers in the Coteaux de l'Aunbance AOC was given their own distinct sub- appellation in 1998 known as the Anjou-Villages Brissac AOC. The Gamay grape of Beaujolais still has a presence here and its own appellation of Anjou Gamay AOC. Gamay, as well as a variety of other red wine grape varieties, can also be produced under the catch-all appellation Anjou Rouge AOC. Major appellations Rosé d'Anjou and Cabernet d'Anjou *Anjou AOC - The boundaries of this AOC extend into nearby Saumur, allowing some of the wine produced in that region to be sold under the Anjou AOC label. The basic Anjou Rouge can be produced from Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pineau d'Aunis and tend to be medium to full bodied. Basic Anjou Blanc can range in style from dry to sweet and light bodied to full. They must be composed of a minimum 80% Chenin blanc with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc permitted to fill out the remaining 20% of the blend. According to wine expert Tom Stevenson, both the reds and whites wines have the aging potential of only a few years after vintage. *Anjou-Villages AOC The boundaries of this red wine only AOC was first delimited in 1986 but did not go into effect until the 1991 harvest. Made entirely from Cabernet Franc and/or Cabernet Sauvignon, these wines have an aging potential of 2–6 years after harvest. There are 46 communes in the appellation allowed to produce grapes for this AOC. *Anjou-Villages Brissac AOC A sub appellation of the Anjou-Villages AOC, the boundaries of this AOC encompassed the vineyards around Brissac-Quincé and nine surrounding villages. Officially recognized in 1998, producers in the region were given an allowance to back date their labels with the new appellation for the previous 1997 & 1996 vintage. *Cabernet d'Anjou AOC The first rosé wine to be made entirely from Cabernet grapes was in 1905 but for most of the 20th century, this style of rosé took a backseat to the popularity of Rosé d'Anjou made predominantly from Grolleau. Made entirely from Cabernet Franc and/or Cabernet Sauvignon, these rosés tend to be drier than Rosé d'Anjou with higher alcohol and potentially more character. *Rosé d'Anjou AOC Also known as Anjou Rosé AOC, these medium-sweet rosés saw a period of immense popularity in the mid to late 20th century where in the late 1980s they composed nearly 55% of all wine produced in the Anjou district. Since that high point, production has been steadily declining. Made predominantly from Grolleau with small percentages of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Malbec and Pineau d'Aunis permitted, these wines can be sold nouveau with wine experts recommending that they be consumed early soon after release. Savennières wine from producer Nicolas Joly. The bottle on the left is from the sub-appellation AOC of Savennières Coulée-de-Serrant. *Savennières AOC In the early 20th century, Savennières was known mostly for sweet wine production. As the focus turned towards dry Chenin blanc based wines, the region started to garner attention for mineral intensity and aging potential of the wines. Located along four southeast facing slopes on the right bank of the Loire river, vineyards in Savennières are composed primarily of schist and volcanic soils. Yields are highly restricted to just 20 hectoliters per hectare which tends to produce more concentrated fruit. In recent years, the wines of Savennières have received much praise and recognition for their quality by various wine experts such as Jacqueline Friedrich who describes the intense flavors and layers of minerality as \\"the most cerebral wine in the world\\" and Karen MacNeil who describes the wines as \\"..possibly the great dry Chenin blanc in the world.\\" *Savennières Coulée-de-Serrant AOC A 17 acres (7 hectare) sub appellation of Savennières, this AOC encompasses one single vineyard that is a monopole owned by Nicolas Joly. *Savennières Roche-Aux-Moines AOC A 42-acre (17 hectare) sub appellation of Savennières, this AOC encompasses a single vineyard that is partially owned by 3 wine estates-Château de la Roche-aux-Moines (owned by Nicolas Joly), Château de Chamboureau and Domaine-aux-Moines. Sweet wine appellations *Anjou Coteaux de la Loire AOC Located southwest of the city of Angers, this white wine only appellations was designated in 1946 to produce sweet wines from Chenin blanc. The grapes in this AOC are harvested at same sugar levels as in Sauternes (221 grams per liter) with the finished wines having residual sugar levels of 17 grams per liter. In the early 21st century, as the market for dessert wines dwindle, vineyards in this area are rapidly being converted to Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon for production of red wines under the Anjou AOC appellation. *Bonnezeaux AOC A sub-appellation of the Coteaux du Layon AOC comprises three southwest facing slopes within the village of Thouarcé that produce sweet, often botrytized, wines made entirely from Chenin blanc. Harvest in Bonnezeaux is very labor-intensive requiring harvested to go through the vineyards in multiple passes or tries selecting only the ripest individual grapes. In 2003 the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) increased the harvest sugar levels from 204 grams per liter to 238 and the minimum residual sugar levels of the finished wine from 17 grams per liter to 34. Wine expert Tom Stevenson describes the wines of Bonnezeaux as being more full-bodied and richer than those of Quarts- de-Chaume with an aging potential of up to 20 years or more. Many of the sweet wines of the Anjou are botrytized, meaning that the noble rot of Botrytis cinerea has infected the grapes causing the grapes to shrivel and concentrate the sugars inside. *Coteaux de l'Aubance AOC Located along the Aubance river, this AOC covers sweet wines made entirely from Chenin blanc planted in the schist vineyard soils of the region. To qualify for the Coteaux de l'Aubance AOC designation producers must harvest the grapes in tries. In 2003 a special designation of Coteaux de l'Aubance Sélection de Grains Nobles was set aside for the grapes harvested at sugar levels of 230 grams liter (as opposed to 204 g/l) with residual sugar levels of the finished wine reaching a minimum of 34 grams per liter (as opposed to the previous standard of 17 g/l). Due to the high cost of labor and low production, many producers in this area are converting their vineyards to the red Cabernet varieties to produce the rosé wine Cabernet d'Anjou. *Coteaux du Layon AOC This large appellation overlaps the Saumur AOC to the southeast and the Anjou Coteaux de la Loire AOC in the northwest. The region has a long history of winemaking sweet white wines dating back to the 4th century AD. Today the AOC is dedicated to 100% Chenin blanc wines that, in favorable years, are afflicted by noble rot. Yields are restricted to a maximum of 30 hectoliters per hectare and wines must have a minimum 12% alcohol level in order to qualify for AOC designation. In 2003 mandatory harvest sugar levels being increased from 204 grams per liter to 221 g/l or 294 g/l for the newly established Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN) designation and minimum residual sugar levels in the finished wines increased from 17 g/l to 34 g/l. *Coteaux du Layon Villages AOC A sub-appellation of the Coteaux du Layon AOC, this wine region covers six communes along the Layon river that have historically produced wines of high quality. The six communes are Beaulieu-sur-Layon, Faye-d'Anjou, Rablay-sur-Layon, Rochefort-sur-Loire, Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné and Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay. According to wine expert Tom Stevenson, there are noticeable differences among the wines produced by each commune (all made from Chenin blanc) with the wines of Beaulieu-sur-Layon being characterized by their light aromas; Faye-d'Anjou wines having a distinctive brushwood aroma; Rablay-sur-Layon wines tend to be the most bold and round; the wines of Rochefort-sur-Loire tend to be full bodied and have the most aging potential; Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné wines are characterized by their delicate aromas that develop over time and the wines of Saint-Lambert- du-Lattay often have very round mouthfeel and robust flavors. *Quarts-de- Chaume AOC Most of the land in this appellation near the village of Chaume once belonged to the abbey of Ronceray d'Angers who required from tenant vignerons tithes in the form of 1/4 (a quarter or \\"Quarts\\") of their yearly production. From this history, the name Quarts-de-Chaume was attached to the Chenin blanc wines of this region harvested and produced in a manner similar to those in Bonnezeaux. Chaume AOC controversy An example of passerillage where the grapes are raisined on the vine rather than infected by Botrytis cinera. Similar to botrytized wines, the raisining has the effect of reducing water in the grape and causing the sugars to be more concentrated. Along the Layon river is the commune of Rochefort-sur-Loire which contains the village of Chaume with a long making tradition that finally received AOC designation in the early 21st century. In 2003 the INAO granted the request for the sweet wines from this region to be called Chaume 1er Cru des Coteaux du Layon AOC. Made entirely from Chenin blanc, these wines are most often the product of passerillage or \\"raisining\\" on the vine than of infection by noble rot. Yields were restricted to no more than 25 hectoliters per hectares as grapes were harvested with a minimum of 238 grams per liter with at least 34 grams of residual sugar in the finished wine. The producers in the Quarts-de- Chaume AOC, located on the plateau southwest of Chaume, took exception to the new AOC particularly the inclusion of the term 1er Cru (or Premier cru) which has a quality association with the wines of Burgundy. The producers of the Quarts-de-Chaume AOC felt that consumers would equate Chaume 1er Cru des Coteaux du Layon as being of a higher quality than their own wines and such their own AOC designation was being devalued.M. Rosen \\"AOC Chaume designation scrapped \\" Decanter Magazine, June 17th 2009 In response to these concerns, the INAO renamed the AOC in 2006 to the shorter Chaume AOC.F. Robinson \\"INAO recognises new appellations\\" Decanter Magazine, September 12th 2006 Quarts-de- Chaume AOC producers still felt that the close associate between their AOC and Chaume was causing damage to the value of their wines and continued to object to the AOC naming. In response the INAO disbanded the Chaume AOC entirely in 2009. Now wine produced in this region must fall under the larger Coteaux du Layon AOC designation. Other appellations *Anjou Gamay AOC This appellation maintains nearly the same boundary as the Anjou AOC but is dedicated to wines produced 100% from the Gamay grape. Similar to Beaujolais nouveau, these wines can be produced as Vins de primeur and released as early as the third Thursday of November following harvest. *Anjou Mousseux AOC Sparkling wine AOC produced according to the traditional method. Most vineyards in the appellation overlap with those of Saumur, making the appearance of the Anjou Mousseux AOC on wine labels rare as producers favor using the more recognizable and marketable Saumur AOC designation. Both white and rosé sparkling wines are produced in this region with sweetness levels ranging from brut to demi-sec. The white sparkling wines must be composed of a minimum 60% Chenin blanc with Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Grolleau, Malbec and Pineau d'Aunis permitted to fill out the remaining 40%. Rosé sparklers are made from a blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Grolleau, Malbec and Pineau d'Aunis. *Anjou Pétillant AOC Wines labeled under this designation are semi-sparkling (similar to the Italian wine frizzante) and sold in regular still wine bottles and corks rather than Champagne bottles. These wines are aged in the bottle for a minimum of 9 months before release and can range in sweetness levels from dry to medium sweet. The white wines produced under this style must be composed of a minimum 80% Chenin blanc with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc responsible for the remaining 20%. A semi-sparkling rosé style may be produced under the Rosé d'Anjou Pétillant AOC designation and be composed of predominantly Grolleau with Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Malbec and Pineau d'Aunis also permitted. Viticulture and winemaking Cabernet Franc is an important red wine grape variety in the Anjou. The two major grape varieties of the Anjou are Chenin blanc, known locally as Pineau de la Loire, which is used for dry, sweet, still and sparkling wine and Cabernet Franc which is used mostly for rosé and still red wines.A. Bespaloff \\"Complete Guide to Wine\\" pg 92 Penguin Books 1994 The sweet wine production of Anjou is highly dependent on favorable climate conditions and experiences marked vintage variation from year to year. The character of the vintage and climate will ultimately determine what type of wine will be produced. Many of the vineyards in the Coteaux du Layon, Bonnezeaux, Quarts de Chaume and Coteaux de l'Aubance AOCs are located on sheltered slopes along tributaries of the Loire. In favorable vintages, the late summer and early fall months will bring climate conditions that encourage moisture and mist in the morning and enough sunshine in the afternoon to promote the development of favorable Botrytis cinerea rot instead of less desirable forms of grape rot. In exceptional years where there is enough warmth and dry weather during the harvest months, the grapes will be left on the vine to raisin in a process known as passerille. This method desiccates the wine, removing moisture and concentrating sugars, without adding the nuance of flavor that Botrytis does. A characteristic of late harvest and botrytized wine production is the harvest of individual grapes in successive passes or tries through the vineyard ensuring only the ripest grapes are picked. Some producers will ferment and bottle the production of each tries separately but many eventually blend them together in order to produce a more balanced wine. The wine is often fermented at low temperatures and for some sweet wines can take up to 2 months. The alcohol level left in these wines can range from 12-14% depending on the sweetness level. The broad spectrum of wine styles produced in Anjou brings with it a wide variety of winemaking techniques. In areas such as the Coteaux du Layon, the wines are fermented in 400 l (106 gallons) \\"double-barriques\\" and submitted to partial malolactic fermentation. The basic still wines of Anjou blanc are made similar to still white wine production elsewhere though, as wine expert Jancis Robinson notes, they do have an historical association with being over sulfited. As red wine production continues to find a market, and plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon increase, more producers are experimented with the use of new oak barrels. In riper years Angevin producers can make more fuller bodied reds similar to those found in the Touraine wine reds but still relatively light when compared to the reds of warmer climates such as Bordeaux and the Rhone.

It grew from a national service model in the WPA tradition and is now an alliance of separately-run organizations in three cities. History WritersCorps was born out of discussions between the National Endowment for the Arts and AmeriCorps with the goal of furthering a group of artists to teach creative writing at public schools and social service organizations in order to help underserved youth improve their literacy and communication skills and to offer creative expression as an alternative to violence, alcohol and drug abuse. They selected San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Bronx, N.Y. as the three initial sites. In 1997, WritersCorps transitioned from being a federally funded program to an independent alliance that is supported by a collaboration of public and private partners. DC WritersCorps is a nonprofit organization while San Francisco and the Bronx WritersCorps are projects of the San Francisco Arts Commission and the Bronx Council on the Arts, respectively. The organizations lead writing workshops, produce youth events, and create books of youth work, including two national anthologies published by HarperCollins: Paint Me Like I Am and Tell the World. San Francisco WritersCorps Since its inception in 1994, San Francisco WritersCorps has helped over 20,000 young people from neighborhoods throughout San Francisco improve their literacy and increase their desire to learn. WritersCorps is a joint project of the San Francisco Arts Commission and San Francisco Public Library. Mission WritersCorps hires experienced teachers who are published poets, fiction writers, playwrights and performers. These writers-in-service work long-term and in-depth in communities to build lasting relationships and to provide positive role models for young people. In addition to teaching creative writing, the WritersCorps teaching artists work together as a team to produce special projects and support each other as resources in the field of community arts. WritersCorps classes exercise the imagination and allow young people to expand their possibilities, improve their critical thinking and become more self-aware. The organization publishes anthologies of youth writing, produces writing contests and puts on performances at community venues. The organization serves over 1,000 young people a year, ages 6-22, who are low- income, incarcerated, immigrant, homeless and educationally disadvantaged. WritersCorps conducts workshops in public schools, community centers, detention facilities, after-school programs and in low-income housing. As of the 2010-2011 school year, San Francisco has six teaching artists who offer creative writing workshops to 600 students at ten sites, including public schools, libraries, and the juvenile justice system. Awards and Distinctions National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award In October 2010, San Francisco WritersCorps was recognized with a prestigious national award by First Lady Michelle Obama at a White House ceremony. Chosen from a pool of more than 400 nominations and 50 finalists, WritersCorps was one of 15 after-school and out-of-school programs across the country to receive the 2010 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award (formerly, the Coming Up Taller Award), the highest honor such programs can receive in the United States. The awards are administered annually by the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. The award honors WritersCorps for its effectiveness in developing creativity and fostering academic success by engaging young people in the arts and humanities. Books and Teaching Artists In 2009, City Lights published \\"Days I Moved Through Ordinary Sounds: the Teachers of WritersCorps in Poetry and Prose,\\" an anthology of poetry, fiction, memoir and playwriting by fifty teaching artists in the National WritersCorps, each of whom led writing workshops in San Francisco, Washington D.C., or the Bronx with youth in public schools, housing projects and detention facilities. In 2010, San Francisco WritersCorps independently published its first travel and poetry anthology, \\"City of Stairways: A Poet's Field Guide to San Francisco,\\" written by students in the Apprentice Program, an after-school program for advanced young writers. Part travel guide and part literary anthology, the book is 7x7 inches, to reflect the dimensions of San Francisco (7x7 miles). \\"City of Stairways\\" includes original poetry, photography, artwork, maps, and tips on neighborhoods and sites in San Francisco. The book was lauded by former mayor Gavin Newsom as \\"an engaging approach to seven San Francisco neighborhoods seen through the eyes of the newest generation of San Francisco poets.\\" Writers who have taught in WritersCorps include Stephen Beachy, Ishle Park, Jeffrey McDaniel, giovanni singleton, and Chad Sweeney.

MFI is the successor of RAGS International, a spiritual organisation founded by Pakistani spiritual leader Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi in 1980. The organisation claims to be a syncretic fulfilment of Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu prophecy, with Shahi depicted as the messianic figure of many religions, given the title of Mehdi, Messiah, and Kalki Avatar as well as the generic \\"Awaited One\\" prophesied by other religions. Adherents propose to promote the reduction of hatred, promotion of divine love and world peace, and raise awareness of miraculous images of spiritual figures they claim are on the face of such objects as the moon, sun, and the Black Stone in Mecca. According to MFI, these images were put on these locations by God. The MFI purports that Gohar Shahi's image on the moon has spoken to people in different languages and rendered spiritual grace to those searching for divine love. They declare that the titles of the Messiah, Kalki Avatar and Imam Mehdi are different titles for one personality, whom they depict as Shahi. Members of the MFI refer to themselves as Goharians, due to their affiliation with Shahi. History MFI was previously known as \\"RAGS International\\" until the year 2002, when Younus AlGohar became the CEO and formally established the organisation. At this time, AlGohar also formed MFI's sister organisation, Kalki Avatar Foundation, under the apparent guidance of Shahi. After Shahi's disappearance in 2001, Shahi's followers in the MFI declared it to be akin to miraculous occultation and continued their activities under the leadership of AlGohar, who they claim is the personally appointed representative of Shahi. In June 2018, Shahi's daughter, Farah Naz, expressed her support of the MFI and was appointed the role of 'Guardian' of the MFI. The organisation's self- proclaimed objectives are to preach Shahi's teachings of divine love and global peace. They consider it their responsibility to propagate alleged images of Shahi, Jesus Christ, Durga, and others on the Moon, Sun, and the Holy Black Stone in Mecca, which they say are \\"divine signs\\". Though MFI has not released an official count of its members, Younus AlGohar has stated that the number is in the thousands. Shahi's message presented to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Ghulam Farid Sabri by an MFI qawalist, Hafiz Nadeem Siddiqui. Shahi's alleged meeting with Jesus Shahi claimed to have met with Jesus Christ on the 29th of May 1997 in Taos, New Mexico. When asked about what was discussed between himself and Jesus, Shahi stated that it was secretive and would be revealed at \\"an appropriate time\\". After this incident, an image of Jesus Christ, which the photograph's owner claimed had appeared miraculously from pictures taken of sacred places, was shown to Shahi in Tucson, Arizona. It was then announced by Shahi to be the \\"original image of Jesus Christ.\\" The MFI has taken this to mean Shahi has the support of Jesus Christ and propagates Jesus Christ as a \\"universal figure of divinity\\" who is for humanity rather than being confined to Christianity. Teachings and Beliefs They profess to be peace-promoting. They condemn hate-preaching, especially in the context of religion. Their teachings, based on the Goharian Philosophy of Mystical Sciences and Divine Love, are purported to be acceptable to all regardless of religious affiliation or nationality. Method According to their methodology, God's love is implanted in the heart when one's heart is initiated with God's name. In this approach, the name of God is supposed to become synchronised within the heartbeats to produce \\"divine energy\\" which would then clean the heart and implant love of God so as to connect the aspirant with God. It is referred to Zikr-e-Qalb in Islamic terminology and \\"Simran\\" in Hindu terminology. The MFI claims to not be influenced by any one religion or faith and do not discriminate against anyone based on \\"nation, religion, cast, creed\\", etc. The organisation purports that religions have both an inner dimension and outer. The teachings state that the outer part of the religion is the rituals and bodily worship while the inner religion is purification of the heart and souls to gain connection with God. In their beliefs, the inner religion is the core while the outer religion is like a \\"potato skin\\" Part of their claims is that the spiritual system within the religions today has diminished. They propose to \\"convert the hearts towards divine love\\" rather than to a particular religion. AlGohar asserts that because the MFI does not lay emphasis on rituals and worship, people from different religions can follow their teachings while practicing their own faith. Eschatology The MFI maintains that the world is passing through its twilight phase. Members propagate that the world is supposed to end in 2026, when a comet would collide with Earth in accordance with Shahi's predictions in The Religion of God They also declare that the only hope for humanity is Shahi and that his image they propagate to be on the Moon will provide salvation for humanity \\"when calamity strikes\\". Claimed miracles *The MFI believes in spiritual healing, offering that service to the wider community. It claims to heal all diseases and ailments including HIV and AIDS; and also claims that it has done so in the past. They also publicise that the alleged image of Shahi on the Moon performs healing. *The MFI claims divine intervention caused a sandstorm during an attack on an MFI procession in Faisalabad, Pakistan. Members were allegedly attacked with bricks and bullets by local Muslims angered by the claims that Shahi represented the Mehdi. Reports provided show that such had happened, but none of the members were injured, to which the members credited the \\"miracle\\". The Religion of God by Shahi Before his disappearance, Shahi penned a book, Deen-e-Ilahi (literally \\"the Religion of God\\"). Deen-e-Ilahi explains secrets of spirituality as per the understanding of Shahi. On the front cover, Shahi states, \\"This book requires unruffled concentration and attention, pondering and research from all religious sects and every man. It poses a challenge for those who reject the existence of Spirituality.\\" Originally Deen-e-Ilahi was written in Urdu, the native tongue of Shahi, however the book is available in English, Dutch, Arabic, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Persian, Portuguese, Sindhi, Spanish, Thai, and Tamil as well. MFI distributes the book for free and through Balboa Press, with whom they republished the book in English on May 17, 2012. As of June 29, 2012, it was #5 on the publisher's Best Seller's List. Deen-e-Ilahi is now banned in Pakistan, due to it allegedly carrying material offensive to Muslims. Controversy MFI has been opposed by religious groups particularly in Pakistan. Many cases, later proved false, have been instigated against Shahi. In regards to this subject, the following is written in The Religion of God, written by Shahi: > The Wahhabi denomination has very religiously taken it to persecute, > discourage, entrap and eradicate His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi. Hence, > they instigated various false cases against His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi. > They have been threatened by the universality of His Divine Eminence’s > message of Divine Love, and His ever-increasing fame on the global sphere. The government of Pakistan also banned The Religion of God and his magazine Hatif-e-Mehdi for allegedly \\"...[containing] matter which is objectionable and maliciously intended to outrage the religious feelings of the Muslims and these should be seized\\". AlGohar has also been persecuted by the government of Pakistan, having been issued a death sentence for allegedly blaspheming, though details of his blasphemy have not been disclosed. Messiah Foundation International claims that the Pakistani government has persecuted and jailed some 50 MFI members under false charges of blasphemy against Islam. First Information Reports have been registered against officials of MFI in Pakistan. In a related incident, an armed group hijacked a bus in Faisalabad, claimed that their leader was the Imam Mehdi, and went on to have a shootout with the police. This had been falsely attributed to Messiah Foundation International. The leader, Shahbaz Khan, claimed in an interview with a Pakistani newspaper to be supported by the alleged billionaire and hypnotist Younus AlGohar. These claims were not verified. A press release by MFI stated that \\"The false claimant Shahbaz has no association with MFI. Shahbaz is a severely misguided and blasphemous to His Holiness Gohar Shahi. Shahbaz, the impostor has demanded the government to deal with Goharians harshly which suggests that he does not belong to MFI\\". It is also stated in the same press release that MFI believes Shahi to be the only awaited Imam Mehdi and does not support Shahbaz Khan. In an open letter to the former President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, Younus AlGohar demanded justice be served to the 50 or so MFI members who had been persecuted because Khan claimed to be associated with MFI. In addition, the Sunday Telegraph stated that \\"There is no suggestion that [Messiah Foundation International] either organised [Shahbaz] Ahmed's actions in Pakistan or knew what he and his disciples were planning\\". Due to the nature of topics covered in speeches by AlGohar released onto the internet, some Muslims in Pakistan have staged protests against MFI and declared them infidels. Furthermore, newspapers in Pakistan reported protesters demanding that MFI members be punished. Persecution Extract written by Eric Lubbock, 4th Baron Avebury, in his report on the MFI. > On 11 August 2008 a blasphemy case 295A, PPC was registered against eight > MFI members by the Khatam-e-Nabuwwat (FIR No. 281/2008, Date of Occurrence 8 > August 2008), at Police Station Kotri, District Jamshoro, Sindh Province, > Pakistan.

It was reported on 4 August 2009 in the daily Safeer, that Mr > Paras Masih, organiser for the Christian community of the MFI, had been > murdered in Karachi. In another case, members of MFI in Pakistan were arrested and charged for claiming Shahi as being the Imam Mehdi. According to Dawn.com, > 2005 – December 23: Five members of the Mehdi Foundation International were > arrested in Wapda Town, Lahore, for putting up posters of their leader Riaz > Gohar Shahi showing him as 'Imam Mehdi'. The Anti-Terrorism Court sentenced > each to five years of imprisonment under 295-A of PPC. Their prisoners’ > records posted outside the cell falsely indicate that they had been > sentenced under 295-C – the Blasphemy Law. The prisoners \\"were forced to parade naked, hung up in the air and beaten\\", and were sexually abused in jail by staff members. MFI Members in Tihar Jail On April 23, 2007, 63 Pakistani MFI members, having obtained tourist visas to India, protested in front of the Pakistani Embassy in Yantra Mantra, New Delhi, India, against the government of Pakistan. They asked India for asylum, refusing to return to their homeland. During their protests, they burnt their passports and travel documents that tied them to Pakistan, Pakistani flags, and effigies of Pervez Musharraf and Maulana Fazlur Rehman. They were subsequently arrested for having no travel documentation and therefore being in India illegally. It is reported that they feared for their lives in Pakistan, where if they went back they would be charged with the Blasphemy Law, the penalty for which is death. According to Zee News, IBN Live, Outlook India and other newspapers, the Pakistani government had banned their practice of faith in Pakistan. Among the 63 members were 19 women, 5 of whom are pregnant in \\"advanced stages\\" and 7 children. The DNA reports, \\"The Pakistani judges said they were shocked to see 16 Pakistani prisoners had lost their mental balance in Amritsar jail.\\" Later, the United Nations Human Rights Council in New Delhi recommended to the government of India that the Pakistan nationals should not be deported back \\"till a proper decision on their request for asylum is taken by the government.\\" On the 22nd of May 2007, in front of Indian Embassy in London, the MFI staged a demonstration to bring attention to the situation of their members in jail and the dangers they faced if the Indian government decided to deport them to Pakistan. In the 2007 annual report on Pakistan, Human Rights Without Frontiers appealed to the National Human Rights Commission in India about the MFI case: \\"Is the Commission aware of the case of the planned deportation by India of 62 Pakistani citizens...? [India]is a secular democracy observing high standards of human rights including the right of peaceful practice of religion, and Pakistani Muslims consider that the religious beliefs of the Mehdi Foundation International are blasphemous, making its followers vulnerable to criminal charges for which the penalty is death under the controversial Pakistani Blasphemy Act.\\" The NHRC stated in reply that \\"The Commission...will examine...the most appropriate follow-up\\". However, the Telegraph in Calcutta, as well as other Indian newspapers, reported on November 26, 2009 that the plea to involve the National Human Rights Commission had been rejected by the government of India and that the Pakistani nationals were being put in the process of deportation despite the fact that, upon deportation, they would be charged under the blasphemy laws in Pakistan. In December 2010, however, the Hindustan Times reported that the Delhi high court had issued a protection order for the inmates, preventing their deportation for 70 days as of December 2. Mail Today reported in March 2011 that the UNHCR was asked by the Indian High Commission to conduct interviews of the jail members and grant them asylum in countries other than India within 6 weeks of December 2, 2010. This was extended another 3 weeks, but the possibility of them being deported to Pakistan had not been ruled out. In April 2011, though the Centre wished to deport the Pakistani nationals, the Delhi High Court ordered the Centre to wait until it made a decision on a plea to hand them over to the United Nations High Commission of Refugees. On April 21, 2011, the Times of India and other Indian newspapers reported that the Indian government had granted the MFI members in jail refugee status and had requested the UNHCR to search for a third country for their relocation. In December 2011, various newspapers disclosed that the 65 MFI members from Tihar Jail had been granted refugee status and were being sent to Canada and the United States. They are now settled in said countries. Protests Protestors occupying the street outside the Indian Embassy, London MFI has held many protests and rallies over the years to bring attention to the way their members are treated in the country of Pakistan and about their cause. They staged demonstrations on August 16, 2005 in front of the Pakistan high commission in London and on August 25, 2005 on 10 Downing Street, London, UK. On July 25, 2005, MFI members in Pakistan staged a rally in front of the Parliament of Pakistan in Islamabad to express their support for Pervez Musharraf in his anti-terrorism endeavours. The MFI also has called for Wahhabism to be banned in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and India, due to its alleged link to terrorism and hate preaching. Due in part to their efforts in India to raise awareness of Zakir Naik's link to Wahhabism, he was declared a proclaimed offender by the National Investigation Agency and his Indian passport was revoked. Expansion Messiah/Mehdi Foundation International has centres in Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Greece, Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, Nepal, Japan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. In association with their sister organisation, Kalki Avatar Foundation, the organisation has centres located in Sri Lanka and India, where they have been featured on television.

In August 2009, the High Court of Australia ruled that the AMC was unconstitutional according to the Constitution of Australia, putting the 171 cases the court had tried in doubt. In May 2010, the Australian Government announced a new Military Court of Australia (MCA) to replace the provisional system established after the dissolution of the AMC and to provide an appropriate military judiciary for the Australian Defence Force. Establishment The Australian Military Court was created when the Parliament of Australia passed the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, adding Section 114 to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982,. and commenced on 1 October 2007. It replaced the previous systems of individually convened trial by court-martial or defence force magistrate. Structure The Australian Military Court consisted of a Chief Military Judge, two permanent Military Judges, and a part-time panel of reserve Military Judges. The first Chief Military Judge was Brigadier Ian Westwood, who was sworn in with the two Permanent Military Judges (Colonel Peter Morrison and Lieutenant Colonel Jennifer Woodward) on 1 October 2007.Australian Military Court opens, The Daily Telegraph, 3 October 2007. Depending on the nature and severity of the offence, the Defence Force Discipline Act made provision for cases to be tried before a single judge, or in more serious cases (such as those committed in the face of the enemy, mutiny, desertion or commanding a Service offence), a jury. Although based in Canberra, the AMC was able to conduct trials anywhere in Australian territories and overseas in operational areas where Australian forces were serving.Military Justice, Department of Defence (Australia). High Court challenge The constitutional validity of the Australian Military Court was successfully challenged in the High Court of Australia by a former Royal Australian Navy Leading Seaman, in the case Lane v Morrison commencing on 16 January 2009.. In August 2005, the sailor and three other military personnel were on a recruitment drive in the Queensland town of Roma. After a game of golf and consumption of a quantity of beer, he was alleged to have \\"tea- bagged\\" a sergeant from the Australian Army, that is, placed his testicles on the man's forehead as he slept in a motel bed. Two years later, the Navy charged him with indecent assault on a superior officer, and he was scheduled to be tried before the Australian Military Court on 25 March 2008.Nicholson, Brendan: The curious case that sank a court system, The Age, 27 August 2009. On 26 August 2009, the High Court ruled that the Australian Military Court was not a Chapter III Court for the purposes of the Constitution of Australia, and that the legislation creating it was invalid as it was a court of record which \\"[was] to exercise the judicial power of the commonwealth\\" by making binding and authoritative judgements independent of the Australian Defence Force chain of command.'Teabagging' case challenge: court ruled invalid, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 26 August 2009. Proposed Military Court of Australia On 24 May 2010 the Australian Federal Government through the Attorney-General Robert McClelland and Defence Minister John Faulkner announced a proposal for a new Military Court of Australia,Woodley, Naomi: Government announces new military court, ABC News (Australia), 24 May 2010. to replace the interim measures put in place after the High Court invalidated the Australian Military Court in 2008. The court would have been independent of the military, with all court appointees having either past military experience or knowledge of the services. Faulkner stated that the proposed new specialist court would deliver \\"a system of military justice for ADF members that combines the necessary independence and constitutional protections for the judiciary with an understanding of the vital importance of military discipline in the operation of our armed forces. \\"Timely and fair trials in the new court will enhance military justice and promote discipline in the ADF, which in turn will contribute to improved morale and operational effectiveness. While judicial officers with knowledge of the military system are necessary, they may not be currently serving Defence Force or Reserve members. McClelland says these measures will ensure the court remains independent. \\"Judicial officers appointed to the new Military Court of Australia will have the same independence and constitutional protections that apply in other federal courts\\", he said. A bill setting out the shape and structure of the court was introduced to Parliament in 2012.. The bill lapsed with the prorogation of Parliament for the 2013 Australian federal election and has not been reintroduced. In the absence of a military court, the current military justice system involves the use of courts martial and \\"Defence Force Magistrate\\" trials.

During that time, United States Marine Corps (USMC) service members and their families living at the base bathed in and ingested tap water that was contaminated with harmful chemicals at concentrations from 240 to 3400 times levels permitted by safety standards. An undetermined number of former base residents later developed cancer or other ailments, which many blame on the contaminated drinking water. Victims claim that USMC leaders concealed knowledge of the problem and did not act properly in trying to resolve it or notify former base residents that their health might be at risk. In 2009 the U.S. federal government initiated investigations into the allegations of contaminated water and failures by U.S. Marine officials to act on the issue. In August 2012, President Obama signed the Janey Ensminger Act into law to begin providing medical care for people who may have been affected by the contamination. In February 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the contaminated water at Lejeune significantly increased the risk of multiple diseases including liver cancer, kidney cancer and ALS. Contamination Early reports From at least 1953 through 1985, Marines and personnel of any branch of the armed forces and their families stationed at Camp Lejeune's main base, barracks, family, temporary housing, Tarawa Terrace and Hadnot Point (for thirty days or more) drank and bathed in water contaminated with toxins at concentrations from 240 to 3400 times levels permitted by safety standards. As a result, at least 850 former residents filed claims for nearly $4 billion from the military. The contamination appears to have affected the water from two of the eight water treatment plants on the base.Altman, Howard, \\"Lejeune Water Haunts Marines\\", Tampa Tribune, January 16, 2011, p. 1. The main chemicals involved were volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as perchloroethylene (PCE), a dry cleaning solvent, and trichloroethylene (TCE), a degreaser; however, more than 70 chemicals have been identified as contaminants at Lejeune. The base's wells were shut off in the mid-1980s, after which the water met federal standards, then they were placed back online in violation of the law. The National Resource Council of the National Academies released a report based upon a literature review of PCE and TCE in July 2009\\\\. The report failed to assess other contaminants, such as benzene and vinyl chloride, and concluded that the water at the base was tainted between 1950 and 1985, but that the contamination could not be linked to any health problems.Washington Times, \\"Contaminated Water At Base Spurs Suit\\", July 7, 2009, p. 6.Maurer, Kevin (Associated Press), \\"Congressman to introduce bill on Lejeune water\\", Military Times, October 6, 2009. However, an October 2010 letter from the Director of the government agency tasked to study health effects at Superfund sites, such as Camp Lejeune, illustrated the limitations of the 2009 literature review and advised that there \\"was undoubtedly a hazard associated with drinking the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune\\".October 22, 2010 letter from Dr. Poitier, ATSDR to Donald Schregardus, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy In 1980 the base began testing the water for trihalomethanes in response to new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). That same year, a laboratory from the U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency began finding halogenated hydrocarbons in the water. In March 1981 one of the lab's reports, which was delivered to U.S. Marine officials, stated, \\"Water is highly contaminated with other chlorinated hydrocarbons (solvents)!\\"Barrett, Barbara, \\"Warnings about Camp Lejeune's tainted water unheeded for years\\", Stars and Stripes, April 18, 2010. Possible sources of the contamination include solvents from a nearby, off-base dry cleaning company, from on-base units using chemicals to clean military equipment, and leaks from underground fuel storage tanks. In 1982, a private company, Grainger Laboratories, contracted by the USMC to examine the problem provided the base commander with a report showing that the wells supplying water for the base were contaminated with trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. The contractor delivered repeated warnings to base officials, including base chemist Elizabeth Betz, that the water was contaminated. A representative from Grainger, Mike Hargett, stated that he went with Betz in July 1982 to inform an unnamed Marine lieutenant colonel who was deputy director of base utilities about the problems with the water. According to Hargett, the Marine was unwilling to discuss Hargett's concerns. In August 1982, a Grainger chemist, Bruce Babson, sent a letter to the base commander, Marine Major General D. J. Fulham, warning him that the base wells appeared to be poisoned. The water from the contaminated wells, however, continued in use at the base.Zucchino, David, \\"The Few, The Proud, The Stricken: A rare cancer cluster is found in families who used tainted Camp Lejeune water. Some fault Marine officials.\\" Los Angeles Times, August 26, 2009, p. 10. Grainger continued to warn Marine officials of problems with the water in December 1982, March 1983, and September 1983. In a spring 1983 report to the EPA, Lejeune officials stated that there were no environmental problems at the base. In June 1983, North Carolina's water supply agency asked Lejeune officials for Grainger's lab reports on the water testing. Marine officials declined to provide the reports to the state agency. In December 1983 Lejeune officials scaled back the water testing performed by Grainger. Further reports In July 1984, a different company contracted under the EPA's Superfund review of Lejeune and other sites found benzene in the base's water, along with PCE and TCE. Marine officials shut down one of the contaminated wells in November 1984 and the rest in early 1985. The Marines notified North Carolina of the contamination in December 1984\\\\. At this time the Marines did not disclose that benzene had been discovered in the water and stated to the media that the EPA did not mandate unacceptable levels of PCE and TCE. In 1997 the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) investigated the well water and concluded that cancerous effects in personnel exposed to the water was unlikely. According to a federal investigation, ATSDR investigators overlooked evidence of benzene in the water when preparing the report.Barrett, Barbara, \\"Congress Wants Answers On Water Contamination At Lejeune\\", Raleigh News & Observer, September 14, 2010, p. 1. On April 28, 2009, the ATSDR admitted that the water had been contaminated with benzene and withdrew the 1997 report. The benzene most likely occurred as a result of 800,000 gallons of fuel that leaked from the base fuel farm during the years in question. The fuel leaks occurred near the main well that serves Hadnot Point, location of enlisted and officer's quarters and the base hospital.Barrett, Barbara, \\"Marine Base's Ex-Residents, Many Ill, Only Now Learning Of Toxic Water\\", Raleigh News & Observer, February 14, 2010. For unknown reasons, the presence of benzene in the water had been omitted from the official report that the USMC submitted for federal health review in 1992, in spite of the USMC being aware of the presence of the chemical. The report had been prepared by a contractor, Baker Corp.Maurer, Kevin, (Associated Press), \\"Report on Marines’ water omitted cancer chemical\\", Stars and Stripes, February 18, 2010. State officials had also reportedly informed the ATSDR in 1994 about the presence of benzene in the water. Responses and actions Notifications and responses to initial investigations In 1999 the USMC began to notify former base residents that they might have consumed contaminated water. The notifications were directed by a federal health study examining possible birth defects among children born at the base during the contamination years. Up to this point, many families potentially affected by the water contamination attributed rare illnesses and cancers in their families to bad luck. In 2005 the US Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigated the USMC's handling of the issue, and reported that they found no criminal conduct by USMC officials. In 2007, however, one of the EPA investigators told Congress that he had recommended obstruction of justice charges against some Camp Lejeune officials, but had been overruled by Justice department prosecutors. In 2007, Jerry Ensminger, a retired Marine master sergeant, found a document dated 1981 that described a radioactive dump site near a rifle range at the camp. According to the report, the waste was laced with strontium-90, an isotope known to cause cancer and leukemia. According to Camp Lejeune's installation restoration program manager, base officials learned in 2004 about the 1981 document. Ensminger served in the Marine Corps for 24 and a half years, and lived for part of that time at Camp Lejeune. In 1985 his 9-year-old daughter, Janey, died of cancer. An advocacy group called The Few, The Proud, The Forgotten was created to inform possible victims of the contamination at Lejeune. The group's website includes an introduction with some basic information about the contamination at Lejeune, including that many health problems various types of cancer, leukemia, miscarriages and birth defects, have been noted in people who drank the contaminated water. According to their site, numerous base housing areas were affected by the contamination, including Tarawa Terrace, Midway Park, Berkeley Manor, Paradise Point, Hadnot Point, Hospital Point, and Watkins Village and Knox Trailer Park (Frenchman's Point). In 2008, the USMC began a Congressionally required notification campaign to notify former base residents of the issue. An online health registry now contains more than 135,000 names. United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has determined that a former servicemember's cancer was caused by his exposure to the contaminated water. Paul Buckley, a USMC veteran who was diagnosed with incurable hematological malignancy, was stationed at Camp Lejeune in the 1980s.Sawyer, Diane, and Steve Osunsami, \\"Toxic Water\\", ABC World News, March 19, 2010. In March 2010 the VA decided that Buckley's cancer was directly linked to his ingestion of contaminated water at Camp Lejeune and awarded him 100% disability benefits.Jontz, Sandra, \\"VA Ruling On Former Marine's Illness May Affect Thousands\\", Stars and Stripes, March 27, 2010. On February 22, 2012, the VA agreed that retired Marine Frank Rachowicz' terminal cancer was caused by exposure to the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.Mason, Anthony, \\"Contaminated Water\\", CBS Evening News, May 28, 2012 Lawsuits Laura Jones On July 6, 2009, Laura Jones, who has lymphoma, filed a suit against the U.S. government over the contaminated water at the base. Jones previously lived at the base where her husband, a Marine, was stationed. The U.S. Navy requested a dismissal of the case, stating that the statute of limitations had expired and that regulations at the time did not include contaminants such as trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, vinyl chloride and benzene. U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle, however, rejected the Navy's arguments and ruled that the suit could go forward. Said Boyle, \\"The Department of the Navy's unwillingness to release information regarding contamination at Camp Lejeune or to provide notice to former residents remains relevant in that such conduct limited the information available to potential clients.\\"Barrett, Barbara, \\"Judge: Lejeune Suit Can Proceed\\", Raleigh News & Observer, February 25, 2010. Boyle dismissed a claim by the Navy in November 2010 that Jones had violated the 10-year statute of repose. Said Boyle, \\"To summarily bar such claims from entering the courthouse would be a profound miscarriage of justice.\\"Barrett, Barbara, \\"Judge Refuses To Dismiss Camp Lejeune Water Exposure Lawsuit\\", McClatchy News Service, 10 November 2010. Joel Shriberg In January 2011, retired Marine Joel P. Shriberg filed suit against the US Government, claiming that Lejeune's contaminated water caused his breast cancer. Shriberg was stationed at Lejeune from September 1957 through April 1959.Barrett, Barbara, \\"Suit Blames Lejeune For Cancer\\", Raleigh News & Observer, 25 January 2011. Multi District Litigation: PreTrial Consolidation, 2011–present In 2011, 10 lawsuits were consolidated in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Georgia. In October 2014, a federal appeals court rejected the North Carolina legislature's attempt to extend a time limit for filing pollution-related lawsuits. On October 14, 2014, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ruled that CERCLA did not preempt North Carolina's statutory limits. U.S. Congressional Action  2009–2010 In October 2009 North Carolina Congressman Brad Miller announced his intention to add a companion bill to Richard Burr's \\"Caring for Camp Lejeune Veterans Act of 2009\\" to provide assistance to possible victims of the Lejeune water contamination. The proposed bills would authorize treatment at a US Veterans Administration facility to any veteran or family member who was based at Camp Lejeune during the time the water was contaminated and suffers from adverse health effects.Barrett, Barbara, \\"Vote On Lejeune Contamination Expected This Month\\", McClatchy, 10 June 2011. In response to Miller's recommendation that the Navy reassess the issue, the Navy announced in December 2009 that it would review the 1998 study into the water contamination at the base.Maurer, Kevin, \\"Navy to pay for review of Lejeune water study\\", Military Times, December 4, 2009.Maurer, Kevin, \\"Rep. wants fed probe of Lejeune water reports\\" Military Times, February 18, 2010. Miller and Burr's proposed bill, renamed \\"Caring for Camp Lejeune Veterans Act of 2011\\", was approved by the Veteran's Affairs Committee on 29 June 2011 and was sent to the full House and Senate for approval. The bill was expected to cost $3.9 billion over 10 years and directed the Department of Defense to pay, and the VA to provide the care, for victims of the water contamination.Barrett, Barbara, \\"Health Care For Camp Lejeune Veterans Clears Senate Hurdle\\", McClatchy, June 29, 2011 (wire service report).Philpott, Tom, \\"Commissary Savings At Risk To Help Ill Lejeune Vets\\", Kitsap Sun, 1 July 2011. In February 2010, Senator Richard Burr stated that he would hold the nominations of two top Navy civilian officials- Paul Luis Oostburg Sanz as Navy general counsel and Jackalyne Pfannenstiel as assistant Navy secretary for installations and the environment, until the Navy confirmed that it had funded and initiated programs to study the mortality rate of possible victims of the contamination and a plan to compensate any victims for their injuries.Maze, Rick, \\"Navy nominations held up by Lejeune studies\\", Military Times, February 22, 2010. The Navy notified Burr the week of March 1, 2010 that it had released $8.8 million to fund the requested study and Burr allowed the nominations of Sanz and Pfannenstiel to go forward. The study will be conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).Barrett, Barbara, \\"Navy Antes Up For Lejeune Study\\", Raleigh News & Observer, March 3, 2010. In March 2010 a congressional investigation led by Miller asked the Navy and a contractor, Baker Environmental Inc., for documents related to the contamination issue. Miller also asked for access to the Navy's electronic database of documents related to the contamination, which heretofore had not been made publicly accessible. Said Miller, \\"We want to know what did [the Navy and the Marine Corps] know about the water, when did they know, and what did they do about it?\\"Barrett, Barbara, \\"Miller Sets Deadline To Get The Facts On Lejeune Water Pollution\\", Raleigh News & Observer, March 10, 2010. On March 22, 2010, the ATSDR formally complained to the USMC for withholding details of and access to databases containing more than 700,000 electronic documents related to the water contamination. Said ATSDR Deputy Director Thomas Sinks, \\"It's interesting that there is information that we continue to discover that we need to go through.\\" The Navy/USMC responded by providing access to ATSDR to the databases and denied that there was any intent to withhold documents from the investigation, saying that all of the documents had already been provided in hard copy. Access to the databases, however, was not provided to two panels advising the US Government on the contamination issue, with the USMC saying that the panel members must use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain access to the documents.Levesque, William R., \\"Marines Keeping Files Secret?\\", St. Petersburg Times, March 30, 2010, p. 1. In September 2010 Miller and the oversight subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Science and Technology held hearings into the contamination. The committee focused in part on the 1997 ATSDR report and on a booklet the USMC released in July 2010 about the contamination which Miller described as \\"more public relations than public health.\\" Congressional investigators and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have asked the Marine Corps to retract the booklet, which contains information its critics have called \\"misleading\\".Barrett, Barbara, \\"Camp Lejeune Water Pamphlet Comes Under Fire\\", Raleigh News & Observer, February 1, 2011. 2011–present In April 2011, five members of Congress, including Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, Senators Kay Hagan and Richard Burr and Representative Brad Miller of North Carolina, and Representative John Dingell of Michigan, sent the Navy a letter criticizing the service's continued behavior regarding the water contamination issue. In the letter, the members accused the Navy of continuing to mischaracterize the 2009 report by the National Academy of the Sciences' National Research Council, which concluded there was no concrete link between the chemicals trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene and a host of ailments suffered by veterans and family. The Navy states that the report also assessed benzene exposure, which is false, according to the members' letter. Also, the letter criticized the Navy for not agreeing to a communications protocol with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to allow that agency to review all Navy public relations material related to the contamination issue. The letter pointed out that the Marine website with information on the contamination did not contain direct links to the ATSDR website documenting their study of the issue.Barrett, Barbara, \\"Lawmakers Blast Navy Over Lejeune Water Contamination\\", The McClatchy Company, April 15, 2011. In June 2011 the Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry began sending a survey to approximately 350,000 former employees or residents of Camp Lejeune. The purpose of the survey was to determine what diseases may be linked to the water contamination. The agency's report is expected to be completed in 2014.Sun, Lena H., \\"Survey Seeks Data On Camp Lejeune Illnesses\\", The Washington Post, June 27, 2011, p. 15. In 2011 a documentary film on the water contamination was produced and released by Wider Film Projects/Tracks Films called Semper Fi: Always Faithful. The film, directed by Tony Hardmon and Rachel Libert, made the 15 film short list for consideration for a 2012 Academy Award for best documentary feature.Fears, Darryl, \\"Film Examines Camp Lejeune Tragedy\\", The Washington Post, January 22, 2012, p. 3; IMDB.com, \\"Semper Fi: Always Faithful (2011)\\". On April 20, 2012, members of both the House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committees signed a letter to President Obama asking that health care for Camp Lejeune contamination victims be expedited. Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki responded that providing healthcare to Camp Lejeune veterans was \\"premature.\\" The Government Accountability Office, on May 2, 2012, issued a report recommending that the DoD update its processes for addressing possible health effects from toxic exposure. Retired Marine drill instructor Jerry Ensminger started a petition requesting that the US Government begin providing healthcare to Camp Lejeune veterans exposed to the toxic water.Wilcox, Amanda, \\"Push Continues For Lejeune Toxic Water Victims\\", Jacksonville Daily News, May 31, 2012 More than 136,000 people signed Jerry Ensminger's Change.org petition. In February 2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its report on the effects of the water contamination. The report found that Lejeune Marines had about a 10 percent higher risk of dying from any type of cancer compared to the Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton. Lejeune Marines had a 35 percent higher risk of kidney cancer, a 42 percent higher risk of liver cancer, a 47 percent higher risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, a 68 percent higher risk of multiple myeloma, and double the risk of ALS.Fox, Maggie, \\"Camp Lejeune Study Finds Higher Cancer Death Risk\\", NBC News, 20 February 2014 Janey Ensminger Act On July 18, 2012, the US Senate passed a bill, called the Janey Ensminger Act in honor of Jerry Ensminger and his daughter Janey who died of cancer at age 9, authorizing medical care to military and family members who had resided at the base between 1957 and 1987 and developed conditions linked to the water contamination. The measure applies to up to 750,000 people.Ordonez, Franco, (McClatchy), \\"Senate Passes Lejeune Water- Contamination Bill\\", Raleigh News & Observer, July 19, 2012 The House approved the bill on July 31, 2012.Ordonez, Franco, \\"Congress Helps Camp Lejeune Families Hurt By Tainted Water\\", McClatchy, 1 August 2012 President Obama signed the bill into law on August 6, 2012.Ordonez, Franco, and Barbara Barrett, (McClatchy), \\"Obama Signs Law Giving Health Care To Lejeune Tainted- Water Victims\\", Raleigh News & Observer, August 7, 2012 The bill applies to 15 specific ailments believed to be linked to the contamination, including cancer of the esophagus, lung, breast, bladder or kidney; leukemia; multiple myeloma; myleodysplasic syndromes; renal toxicity; hepatic steatosis; female infertility; miscarriage; scleroderma; or neurobehavioral effects or non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. The Department of Veterans Affairs is assigned by the bill to provide the medical care. To fund the medical care, the bill extends higher fees for VA home loan guarantees to October 1, 2017.Philpott, Tom, \\"'First step of justice' for ailing Camp Lejeune vets, families\\", Stars and Stripes, August 9, 2012 References External links *USMC site about contamination *Document Display NEPIS US EPA *C-SPAN Q&A; interview with Jerry Ensminger and Rachel Libert about Semper Fi: Always Faithful, April 1, 2012 *Trailer for Semper Fi: Always Faithful: Semper Fi: Always Faithful The Award-Winning Documentary Film *Report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention *Report by Amanda Greene StarNews \\"Family attributed health problems to bad luck but now think Lejeune's water the source\\" Category:Environment of North Carolina Category:Water pollution in the United States Category:United States military scandals Category:United States Marine Corps in the 20th century Category:Environmental disasters in the United States Category:Onslow County, North Carolina Category:Superfund sites in North Carolina ","title":"Camp Lejeune water contamination"},{"id":"24124823","text":"Ao Vivo e Acústico no Som do Mato is the fourth album from Brazilian blues/rock band O Bando do Velho Jack, and was released in 2004.

It features static graphics on some platforms. The plot focuses on Lancelot's quest to find the Holy Grail. Plot Designed by Peter Austin with in-game text by Christina Erskine and Peter McBride,MobyGames Lancelot Credits (DOS). Lancelot describes the adventures of Sir Lancelot as recounted in Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur.The Interactive Fiction Database Lancelot. Like other interactive fiction releases from Level 9 such as Scapeghost, gameplay is divided into three parts. Lancelot's overall objectives are to complete the Order of the Knights of the Round Table and ultimately to recover the Holy Grail. The lore drawn from Arthurian legend allows for a vast range of familiar settings (such as Camelot, Tintagel, and Winchester) and characters (like Merlin, Arthur, Guenever, and Lancelot's son Galahad). As Lancelot grows in power and completes quests, several knights and ladies accompany him on his travels, and many of these non-player characters can be controlled by providing instructions through the game's parser. These supporting characters include the Damosel Maledisant, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Tristram, and several others. Lancelot's first challenge is to face the Black Knight in combat. If he is merciful with him, Lancelot learns that the knight is really the disguised King Arthur, who invites Lancelot to become part of his order of knights. At his knighting the next day, Lancelot discovers his feelings for Guenever, and seeks to prove his worth to her. Arthur tasks Lancelot with scouring the kingdom to recover several lost knights, including Sir Meliot,David Nash Ford's Early British Kingdoms Sir Meliot de Logres: Arthurian Literary Character. Sir Lamorak, Sir Bors, and Sir Gawain, many of whom are held captive by rebel lords. To prove his honor, Lancelot must only engage in combat when provoked. The final stage of the story sees Lancelot setting off from Castle Vagon with Sir Galahad in search of the Holy Grail.

From the Kabaw Valley they shifted southwards to the Yaw Valley and settled in their present location in the southern Chin Hills (Samee, Kanpetlet, Matupi and Mindat township). Social Life The majority of Chho people are farmers. They usually live on the farm as long as there is work, so they may live in the village for only two or three months out of the year. Hospitality The Chho people have always shown hospitality to any guests, even to a complete stranger, without any differences or discrimination. If there is a traveler passing through their village during a storm, a rainy day, or at night, they will invite them to stay, occasionally insisting upon it. Revenge-Murder In contrary to their hospitality, murder for the cause of revenge is the strangest tradition they keep. The root cause for this tradition is not known. However, this tradition is not observed in other Mizo people living nearby (the Chinboi, Yindu and Yaw tribes). In 1968, the Burmese government attempted to eradicate this tradition of revenge-murder. In the beginning, the people were afraid their tradition would be completely eradicated, which resulted in higher rate of murder. Till 1973, the murder record was much less than before.Aung Ngai Htang: A study of the revenge-murder of Cho (Chin) in Mindat Township, Chin State. Mandalay University. 1974. p. 1-64.

He was one of the original \\"Swingin' Seven DJs\\" who brought rock and roll into its first major market in 1958 at KFWB in Hollywood. He was in radio for over 60 years and was honored by the Nevada Broadcasters in 2005, when he was inducted into their Hall Of Fame. Early life and radio career Born in Oklahoma City, Quillin moved to El Paso, Texas where he finished high school and attended the Texas College of Mines and Metallurgy (now the University of Texas at El Paso). During this time, while still in high school Ted started his broadcast career at KEPO, an ABC station in El Paso. He started as a ‘gofer’ on a morning show from 6 to 7 AM, before he went to school. He graduated to staff announcer. After that he took a job in Corpus Christi, Texas, at KSIX. The program director from KXYZ in Houston heard him, and hired him as a staff announcer. From there he went to WACO in Waco, Texas. Ted moved to KELP-El Paso which was a Gordon McClendon station, doing top 40. This is where he met Chuck Blore and when Chuck got the call to Hollywood he took Ted with him and Ted became one of the original \\"Seven Swingin’ Gentlemen\\", who took Rock and Roll into its first major market, at KFWB.

Ted was at KORK for several years and later opened an advertising agency in the city. During the days at his agency he did months and sometime years of DJ work on several local radio stations, including KLAV. People in broadcasting in Vegas knew Ted and would call him when they got in a ‘pinch’ to fill in for them, and sometimes this ‘fill-in’ would last for a year or more. During this period he taught a class on communications at Las Vegas City College. Ted did a show for Armed Forces Radio & Television Network for many years and was heard on 530 radio stations worldwide. This show was broadcast while he was in Hollywood as well as after he moved permanently to Las Vegas. Years later the Armed Forces Network was re-broadcasting Quillin's shows on their radio stations. In his later years Quillin still kept his hand in broadcasting with a Classic Country show which he did for KDSS in Ely, NV and a show on the Internet on Rock-it Radio.http://www.palmsradio.com/rockittext.htm Rockit Radio Ted always signed off any of his radio programs with his trademark slogan “Blue Skies and Green Lights.” Quillin died April 20, 2011, in Las Vegas. Awards Ted was rated #1 Personality Disc Jockey nationally, by the C. E. Hooper Audience Corp. while at KFWB. In 2005 Ted was inducted into the Broadcasters' Hall of Fame in Nevada. He received a standing ovation when he was called to accept his trophy. He was revered and respected by his peers. Don Imus spoke of him with admiration on his show.

The route is fully signed; complete with Iowa welcome and Adopt-a- Highway signs on both ends. Abbott Drive in Omaha is not a state highway, so it does not have any state line signage. Abbott Drive, in Iowa and in Nebraska, is included in the Federal Highway Administration's National Highway System. Omaha, Nebraska Looking south upon the Omaha area and Abbott Drive, June 2009 Abbott Drive continues north as an unmarked divided boulevard north from Avenue G, which is the Iowa-Nebraska state line. It wraps around Carter Lake and borders Eppley Airfield. The Arthur C. Storz Expressway branches westward, and approximately later the divided roadway ends. At North 9th Street the road becomes John J. Pershing Drive. History Abbott Drive was built in the 1950s, connecting the area of downtown Omaha where the Union Pacific Railroad Omaha Shops Facility is with Eppley Airfield in East Omaha. One of the Kountze descendants built businesses along the drive in the 1970s, including the Easy Parking Company, which was one of the first parking companies in the United States. It moved from its early offices at the Omaha Grain Exchange and built Abbott Drive at Locust Street near Eppley Airfield in 1974.(1975) Parking. National Parking Association. p 175.

Carter Lake initially maintained its section as a municipal road. In 1957, when plans were made to upgrade the airport to accommodate jet aircraft, the Iowa Department of Transportation took over the road.

Overview The first church in Heredia was a small wooden construct built as early as 1704 in an attempt to convert the natives; nothing remains of the original building, which was replaced by a larger, more permanent adobe structure in July 1736 when Heredia was granted its own independent parish. Construction on the current building began towards the end of the colonial period. The cornerstone was laid on October 31, 1797, but the church was not completed until several years later; though the exact date is unknown, it is believed to have been completed in 1806. The façade was again reconstructed in 1851 when an earthquake brought it tumbling to the ground. Over the years, a baptistry and catechism school were added, while the church gardens were enlarged. The temple exhibits a simple, whitewashed, Spanish neoclassical exterior, while the relatively unadorned interior shows the humility and faith of the people who constructed it. On the front of the church, three niches once contained statues of saints created by the famous Heredian soldier, architect, and sculptor Fadrique Gutiérrez; today, only the central statue of St. Peter remains. The 20 stained glass windows which adorn the church were made in France. Monseñor Gregorio de Jesús Benavides is buried in the church gardens.

Ba-Ba-Re-Bop\\" is a 1946 song by Lionel Hampton and His Orchestra. The song's lead vocals were performed by Lionel Hampton himself and the recording featured Herbie Fields on alto sax. The song went to number one on the R&B; Juke Box chart for sixteen non-consecutive weeks and reached number nine on the national pop charts. Although the writing of \\"Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop\\" was credited to Hampton and his drummer Curley Hamner, it was essentially a partial rewriting of Helen Humes' 1945 R&B; hit \\"Be-Baba-Leba\\", which in turn was closely related to \\"Ee-Bobaliba\\" by Jim Wynn. Precursors The song \\"Be- Baba-Leba\\" was recorded by Helen Humes with the Bill Doggett Octet in August 1945, in Los Angeles, and rose to number 3 on the Billboard R&B; chart at the end of the year.Whitburn, Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004, p.201 The writing of the song was credited to Humes, who wrote the lyrics, such as: \\"He thrills me in the morning, thrills me in the night, the way he loves me makes me scream with delight, oooh oooh oooh baba-leba....\\". The vocal choruses are interspersed with saxophone breaks by Wild Bill Moore, who was brought in by Doggett for the session. Pianist Jelly Roll Morton said that \\"Be-Baba-Leba\\"'s riff was \\"so old it's got whiskers\\", and it is close to the one on \\"Boogie Woogie\\" recorded by Jimmy Rushing with Count Basie in 1937. However, the scat wording apparently derives from \\"Ee-Bobaliba\\", a song performed by saxophonist and bandleader Jim Wynn in the early 1940s with his band, the Bobalibans. By that time, the term \\"bebop\\" or similar terms like \\"ba-re-bop\\" were becoming popular among musicians to describe the new forms of jazz being performed by such musicians as Dizzy Gillespie. Wynn recorded his song, with vocalist Claude Trenier, after Humes recorded \\"Be-Baba-Leba\\", and it did not make the chart.Dave Penny, \\"Jim Wynn\\", Black Cat Rockabilly. Retrieved 30 November 2016 Lionel Hampton recording Once Humes' record had become a hit, Decca Records rushed Lionel Hampton into the studio to record a similar song, which became \\"Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop\\". Their arrangement was similar to Jim Wynn's but added a call and response element between Hampton and his musicians, and replaced Humes' salacious verses with nonsense rhymes like: \\"Matilda Brown told old King Tut, 'If you can't say rebop keep your big mouth shut', say hey ba-ba-re-bop...\\". Hampton was already a popular and established musician, at a bigger company than Humes' Philo, and his version soon knocked Humes off the charts and went to number one on the R&B; chart for 16 weeks (a record broken at that time only by Joe Liggins' \\"The Honeydripper\\" and Louis Jordan's \\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\\"). The song is viewed in some respects as a precursor to rock and roll. Reviewer Lindsay Planer wrote of Hampton's recording: > The cut immediate gets fired up with Hampton's trademark two-fingered piano > lick as it beckons to hipsters of all stripes.

Each year the race presents a very prestigious horseracing trophy called the Haskell Invitational Trophy along with its hefty purse. The Haskell Invitational Trophy presented to the connections of Bluegrass Cat  Description of trophy  The trophy is made of four distinct segments, three of which are gold- and silver-plated. The first and most forwardly placed segment of the trophy shows three gold thoroughbreds (each approximately 3 inches tall and 5 inches long) running down the stretch toward the finish line. The second segment forms the 14-inch backdrop of the trophy; it is that of the familiar Monmouth Park Arches logo also in gold and silver plate. It is surrounded by the third portion of the trophy, four 15-inch gold-plated festival flags on the top of silver-plated flag poles. The flags were specifically chosen to help portray the festival atmosphere of the New Jersey beach track's signature event. The fourth and final segment of the trophy is a 5-inch-thick wood base shaped in a racing oval made of polished mahogany, it is faced with a 4-inch-tall silver plate engraved with the connections of the winner. The race name, year, distance and time are at the top to identify the race but the name of the horse, the owner, the trainer and the jockey are all inscribed on the plate.  History of trophy's namesake  The Haskell Invitational Handicap has marked its 42nd renewal of the race named for the first president and chairman of the Monmouth Park Jockey Club, Amory Lawrence Haskell. As a tribute to the man honored by this race, Amory L. Haskell's daughters, Hope Haskell-Jones and Anne Haskell-Ellis, present the Haskell Invitational Trophy each year. Amory L. Haskell was born in New York City in 1893. He worked at General Motors for many years and then left to form Triplex Safety Glass Company and was president and chairman of the board when he sold it. Haskell then organized a group of prominent New Jersey residents to build a modern Thoroughbred racetrack in Monmouth County. Appointed president and chairman of Monmouth Park Jockey Club in 1945, he guided that organization through its opening in 1946 and continued at the helm until his death on April 12, 1966. Monmouth Park website, Haskell Invitational Stakes homepage;http://www.thehaskell.com/history.html.  Changes in race  In 1968, the Monmouth Park directors honored his memory with the Amory L. Haskell Handicap, a race for older horses. In 1981, the Haskell name was transferred to a mile and an eighth invitational for the nation's top three-year-olds. In 1983, Monmouth Park's Board of Directors commissioned a trophy to be awarded each year that would be worthy of the high esteem that the race had garnered.

Called to active duty in September 1941, Marshall was appointed midshipman and attended Midshipman's School at New York City. He later attended Naval Armed Guard School and in April 1942 reported to United States Army Transport USAT Merrimack and took command of her Naval Armed Guard detachment. Carrying military supplies to the Panama Canal Zone, Merrimack was torpedoed by the in the Caribbean south of the Yucatán Channel on June 9, 1942. Despite the danger of further attacks, Ensign Marshall led his Armed Guard gun crews in furious resistance to the submarine until the forward part of the sinking Merrimack was actually awash. Marshall was one of the last to leave the ship and was lost. He was listed as presumed dead on June 10, 1943.

Economists and pollsters in the United States generally define \\"working class\\" adults as those lacking a college degree, rather than by occupation or income. Many members of the working class, as defined by academic models, are often identified in the vernacular as being middle-class, there is considerable ambiguity over the term's meaning. According to Frank Newport, \\"for some, working class is a more literal label; namely, an indication that one is working.\\" Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert and Joseph Kahl see the working class as the most populous in the United States, while other sociologists such as William Thompson, Joseph Hickey and James Henslin deem the lower middle class slightly more populous. In the class models devised by these sociologists, the working class comprises between 30% and 35% of the population, roughly the same percentages as the lower middle class. According to the class model by Dennis Gilbert, the working class comprises those between the 25th and 55th percentile of society. In 2018, 31% of Americans self described themselves as working class. Retired American adults are less likely to describe themselves as \\"working class\\", regardless of the actual income or education level of the adult. Those in the working class are commonly employed in clerical, retail sales, and low-skill manual labor occupations. Low-level white-collar workers are included in this class. For purposes of political science, and less scientific or journalistic political analysis, defining the working class as less well educated workers is useful. One can then meaningfully analyze the political opinions and political behavior of, say, the white working class in the United States. In the case of the United States, for example, the white working class is often defined as \\"white\\" (i.e. non-Hispanic) workers who have not completed college. Recent history Since the 1970s, economic and occupational insecurity has become a major problem for American workers, their families, and their communities. While outsourcing, the busting and decline of unionization and welfare supports, and the rise of immigration, the prison-industrial complex, and unemployment have brought increased competition and considerable economic insecurity to working-class employees in the \\"traditional\\" blue-collar fields, there is an increasing demand for service personnel, including clerical and retail occupations. Sociologist Gosta Esping-Anderson describes these supervised service occupations as \\"junk jobs,\\" as they fail to pay living wages in the face of asset and price inflation, fail to pay benefits, are often insecure, unstable, or temporary, and provide little work control and little opportunity for skill development or advancement. In contrast to other expensive countries with higher proportions of quality jobs, the U.S. has developed an economy where two-thirds of jobs do not require or reward higher education; the other one-third of jobs consist largely in managing the junk job workers.Esping-Anderson, Gosta. 1990. The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism. Princeton: Princeton University Press. Page 207. Recalling this American labor market reality as well as the high cost of higher education in the US, lower educational attainment can be a rational calculation. The alternative is probably not a better job. It is the junk job, with educational debt added on top. In fact, even if more Americans were to become highly educated, there would be more competition for the relatively few high-quality jobs, and those wages would decline. This suggests that the middle and working classes in the US may not be distinct classes, but rather opposing subgroups of the same class. Despite, or perhaps because of the well-known limitations that the US labor market, inequality—including deep educational inequality, and other structural factors set on social mobility in the US, many commentators find more interesting the idea of class cultures. Education, for example, can pose an especially intransigent barrier in the US, and not just because of gross educational inequality; culture plays some role as well. The middle class is often recognized in the US by educational attainment, which is correlated with (but may not cause) income and wealth, especially for white men. Members of the working class commonly have a high school diploma and many have only some college education. Due to differences between middle and working class cultures, working class college students may face culture shock upon entering the post-secondary education system, with its \\"middle class\\" culture. Some researchers try to measure the cultural differences between the American middle class and working class and suggest their ahistorical sources and implications for educational attainment, future income, and other life chances. Sociologist Melvin Kohn argues that working class values emphasize external standards, such as obedience and a strong respect for authority as well as little tolerance for deviance. This is opposed to middle-class individuals who, he says, emphasize internal standards, self-direction, curiosity and a tolerance for non-conformity. Other social scientists, such as Barbara Jensen, show that middle-class culture tends to be highly individualistic, while working-class culture tends to center around the community. Such cultural value differences are thought to be closely linked to an individual's occupation. Working-class employees tend to be closely supervised and thus emphasize external values and obedience. Working class culture can be broken down into subgroup tendencies. According to Rubin (1976), there is a differential in social and emotional skills both between working-class men and women and between the blue-color working-class and college-educated workers. Working-class men are characterized by Rubin as taking a rational posture while women are characterized as being more emotional and oriented towards communication of feelings. This constellation of cultural issues has been explored in the popular media, for example, the television shows, Roseanne or All in the Family featuring Archie Bunker and his wife Edith Bunker. These popular television programs also explored generational change and conflict in working-class families. One does need to note, however, that there are great variations in cultural values among the members of all classes and that any statement pertaining to the cultural values of such large social groups needs to be seen as a broad generalization. Further, if the hypothesis that culture primarily produces class were true, such a non-dialectical, causal relationship pertains more validly in some low- social mobility societies. Scandinavian countries, by contrast, have discovered that removing structural barriers (and to some extent broadly valorizing working class culture) is effective in increasing social mobility, if not in eradicating social class under capitalism. Political role of the white working class According to Thomas B. Edsall, an experienced political commentator, the white working class, defined as non-Hispanic whites who have not completed college, plays a pivotal role in the politics of the United States. This segment of the electorate is large and volatile and its role as swing voters closely tracks the success or failure of Democratic candidates. Selection of Democratic candidates who can relate to the white working class has been difficult; a number of candidates who had support among college- educated Democrats failed to garner sufficient support among white working- class voters to win elections. This segment of the electorate was solidly Democratic during the New Deal but its support of Democratic candidates has steadily eroded to about 50%. It is also diminishing as a portion of the electorate, both due to increased educational opportunities and to an increased minority population. A further refinement by social psychologist Jonathan Haidt which defines the white working class as \\"whites without college who are working\\" is useful for political analysis. See Reagan Democrats for the segment of the white working class which forms part of the Republican base of support. The political role of the white working class was re-examined during the 2016 United States presidential election, due to the strong support for Donald Trump by white working class voters. Trump's victory was in part credited to this support in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, that had previously been won by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Professional pollsters did not predict such a large swing for Trump among the white working class. According to Nate Cohn, the gains that Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton made among other voter classes \\"were overwhelmed by Mr. Trump’s huge appeal to white voters without a degree.\\" Voter turnout among white voters who did not have a college degree had increased by 3 percent from 2012 to 2016. This is in spite of the voter composition composition of white voters who did not have a college degree decreasing by 1 percent from 2012 to 2016. Florida saw an even larger increase, with voter turnout among white voters without a college degree increased almost 7 percent from 2012 to 2016. In North Carolina, voter turnout in 2016 by this demographic increasing more than 4 percent compared to 2012. Some have stated that Trump's brand of conservative populism has target the loyalty of white working class voters, saying that the demographic will support him despite claims that Trump's policies have threatened their jobs.

Biography Eustis was born in Jefferson County, New York on July 17, 1847. When he was 15 years old, he contracted a hip disease, which required him to walk with a cane and then with crutches. Eustis graduated from Wesleyan University in Connecticut in 1873 and then got his law degree from Columbia Law School the next year. He moved to Minneapolis in 1881 and started dealing in real estate, becoming more well known as an owner of downtown buildings than as an attorney. He served as the mayor of Minneapolis for one term, 1893 through 1895. Later in life, he began to think about donating much of his wealth to charity, facetiously calling it \\"mostly unearned increment.\\" In 1923, he bought of land on the west side of the Mississippi River and donated to the Minneapolis School Board for the site of the Michael Dowling School, devoted to the education of handicapped children. He subsequently donated the remaining of land, along with $900,000 in securities, to the University of Minnesota for a hospital and convalescent home. He did not want the hospital to bear his name, instead preferring it to be called the \\"Minnesota Hospital and Home for Crippled Children.\\" Eustis eventually donated his interest in the Flour Exchange Building and Corn Exchange Building to the university, along with the rental income. Hospital construction began on November 10, 1928, but by that time he was too ill to attend. Eustis died of heart disease on November 30, 1928. The hospital included an outpatient department, two floors of rooms for inpatient treatment, space for an on-site school, and an amphitheater for teaching purposes. The university eventually named the hospital after Eustis to recognize his generosity. When the Mayo Memorial Building on campus was completed in 1954, the Eustis Hospital, along with Elliot Hospital, were incorporated into the structure.

One feature of the ACT is that it allowed bi-directional travel on a single rail—cars passed each other by switching onto short bypass lanes on the track, distributed where space allowed. ACT was a contender in the Urban Mass Transportation Administration's plan to deploy three or four systems in cities in the United States, as well as the GO-Urban project in Toronto, Canada. One ACT system was installed as a part of a Ford-funded real estate development near their headquarters in Dearborn, MI, and although they proposed to install ACT in several other locations, no additional systems were ever installed and the project was put on indefinite hold. History Background The widespread introduction of the automobile in the late 1950s into the 1960s led to new problems in the city cores in terms of moving people to and from work. This was not so much a problem in cities with extensive mass transit systems, like New York City or London, but the expense of developing a useful metro system was one that could only be undertaken by the largest and richest cities. Studies in Canada placed the cost of a conventional metro system at between $75 and $80 million per mile in 1980,Litvak & Maule, pg. 104 – the first mention puts it at $80 million, but the very next page puts it at $75 about $250 million in 2013, and required high passenger utilization to pay for its construction. President Kennedy started the process of creating a federally funded project to study the problem and develop solutions.FTA, \\"The Beginnings of Federal Assistance for Public Transportation\\" A particularly influential work at the time was Donn Fichter's Individualized Automatic Transit and the City. Most mass transit systems, even today, utilize set routes and stops, generally requiring the rider to change vehicles to reach their destination. Fichter suggested that the only way you could coax drivers to use mass transit would be if it offered the same point-to-point flexibility as the car. Several studies followed, notably by RAND and the Aerospace Corporation, exploring a wide variety of people mover systems. A series of bills passed through the 1960s and 1970s created the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), with funding to develop new systems to match the needs outlined by the earlier reports. Several companies were invited to enter Phase I proposals, which were presented in mock-up form at Dulles Airport for the Transpo 72 trade show.Schneider The primary entries were LTV's Airtrans, Rohr, Inc.'s ROMAG and Ford's ACT. These systems shared a number of features; they were completely automated in operation, used computer-guidance to allow short headways (inter-car spacing) as small as 10 seconds, and featured on-demand point-to-point routing. They differed primarily in the technology used to support and guide the train; some used rubber wheels, some were hovercraft, and some were maglev systems. ACT Development of ACT started as an unofficial project in a Ford engineer's basement. John Logan became interested in the people mover concept and invited fellow engineers Richard Skruch and Denny Colovas to join him in designing what would become ACT. They presented their ideas to management, and in the fall of 1970 they agreed to provide funds to develop a prototype car and a short guideway to test it.Chamberlain, pg. 44 A mock-up, somewhat different in design from the actual prototypes, was demonstrated at the Transpo '72 show. A 4000 foot test guideway was built near Allen Park, MI for testing and development of the Transpo '72 demonstration vehicles. Later, a test facility with a complete loop, a bypass area, test grade, maintenance spur and maintenance building, was erected near Ypsilanti, MI. For a time in late 1974, this facility was home to the Transpo '72 vehicles, and the vehicles that would ultimately be installed at Connecticut's Bradley International Airport and Dearborn's Fairlane Town Center. The Fairlane system was worked into a real estate development across the road from Ford's test tracks in Dearborn, MI. One end of the new track connected with one station attached to the exterior of the new Hyatt Regency hotel and the other inside the Fairlane Town Center shopping mall, where the vehicles were stored outside their hours of operation and serviced. A single by-pass for switching was located between the two. The track and two cars completed basic testing in 1976, and were turned over for passenger use between the two buildings. Although the ACT system was later removed, the Fairlane mall's layout retains several vestigial signs of its former presence, notably the bisection of its central interior court.Milford During the project's lifetime there were numerous expressions of interest in the ACT system. It was one of three Phase II contenders for the GO-Urban project in Toronto, but Ford withdrew after the plans evolved into a higher-speed system for inter-urban movements, not the slower short-haul routes ACT was intended for.Litvak & Maule, pg. 75 A deal was signed for a system at Bradley Field in Hartford, CT,Instrument Society of America, \\"Ford ACT system\\", Advances in Instrumentation, Volume 29 Part 1 (1974) but fell through due to budget cuts after basic installation and state acceptance tests were completed.\\"Ford peoplemover in mothballs\\", Traffic Engineering & Control, Volume 18 (1977), pg. 217 A 2.1 mile long loop was considered for El Paso, TX to connect the city with Juarez across the Rio Grande,United States Congress, \\"Transportation planning and priorities for the seventies: hearing Ninety\\", pg. 39 but also fell to budget cuts. Grand Rapids was the target of a UMTA proposal, but ended along with the UMTA funding. By the early 1980s interest in people mover systems in urban areas was waning, especially after UMTA lost most of its funding after a somewhat negative GAO report, Better Justification Needed for Automated People Mover Demonstration Projects. Ford put ACT on \\"indefinite hold\\" and the project essentially disappeared.Brough, pg. 320 Description ACT was based around a rubber-wheeled car that Ford referred to as a \\"horizontal elevator\\". The vehicles rode in a U-shaped guideway of prestressed concrete. The guideway was about 12 feet wide and normally built in 60 foot cantilevered sections. The vehicles themselves were just less than 7 feet wide, 9 feet high and 25 feet long, and weighed 13,800 pounds. To keep the vehicle centered in the guideway, smaller horizontal tires were attached by leaf springs to the main bogies, one in front and rear of the main axle on either side, for a total of four wheels per bogie. The springs pressed the wheels against metal guide rails on either side of the track, and when the car entered a curved section of the guideway they rotated the bogie so it steered along the curve.Chamberlain, pg. 46 A separate set of wheels was also attached to the bogies, located above them on the end of switch arms. These arms were hydraulically extended at the appropriate time and engaged a rail mounted above the power and signal rails, serving to steer the vehicle from the enclosed, single-lane guideway into the bypass areas where the guideway split to become two separate passing lanes. Since the system was centrally controlled and used hydraulics, there was a minimum actuation time that required headways to be around 30 seconds at the normal operating speed of 30 mph. It may be noted that, although the designed and advertised maximum operating speed was 30 mph, the actual cruise speed of the Fairlane system was lowered to about 25 mph, where it remained throughout the duration of its operating lifetime of approximately 12 years. Power was supplied at 480 V 60 Hz AC, in a corner-grounded Delta configuration, with the guide rail serving as the ground leg and the other two phases supplied on separate rails above the ground/guidance rail. The AC power was converted on board to power two 60 horsepower DC electric motors. The system used regenerative braking, converting the energy back through the DC motors to AC into the lines. Another rail, above the power rails, carried multiplexed frequency 'tones' that were decoded by the vehicles on-board controller into a 3-of-5 command sequence that was used to control all vehicle movement and station cycle functions. The heart of the on-board controller was a DEC PDP-8 minicomputer which interfaced with various vehicle subsystems via dual-redundant fail-safe vital relay logic. A key safety feature was a novel braking system that consisted of an automotive disc brakes attached to the vehicles driveshafts. These brakes were held off by hydraulic pressure that was present whenever the vehicle was connected with guideway power and the on-board controller was commanding them off. In the event of loss of electrical power, the hydraulic pressure holding the brakes was lost and springs inside the cylinders forced brake fluid into the calipers of the disc braking system, ensuring that the vehicles did not simply coast to a stop. In order to provide for a controlled deceleration, a pendulum valve was located in line with the brake actuation cylinders. Pendulums inside the valve reacted to the deceleration profile of the vehicle and would partially close, reducing the pressure in the brake lines and moderating the deceleration so that the emergency stop was not dangerously abrupt. In operation the ACT systems had more in common with a metro system or the people movers used at airports, using relatively large cars with up to 20 passengers and making stops at all requested stations. As deployed, it was not a true personal rapid transit system, like the contemporary Cabinentaxi or the modern ULTra, which offer true point-to-point service for every car. ACT's unique feature was the embedded bypasses, which allowed bi-directional service on a line consisting primarily of a single track.

Early life and military service Werner Preuss was the son of a tax inspector. He graduated from high school in Rendsburg, Holstein on 6 August 1914. Eight days later, he volunteered for service with Infantry Regiment No. 85. On 15 May 1915, he attended an officer's training course. He returned to the front from this course as a sergeant. On 16 January 1916, he was commissioned an officer. On 25 May 1916, he was severely wounded. It would take him a year to recover from paralysis. Upon his recovery, he enlisted in the Luftstreitkräfte. He was forwarded to pilots training in Poznan on 20 September 1917. He passed his first pilot's test on 7 October, and the second one on 15 October, setting a record. On the 26th, he was sent to the Western Front via a short stopover in Courland, as an infantry cooperation pilot flying reconnaissance. He arrived on the front in December 1917. He began flying missions in January 1918. He also requested and received a transfer to the Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 66. Career of aerial victories Preuss won for the first time on 4 June 1918. He did not score again until 1 July. He then ran up a tally of seven for the month; win number eight came on 22 July. His next successful claim was against a Spad on 26 August. He was victorious three more times during the last few days of the month. His winning string continued into September with four more victims joining his list, the last on 14 September. By now, he had 16 accredited claims. He was awarded the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern on the 19th. In October, he shot down six more enemy planes, to bring his total to 22. His victories were split evenly between fighters and reconnaissance planes. With his twentieth victory, he qualified for Germany's highest decoration for valor, the Prussian Pour le Mérite. He was nominated in early November. One of the extant photographs, a formal portrait, shows him wearing a Blue Max. However, there is no surviving evidence of its award. A number of nominees lost out on their award when the Kaiser resigned on 9 November, but his name is not recorded among them. However, this is the most likely explanation for him not receiving the medal he earned. Post World War I Upon the armistice ending the war, Preuss led his squadron to Lübeck. There he resigned his commission. On 13 February 1919, he joined the air component of the Schleswig-Holstein Freikorps. On 6 March, he was killed in an air crash near the site of his alma mater, Rendsburg.

It was recorded by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five on Decca and later included in the Ella Fitzgerald album Ella and Her Fellas. The lively tone of the music is matched by the use of dark humor in the lyrics. The song is sung in first-person and tells the story of an unnamed woman who killed her husband with a rolling pin, bashing in his skull while in a marketplace after he went out drinking and then came home and beat her. The narrative shifts back and forth between the wife who repeatedly claims that \\"he had it coming\\" and doesn't care about either revenge from his family or facing the electric chair, and the husband who recounts his side of the story apparently from beyond the grave. At the end of the song, the husband vows to come back and exact his revenge, but she repudiates by reminding him that he can't come back from the grave. Throughout the song, both the wife and the husband refrain that she didn't kill anyone else but the husband. Franklin Bruno argued in a piece in the Journal of Popular Music and Society that \\"Fitzgerald and Jordan's adoption of an exoticized West African accent, as well as their public personae, effectively produced a comic and ethnic \\"mask\\" from behind which the song's subject matter could be presented with relative frankness.\\"[ Chart Performance The single was the first of five that Louis Jordan would take to the number-one spot on the R&B; Juke Box chart. The song also reached number seven on the U.S. pop chart. The B-side of the single, \\"Petootie Pie,\\" was also an R&B; chart hit, peaking at number three.

This may be a surprise to most individuals because in the past Mediterranean countries like Greece were known to live a pretty healthy lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet was developed based on the food patterns in these different countries, Greece being a main one. In the past the people of Greece consumed a diet consisting mainly of fish, fruit, vegetable, and wine, limiting meats. These countries also were fairly active which helps to keep them healthy. Today's European countries are moving away from this Mediterranean lifestyle and towards a more Western way of life. Indulging on the fast foods and limited daily activity are to blame on for this increase in obesity in Greece . An article from the Associated Press states that obesity rates in some European countries are higher than that of the United States. Greece's growing health concerns related to obesity are becoming an issue that was not evident in the past because of an increase in consumption of high fat, high calorie, fast foods and decreased levels of activity.

It was laid down at Charleston Navy Yard and commissioned on 21 November 1944. It participated in the Battle of Okinawa as well as the run-up to the battle Service History (Turner) It was laid down at Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina, and was commissioned on 21 November 1944, Lt. Donald E. Boynton, USNR, in command. During World War II the ship was assigned to the Asiatic Pacific theater. At that time the fleet was under the command of Admiral Spruance and named the Fifth fleet. Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner was Commander of Amphibious Forces Pacific and was to be in charge of operations until the beachhead was established. The Kerama Retto islands were a small chain of islands 15 miles west of the southwest tip of Okinawa. The invasion of the Kerma Retto was an opportunity to break in all twelve of the 188-class LSM(R)s. One of the reasons that Admiral Turner wanted to capture Kerama Retto was his knowledge that the Japanese Sea Raiding Units had suicide boats hidden there. On the morning of 29 March three of these boats attacked the but were promptly destroyed. The southern half of the six-mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 55, commanded by Rear Admiral John Leslie Hall, Jr. The assault troops were under Major General John R. Hodge. The southern support craft included LSM(R)-189, , , , and USS LSM(R)-193. On 3 May 1945 the 188-class LSM(R)s were put to the test and were not found wanting. The action at the picket stations proved that the courage and punishment endured by US Navy personnel was unrelated to the size of the ship. The Japanese launched their fifth kikusui attack on 3 May. Picket station 10 was the hardest hit. Shortly before dusk, the destroyer was hit by a series of six kamikazes, suffering 45 killed or missing and 49 wounded. The ship survived, but was later decommissioned because it wasn't worth repairing. About the same time, approximately 20 planes attacked destroyer . She was crashed by four of them and sank within 12 minutes of the first hit. She lost 30 dead or missing and 79 wounded. was also on Picket Station 10 and while rushing to the aid of the Aaron Ward and the Little was likewise crashed by a kamikaze. The crash started her rockets exploding and knocked out the fire main and auxiliary pumps. LSM(R)-195 had to be abandoned and, after being ripped by heavy explosions, sank. The following day the ordeal for the LSM(R)'s reached its tragic climax. The day dawned bright and ominous. LSM(R)-190 was patrolling at Picket Station 12. Not long after sunrise the anticipated kamikazes arrived and were met by American combat air patrol. Several of the Japanese planes managed to get through and attack the ships on this station. Three kamikazes crashed LSM(R) 190. The ship that had seen so much previous action and had been credited with rescuing 180 survivors of other stricken ships was herself sunk. In the same attack the destroyer USS Luce was sunk, carrying 126 of her 312 officers and men with her. At the same time as LSM(R)-190 was fighting her final battle, was facing the same fate at Picket Station 1. This was the most critical station on the picket line. The capture of the Kerama Islands did not come without a price. On the night of 28 March, Japanese planes from Okinawa airfields made a special attack on the small patrol craft assembled between the islands and Okinawa. About a dozen were shot down, but one crashed into . There were 15 men killed and another 32 wounded. The badly damaged ship survived, but she was sent back to Pearl Harbor and saw no further combat. No one realized at the time that this was a preview of what this class of ship would suffer six weeks later on the picket line. On 13 April 1945, LSM(R)'s 192, 193, 196, 197, 198, 199 and LC(FF)-535 were assigned to night harassment patrols and destructive bombardment of Ie Shima from period beginning 13 April through 16 April 1945. The LSM(R)s utilized irregular rocket fire for destructive harassment, 5\\" star shell for illumination and harassment, and 40 mm to prevent any reinforcement of the beach defenses. On 11 May 1945 LSM(R)-193 (Lt. Donald E. Boynton, USNR) responded to the Kamikaze attack on the . CO USS Hugh V. Hadley comments: The LSM 193 and the LCS 83 were responsible for recovering all personnel in the water. These two ships did a remarkable job in caring for the wounded, expediting the fighting of the fire, and later towing. Lieutenant (later LCDR) Boynton was awarded the Silver Star. LSM(R) 193 was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. Okinawa Radar Picket Line (C.T.G.52.21) The American plan for defense against the kamikazes was to have fighters intercept the Japanese as early as possible. Sixteen radar picket stations were established around the island of Okinawa in preparation for the invasion of that island, in some cases almost 100 miles out, to give early warning of the Japanese planes which might be coming from any direction. Each station was manned around the clock by a handful of ships ranging from destroyers down to minesweepers. Their job was to sound the alarm and vector fighters to intercept before the Japanese could attack the fleet anchored off Okinawa and the Allied forces and supply dumps ashore. Unfortunately, some of the eager-to-die Japanese wanted to attack the first American ships they saw: the pickets. Dennis L. Francis LSM Commander, Flotilla Nine for the period 2 – 20 April, Action Report indicated that . . .\\"these ships are not particularly suited for picket duty. Since their primary function is to deliver rockets during invasion operations, it seems feasible that subjecting them to continual enemy air attack will allow this secondary duty to seriously affect their ability to perform their primary function due to damage. They have no great value in combating enemy air craft due to the absence of air search radar, adequate director control for the 5\\"/38 main battery, and director control for the 40mm single guns. The fact that they carry a considerable quantity of explosive rockets in their magazines presents another hazard. In general, it is believed that assigning them to picket duty should be avoided since it means risking the operation of a limited number of specialized ships which could be performed by any number of other landing craft whose primary function is more closely coincident with screening operations.\\" Before these recommendations were implemented the USS LSMR-195 was sunk on 3 May 1945 with 9 killed and 16 wounded, the USS LSMR-190 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 18 wounded, the USS LSMR-194 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 23 wounded.

The landowners' power was unsuccessfully challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors. In 1868 popular uprisings led to the overthrow of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. After the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874, Carlists and anarchists emerged in opposition to the monarchy. Alejandro Lerroux helped bring republicanism to the fore in Catalonia, where poverty was particularly acute. Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909. After the First World War, the working class, the industrial class, and the military united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government, but were unsuccessful. Fears of communism grew. A military coup brought Miguel Primo de Rivera to power in 1923, and he ran Spain as a military dictatorship. Support for his regime gradually faded, and he resigned in January 1930. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities, and King Alfonso XIII abdicated; the Second Spanish Republic was formed, whose power would remain until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War. Monarchists would continue to oppose the Republic. The revolutionary committee headed by Niceto Alcalá-Zamora became the provisional government, with Zamora as the President and Head of State.Beevor (2006). p. 23. The Republic had broad support from all segments of society; elections in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists. With the onset of the Great Depression, the government attempted to assist rural Spain by instituting an eight-hour day and giving tenure to farm workers. Land reform and working conditions remained important issues throughout the lifetime of the Republic. Fascism remained a reactive threat, helped by controversial reforms to the military. In December a new reformist, liberal, and democratic constitution was declared. The constitution secularised the government, and this, coupled with their slowness to respond to a wave of anti-clerical violence prompted committed Catholics to become disillusioned with the incumbent coalition government.Beevor (2006). pp. 25–26 In October 1931 Manuel Azaña became Prime Minister of a minority government. The Right won the elections of 1933 following an unsuccessful uprising by General José Sanjurjo in August 1932, who would later lead the coup that started the civil war. Events in the period following November 1933, called the \\"black biennium\\", seemed to make a civil war more likely. Alejandro Lerroux of the Radical Republican Party (RRP) formed a government with the support of CEDA and rolled back all major changes made under the previous administration, he also granted amnesty to General José Sanjurjo, who had attempted an unsuccessful coup in 1932. Some monarchists moved to the Fascist Falange Española to help achieve their aims. In response, the socialist party (PSOE) became more extreme, setting up a revolutionary committee and training the socialist youth in secret.Beevor (2009). pp. 31–32 Open violence occurred in the streets of Spanish cities and militancy continued to increase right up until the start of the civil war, reflecting a movement towards radical upheaval rather than peaceful democratic means as a solution to Spain's problems. In the last months of 1934, two government collapses brought members of the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) into the government, making it more right-wing. Farm workers' wages were halved, and the military was purged of republican members and reformed. A Popular Front alliance was organised, which won the 1936 elections. Azaña led a weak minority government, but soon replaced Zamora as president in April. Prime Minister Casares failed to heed warnings of a military conspiracy involving several generals, who decided that the government had to be replaced if the dissolution of Spain was to be prevented. They organised a military coup in July, which started the Spanish Civil War. Constitutional monarchy 19th century The 19th century was a turbulent time for Spain.Beevor (2006). p. 8. Those in favour of reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms from taking place. Some liberals, in a tradition that had started with the Spanish Constitution of 1812, sought to limit the power of the monarchy of Spain and to establish a liberal state.Fraser (1979). pp. 38–39. The reforms of 1812 did not last after King Ferdinand VII dissolved the Constitution and ended a short-lived liberal government with French royalist military assistance.Beevor (2006). p. 7. Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874. There were several attempts to realign the political system to match social reality.Preston (2006). p. 18. Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class. The land- based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates (called latifundia) as well as all the important government positions. The landowners' power was challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors, largely unsuccessfully.Preston (2006). p. 19. King Amadeo I of Spain In 1868 popular uprisings led to the overthrow of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots, and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by General Joan Prim),Thomas (1961). p. 13. who were concerned about the ultra- conservatism of the monarchy.Preston (2006). p. 21. In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. However, the intellectuals behind the Republic were powerless to prevent a descent into chaos. Uprisings were crushed by the military. The old monarchy returned with the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874,Preston (2006). p. 22. as reform was deemed less important than peace and stability. Despite the introduction of universal male suffrage in 1890, elections were controlled by local political bosses (caciques).Thomas (1961). p. 14. The most traditionalist sectors of the political sphere systematically tried to prevent liberal reforms and to sustain the patrilineal monarchy. The Carlists – supporters of Infante Carlos and his descendants – fought to promote Spanish tradition and Catholicism against the liberalism of successive Spanish governments. The Carlists attempted to restore the historic liberties and broad regional autonomy granted to the Basque Country and Catalonia by their fueros (regional charters). At times they allied with nationalists (separate from the National Faction during the civil war itself), including during the Carlist Wars. Periodically, anarchism became popular among the working class, and was far stronger in Spain than anywhere else in Europe at the time. Anarchists were easily defeated in clashes with government forces.Preston (2006). p. 24. 20th century Michele Angiolillo kills Cánovas in a health resort in 1897 In 1897 an Italian anarchist assassinated Prime Minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, motivated by a growing number of arrests and the use of torture by the government. The loss of Cuba, Spain's last valuable colony, in the Spanish–American War of 1898 hit exports from Catalonia hardest; there were acts of terrorism and actions by agents provocateurs in Barcelona. In the first two decades of the 20th century, the industrial working class grew in number. There was a growing discontent in the Basque country and Catalonia, where much of Spain's industry was based. They believed that the government favoured agrarianism and therefore failed to represent their interests.Preston (2006). p. 25. The average illiteracy rate was 64%, with considerable regional variation. Poverty in some areas was great and mass emigration to the New World occurred in the first decade of the century.Beevor (2006). p. 9. Spain's socialist party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (, PSOE) and its associated trade union, the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT), gained support. The UGT grew from 8,000 members in 1908 to 200,000 in 1920. Branch offices (Casas del pueblo) of the unions were established in major cities.Thomas (1961). p. 25. The UGT was constantly fearful of losing ground to the anarchists. It was respected for its discipline during strikes. However, it was centrist and anti-Catalan, with only 10,000 members in Barcelona as late as 1936.Thomas (1961). p. 26. The PSOE and the UGT were based on a simple form of Marxism, one that assumed an inevitable revolution, and were isolationist in character. When the UGT moved their headquarters from Barcelona to Madrid in 1899, many industrial workers in Catalonia were no longer able to access it. Some elements of the PSOE recognised the need for cooperation with republican parties. In 1912 the Reformist Party was founded, which attracted intellectuals. Figures like its leader, Alejandro Lerroux, helped attract wide support from the working class. His advocacy of anti- clericalism made him a successful demagogue in Barcelona. He argued that the Catholic Church was inseparable from the system of oppression the people were under. It was around this time that republicanism came to the fore.Preston (2006). p. 26. The military was keen to avoid the break-up of the state and was increasingly inward-looking following the loss of Cuba. Regional nationalism, perceived as separatism, was frowned upon. In 1905 the army attacked the headquarters of two satirical magazines in Catalonia believed to be undermining the government. To appease the military, the government outlawed negative comments about the military or Spain itself in the Spanish press. Resentment of the military and of conscription grew with the disastrous Rif War of 1909 in Spanish Morocco.Beevor (2006). p. 13. Lerroux's support of the army's aims lost him support.Preston (2006). p. 28. Events culminated in the Tragic Week () in Barcelona in 1909, when working class groups rioted against the call-up of reservists.Thomas (1961). p. 15. 48 churches and similar institutions were burned in anti-clerical attacks. The riot was finally ended by the military; 1,725 members of such groups were put on trial, with five people sentenced to death.Preston (2006). p. 29. These events led to the establishment of the National Confederation of Labour (, CNT), an anarchist-controlled trade union committed to anarcho-syndicalism. It had over a million members by 1923.Thomas (1961). p. 16. Prime Minister Miguel Primo de Rivera Increasing exports during the First World War led to a boom in industry and declining living standards in the industrial areas, particularly Catalonia and the Basque country.Preston (2006). p. 30. There was high inflation. The industrial sector resented its subjugation by the agrarian central government. Along with concerns about antiquated promotion systems and political corruption, the war in Morocco had caused divisions in the military. Regenerationism became popular, and the working class, industrial class, and the military were united in their hope of removing the corrupt central government. However, these hopes were defeated in 1917 and 1918 when the various political parties representing these groups were either appeased or suppressed by the central government, one by one. The industrialists eventually backed the government as a way to restore order.Preston (2006). pp. 32–33. After the formation of the Communist International in 1919, there was a growing fear of communism within Spain and growing repression on the part of the government through military means. The PSOE split, with the more left-wing members founding the Communist Party in 1921.Beevor (2006). p. 15.Preston (2006). pp. 34–35. The Restoration government failed to cope with an increasing number of strikes amongst the industrial workers in the north and the agricultural workers in the south. Miguel Primo de Rivera came to power in a military coup in 1923 and ran Spain as a military dictatorship. He handed monopolistic control of trade union power to the UGT, and introduced a sweeping programme of public works. These public works were extremely wasteful, including hydroelectric dams and highways causing the deficit to double between 1925 and 1929. Spain's financial situation was made far worse by the pegging of the peseta to the gold standard and by 1931 the peseta had lost nearly half its value.Beevor (2006). p. 20. The UGT was brought into the government to set up industrial arbitration boards, though this move was opposed by some in the group and was seen as opportunism by anarchist leaders.Beevor (2006). p. 17. He also attempted to defend the agrarian–industrial monarchist coalition formed during the war. No significant reform to the political system (and in particular the monarchy) was instituted. This made forming a new government difficult, as existing problems had not been rectified. Gradually, his support faded because his personal approach to political life ensured he was personally held accountable for the government's failings, and due to an increasing frustration over his interference in economic matters he did not understand. José Calvo Sotelo, his finance minister, was one person to withdraw support,Thomas (1961). p. 17. and de Rivera resigned in January 1930.Preston (2006). p. 36. There was little support for a return to the pre-1923 system, and the monarchy had lost credibility by backing the military government. Dámaso Berenguer was ordered by the king to form a replacement government, but his dictablanda dictatorship failed to provide a viable alternative.Preston (2006). p. 37. The choice of Berenguer annoyed another important general, José Sanjurjo, who believed himself to be a better choice.Beevor (2006). p. 18. In the municipal elections of 12 April 1931, little support was shown for pro-monarchy parties in the major cities, and large numbers of people gathered in the streets of Madrid. King Alfonso XIII abdicated to prevent a \\"fratricidal civil war\\".Thomas (1961). pp. 18–19.His statement included the sentence \\"I am determined to have nothing to do with setting one of my countrymen against another in a fratricidal civil war.\\" from Thomas (1961). pp. 18–19. The Second Spanish Republic was formed. Second Republic Niceto Alcalá-Zamora in 1931 The Second Republic was a source of hope to the poorest in Spanish society and a threat to the richest, but had broad support from all segments of society.Preston (2006). pp. 38–39. Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was the first prime minister of the Republic.Thomas (1961). p. 21. The wealthier landowners and the middle class accepted the Republic because of the lack of any suitable alternative. Elections to a constituent Cortes in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists, with the PSOE gaining 116 seats and Lerroux's Radical Party 94.Preston (2006). p. 50. Lerroux became foreign minister.Thomas (1961). pp. 21–22. The government was controlled by a Republican–Socialist coalition, whose members had differing objectives. Some more conservative members believed that the removal of the monarchy was enough by itself, but the Socialists and leftist Republicans demanded much wider reforms. The state's financial position was poor. Supporters of the dictatorship attempted to block progress on reforming the economy.Preston (2006). pp. 41–42. The redistribution of wealth supported by the new government seemed a threat to the richest, in light of the recent Wall Street Crash and the onset of the Great Depression. The government attempted to tackle the dire poverty in rural areas by instituting an eight-hour day and giving the security of tenure to farm workers.Preston (2006). p. 42.Beevor (2006). p. 22. Landlords complained. The effectiveness of the reforms was dependent on the skill of the local governance, which was often badly lacking. Changes to the military were needed and education reform was another problem facing the Republic. The relationship between central government and the Basque and Catalan regions also needed to be decided.Beevor (2006). p. 21. Effective opposition was led by three groups. The first group included Catholic movements such as the Asociación Católica de Propagandistas,See also: :es:Asociación Católica de Propagandistas who had influence over the judiciary and the press.Preston (2006). p. 43. Rural landowners were told to think of the Republic as godless and communist.Preston (2006). p. 44. The second group consisted of organisations that had supported the monarchy, such as the Renovación Española and Carlists, who wished to see the new republic overthrown in a violent uprising. The third group were Fascist organisations, among them supporters of the dictator's son, José Antonio Primo de Rivera. Primo de Rivera was the most significant leader of fascism in Spain.Preston (2006). p. 45. The press often editorialised about a foreign Jewish–Masonic–Bolshevik plot.Preston (2006). p. 49. Members of the CNT willing to cooperate with the Republic were forced out, and it continued to oppose the government.Thomas (1961). p. 61. The deeply unpopular Civil Guard (), founded in 1844, was charged with putting down revolts and was perceived as ruthless. Violence, including at Castilblanco in December 1931, was usual.Thomas (1961). pp. 48–49. On 11 May 1931 rumours that a taxi driver was supposedly killed by monarchists sparked a wave of anti-clerical violence throughout south west urban Spain beginning. An angry crowd assaulted and burned ABC newspaper. The government's reluctance to declare martial law in response and a comment attributed to Azaña that he would \\"rather all the churches in Spain be burnt than a single Republican harmed\\" prompted many Catholics to believe that the Republic was trying to prosecute Christianity.Beevor (2006) p. 26. Next day the Jesuit Church in the Calle de La Flor was also burned. Several other churches and convents were burned throughout the day. Over the next days some hundred churches were burned all over Spain. The government blamed the monarchists for sparking the riots and closed the ABC newspaper and El Debate.Thomas (2013). Chapter 5 Parties in opposition to Alcalá-Zamora's provisional government gained the support of the church and the military.Preston (2006). pp. 46–47. The head of the church in Spain, Cardinal Pedro Segura, was particularly vocal in his disapproval. Until the 20th century, the Catholic Church had proved an essential part of Spain's character, although it had internal problems.Thomas (1961). p. 36 Segura was expelled from Spain in June 1931. This prompted an outcry from the Catholic right, who cited oppression. The military were opposed to reorganisation, including an increase in regional autonomy granted by the central government, and reforms to improve efficiency were seen as a direct attack. Officers were retired and a thousand had their promotions reviewed, including Francisco Franco, who served as director of the General Military Academy in Zaragoza, which was closed by Manuel Azaña.Preston (2006). pp. 47–48. Constitution of 1931 In October 1931 The conservative Catholic Republican prime-minister Alcalá-Zamora and the Interior Minister Miguel Maura resigned from the provisional government when the controversial articles 26 and 27 of the constitution, which strictly controlled Church property and prohibited religious orders from engaging in education were passed. During the debate held on 13 October, a night that Alcalá-Zamora considered the saddest night of his life, Azaña declared that Spain had \\"ceased to be Catholic\\"; although to an extent his statement was accurate,According to Thomas (1961). p. 31., it was estimated that around two-thirds of Spaniards were not practising Catholics. it was a politically unwise thing to say.Thomas (1961) p. 31. Manuel Azaña became the new provisional Prime Minister. Desiring the job for himself, Lerroux became alienated, and his Radical Party switched to the opposition,Thomas (1961). p. 47. leaving Azaña dependent on the Socialists for support. The Socialists, who favoured reform, objected to the lack of progress. The reforms that were made alienated the land-holding right.Preston (2006). pp. 54–55. Conditions for labourers remained dreadful; the reforms had not been enforced.Preston (2006). p. 57. Rural landowners declared war on the government by refusing to plant crops.Preston (2006). p. 58. Meanwhile, several agricultural strikes were harshly put down by the authorities. Reforms, including the unsuccessful attempt to break up large holdings, failed to significantly improve the situation for rural workers. By the end of 1931, King Alfonso, in exile, stopped attempting to prevent an armed insurrection of monarchists in Spain, and was tried and condemned to life imprisonment in absentia.Thomas (1961). p. 60. A new constitution was approved on 9 December 1931.Preston (2006). p. 53. The first draft, prepared by Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo and others, was rejected, and a much more daring text creating a \\"democratic republic of workers of every class\\" was promulgated.Lannon (1987). p. 181. It contained much in the way of emotive language and included many controversial articles, some of which were aimed at curbing the Catholic Church.Thomas (1961). p. 46.Beevor (2006). p. 24. The constitution was reformist, liberal, and democratic in nature, and was welcomed by the Republican–Socialist coalition. It appalled landowners, industrialists, the organised church, and army officers. At this point once the constituent assembly had fullfilled its mandate of approving a new constitution, it should have arranged for regular parliamentary elections and adjourned.Hayes (1951). p. 91. However fearing the increasing popular opposition the Radical and Socialist majority postponed the regular elections, therefore prolonging their way in power for two more years. This way the provisional republican government of Manuel Azaña initiated numerous reforms to what in their view would \\"modernize\\" the country.Hayes (1951). p. 91. As the provisional government believed it was necessary to break the control the church had over Spanish affairs, the new constitution removed any special rights held by the Catholic Church. The constitution proclaimed religious freedom and a complete separation of Church and State. Catholic schools continued to operate, but outside the state system; in 1933 further legislation banned all monks and nuns from teaching.Vincent (2007). p. 122. The Republic regulated church use of property and investments, provided for recovery and controls on the use of property the church had obtained during past dictatorships, and banned the Vatican-controlled Society of Jesus. The controversial articles 26 and 27 of the constitution strictly controlled Church property and prohibited religious orders from engaging in education.Smith (2009). p. 195. Supporters of the church and even Jose Ortega y Gasset, a liberal advocate of the separation of church and state, considered the articles overreaching.Paz (2001). p. 2. Other articles legalising divorce and initiating agrarian reforms were equally controversial, and on 13 October 1931, Gil Robles, the leading spokesman of the parliamentary right, called for a Catholic Spain to make its stand against the Republic.Preston (2006). p. 54. Commentator Stanley Payne has argued that \\"the Republic as a democratic constitutional regime was doomed from the outset\\", because the far left considered any moderation of the anticlerical aspects of the constitution as totally unacceptable.Payne (1973). p. 632. Restrictions on Christian iconography in schools and hospitals and the ringing of bells came into force in January 1932. State control of cemeteries was also imposed. Many ordinary Catholics began to see the government as an enemy because of the educational and religious reforms.Preston (2006). pp. 59–60. Government actions were denounced as barbaric, unjust, and corrupt by the press.Preston (2006). p. 61. In August 1932 there was an unsuccessful uprising by General José Sanjurjo, who had been particularly appalled by events in Castilblanco.Thomas (1961). p. 62. The aims of the insurrection were vague, and it quickly turned into a fiasco.Thomas (1961). p. 63.Beevor (2006). p. 26. Among the generals tried and sent to Spanish colonies were four men who would go on to distinguish themselves fighting against the Republic in the civil war: Francisco de Borbón y de la Torre, Duke of Seville, Martin Alonso,See also: :es:Pablo Martín Alonso Ricardo Serrador Santés, and Heli Rolando de Tella y Cantos. Azaña's government continued to ostracized the church. The Jesuits who were in charge of the best schools throughout the country were banned and had all their property confiscated. The army was reduced. Landowners were expropriated. Home rule was granted to Catalonia, with a local parliament and a president of its own.Hayes (1951). p. 91. In November 1932, Miguel de Unamuno, one of the most respected Spanish intellectuals, rector of the University of Salamanca, and himself a Republican, publicly raised his voice to protest. In a speech delivered on 27 November 1932, at the Madrid Ateneo, he protested: \\"Even the Inquisition was limited by certain legal guarantees. But now we have something worse: a police force which is grounded only on a general sense of panic and on the invention of non-existent dangers to cover up this over-stepping of the law.\\"Hayes (1951) p. 93 In June 1933 Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical Dilectissima Nobis, \\"On Oppression of the Church of Spain\\", raising his voice against the persecution of the Catholic Church in Spain. The political left became fractured, whilst the right united. The Socialist Party continued to support Azaña but headed further to the political left.Thomas (1961). p. 67.Beevor (2006). p. 28. Gil Robles set up a new party, the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (, CEDA) to contest the 1933 election, and tacitly embraced Fascism. The right won an overwhelming victory, with the CEDA and the Radicals together winning 219 seats.Thomas (1961). p. 66. allocates 207 seats to the political right. They had spent far more on their election campaign than the Socialists, who campaigned alone.Preston (2006). pp. 63–65. The roughly 3,000 members of the Communist Party were at this point not significant.Thomas (1961). p. 71. The \\"black biennium\\" Following the elections of November 1933, Spain entered a period called the \\"black biennium\\" ()Preston (2006). p. 66. by the left. The CEDA had won a plurality of seats, but not enough to form a majority. President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora declined to invite the leader of the most voted party, Gil Robles, to form a government, and instead invited the Radical Republican Party's Alejandro Lerroux to do so. Immediately after the election, the Socialists alleged electoral fraud; they had, according to the PSOE, needed twice as many votes as their opponents to win each seat. They identified the lack of unity in the left as another reason for their defeat.Preston (2006). pp. 66–67. The Socialist opposition began to propagate a revolutionary ideal.Preston (2006). p. 67. Stanley Payne asserts that the left demanded the cancellation of the elections not because the elections were fraudulent but because in its view those that had won the elections did not share the republican ideals.Preston (2012). p. 84. The government, with the backing of CEDA, set about removing price controls, selling state favours and monopolies, and removing the land reforms—to the landowners' considerable advantage. This created growing malnourishment in the south of Spain.Preston (2006). pp. 67–68. The agrarian reforms, still in force, went tacitly unenforced.Thomas (1961). p. 75. Radicals became more aggressive and conservatives turned to paramilitary and vigilante actions. The first working class protest came from the anarchists on 8 December 1933, and was easily crushed by force in most of Spain; Zaragoza held out for four days before the Spanish Republican Army, employing tanks, stopped the uprising.Preston (2006). p. 68. The Socialists stepped up their revolutionary rhetoric, hoping to force Zamora to call new elections.Preston (2006). p. 69. Carlists and Alfonsist monarchists continued to prepare, with Carlists undergoing military drills in Navarre; they received the backing of Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. Gil Robles struggled to control the CEDA's youth wing, which copied Germany and Italy's youth movements. Monarchists turned to the Fascist Falange Española, under the leadership of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, as a way to achieve their aims.Preston (2006). pp. 69–70. Open violence occurred in the streets of Spanish cities.Preston (2006). p. 70. Official statistics state that 330 people were assassinated in addition to 213 failed attempts, and 1,511 people wounded in political violence. Those figures also indicate a total of 113 general strikes were called and 160 religious buildings were destroyed, typically by arson.Brincat (2005). p. 80.abc.es: \\"La quema de iglesias durante la Segunda República\\" 10 May 2012 Lerroux resigned in April 1934, after President Zamora hesitated to sign an Amnesty Bill which let off the arrested members of the 1932 plot. He was replaced by Ricardo Samper.Thomas (1961). p. 76. The Socialist Party ruptured over the question of whether or not to move towards Bolshevism. The youth wing, the Federation of Young Socialists (), were particularly militant.Preston (2006). p. 71. The anarchists called a four-week strike in Zaragoza.Preston (2006). p. 72. Gil Robles' CEDA continued to mimic the German Nazi Party, staging a rally in March 1934, to shouts of \\"Jefe\\" (\\"Chief\\", after the Italian \\"Duce\\" used in support of Mussolini). Gil Robles used an anti-strike law to successfully provoke and break up unions one at a time, and attempted to undermine the republican government of the Esquerra in Catalonia, who were attempting to continue the republic's reforms.Preston (2006). pp. 73–74. Efforts to remove local councils from socialist control prompted a general strike, which was brutally put down by Interior Minister Salazar Alonso,See also: :es:Rafael Salazar Alonso with the arrest of four deputies and other significant breaches of articles 55 and 56 of the constitution.Preston (2006). p. 75. The Socialist Landworkers' Federation (, FNTT), a trade union founded in 1930, was effectively prevented from operating until 1936.Preston (2006). p. 76. On 26 September, the CEDA announced it would no longer support the RRP's minority government. It was replaced by an RRP cabinet, again led by Lerroux, that included three members of the CEDA.Thomas (1961). p. 78. After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, who had more seats in parliament, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries. As a reaction, the Socialists (PSOE) and Communists triggered an insurrection that they had been preparing for nine months.Payne&Palacios; (2014) p.88 In Catalonia Lluís Companys (leader of the Republican Left of Catalonia and the President of the Generalitat of Catalonia) saw an opportunity in the general strike and declared Catalonia an independent state inside the federal republic of Spain;Beevor (2006). p. 33. the Esquerra, however, refused to arm the populace, and the head of the military in Catalonia, Domingo Batet,See also: :es:Domingo Batet charged with putting down the revolt, showed similar restraint. In response, Lluís Companys was arrested and Catalan autonomy was suspended.Thomas (1961). p. 79. The 1934 strike was unsuccessful in most of Spain.Preston (2006). p. 77. However, in Asturias in northern Spain, it developed into a bloody revolutionary uprising, trying to overthrow the legitimate democratic regime. Around 30,000 workers were called to arms in ten days.Thomas (1961). p. 80. Armed with dynamite, rifles, carbines and light and heavy machine guns, the revolutionaries managed to take the whole province of Asturias committing numerous murders of policemen, clergymen and civilians and destroying religious buildings including churches, convents and part of the university at Oviedo.Orella Martínez|Mizerska-Wrotkowska, 2015Thomas (2001) pp=131-132Hayes (1951), p=96 In the occupied areas the rebels officially declared the proletarian revolution and abolished regular money.Payne (2004) p=55 The war minister, Diego Hidalgo wanted General Franco to lead the troops. However, President Alcalá-Zamora, aware of Franco's monarchist sympathies, opted to send General López Ochoa to Asturias to lead the government forces; hoping that his reputation as a loyal Republican would minimize the bloodshed.Payne & Palacios (2014) p=90 Franco was put in informal command of the military effort against the revolt.Preston (2006). pp. 78–79. Government troops, some brought in from Spain's Army of Africa,Thomas (1961). p. 81. killed men, women and children and carried out summary executions after the main cities of Asturias were retaken.Preston (2006). p. 79.Beevor (2006). pp. 31–32. About 1,000 workers were killed, with about 250 government soldiers left dead.Thomas (1961). p. 84. Atrocities were carried out by both sides.Payne (1973) pp. 637–638. The failed rising in Asturias marked the effective end of the Republic.Preston (2006). pp. 79–80. Months of retaliation and repression followed; torture was used on political prisoners.Thomas (1961). pp. 84–85. Even moderate reformists within the CEDA became sidelined. The two generals in charge of the campaign, Franco and Manuel Goded Llopis, were seen as heroes.Thomas (1961). p. 85. Azaña was unsuccessfully made out to be a revolutionary criminal by his right-wing opponents.Preston (2006). p. 80. Gil Robles once again prompted a cabinet collapse, and five positions in Lerroux's new government were conceded to CEDA, including one awarded to Gil Robles himself. Farm workers' wages were halved, and the military was purged of republican members and reformed. Those loyal to Robles were promoted, and Franco was made Chief of Staff.Preston (2006). p. 81. Stanley Payne believes that in the perspective of contemporary European history the repression of the 1934 revolution was relatively mild and that the key leaders of the rebellion were treated with leniency.Payne & Palacios (2014) p.92 There were no mass killing after the fighting was over as was in the case of the suppression of the Paris Commune or the Russian 1905 revolution; all death sentences were commuted aside from two, army sergeant and deserter Diego Vásquez, who fought alongside the miners, and a worker known as \\"El Pichilatu\\" who had committed serial killings. Little effort was actually made to suppress the organisations that had carried out the insurrection, resulting in most being functional again by 1935. Support for fascism was minimal and did not increase, while civil liberties were restored in full by 1935, after which the revolutionaries had a generous opportunity to pursue power through electoral means.Payne (2006) pp.100-103 With this rebellion against established political legitimate authority, the Socialists showed identical repudiation of representative institutional system that anarchists had practiced.Casanova (2010) p. 138 The Spanish historian Salvador de Madariaga, an Azaña's supporter, and an exiled vocal opponent of Francisco Franco asserted that: \\"The uprising of 1934 is unforgivable. The argument that Mr Gil Robles tried to destroy the Constitution to establish fascism was, at once, hypocritical and false. With the rebellion of 1934, the Spanish left lost even the shadow of moral authority to condemn the rebellion of 1936\\"Madariaga - Spain (1964) p.416Orella Martínez & Mizerska-Wrotkowska (2015) In 1935 Azaña and Indalecio Prieto started to unify the left and to combat its extreme elements. They staged large, popular rallies of what would become the Popular Front. Lerroux's Radical government collapsed after two major scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, instead calling elections. The elections of 1936 were won by the Popular Front, with vastly smaller resources than the political right who followed Nazi propaganda techniques.Preston (2006). pp. 82–83. The right began to plan how to best overthrow the Republic, rather than taking control of it.Preston (2006). p. 83. The government was weak, and the influence of the revolutionary Largo Caballero prevented socialists from being part of the cabinet. The republicans were left to govern alone; Azaña led a minority government.Preston (2006). p. 84. Pacification and reconciliation would have been a huge task. Largo Caballero accepted support from the Communist Party (with a membership of around 10,000).Thomas (1961). p. 99. Acts of violence and reprisals increased.Preston (2006). p. 85. By early 1936, Azaña found that the left was using its influence to circumvent the Republic and the constitution; they were adamant about increasingly radical changes.Payne (1973). p. 643. Parliament replaced Zamora with Azaña in April. Zamora's removal was made on specious grounds, using a constitutional technicality.Payne (1973). p. 642. Azaña and Prieto hoped that by holding the positions of Prime Minister and President, they could push through enough reforms to pacify the left and deal with right- wing militancy. However, Azaña was increasingly isolated from everyday politics; his replacement, Casares Quiroga, was weak. Although the right also voted for Zamora's removal, this was a watershed event which inspired conservatives to give up on parliamentary politics.Preston (1999). pp. 17–23. Leon Trotsky wrote that Zamora had been Spain's \\"stable pole\\", and his removal was another step towards revolution.Trotsky (1936). pp. 125–126. Largo Caballero held out for a collapse of the republican government, to be replaced with a socialist one as in France.Preston (2006). p. 86. CEDA turned its campaign chest over to army plotter Emilio Mola. Monarchist José Calvo Sotelo replaced CEDA's Gil Robles as the right's leading spokesman in parliament.Thomas (1961). p. 100. The Falange expanded rapidly, and many members of the Juventudes de Acción Popular joined. They successfully created a sense of militancy on the streets to try to justify an authoritarian regime.Preston (2006). p. 89. Prieto did his best to avoid revolution by promoting a series of public works and civil order reforms, including of parts of the military and civil guard. Largo Caballero took a different attitude, continuing to preach of an inevitable overthrow of society by the workers.Preston (2006). p. 90. Largo Caballero also disagreed with Prieto's idea of a new Republican–Socialist coalition.Preston (2006). p. 92. With Largo Caballero's acquiescence, communists alarmed the middle classes by quickly taking over the ranks of socialist organisations. This alarmed the middle classes.Preston (2006). p. 91. The division of the Popular Front prevented the government from using its power to prevent right-wing militancy. The CEDA came under attack from the Falange, and Prieto's attempts at moderate reform were attacked by the Socialist Youth. Sotelo continued to do his best to make conciliation impossible. Casares failed to heed Prieto's warnings of a military conspiracy involving several generals who disliked professional politicians and wanted to replace the government to prevent the dissolution of Spain.Preston (2006). p. 93. The military coup of July that started the Spanish Civil War was devised with Mola as director and Sanjurjo as a figurehead leader.Beevor (2006). p. 49.

Ramasamy is an Indian politician and former Member of the Legislative Assembly of Tamil Nadu. He joined the congress under the then mass leader K. Kamaraj. He rose to power steadily being the Vellakovil Panchayat board president for a period of 10 yrs and then the union chairman for 15 yrs and member of Legislative Assembly 5 times. When the Congress split in Tamil Nadu he joined the NCO under K. Kamaraj. After Kamaraj's sudden demise he, along with G. Moopanar, pulled the party together and merged it with Indira Congress. But in spite of this he was denied an electoral seat in 1980. So he contested as an Independent candidate. This was when Dr. MGR (then chief minister) invited him to his party. So he joined AIADMK and won the elections in 1980 and 1984. In 1989 he was one of the 28 MLA's of ADMK (JL) He was one who pulled the now chief minister of Tamil Nadu J. Jayalalitha out of the Assembly when the DMK members assaulted the opposition parties. In 1991 he was again elected from Vellakovil constituency and became the Minister for Rural Industries. But due to widespread Anti-incumbency wave he lost the election. In 2001 he was again denied an electoral seat from AIADMk so he contested as an independent candidate but lost the election as ADMK members were pumping in money for votes. But he still garnered a lead of 13000 votes in Vellakovil union but whereas the votes in Mulanur union pulled him down and he lost by 1500 votes. He was the only minister of the ADMK government 1991-1996 not to have been arrested under any corruption charges. He is a very straightforward man who is against corruption. He founded his own party and more than 35000 people enrolled in his party. He then again joined ADMK in 2010 and is now retired from active politics. Most political readers suggest his downfall was mainly due to him being straightforward and not bending.

Thanks mainly to their efforts, the chapel was opened in 1839. Galway was one of the worst affected areas in Ireland during the Great Irish Famine, and members of the community risked their lives in attempting to save the lives of their fellow Irish. While assisting the sick and hungry, Alley became infected with fever and died in June 1849. His wife, Mary, died in 1863, aged 62. Both of them were buried at the back of chapel at Victoria Place, over which an impressive monument with a Corinthian pillar was erected. He was an older brother of George Alley.

SS General Karl Wolff stated that he had been ordered on September 13, 1943, to kidnap the Pope. Accounts by former SS and Wehrmacht commanders In the early 1970s, Karl Wolff, former Supreme SS and Police Leader in Italy, promoted the theory of an alleged plot. Most other allegations of such a plot are based on a 1972 document written by Wolff that Avvenire d'Italia published in 1991, and on personal interviews with Wolff before his death in 1984. Wolff maintained that on 13 September 1943, Hitler gave the directive to \\"occupy Vatican City, secure its files and art treasures, and take the Pope and Curia to the north\\". Hitler allegedly did not want the Pope to \\"fall into the hands of the Allies\\".Kurzman, 2007, p. 12.

Reviewing A Special Mission by Dan Kurzman, a promoter of the theory, Deák noted Kurzman's \\"credulity\\" and that the latter \\"uncritically accepts the validity of controversial documents and unquestioningly believes in the statements made to him by his principal German interlocutor, the former SS General Karl Wolff\\". He further criticized the book's \\"modest documentation\\" containing \\"a great number of vague or inaccurate references\\".István Deák. 2008, June 12. \\"Did Hitler Plan to Kidnap the Pope?\\" Vol. 55. No. 10. Erwin von Lahousen testifying at Nuremberg Former Generalmajor Erwin von Lahousen, in his deposition at the Nuremberg Trials on February 1, 1946 (Warnreise Testimony 1330-1430), said that Hitler had ordered the Reichssicherheitshauptamt to devise a plot to punish the Italian people by kidnapping or murdering Pius XII and the King of Italy.Zenit. June 16, 2009. \\"More Proof of Hitler's Plot to Kill Pius XII \\". But, Lahousen said, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the German counterintelligence service, informed his Italian counterpart, General Cesare Amè, during a secret meeting in Venice on July 29–30, 1943. Lahousen and Colonel Wessel Freytag von Loringhoven were also present at this meeting. According to Lahousen, Amè apparently spread the news and the plot was dropped. Rudolf Rahn, the German Plenipotentiary to the Italian Social Republic (RSI), sent a letter to Robert A. Graham (one of the editors of the ADSS) in the 1970s, which was published by Italian magazine 30 Giorni in 1991, stating that such a plot existed but that all documents relating to it had been destroyed or lost; Rahn died in 1975. Sources alleging a plot John Cornwell John Cornwell's Hitler's Pope (1999) subscribes to the existence of such a plot.Cornwell, 1999, pp. 313-315. The only source that Cornwell's account cites is \\"Teste manuscript, 822ff, in the keeping of the Jesuit Curia at the Borgo Santo Spirito in Rome.\\"Cornwell, 1999, p. 407, note 30. Cornwell's version centers on Wolff, but--unlike the account of other secondary authors--does not claim that the matter was not to be put in writing; in fact, Cornwell claims that Wolff \\"sent in about six to eight personnel reports.\\"Cornwell, 1999, p. 314. As with Wolff's own account, Cornwell casts Wolff as the hero, whose \\"purpose\\" was to \\"impede the deportation of the Pope.\\" According to Cornwell, Wolff was able to persuade Hitler to drop the plan.Cornwell, 1999, pp. 314-315. In Cornwell's view: \\"all the facts indicate, therefore, that an attempt to invade the Vatican and its properties, or to seize the Pope in response to a papal protest would have seriously hindered the Nazi war effort. And thus even Hitler came to acknowledge what Pacelli appeared to ignore: that the strongest social and political force in Italy in the autumn of 1943 was the Catholic Church, and that its scope for noncompliance with disruption was immense.\\"Cornwell, 1999, p. 315. The historical value of Cornwell's Hitler's Pope has been questioned in regards to his treatment of the Pope by many other authors, such as Kenneth L. Woodward, who wrote in his review of the book in the September 27, 1999, issue of Newsweek that “Errors of fact and ignorance of context appear on almost every page.” Dr.Peter Gumpel, S.J., an expert in the wartime period of Pope Pius XII's papacy, published a point-by-point rebuttal, including pointing out that \\"Before publication of the book [\\"Hitler's Pope\\"], an article appeared in the Sunday Times, in which Cornwell (who has no academic degrees in history, law, or theology) said he was the first and only person ever to be granted permission to visit the archive of the Vatican secretariat of state, had worked there for months on end, and discovered an unknown and highly compromising letter written by Pacelli on April 18, 1917, which, according to him, had lain there hidden as a time-bomb. All these statements are false and were declared as such in an official and authoritative statement issued by the Vatican in l’Osservatore Romano on October 13.\\"http://www.crisismagazine.com/1999/cornwells-cheap-shot-at-pius-xii Another scholar who addressed Cornwell's publication was Prof. Ronald Rychlak, with \\"Hitler, the War and the Pope\\" and then \\"The Pius War: Responses to the Critics of Pius XII\\", a major anthology, appeared. Also, Rabbi David Dalin wrote \\"The Myth of Hitler's Pope.\\" Dan Kurzman Dan Kurzman, a former foreign correspondent for The Washington Post', maintains in A Special Mission: Hitler's Secret Plot to Seize the Vatican and Kidnap Pope Pius XII (2007) that the planned kidnapping was real and that the interviews he conducted \\"leave little doubt that the plot was serious\\".Kurzman, 2007, pp. ix, 12. Kurzman's book has received attention from Catholic and other Christian news sources and advocacy organizations.Anne Thomas. 2009, April 22. \\"Pope would have quit if captured by Nazis\\". Christianity Today. Kurzman acknowledges that there are no official German documents that refer to the plot, claiming that Hitler prohibited the plot to be put in writing, and bases his book on personal interviews with Germans and Vatican officials. Kurzman's principal source is Karl Wolff, after his release from Allied custody; Kurzman acknowledges that Wolff was demonstrably untruthful in many aspects of his testimony.Kurzman, 2007, pp. x-xi. Kurzman's other interviewees include: Rudolph Rahn, German ambassador to the RSI, Eitel Mollhausen, Rahn's deputy, Albrecht von Kessel, the deputy of Ernst von Weizsäcker, SS Colonel Eugen Dollman, Wolff's liaison to Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, and Peter Gumpel, the Vatican's advocate for canonization of Pius XII. Gumpel has claimed that Pius XII made plans to resign in the event of his kidnapping. Sources denying a plot Owen Chadwick Lichtenstein Castle. Owen Chadwick, a professor of history at Cambridge, having studied the papers of D'Arcy Osborne, the British ambassador to the Vatican during the war, argued that the British Political Warfare Executive (PWE) \\"found it excellent propaganda to put it about that Hitler was just about to kidnap the Pope\\".Chadwick, 1988, p. 275. The British propaganda office fabricated at least two German wireless broadcasts in support of the theory, building upon a pre-existing \\"rumour\\". First, on October 9, 1943, the British released a fake German broadcast claiming that all preparations had been made for such a kidnapping. Then, two days later, another falsified transmission stated that the Lichtenstein Castle in Württemberg was ready to imprison the Pope and cardinals. Osborne himself considered the odds of such a kidnapping incredibly unlikely, as the Pope's presence in the Vatican prevented the British from bombing the key communications center of the German army in Southern Italy, which was adjacent.Chadwick, 1988, pp. 275-276. Weizsäcker, the German ambassador, had already ensured that the Vatican itself would not be occupied by the Germans when they occupied Rome after the collapse of Mussolini's government.Chadwick, 1988, p. 276. Alvarez and Graham David Alvarez and Robert A. Graham, one of the Jesuit priest-historians chosen by Pope Paul VI to edit the ADSS, concur with Chadwick, concluding that \\"the evidence concerning an alleged plot to kidnap the pope is, at best, mixed\\".Alvarez and Graham, 1997, p. 87. Noting that such a kidnapping would have outraged Catholics around the world and seriously destabilized the Third Reich's occupation of majority Catholic nations, Alvarez and Graham argue that Allied propagandists \\"did not shrink from the opportunity\\" to claim such a plot. Alvarez and Graham cite the PWE fabrications mentioned by Chadwick, but also prior PWE propaganda pieces featuring various claims about the Pope contemplating abandoning the Vatican due to Axis threats. Although such rumors were picked up even by German diplomats, Alvarez and Graham conclude that \\"the clearest evidentiary trail in the tangle of rumor, memory and fiction that surrounds the purported plot to kidnap the Pope is the one that leads back to London instead of Berlin\\".Alvarez and Graham, 1997, p. 88. Alvarez and Graham go further in indicting the scholarship of those claiming a plot: > Historians have yet to uncover a single piece of contemporary evidence > indicating that Hitler, Himmler, Bormann, or any other authority had any > serious intention, let alone plan, to invade Vatican City and carry out Pope > Pius XII. As for all the smoke, the recollections are post-war and > suspiciously self-serving; the rumors and warnings second- and third-hand; > the alleged plans and concentration of forces undocumented. The few bits of > credible evidence that do exist suggest that, in fact, there was no plan to > move against the Pope.Alvarez and Graham, 1997, p. 86.

First broadcast on February 3, 1966, and re-aired on May 19, 1966, it continues and concludes the story that began in \\"Instant Freeze.\\" Plot synopsis In the former episode, Dr. Schivel, (also known as Mr. Freeze) previously left Batman and Robin frozen solid. An ambulance takes them to the Gotham City Hospital, where doctors use the \\"Super Hypertherm De- icifier\\" chamber to slowly restore their body temperature to normal levels. But Mr. Freeze has escaped with Princess Sandra's rare diamond, the \\"Giaclio Circlo\\". From his frozen lair, Mr. Freeze learns of their rescue as he watches the news. A henchman enters and reports the success of \\"Operation: Beautiful Diamond\\", and Mr. Freeze commands him to bring \\"something\\" into the coldest part of the lair, where Freeze can survive without his suit and his men must keep to special \\"hot paths\\" or face death from the extreme cold. Watching further, Freeze sees Princess Sandra and Bruce Wayne throw out the first pitch at a baseball game. At that game, the scheduled pitcher, ace Paul Diamante, has tried to appear. A Tiger Moth biplane skywrites over the stadium, \\"Three Strikes, you're out Batman.\\" It is another message from Mr. Freeze and Dick reveals that Diamante means \\"diamond\\" in Spanish. Commissioner James Gordon tells Batman that three disreputable men visited Diamante earlier that day, and when his landlady entered to clean, the apartment was empty of people. She did find a note that read simply, \\"You will soon hear my demands\\" along with an icicle - clearly the work of Mr. Freeze. As the meeting continues, Freeze telephones, and informs the commissioner, Chief Miles O'Hara, and Batman and Robin of his terms: for the safe release of Paul Diamante, he demands Batman in exchange and Batman agrees to come to Mr. Freeze. Batman meets a helicopter, which drops off a chloroformed Diamante. The henchmen jump Batman and bundle him into the copter, then fly off with him. When he awakens inside Mr. Freeze's lair, he discovers that Freeze has stolen his utility belt. He promises Batman some kind of death, but whether it will be merciless or quick depends on Batman, and on how Mr. Freeze feels \\"when the time comes.\\" Dr. Schimmel clearly still holds Batman responsible for the accident that left him unable to withstand temperatures above 50 degrees below zero, and his ostracism from normal society. For the second time, Batman attempts to subdue Mr. Freeze, and twice he fails, overcome by the subzero temperatures in the cold zone which Mr. Freeze is perfectly comfortable. Finally, Mr. Freeze guides Batman along a hot path into a dining room, where Batman discovers that the villain has captured Robin, who followed Batman to the lair. Mr. Freeze serves them a warm dinner of roast beef and spinach, with baked Alaska for dessert. He even offers a cordial after the meal, but of course Batman does not touch a drop of alcohol. Batman pleads with Mr. Freeze to turn himself to get medical attention for condition, but Freeze refuses to believe that would be possible in prison and admits that he will have to murder Robin as well since the boy knows his whereabouts. Following the meal, Mr. Freeze attends to that by reducing the hot zone to a tiny area, his goal to freeze Batman and Robin, slowly in revenge for his skin condition. When he leaves room for only one person, Batman orders Robin to remain inside and then suddenly knocks Mr. Freeze to the ground. Batman took the precaution of wearing his \\"Special Super B Thermal underwear\\" as protection. His previous failures to subdue Dr. Schimmel were simply feints, to throw him off guard. Seizing his control box, Robin quickly warms the entire room and Mr. Freeze begins to suffocate from the heat. Robin creates a small zone of cold to contain Freeze safely, and then Freeze's henchmen appear. They threaten them with handguns, but a quick exposure to Mr. Freeze's preferred temperature convinces them to drop the weapons while a quick shift back to heat cuts short Freeze's interference. With the goons safely disarmed, Batman and Robin subdue them with fisticuffs before the police finally arrive to storm the hideout. Later, Bruce Wayne hosts a reception for the rescued Paul Diamante, and for Princess Sandra, whose rare diamond has been returned to her. But Dick Grayson is not interested in the event's dessert course: Baked Alaska. NEXT WEEK Batman versus Zelda The Great! Notes * Teri Garr makes one of her first TV appearances in Part 1 of this 2-Part story. She is at the beginning of \\"Instant Freeze\\". * This episode features one of the scant few times that Robin actually disobeys an order from Batman. * Despite the fact that no one but Mr. Freeze can survive in the extreme cold of his hideout, his Butler seems to have managed it when he handed Freeze his sherry, as his hand can clearly been seen placing the glass down outside of the warm red area. * The character of Doctor Schimmel/Mr. Freeze was based on the comic book villain Mr. Zero. DC changed Mr. Zero's code name to Mr. Freeze to match the TV show. * The Victor Fries backstory of Mr. Freeze was created twenty-five years later on Batman: the Animated Series. * This is the only appearance of George Sanders as Mr. Freeze. * Dr. Vince is an obvious spoof on the 1961-66 ABC medical drama Ben Casey. * This is the first time that the duo is unable to use its utility belts to escape from a trap.Batman at 45: A Milestone Tribute to Pow, Bam and Zap!

A., is an actress, author and producer. Her first book, From Shakespeare to Coward, was published in 1997 and she has since written six more books on the theatre, including The British on Broadway, A Theatrical Feast of London, and A Theatrical Feast of New York, as well as penning a novel, The Best Actress, promoted by the noted British public relations consultant Richard Fitzwilliams. She speaks regularly at book signings at venues such as the Players Club and National Arts Club in New York. Her most recent book is Passionate Pilgrimages from Chopin to Coward. Early life Sharland was born in Tasmania and studied at St Michael's Collegiate School, also taking private lessons in speech, drama and music. She won a scholarship to study at the Guildhall School in London, and left to take up studies there for two years, gaining a diploma in piano as well as in drama. Her acting career began with her first professional job at the Felixstowe Repertory Company, after which she toured Australia for six months with London's Old Vic Company, alongside Katharine Hepburn and Robert Helpmann. She later lived in Tangier, where she taught music at the American School and performed as house pianist at the Velasquez Hotel. After her marriage, she moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada with her doctor husband who had accepted a position there. She joined the summer stock company The Straw Hat Players to tour Ontario. She performed many roles for CBC Radio and CBC-TV dramas, including the General Motors Hour, with actors Gordon Pinsent, Barry Morse, Robert Goulet and Douglas Campbell. Theatrical work: Paris, New York, London, and beyond Sharland later went to live in Paris, France, where she opened her own English-speaking cafe-theatre, featuring new plays, and she details the experience in her 2008 book A Theatrical Feast in Paris which profiles many of the city's famous theatres and restaurants, including Le Grand Véfour. In 1983, she re-located to New York City, and served as personal assistant to actor Yul Brynner on his final tour of the US in The King and I. She started writing plays, three of which were produced at American Theatre of Actors in New York. After Brynner's death, Sharland moved back to London, producing an anthology entitled Love From Shakespeare to Coward at the Theatre Museum, and she cast over 200 actors to work in it over 6 years. Recent activities Elizabeth Sharland's 2009 book, Passionate Pilgrimages, recounts her years of travelling through Europe and Africa, describing her journey to meet the American composer and writer Paul Bowles, and also offers memories of her family in Tasmania as well as the composers, writers and musicians she went to visit during her career. The book was launched at Hatchard's in London in May 2009, and also on board the RMS Queen Mary 2 in July 2009. Her latest book, Behind the Doors of Notorious Covent Garden is featured as part of New York Lincoln Center's New Books in the Performing Arts series, where Sharland is joined by actress Tammy Grimes and cabaret artist Steve Ross at a March 10, 2011 event at the Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center. She lectures regularly on board the Cunard line of cruise ships, as well as for the American Australian Association, the Society for the Four Arts, the English Speaking Union in Palm Beach and New York, The University Club, the Harvard Club, the National Arts Club and the National Portrait Gallery in London.

It is considered as one of the first combat flight simulators to have a dynamic campaign environment. While the graphics, scenery and audio are quite sparse and basic, the instruments and flight dynamics of a F-16C Fighting Falcon are fully featured and modeled. Gameplay Opposition & player The airborne opposition is made up from MiGs: Mikoyan MIG-31 Foxhound, Mikoyan MIG-27 Flogger and Mikoyan MIG-29 Fulcrum. Most of the missions start with the player inside a hangar, from which the player enters an IFF code, initiate engine start up, taxi without over-speeding, getting on the runway and takeoff - which adds to the tension if the base is under attack. On the ground, there are tank battalions (which moved to different locations as war progressed), radar & missiles installations and Triple-A guns around enemy airfields. It is possible to shoot down friendly aircraft by gunfire, but friendly aircraft can not be designated or tracked by player's radar. The simulation keeps a flying log of all the player's time on F-16 and \\"callsign\\", which also appears in the game when the player contacts the control tower at airfields. (For its time, this was a very advanced feature.) If the pilot \\"dies\\" in combat, this log is erased, and a new \\"pilot\\" is created. Any training missions that were previously completed successfully (using the old \\"pilot\\") will have to be repeated because the player is now playing as new pilot. Weapons The weapons that can be used in the game include: AIM-120A AMRAAM, AIM-9M Sidewinder, Mk82 ( slicks and snakes ), Mk83 slicks, Mk84 slicks, AGM-88A HARM, BLU-107 Durandal, AGM-65 Maverick (IR guided \\"D\\" and laser guided\\"E\\"), M61A1 20mm cannon, LANTIRN Targeting pod, ATARS pod, and the external fuel tanks. The LANTIRN pod is possibly the first to appear in a combat flight simulation. All weapons behave as accurately as possible, missiles can miss if used incorrectly, fired at extreme angles in relation to the enemy fighter or the enemies used countermeasures; the missiles don't make impossible maneuvers to its target as prevalent in other combat simulations of its time. Flight dynamics Dave Marshall of Digital Integration used to program real military flight simulators and had built up a huge library of the technical specifications for the F-16C and knew whom to ask for some of the less readily available information, and this clearly shows in the complexity and realism of F-16 Combat Pilot. The flight dynamics is one of the most accurate for its time. The landing is accurately difficult, the player has to master the AoA (Angle of Attack) and vertical velocity during approach, unlike other combat simulations of its time For example, F-15 Strike Eagle II had extremely unrealistic landings where all the player had to do is simply just aim the plane at the runway at any angle or speed. Being not properly lined up would cause Autoland (used in conjunction with ILS) to disengage if activated, and hard landings beyond certain parameters would damage the landing gear, or even cause a crash. Not following proper speed guidelines while taxiing or going too fast on the runway without lifting off would also damage the aircraft. Unlike other simulations of its time, landing on the nose-wheel would result in a crash due to gear collapse as in real life. A crash is represented with a full screen showing mini explosions, after which the debriefing screen would show up indicating whether or not the player survived. Hard crashes are usually unsurvivable, but the player may walk away from nose-wheel collapses and other minor crashes. The simulation allows the player to perform a wheels- up (belly) landing if the landing gear is damaged and not extendable, however, landing has to be precise and smooth with a very low vertical velocity. The airframe also has G-Force limitations depending on whether the aircraft was fully loaded as the real F-16 has stores configuration categories. When fully loaded, the player can only pull 5.5G's, instead of the 9G's a clean F-16 is capable of. Airspeed & Mach speed would be lower when fully laden as well. The player can even jettison the fuel and weapons to enable the aircraft to pull higher G's, such as in the event of an emergency or in combat or an aborted mission. Spins and ground effect are not simulated, as is with other simulations of its time, although another rare feature, turbulence is a user selectable option at Briefing & Weather screen. Turbulence in the simulation causes random and slight variations in the aircraft's bank angle and heading, making it a little bit more difficult to land, but it never affects the altitude. The damage system is extensively modeled on F-16 Combat Pilot. Each system on board the player's aircraft can be damaged in combat, from radar, landing gear, flaps to ASPJ,Aircraft Self Protection Jammer oxygen/cabin pressure systems, weapons, communications, navigation system or HUD etc... If the player successfully returns to base with a damaged aircraft, the aircraft can be repaired and reused before the debrief screen, provided that given airfield has the necessary components and spare parts. This is indicated by color-coded status in radio communications. The aircraft can survive near missile hits or enemy AAA fire at times, but not a direct hit. When there is an onboard fire, the aircraft will be damaged and explode subsequently (if the player does not eject immediately). It is not uncommon for players to have many \\"dead stick\\" landings with engine failure when returning damaged from combat, out of chaff and flare, and even out of fuel, being chased and fired upon by enemies. Weather and environment Players fly in a large battlefield. A typical flight from one end of the battlefield to the other end usually takes about forty minutes, depending on the traveling speed the player is flying to. The faster the player flies to his target also has the effect of consuming more fuel than usual due to afterburners, especially at low altitude, so some fuel conservation, careful planning and flying is required to come out alive. This battlefield is dotted with 2 sides of factories, towns, airports, power stations, radar installations and tank battalions. This map can be viewed in the Mission Room. Once near enemy border, any flights above 500 feet will cause enemy radars to track the player and MiGs to scramble and vector into the players' position, so this requires flying at low altitude to infiltrate enemy territory for strike missions. Mountains are represented by same-sized pyramids. There are also rivers, bridges (which the player can fly under), SAM sites and roads which makes navigation easier. Although game manual mentions the bridges as supply choke points and calls attention to the importance of destroying them, bombing these bridges has no effect on the progress of the war. In the Amiga version of the game, successfully hitting bridges causes the deck of the bridge disappear while suspenders and towers remain intact. The simulation has been thoroughly thought out - the surprise is that landing on an enemy airfield means that the player has \\"defected\\", and this shows in the debriefing screen. It is also possible to land on roads - which are much narrower and trickier to land on - but this also has the same effect of landing at an enemy airport, and the simulation shows that the player has \\"defected\\" from his country. When flying over towns, one can easily spot the various buildings representing churches, hospitals, and various other buildings. Flying over power stations, one can make out the cooling towers, and so on. It is fairly easy to distinguish visually in between which area you are flying over based on recognizing the landmarks, but such navigation is not really necessary due to the waypoint computer which shows the target waypoint, distance and estimated time to reach it within the cockpit, assuming that this was set in the Mission Room. While it is not possible to fly into a \\"wall\\" when flying out of the map - the player can fly out of the map until he or she runs out of fuel, but upon doing so there will be no more scenery, just a flat piece of land to fly in. The simulation also has a weather system ( fog and low clouds down to 500 feet AGL ) and the combat can even be in the middle of the night. In night flights, there are no outside visual references except for the green thermal image projected onto the HUD by the LANTIRN pods. There was however, lights on the ground though from towns and military installations, which gives very limited orientation from within the cockpit. The programmers claimed that F-16 Combat Pilot's cockpit views were based on the latest version of the F-16 at that time. The game manual states; \\"Following the trend in all modern aircraft towards the \\"glass cockpit\\", the instrument panel has been modified and updated many times since its first design. You are now looking at the very latest version, including the 3 multi-function digital displays introduced as part of the MSIP avionics update programme. This layout was first evaluated in the AFTI F-16 technology demonstrator.\\" As the game was only viewable on 4 angles from within the cockpit, there is no \\"outside\\" look of the player's aircraft, increasing the realism. Many players rely on instruments to fly with, especially in low cloud covers or night missions, which add to the realism of the simulation, but can also be boring for those looking for a quick dogfight. There is an option for a \\"Quickstart\\" but even that will require reading through the manual. Weather is random and cannot be manipulated except in the training sessions. It can be said this sim is not for the ordinary \\"arcade\\" style gamer, as the sheer depth of cockpit and campaign but relatively sparse environment are more suited for the simulator enthusiast. Dynamic campaign This was the first flight simulator with a dynamic campaign. Once the player has become a Mission Commander (via achieving success on all other 5 missions without dying or failing the mission) he or she can control a squadron of other pilots which could be assigned missions by the player to help win the war, and attack targets such as power stations, factories, radar installations and SAM sites. The player can jump into the F-16 as well and perform his/her own mission objectives - this can be anything the player sets it on the mission map - from destroying a target destination or simply fly patrol and shoot down enemies, although it is not possible to communicate with squadron while in-flight. The AI aircraft are up to the task and do a pretty good job - but at the same time, the enemy aircraft AI are also doing a pretty good job attacking the allies. As the war progresses, missions become simpler or more complex as both sides inflict damage, and strategy, (such as targeting factories and radar installations first) is required to win. Weapons and parts may even become unavailable as time goes by. Known bugs When the radar is on, the target cue will light up in the HUD (looking out front) where the enemy aircraft is located on the screen for a brief moment, immediately after looking out left, right or rear angles. This gives a clue where the enemy is, and the player can use this advantage to track where the target is effectively no matter the enemy is on his left, right or from behind. This appears in the DOS version, but it is not known whether it also happens in any other version. Reception F-16 Combat Pilot, although a very good simulator, did not receive much popularity as the DOS version was released a year later than Spectrum Holobyte's Falcon, which was more popular and had much more advanced graphics and audio for its time, and by 1991, the very popular Falcon 3.0 was released. F-16 Combat Pilot was never released with VGA graphics and soon looked very dated. Computer Gaming World approved of the game's graphics and performance, even on the original IBM PC with CGA video, and the modem play. F-16 Combat Pilot was voted \\"best flight simulator\\" by the European Computer Leisure Awards 1990. Digital Integration repackaged and released the game in 1994 under Action Sixteen publishing label after fixing the compatibility issue with Amiga 1200 computers, however the 14-MHz processor of the system ran the game faster than real-time.

As of 2008, Jenisch House is the home of the Museum für Kunst und Kultur an der Elbe. It is located within the Jenisch park in the Othmarschen quarter. History The house was built by Franz Forsmann and Karl Schinkel for Martin Johann Jenisch between 1831 and 1834. Jenisch used it as a country house. Location A view toward the Elbe river Jenisch House is located in Jenisch Park, Hamburg's oldest landscaped park and a protected area of . The park was landscaped by Caspar Voght as a model farm and arboretum about 1800. It is located in the former independent locality of Klein Flottbek, now part of the Othmarschen quarter of Hamburg with a view toward the Elbe river, often described as \\"magnificent\\". In 1828 Jenisch bought the farm and gardens from Voght and redesigned the area with the construction of his house. Jenisch Park participated in the Tag des offenen Denkmals (\\"Day of the Open Heritage Site\\"), a national annual event of the Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz, opening cultural heritage sites to the public, in 2007 and 2008. Architecture The house is designed as a large cube, with a basement, two main floors and an attic floor. The windows are in a 1-3-1 ratio and focus on the center. On the main floors the windows reach almost completely from the floor to the ceiling. The front of the house toward the park and Elbe river has a Doric portico, supporting a balcony.

In a special case of a function on a flat space (technically a simply connected domain), the Reeb graph forms a polytree and is also called a contour tree.. Level set graphs help statistical inference related to estimating probability density functions and regression functions, and they can be used in cluster analysis and function optimization, among other things.  Formal definition  Given a topological space X and a continuous function f: X → R, define an equivalence relation ∼ on X where p∼q whenever p and q belong to the same connected component of a single level set f−1(c) for some real c. The Reeb graph is the quotient space X /∼ endowed with the quotient topology.  Description for Morse functions  If f is a Morse function with distinct critical values, the Reeb graph can be described more explicitly. Its nodes, or vertices, correspond to the critical level sets f−1(c). The pattern in which the arcs, or edges, meet at the nodes/vertices reflects the change in topology of the level set f−1(t) as t passes through the critical value c. For example, if c is a minimum or a maximum of f, a component is created or destroyed; consequently, an arc originates or terminates at the corresponding node, which has degree 1. If c is a saddle point of index 1 and two components of f−1(t) merge at t = c as t increases, the corresponding vertex of the Reeb graph has degree 3 and looks like the letter \\"Y\\"; the same reasoning applies if the index of c is dim X−1 and a component of f−1(c) splits into two.

Its first English publication was a translation in The Sunday Times in 1965 followed by a trade edition by Beckett's London-based publisher, Calder and Boyars, later that year.  Plot  Developed as an offshoot of the longer prose work, All Strange Away, and consistent with Beckett's preoccupation with cylinders and closed spaces in his work of the 1960s, the text explores \\"the theme of the dying imagination yet conscious of its own activity\\".Ackerley & Gontarski, 273. Two white bodies are situated back to back inside a skull-like rotunda or vault. On the verge of extinction, the imagination of an unspecified being succeeds in imagining two bodies enclosed in a silent and motionless black and white environment subject to varying degrees of heat and cold with a brief interlude of grey.Knowlson, Damned to Fame, 531. According to the painter Avigdor Arikha, an intimate of the author, the rotunda was inspired by the Val-de Grâce church in Paris which Beckett could see from his study window. In an imaginative transposition of reality, Beckett reduced the actual dome to a skull-sized vault that \\"has the ring of bone to it\\".Knowlson, Damned to Fame, 531. The bodies of the two figures remain inert while their left eyes open in turn and stare for lengthy periods. The imagination of the invisible and nameless narrator constantly shifts position to examine, like a miniature camera, the two foetus-like figures in their stark environment. In effect, the figures \\"are like embryos waiting either for birth or for extinction\\".Knowlson, Damned to Fame, 532. The text ends with the identities of the two figures appearing to merge to form a \\"white speck lost in whiteness\\".Ackerley & Gontarski, 273.  Adaptations  A 1984 theatrical adaptation of the work pioneered the use of holography in live theater. Produced by the experimental theater group Mabou Mines, the work was directed by Ruth Maleczech with holographic design by Linda Hartinian. Hartinian later explained that such a design was considered impossible as \\"a hologram could only be seen by one person at a time. I didn't depend totally on the 3 dimensional effect, I used theatre. I ran the audience in a cone, because I do know enough physics to understand optical laws\\".Express Magazine \\"Where Desire Leads\\" Reviewing for The New York Times, critic Mel Gussow described the production as \\"a paradigmatic example of the Mabou Mines mastery of technology in the name of art\\".\\"Theater: Pretty Boy and a Beckett\\"  Notes   Bibliography  * Ackerley, C.J. and Gontarski, A.E.

General  Some ideas of crossing the Yellow Sea from the Shandong Peninsula to the Liaodong Peninsula by means of other than the ships, such as the bridges or undersea tunnels, have been discussed in the history of China, particularly since the late 19th century when many people moved to Northeast China in the Chuang Guandong population move and the Beiyang Fleet was stationed in Weihaiwei, Shandong, and Lushun, Liaoning.

Inspired by the work of Germany's Magnus Hirschfeld and his Scientific- Humanitarian Committee, Gerber founded the Society for Human Rights (SHR) in 1924, the nation's first known homosexual organization, and Friendship and Freedom, the first known American homosexual publication. SHR was short-lived, as police arrested several of its members shortly after it incorporated. Although embittered by his experiences, Gerber maintained contacts within the fledgling homophile movement of the 1950s and continued to agitate for the rights of homosexuals. Gerber has been repeatedly recognized for his contributions to the LGBT movement. Early life Gerber was born Heinrich Joseph Dittmar (some sources say \\"Josef\\")Loughery, p. 53 on June 29, 1892, in the city of Passau in Bavaria. He changed his name to \\"Henry Gerber\\" upon emigrating to the United States in 1913. He and others in his family settled in Chicago because of its large German immigrant population. In 1917, Gerber was briefly committed to a mental institution because of his homosexuality. When the United States declared war on Germany, Gerber was given a choice: be interned as an enemy alien or enlist in the Army. Gerber chose the Army and he was assigned to work as a printer and proofreader with the Allied Army of Occupation in Coblenz. He served for around three years.Bullough, p. 25 During his time in Germany, Gerber learned about Magnus Hirschfeld and the work he and his Scientific-Humanitarian Committee were doing to reform anti-homosexual German law (especially Paragraph 175, which criminalized sex between men).Hogan and Hudson, p. 245 Gerber traveled to Berlin, which supported a thriving gay subculture,Hogan and Hudson, p. 246 on several occasions and subscribed to at least one homophile magazine. He absorbed Hirschfeld's ideas, including the notion that homosexual men were naturally effeminate.Despite being naturally masculine and disliking the company of women and effeminate men, (Bullough, p. 32), Gerber continued to espouse the idea of gay men's effeminacy, writing in 1932, \\"The homosexual man does not shun women because he wants to flee from the reality of normal sex life, but because he himself is a woman and his normal sex life is directed to the other sex, another man.\\" (collected in Blasius and Phane, p. 220) Following his military service, Gerber returned to the United States and went to work for the post office in Chicago. Society for Human Rights Inspired by Hirschfeld's work with the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber resolved to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (SHR) and took on the role of secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the (SHR): > [T]o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental > and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of > happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to > combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors > according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society > stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general > laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner > recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner > inimical to the public welfare.quoted in Katz (1978), pp. 386–87Since sodomy > was illegal in every state in 1924, any participation in or advocacy of sex > with other men would constitute a recommendation of an act in violation of a > present law. Illinois was the first state to repeal its law but did not do > so until 1962 (Hogan and Hudson, p. 634). An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 10, 1924, making SHR the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation.Hogan and Hudson, p. 244 Gerber created the first known American gay-interest publication, called Friendship and Freedom, as the SHR newsletter. However, few SHR members were willing to receive mailings of the newsletter, fearing that postal inspectors would deem the publication obscene under the Comstock Act. Indeed, all gay- interest publications were deemed obscene until 1958.Murdoch and Price, p. 47 Friendship and Freedom lasted two issues. Gerber and Graves decided to limit SHR membership to gay men and exclude bisexuals. Unknown to them, SHR vice- president Al Weininger was married with two children. Weninger's wife reported SHR to a social worker in the summer of 1925,Loughery, p. 54 calling them \\"degenerates\\". The police interrogated Gerber and arrested him, Graves, Weininger and another man; the Chicago Examiner reported the story under the headline \\"Strange Sex Cult Exposed\\".Bullough, p. 27 Gerber was tried three times. Charges against Gerber were eventually dismissed but his defense cost him his life savings,Bullough, p. 28 some or all of which may have been in the form of bribes paid through his lawyer.Loughery, p. 55 Gerber lost his post office job for \\"conduct unbecoming a postal worker\\" and Weninger paid a $10 fine for \\"disorderly conduct\\". SHR was destroyed and Gerber was left embittered that none of the wealthy gays of Chicago came to his aid for a cause designed to advance the common good. Later life Gerber's activities between the demise of SHR and 1927 are undocumented. In 1927, Gerber travelled to New York City, where a friend from his Army days introduced him to a colonel. The officer encouraged Gerber to re-enlist and he did. Gerber was posted to Fort Jay on Governors Island and his post-war talents as a proofreader and editor likely put to use by the Army Recruiting Bureau in the production of their magazines and recruiting publications. It was likely that such low profile office work allowed him to continue in the Army, with occasional harassment until 1945, when he received an honorable discharge. During his second enlistment, Gerber ran a pen pal service called \\"Connections\\" beginning in 1930. The service typically had between 150 and 200 members, the majority of whom were heterosexual. He continued writing articles for a variety of magazines, including one called Chanticleer, in which he sometimes made the case for homosexual rights. It was the norm for gay writers to use pseudonyms when writing on gay matters; Gerber sometimes wrote under his own name but sometimes used the name \\"Parisex\\". Gerber continued to write for the next 30 years. In the mid-1940s, Gerber moved to Washington, D.C., where he explored the city’s gay scene, including the popular cruising area in Lafayette Park. In 1953, the editors of ONE magazine—the first nationally- syndicated homophile periodical available in the U.S.—published a letter from Gerber in which he briefly recounted the story of the Society for Human Rights. Almost a decade later, in 1962, ONE published a full-length article, written by Gerber, providing a detailed history of SHR.Bullough, p. 32 During the emergence of the homophile movement in the U.S., Gerber maintained a voluminous correspondence with other gay men, discussing gay organizing and strategies for answering societal prejudice.Bullough, p. 33 Gerber was an early member of the Washington chapter of the Mattachine Society, though he resigned after clashing with chapter president B. Dwight Huggins. Gerber spent the last decades of his life as a resident of the Soldiers' and Airmen's Home. There he worked on his memoirs (the manuscripts are thought to be lost) and translations of German novels. Gerber was 80 years old when he died at the home on December 31, 1972. He was buried in the adjoining United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery . Legacy Gerber was posthumously inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame in 1992. The Henry Gerber House, located at 1710 N. Crilly Court, Chicago, contains the apartment in which Gerber lived when he founded SHR. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on June 1, 2001. In June 2015 it was named a National Historic Landmark. The Gerber/Hart Library at 6500 North Clark Street is named in honor of Gerber and early civil rights defender Pearl M. Hart. Gerber serves as a direct link between the LGBT-related activism of the Weimar Republic and the American homophile movement of the 1950s. In 1929, a young man named Harry Hay was living in Los Angeles. He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met a man who had been a lover of one of Gerber's SHR compatriots. This man told Hay about the Society's brief history.Loughery, p. 225 Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism,Gay Almanac, p. 131 he was inspired by this knowledge to conceive in 1948 a proposal for gay men's political and social group. In 1950 Hay's idea reached fruition when he and several other men founded the Mattachine Society, the first enduring LGBT rights organization in the United States.Hogan and Hudson, pp. 382–83 Notes References Bibliography * Blasius, Marc and Shane Phelan, eds.

After serving in the Seven Years' War he earned promotion to oberst (colonel) over the next two decades. He fought against Ottoman Turkey at Belgrade and became a general officer for his distinguished effort as a siege specialist. He directed sieges against Fort-Louis and Mannheim while fighting the armies of the First French Republic during the War of the First Coalition. Named chief of staff of the army fighting against Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy in 1796, he fought at Bassano and Mantua. In 1800 he was appointed deputy commander of the main army in southern Germany. His efforts ended in a military disaster at Hohenlinden in December 1800. He was made the scapegoat and soon dismissed from the service. Early career Born in 1736, Lauer studied at the Engineer Academy and joined the army of Habsburgs army in 1755. After being promoted to Captain during the Seven Years' War, he became an expert in siege warfare.Arnold, p 205-206 He received promotion to Major in 1773, Oberstleutnant in 1779, and Oberst in 1783. During the Austro-Turkish War (1787-1791) he earned appointment to the rank of General-Major and the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa for his distinguished actions at the Siege of Belgrade in 1789. He was appointed the noble rank of Freiherr in 1790.Smith-Kudrna, Lauer War of the First Coalition Map of Fort-Louis Lauer fought on the upper Rhine River under the command of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser in 1793-1794. On 13 October 1793, Wurmser's army defeated the French in the First Battle of Wissembourg. Putting his engineering talents to good use, Lauer conducted a successful Siege of Fort-Louis beginning the day after the battle. On 14 November, he accepted the surrender of the 4,500-man French garrison and fortress, which was then situated on an island in the Rhine River.Smith, p 61 Still with Wurmser, he fought at the successful Siege of Mannheim in late 1795. For notable actions in capturing a redoubt on 30 October, he earned the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. Promotion to Feldmarschall-Leutnant followed on 4 March 1796. Lauer performed repairs to the fortifications of Mantua when the siege of that city was briefly raised in early August 1796.Boycott-Brown, p 406 On 19 August an order arrived from Emperor Francis II insisting that Wurmser attempt the second relief of the Siege of Mantua. The same order nominated Lauer as Wurmser's chief-of-staff. When drawing up the plan of attack, Lauer assumed that losses would prevent the French from quickly reacting to an Austrian offensive.Boycott-Brown, p 415-416 This belief proved to be a mistake when Bonaparte hurled three divisions north into the upper Adige River valley. After overwhelming Paul Davidovich's covering force at the Battle of Rovereto, the French general sent his troops marching east, then south down the Brenta River valley. Bonaparte crushed Wurmser at the Battle of Bassano on 8 September, then followed the Austrian when he raced southwest toward Mantua. Ultimately, Wurmser became trapped in Mantua with nearly 30,000 soldiers. \\"To his credit, Lauer thereafter proved the key man during the very stubborn defense of Mantua.\\"Arnold, p 206 The fortress finally surrendered on 2 February 1797.Chandler, p 121 After the War of the First Coalition Lauer became the Director-General of Engineers, a post that he held from April 1797 to February 1801. War of the Second Coalition When hostilities broke out in 1799 in the War of the Second Coalition, Lauer was recalled to the field. Jean Moreau's victories over Pál Kray's Habsburg army in May through July 1800 resulted in an armistice on 15 July. During this time, the Austrians were driven from the Rhine to the Inn River. The emperor decided to replace Kray with the 18-year-old Archduke John of Austria. Lauer became the scapegoat for the defeat at the Battle of Hohenlinden Appointed Feldzeugmeister on 5 September, Lauer became John's second-in-command. The emperor expected John to remain a figurehead while Lauer made the important decisions, creating a very awkward command structure. In September, Lauer pleaded for an extension of the truce and was upheld by the emperor. The old general hoped that his army could gain strength for the inevitable clash.Arnold, p 208 On 12 November the armistice lapsed and war broke out again. Franz von Weyrother, Archduke John's chief-of-staff, persuaded John and Lauer to adopt an offensive strategy against the French. Because of the limitations of the Habsburg army, the hard marching only succeeded in tiring out the troops for the coming battle.Arnold, p 214 The combination of John's inexperience, Weyrother's aggression, and Lauer's inability to restrain his colleagues proved fatal. The Austrians scored a costly victory over the French at the Battle of Ampfing on 1 December 1800. This success made the archduke and his staff reckless in their zeal to get to grips with Moreau. Lauer remained cautious but found himself unable to impose his views on the army headquarters. On 3 December, the Austrians advanced in four non-mutually supporting columns through rough terrain to open the Battle of Hohenlinden.Arnold, pp 220-222 Moreau's army ambushed the Austrians and enveloped their left flank, inflicting a decisive defeat.Arnold, pp 237-242 After a vigorous French pursuit, the Hasburg army's morale collapsed, and the emperor was forced to sue for peace.Arnold, p 256 Blamed for the disaster, Lauer retired from the army in 1801. He died in Krems, in Austria on 11 September 1803. He married Maria d'Allio and his son Joseph Lauer, born in 1769, also became a general. Footnotes References Printed materials * Arnold, James R.

Edited by Doreen Bridges. a non-dogmatic magazine of Australian socialism. Palmer's significance is her cultivation of an inclusive and tolerant left intellectual network in Sydney and Australia more broadly, which contributed strongly to the emergence of the Australian new left of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Palmer was additionally an author, educator, servicewoman, trade unionist and communist activist.The Australian Women's Register biography Contributors to Outlook included the writer Stephen Murray-Smith and the historian Ian Turner, who wrote an article, \\"The Long Goodbye\\" for the final issue. \\"How to review over 13 years, 82 issues, of Outlook?\\" his article began. \\"For 13 years, Outlook has been a significant element in the vanguard, standing on the ground of socialist humanism; is there anything that can take its place,\\" he ended.Room for Manoeuvre: essays on history, politics, ideas and play, selected and edited by Leonie Sandercock and Stephen Murray-Smith, Drummond, 1982, Biography Palmer was the daughter of Vance and Nettie Palmer, prominent Australian intellectuals. During her undergraduate career at university Palmer was a newspaper editor. After military service during WWII in an education unit, Palmer took to secondary teaching. Facing difficulty after publishing on the People's Republic of China in 1953, Palmer eventually secured continuing if extremely tenuous casual employment in secondary education in Sydney. A member of the Australian Communist Party, Palmer was expelled after her involvement in circulating the Secret Speech of Nikita Khrushchev, a cause for political expulsion within Australia, where some of the Communist Party leaders claimed the speech was a CIA forgery. As a result of her expulsion, and of that of many of her immediate comrades, Palmer began publishing Outlook, which continued from 1957 to 1970, and was notable for its attention to indigenous issues: at that time particularly those of Australian Aborigines and Papuans in Australia's protectorate. Denis Freney, in his autobiography, A Map of Days: Life on the Left,A Map of Days, Life on the Left, Denis Freney, 1991, Australia, . describes one of the meetings leading to the publication of Outlook after Bob Walshe, a Communist Party member and schoolteacher rang \\"and asked me to attend a meeting to discuss a new journal named Outlook, which he and another party member and high-school teacher, Helen Palmer, wanted to launch. I had met Helen a few times in Bob's historians' group. She was a daughter of the noted writers Vance and Nettie Palmer and a well-known author herself. We met in Helen's flat in North Sydney. Also present was Ken Gott, a party member from Melbourne who had taken many of the initiatives in distributing Khrushchev's speech. He had an unlimited supply from the US consulate. Jim Staples, whose flamboyant exploits as a student comrade were legendary, was also present. He was also distributing the speech without worrying about the consequences for his party membership. He seemed to enjoy the outrage his actions provoked among conservative party leaders. Others, mainly party academics or teachers, crowded Helen's living room.\\" Outlook, under Palmer's direction, published works by Trotskyist intellectuals, which would otherwise have not been available in Australia. Prominent Vietnam antiwar activist and longtime Labor Party member Bob Gould recollects that Palmer was central to the creation of a milieu in Sydney that encouraged and intellectually supported the emergence of the anti-apartheid and antiwar protest movements.

Thus, true virtue does not arise from self-love or from any earth-bound selflessness (these were two common views at the time) but from a desire to see God's glory displayed above all.

Fresco from Sant Climent de Taüll, Catalonia, Spain. Moses and the Burning Bush wing panel, Dura Europos Synagogue Akhenaten; the rays of the Aten sun-disk end in small hands The Hand of God, or Manus Dei in Latin, also known as Dextera domini/dei, the \\"right hand of God\\", is a motif in Jewish and Christian art, especially of the Late Antique and Early Medieval periods, when depiction of Jehovah or God the Father as a full human figure was considered unacceptable. The hand, sometimes including a portion of an arm, or ending about the wrist, is used to indicate the intervention in or approval of affairs on Earth by God, and sometimes as a subject in itself. It is an artistic metaphor that is generally not intended to indicate that a hand was physically present or seen at any subject depicted. The Hand is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a blessing gesture (in Christian examples), but sometimes performing an action. In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a fully realized figure of God the Father, whose depiction had become acceptable in Western Christianity, although not in Eastern Orthodox or Jewish art.\\"Anthropomorphism\\", Jewish Virtual Library, especially the section on Jewish art near the end. Though the hand of God has traditionally been understood as a symbol for God's intervention or approval of human affairs, it is also possible that the hand of God reflects the anthropomorphic conceptions of the deity that may have persisted in late antiquity.Bar Ilan, 321–35; Roth, 191; C. W. Griffith and David Paulsen, 97–118; Jensen, 120–21; Paulsen, 105–16; Jill Joshowitz, The Hand of God:The Anthropomorphic God of Late Antique Judaism: Archaeological and Textual Perspectives, (B.A. thesis, Yeshiva University, 2013). The largest group of Jewish imagery from the ancient world, the 3rd century synagogue at Dura-Europas, has the hand of God in five different scenes, including the Sacrifice of Isaac,Hachlili, pp. 144–145 and no doubt this was one of the many iconographic features taken over by Christian art from what seems to have been a vigorous tradition of Jewish narrative art. Here and elsewhere it often represents the bath Kol (literally \\"daughter of a voice\\") or voice of God, a use also taken over into Christian art. The hand may also relate to older traditions in various other religions in the Ancient Near East.Summarized by Hachlili, 145 In the art of the Amarna period in Egypt under Akhenaten, the rays of the Aten sun-disk end in small hands to suggest the bounty of the supreme deity. Like the hamsa amulet, the hand is sometimes shown alone on buildings, although it does not seem to have existed as a portable amulet-type object in Christian use. It is found from the 4th century on in the Catacombs of Rome, including paintings of Moses receiving the Law and the Sacrifice of Isaac.Hachlili, 146 There are numerous references to the hand, or arm, of God in the Hebrew Bible, most clearly metaphorical in the way that remains current in modern English, but some capable of a literal interpretation. They are usually distinguished from references to a placement at the right hand of God. Later rabbinic literature also contains a number of references. There are three occasions in the gospels when the voice of God is heard, and the hand often represents this in visual art.\\"in Ravenna and in Western art from the ninth until the eleventh centuries\\" according to Schiller I, 149, although Western examples of the hand in depictions of these occasions extend well before and after these dates. Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice.Schiller, II 674 (Index headings) In sacred texts and commentary Armenian, Akdamar, 10th century Hebrew Bible The hand of God, which encompasses God's arm and fingers as well, is one of the most frequently employed anthropomorphisms of the Hebrew Bible. References to the hand of God occur numerous times in the Pentateuch alone, particularly in regards to the unfolding narrative of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (cf. Exodus 3:19–20, Exodus 14: 3, 8, 31).For an overview of scholarship on anthropomorphism in biblical and rabbinic Judaism see Meir Bar Ilan, \\"The Hand of God: A Chapter in Rabbinic Anthropomorphism\\", in Rashi 1040–1990 Hommage a Ephraim E.

New Testament There are no references to the hand of God as an active agent or witness in the New Testament, though there are several to Jesus standing or sitting by the right hand of God in God's heavenly court,Mark 16:19, Luke 22:69, Matthew 22:44 and 26:64, Acts 2:34 and 7:55, 1 Peter 3:22 a conventional term for the place of honour beside a host or senior family member. For example, when Stephen is filled with the \\"holy spirit\\" he looks to heaven and sees Jesus standing by the right hand of God (Acts 7:55). There are three occasions in the Gospels when the voice of God is heard, and the hand of God often represents this in visual art.\\"in Ravenna and in Western art from the ninth until the eleventh centuries\\" according to Schiller I, 149, although Western examples of the hand in depictions of these occasions extend well before and after these dates. Rabbinic literature Anthropomorphic aggadot regarding the hand of God appear frequently in the corpus of rabbinic literature and expand upon anthropomorphic biblical narratives. Christian art Clothed hand clutching wreath, San Clemente, Rome, 1140–43. In Christian art, the hand of God has traditionally been understood as an artistic metaphor that is not intended to indicate that the deity was physically present or seen in any subject depicted. In the late antique and early medieval periods, the representation of the full-bodied figure of God the Father would have been considered a grave violation of the Second Commandment.Linda and Peter Murray, \\"Trinity\\", in The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), 544. According to conventional art historical interpretation, the representation of the hand of God in early Christian art thus developed as a necessary and symbolic compromise to the highly anti-anthropomorphic tenor of the Second Commandment, though anthropomorphic interpretations are certainly plausible.C. W. Griffith and David Paulsen, \\"Augustine and the Corporeality of God\\", Harvard Theological Review 95.1 (2002): 97–118; Robin Jensen, Face to Face: Portraits of the Divine in Early Christianity (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2005), 120–21; David Paulsen, \\"Early Christian Belief in a Corporeal Deity: Origen and Augustine as Reluctant Witnesses\\", Harvard Theological Review, 83.2 (1990): 105–16. In early Christian and Byzantine art, the hand of God is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a blessing gesture, but sometimes performing an action. Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice.Schiller, II 674 (Index headings) In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a fully realized figure of God the Father, whose depiction had become acceptable in Western Christianity, although not in Eastern Orthodox or Jewish art. Iconography The motif of the hand, with no body attached, provides a problem for the artist in how to terminate it. In Christian narrative images the hand most often emerges from a small cloud, at or near the top of the image, but in iconic contexts it may appear cut off in the picture space, or spring from a border, or a victor's wreath (left). A cloud is mentioned as the source of the voice of God in the gospel accounts of the Transfiguration of Jesus (see below). Several of the examples in the Dura Europos synagogue (see below) show a good part of the forearm as well as the hand, which is not found in surviving Christian examples, and most show an open palm, sometimes with the fingers spread out. Later examples in Jewish art are closer in form to Christian styles. In Christian art, the hand of God usually occupies the form of a blessing gesture, if they are not performing an action, though some just show an open hand. The normal blessing gesture is to point with the index and next finger, with the other fingers curled back and thumb relaxed. There is also a more complicated Byzantine gesture that attempts to represent the Greek letter chi, Christ's initial, which looks like a Latin letter \\"X\\". This is formed by crossing the thumb and little finger inside the palm, with only the forefinger and next one extended,Didron, I, 201–3 or a variant of this. Especially in Roman mosaics, but also in some German imperial commissions, for example on the Lothair Cross, the hand is clenched around a wreath that goes upwards, and behind which the arm then disappears, forming a tidy circular motif. Especially in these examples, the hand may show the sleeve of a garment, sometimes of two layers, as at San Clemente, Rome. In blessing forms the hand often has a halo, which also may provide a convenient termination point. This may or may not be a cruciform halo, indicating the divinity, and specifically the Logos, or Pre-existing Christ (see below). Visigothic capital with the Sacrifice of Isaac. The hand is regularly seen in depictions of certain scenes, though it may occur on occasion in a much wider range.See index of Schiller II under \\"Hand of God\\" In many scenes one or more angels, acting as the messengers of God, may appear instead of the hand. A virtually unique mosaic depiction of the Ark of the Covenant (806) at Germigny-des-Prés, also features the hand of God. In Christian art the hand will often actually represent the hand of God the Son, or the Logos; this is demonstrated when later depictions start to substitute for the Hand a small half-length portrait of Christ as Logos in a similar circular frame. It is nearly always Christ in the East, but in the West God the Father will sometimes be shown in this way. However, in many contexts the person of the Trinity intended cannot be confirmed from the image alone, except in those images, like the Baptism of Christ, where Jesus the Incarnate Christ is also present, where the hand is clearly that of God the Father. Later Eastern Orthodox images often identify Hands as the Logos with the usual monogram used in icons. Old Testament imagery *In the Vienna Genesis the hand appears above the Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise. More often, God was shown in this story using the conventional depiction of Jesus representing the pre-existent Christ or Logos, who was seen as the Creator by Early Christian writers, The story of Adam and Eve was the Old Testament subject most frequently seen in Christian art that needed a pictorial representation of God. A well known modern variant of the traditional hand motif is a sculpture of 1898 by Auguste Rodin called the Hand of God, which shows a gigantic hand creating Adam and Eve. *The Sacrifice of Isaac first appears in Christian art in 4th century depictions from the Roman catacombs and sarcophagi, as well as pieces like a fragment from a marble table from Cyprus.Weitzmann, Kurt, ed., Age of spirituality : late antique and early Christian art, third to seventh century, no. 380, 1979, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, ; full text available online from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries. Abraham is restrained by the hand, which in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus grasped his knife hand, as the angel often does in other depictions. However the angel mentioned in the biblical text is more usual, and often included as well. The use of the hand in this scene, at least in Christian art, indicates God's acceptance of the sacrifice, as well as his intervention to change it. Moses receives the Tablets of the Law, and hears the call of God. Paris Psalter. *Some depictions have the hand passing Moses the Tablets of the Law, found in the Roman catacombs, various Bibles (see gallery), the Paris Psalter, and in mosaic in the Basilica of San Vitale, Ravenna.Noga-Banai, Galit. The Trophies of the Martyrs: An Art Historical Study of Early Christian Silver Reliquaries, Oxford University Press, 2008, , Google books *The prophet Ezekiel (2:9–10) received his prophecy by hand: \\"Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe\\"Ezekiel Ch. 2, NIV and this and other moments from Ezekiel sometimes include the hand. In the Paris Psalter, Moses, Jonah and Isaiah are all shown blessed by hands, from which rays of light come. Other prophets are sometimes also shown with the hand. *In the Klosterneuburg Altar, Drogo Sacramentary (shown below) and San Vitale, Ravenna, Melchizedek is shown blessed by it, in the last combined with Abel. This relates to the approval of his sacrifice mentioned in the biblical text, and possibly also to the hand's association with divinely ordained monarchy (see below), as Melchizedek was both priest and king according to Genesis 14:18–20, and his appearance in art is often to evoke this as well as his function as a type for Christ. *The hand can appear in other contexts; the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter atypically illustrates nearly all the Psalms, probably following an Antique model, and shows the hand in at least 27 of these images, despite also using a figure of Christ-as-God in the heavens even more frequently.Utrecht Psalter online – for hands see Psalms 2,5,14,21–23,26,29,40,42,48,53–55,63,77,83,86,105,111,118,123–125,132,136–7. *A mosaic in the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna shows the battle of Beth-horon with the Amorites (Joshua, 10:11), where: \\"As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites\\" – with a large hand representing God. *The story in Daniel 5:1–31 of the writing on the wall is rarely depicted until the 17th century, when Rembrandt's well known version and others were produced. File:Karolingischer Buchmaler um 840 002.jpg|Moses receives the Tablets, c. 840 File:Meister des Drogo-Sakramentars 001.jpg|In the Drogo Sacramentary Melchizedek is shown blessed by the hand. File:Andrea Mantegna 010.jpg|Andrea Mantegna, Sacrifice of Isaac Ascension of Christ and Noli me tangere, c. 400, ivory. See below for a similar Ascension 450 years later. New Testament imagery *In depictions of the Life of Christ, the hand often appears at the Baptism of Christ representing the voice of God, above the dove representing the Holy Spirit, which is much more common, thus showing the whole Trinity as present and active.Grabar, 115 & Schiller, I pp. 134 & 137–9 The hand never seems to appear without the dove, as the Holy Spirit as a dove is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark: \\"As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, \\"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\\"Mark 3:16–17 NIV; all three Synoptic Gospels have the voice. Both dove and hand are normally located centrally, pointing straight down at Jesus. The hand is mostly found in Baptisms between the 6th (e.g. Rabbula Gospels) and 11th centuries. *The hand is found in some Western and later Armenian scenes of the Transfiguration of Jesus,Schiller, I pp. 148–151. See also Mathews, p. 96 where again the Synoptic Gospels have the voice of God speaking, this time from a cloud.Bible texts and commentaries *The hand is sometimes seen in the Agony in the Garden, though an angel is more common. This is the third and final occasion when the voice of God is mentioned in the gospels, this time only in the Gospel of John (12:28). The earliest known example is in the St Augustine Gospels of c.600.Schiller, II, 49 *From Carolingian art until the Romanesque period, the hand may appear above the top of the cross in the Crucifixion of Jesus, pointing straight down. Sometimes it holds a wreath over Christ's head, as on the rear of the Ottonian Lothair Cross at Aachen Cathedral. The hand represents divine approval, and specifically acceptance of his sacrifice,Schiller, II, 107–108 and passim and possibly also the storm mentioned in the gospels. *The hand may be seen in the Ascension of Christ, sometimes, as in the Drogo Sacramentary, reaching down and clasping that of Christ, as though to pull him up into the clouds. The ivory plaque now in Munich (left) with such a depiction is possibly the earliest representation of the Ascension to survive. *In Eastern Orthodox icons of the Last Judgement, the hand often holds the scales in which souls are weighed (in the West Saint Michael typically does this). The hand may emerge from the Hetoimasia usually present, and is typically huge in size compared to the full figures nearby in the composition.

The hand often blesses rulers from above, especially in Carolingian and Ottonian works, and coins. The hand may hold a wreath or crown over the ruler's head, or place it on the head. A posthumous coin of Constantine the Great (the \\"deification issue\\") had shown the hand reaching down to pull up a veiled figure of Constantine in a quadriga, in a famously mixed message that combined pagan conventions, where an eagle drew deified emperors up to the heavens, with Christian iconography. From the late 4th century coins of Late Antique rulers such as Arcadius (and his empress), Galla Placidia and others show them being crowned by it – it was in fact mostly used for empresses, and often only appears on issues from the Eastern Empire.Catalogue of late Roman coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection: from Arcadius and Honorius to the accession of Anastasius, Philip Grierson, Melinda Mays, Dumbarton Oaks, 1992, , Google books gives a full account of Late Antique usage. See also David Sear coin glossary This theme is not then seen in Byzantine art until the late 10th century, when it appears in coins of John I Tzimisces (969–976), long after it was common in the West.Zach Margulies, \\"Christian Themes in Byzantine Coinage, 307 - 1204\\" In later Byzantine miniatures figures the hand is often replaced by a full figure of Christ (in these examples much smaller than the Emperor) placing a crown on the head.Examples here and here A similar symbolism was represented by the \\"Main de Justice\\" (\\"Hand of Justice\\"), part of the traditional French Coronation Regalia, which was a sceptre in the form of a short gold rod surmounted by an ivory hand in the blessing gesture. The object now in the Louvre is a recreation, made for Napoleon or a restored Bourbon king, of the original, which was destroyed in the French Revolution, although the original ivory hand has survived (now displayed separately). Engraved gems are used for an authentic medieval feel. Here the hand represents the justice- dispensing power of God as being literally in the hands of the king.

Saints imagery Presentation miniature in a copy of St Gregory's Moralia in Job, 11th century. The hand can also be shown with images of saints, either actioning a miracle associated with a saint – in Catholic theology it is God who performs all miracles – or above an iconic scene. In the Bayeux Tapestry the hand appears over Westminster Abbey in the scene showing the funeral of Edward the Confessor. The hand sometimes appears (see gallery) in scenes of the murder of martyrs like St Thomas Becket, clearly indicating neither involvement nor approval of the deed, but approval of the saint. In the dedication miniature shown, the blessing hand seems pointed neither at Emperor Henry III, nor St Gregory or the abbot, but at the copy of Gregory's book – the same copy that contains this miniature. This looser usage of the motif reaches its peak in Romanesque art, where it occasionally appears in all sorts of contexts – indicating the \\"right\\" speaker in a miniature of a disputation, or as the only decoration at the top of a monastic charter. A number of Anglo-Saxon coins of Edward the Elder and Æthelred the Unready has a large hand dominating their reverse sides, although religious symbols were rarely so prominent on Anglo-Saxon coins.Casson, 274 & illustration on 269 Icons In Eastern Orthodox icons the hand remained in use far longer than in the Western church, and is still found in modern icons, normally emerging from circular bands. Apart from the narrative scenes mentioned above it is especially often found in icons of military saints, and in some Russian icons is identified by the usual inscription as belonging to Jesus Christ. In other versions of the same composition a small figure of Christ of about the same size as the hand takes its place, which is also seen in many Western works from about 1000 onwards. The earliest surviving icon of the Virgin Mary, of about 600 from Saint Catherine's Monastery, has an often overlooked hand, suggesting to Robin Cormack that the emphasis of the subject is on the Incarnation rather than a simple Virgin and Child. Another of the very few major Eastern works showing the Virgin from before the Byzantine iconoclasm, an apse mosaic (lost in 1922) from Nicaea, also shows the hand above a standing Virgin. Few similar uses of the hand are seen in later Virgins, though the iconographically adventurous Byzantine Chludov Psalter (9th century) has a small miniature showing the hand and dove above a Virgin & Child.Schiller, I, p. 7 & fig. 3 The hand occasionally appears in Western Annunciations, even as late as Simone Martini in the 14th century, by which time the dove, sometimes accompanied by a small image of God the Father, has become more common.Schiller, I pp. 43,44,45,47, figs 82, 97, 108 Anonymous print on the situation of the Netherlands in the 1570s, with three hands Ravenna mosaics The hand appears at the top of a number of Late Antique apse mosaics in Rome and Ravenna, above a variety of compositions that feature either Christ or the cross, some covered by the regular contexts mentioned above, but others not. The motif is then repeated in much later mosaics from the 12th century. Late Medieval and early Renaissance art From the 14th century, and earlier in some contexts, full figures of God the Father became increasingly common in Western art, though still controversial and rare in the Orthodox world. Naturally such figures all have hands, which use the blessing and other gestures in a variety of ways. It may be noted that the most famous of all such uses, Michelangelo's creating hand of God in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, breaks clear of God's encircling robe above the wrist, and is shown against a plain background in a way reminiscent of many examples of the earlier motif. The motif did not disappear in later iconography, and enjoyed a revival in the 15th century as the range of religious subjects greatly expanded and depiction of God the Father became controversial again among Protestants. The prints of Daniel Hopfer and others make frequent use of the hand in a variety of contexts, and the personal emblem of John Calvin was a heart held in the Hand. Very free use of the motif is made in prints relating to the religious and political fall-out of the Reformation over the next two centuries, in prints on the Dutch Revolt for example. In a high Rococo setting at the Windberg Abbey, Lower Bavaria, the Hand of God holds scales in which a lily stem indicating Saint Catherine's purity outweighs the crown and sceptre of worldly pomp. The similar but essentially unrelated arm- reliquary was a popular form during the medieval period when the hand was most used. Typically these are in precious metal, showing the hand and most of the forearm, pointing up erect from a flat base where the arm stopped. They contained relics, usually from that part of the body of the saint, and it was the saint's hand that was represented.

Susiya synagogue In the Susiya synagogue, the hand of God appears on the defaced remains of a marble bimah screen that perhaps once illustrated a biblical scene such as Moses Receiving the Law or the Binding of Isaac.Steven Werlin, \\"Khirbet Susiya\\" in The Late Ancient Synagogues of Southern Palestine, (Ph.D. diss., University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, 2012): 525. Though the hand was subjected to intense iconoclastic hacking, the iconoclasts left some vestiges of the thumb and the receding fingers intact.Steven Fine, \\"Iconoclasm: Who Defeated this Jewish Art\\", Bible Review (2000): 32-43; Robert Shick, \\"Iconoclasm\\", in The Christian Communities of Palestine from Byzantine to Islamic Rule: A Historical and Archaeological Study (Darwin Press Inc.: Princeton, N.J.), 213. A thumbnail has been carved into the thumb.

The word aneurysm refers to a bulge or ‘pocketing’ of the wall or lining of a vessel commonly occurring in the blood vessels at the base of the septum, or within the aorta. In the heart, they usually arise from a patch of weakened tissue in a ventricular wall, which swells into a bubble filled with blood. This, in turn, may block the passageways leading out of the heart, leading to severely constricted blood flow to the body. Ventricular aneurysms can be fatal. They are usually non-rupturing because they are lined by scar tissue. A left ventricular aneurysm can be associated with ST elevation. Signs and symptoms Ventricular aneurysms usually grow at a very slow pace, but can still pose problems. Usually this type of aneurysm grows in the left ventricle. This bubble has the potential to block blood flow to the rest of the body, and thus limit the patient's stamina. In other cases, a similarly developed pseudoaneurysm (\\"false aneurysm\\") may burst, sometimes resulting in the death of the patient. Also, blood clots may form on the inside of ventricular aneurysms, and form embolisms. If such a clot escapes from the aneurysm, it will be moved in the circulation throughout the body. If it gets stuck inside a blood vessel, it may cause ischemia in a limb, a painful condition that can lead to reduced movement and tissue death in the limb. Alternatively, if a clot blocks a vessel going to the brain, it can cause a stroke. In certain cases, ventricular aneurysms cause ventricular failure or arrythmia. At this stage, treatment is necessary. Causes Ventricular aneurysms are usually complications resulting from a heart attack. When the heart muscle (cardiac muscle) partially dies during a heart attack, a layer of muscle may survive, and, being severely weakened, start to become an aneurysm. Blood may flow into the surrounding dead muscle and inflate the weakened flap of muscle into a bubble. It may also be congenital. Diagnosis Left ventricular aneurysm An ECG of a person with a left ventricular aneurysm. Note the ST elevation in the anterior leads. When a person visits the hospital or doctor with other symptoms, especially with a history of heart problems, they will normally be required to undergo an electrocardiogram, which monitors electrical activity within the heart and shows abnormalities when a cardiac aneurysm is present. It can also appear as a bulge on a chest x-ray, and a more accurate diagnosis will then be made using an echocardiogram, which uses ultrasound to ‘photograph’ the heart and how it functions while it beats.t File:UOTW 57 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|Left ventricular aneurysm as seen on ultrasound File:UOTW 57 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|Left ventricular aneurysm as seen on ultrasound Differential diagnosis It should also not be confused with a pseudoaneurysm, coronary artery aneurysm or a myocardial rupture (which involves a hole in the wall, not just a bulge.) Treatment Some people live with this type of aneurysm for many years without any specific treatment. Treatment is limited to surgery (ventricular reduction) for this defect of the heart. However, surgery is not required in most cases but, limiting the patient's physical activity levels to lower the risk of making the aneurysm bigger is advised. Also ACE Inhibitors seem to prevent Left Ventricular remodeling and aneurysm formation. Blood thinning agents may be given to help reduce the likelihood of blood thickening and clots forming, along with the use of drugs to correct the irregular rhythm of the heart (seen on the electrocardiogram)  Cardiac Diverticulum  Cardiac diverticulum or ventricular diverticulum is defined as a congenital malformation of the fibrous or muscular part of the heart which is only visible during chest x-rays or during an echocardiogram reading . This should not be confused with ventricular diverticulum, as the latter is a sub type derived from the latter in congenital cases. it is usually asymptomatic and is only detected using imaging. Fibrous diverticulum is characterised by a calcification if present at the tip ( apex) or a thrombi that may detaches to form an emboli. Muscular diverticulum is characterised by appendix forming at the ether of the ventricles. it is a rare anomaly and can be diagnosed prenatal. Diagnosis is usually done by a chest X-ray and silhouette is viewed around the heart. Echocardiogram reading present a similar picture to ventricular aneurysms on the ST segment. Management is dependent on the situation presented and the severity of the case. Usually surgical resection is advised but in prenatal cases, due to combination with other cardiac abnormalities, especially in latter trimesters, but pericardiocentesis is useful technique to reduce pleural effusion or/ and secondary disorders.

Following Smith's retirement in the summer of 1914, Green became the established right- back, playing in the first twelve matches of the 1914–15 season, before losing his place to Jack Small in November, although he returned to the side in March.

Walsh joined the FBI in 1934, serving during the Public enemy era, and was involved in several high-profile FBI cases, including the capture of Arthur Barker and the killing of Al Brady. He served in the Pacific theatre during World War II with the Marine Corps and, after a brief return to the FBI, served as a shooting instructor with the Marine Corps until his retirement in the 1970s. A high-profile shooter, Walsh won numerous tournaments within the FBI and the Marine Corps, as well as nationally, and participated in the 1948 Summer Olympics. He received awards for his marksmanship until the age of 90 and served as the coach of the Olympic shooting team until 2000. At the FBI's 100th anniversary celebration he was recognized as the oldest living former agent and noted as being a year older than the organization itself. Aside from some hearing and memory loss, he remained physically fit at his 103rd birthday and, in March 2013, became the longest-lived Olympic competitor. Early life and FBI career Walsh was born on May 4, 1907, in West Hoboken, New Jersey, which merged with Union Hill to become Union City in 1925. He joined the Civilian Military Training Corps at age 16, and the New Jersey Army National Guard in 1928. After graduating from Rutgers Law School, Walsh joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1934. Later that year, he discovered the body of gangster Baby Face Nelson, who died of injuries sustained in a gun battle with the police in Barrington, Illinois, on November 27, 1934. Nelson had killed two FBI agents prior to fleeing the scene, wounded, and later died at his wife's side. The FBI, unaware of Nelson's death, continued a broad search for him, which included several home raids, through the night and into the following day. The search was not called off until a tip led them to Nelson's body, which was lying in a ditch in what is now Skokie, Illinois. Walsh was on the team that captured criminal Arthur Barker, son of gangster Ma Barker, in Chicago in 1935 and was later involved in tracking Public Enemy Number One Al Brady in 1937. On October 12 of that year, he was with the group of FBI agents who ambushed and killed Brady in a shoot-out at a Bangor, Maine sporting goods store. While waiting for Brady to arrive, he acted as a clerk in the store for several days and arrested Brady Gang member James Dalhover. As the operation leader, Walsh's job was to alert thirteen other agents, as well as over 30 other state and local policemen, of any gang member's arrival by pulling a cord on the window. As they were interrogating Dalhover in the store Clarence Lee Shaffer, Jr., another gang member, entered the building and began firing at the agents. While arresting Dalhover, Walsh took five bullets to his hand, shoulder and right chest, but quickly returned to work. Walsh was employed with the FBI until 1942 when, as a Reserve Marine lieutenant, he took a leave to serve with the United States Marine Corps during World War II. After he left, Hoover refused to allow any more active agents to be members of any military reserve. He fought in the Pacific Theater, specifically on Okinawa and in North China. In one incident, he and his comrades were pinned down by a sniper, whom Walsh was able to kill from 90 yards away with a single shot to the torso from a M1911 pistol. He earned the rank of colonel and returned to the FBI for two years from 1946 to 1947. In total, during his tenure with the agency, he killed between 11 and 17 suspects. Shooting and the Olympics Walter Walsh in 1939 Walsh got his start with firearms shooting clothespins off of his aunt's laundry line. In 1935, he joined the FBI pistol team. Within three years of joining the FBI, he had been presented with two marksmanship trophies from director J. Edgar Hoover. In 1939, at Camp Ritchie, he set the world record in pistol shooting with 198 points out of a possible 200 and won the individual eastern regional pistol championships in 1939 and 1940 and placing second in 1941 after leading for most of the tournament. He placed 12th in the Men's Free Pistol, 50 metres competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. At the 1952 ISSF World Shooting Championships, he won a gold medal with the United States team in the 25 m Center-Fire Pistol event and a silver in the individual version of that event. After winning many tournaments within the United States Marine Corps, he became commander of their marksmanship training, a position that he held for many years, until he retired in 1970. In total, he was selected five times for the All-American Pistol Shooting Team. Later life Walsh had three daughters, two sons and seventeen grandchildren. As late as 1997, he was still receiving awards for his marksmanship, winning the Outstanding American Handgunner of the Year. Until 2000 he served as a coach for the Olympic shooting team, able to see without the aid of glasses even at the age of 92. At the age of 100 he was present at a re-enactment of the Al Brady shoot out in Bangor, Maine. At this event, he was presented with a plaque and the key to the city. At the age of 101, he was the FBI's oldest living former agent and was in excellent physical shape, aside from some hearing and memory loss. He credited his longevity to luck, listening to his parents and blessings from God. At the 100th anniversary celebration of the FBI, it was noted that Walsh was older than the agency itself. In March 2013, at the age of 105, he surpassed American gymnast Rudolf Schrader to become the longest-lived Olympic competitor. He died at his home in Arlington, Virginia on April 29, 2014, five days before his 107th birthday.

The club met with immediate success, winning the Welsh National League Division One championship in 1926–27, ahead of Bangor City and Rhyl, and repeating the feat in 1929–30 having been pipped to the title by Connah's Quay & Shotton 12 months earlier. Caernarvon Athletic are still remembered for their FA Cup run in 1929 when they defeated Darlington before going out to Bournemouth in a second round replay, the first game at the Oval attracting a crowd of some 9,000.

Its journalists evaluate original statements and publish their findings on the PolitiFact.com website, where each statement receives a \\"Truth-O-Meter\\" rating. The ratings range from \\"True\\" for statements the journalists deems as accurate to \\"Pants on Fire\\" (from the taunt \\"Liar, liar, pants on fire\\") for claims the journalists deems as false or ludicrous. PunditFact, a related site that was also created by the Times editors, is devoted to fact-checking claims made by political pundits. Both PolitiFact and PunditFact were funded primarily by the Tampa Bay Times and ad revenues generated on the website until 2018, and the Times continues to sell ads for the site now that it is part of Poynter, a non-profit organization that also owns the newspaper. PolitiFact increasingly relies on grants from several nonpartisan organizations, and in 2017 launched a membership campaign and began accepting donations from readers. In addition to political claims, the site monitors the progress elected officials make on their campaign promises, including a \\"Trump-O-Meter\\" for President Donald Trump and an \\"Obameter\\" for President Barack Obama.

The organization was acquired in February 2018 by the Poynter Institute, a non-profit journalism education and news media research center that also owns the Tampa Bay Times.  \\"Lie of the Year\\"  Since 2009, PolitiFact.com has declared one political statement from each year to be the \\"Lie of the Year.\\" ; 2009 In December 2009, they declared the Lie of the Year to be Sarah Palin's assertion that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009 would lead to government \\"death panels\\" that dictated which types of patients would receive treatment.PolitiFact's Lie of the Year: 'Death panels' , Angie Drobnic Holan, PolitiFact.com, December 18, 2009 ; 2010 In December 2010, PolitiFact.com dubbed the Lie of the Year to be the contention among some opponents of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that it represented a \\"government takeover of healthcare\\". PolitiFact.com argued that this was not the case, since all health care and insurance would remain in the hands of private companies.PolitiFact's Lie of the Year: 'A government takeover of health care' , Bill Adair and Angie Drobnic Holan, PolitiFact.com, December 16, 2010 ; 2011 PolitiFact's Lie of the Year for 2011 was a statement by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) that a 2011 budget proposal by Congressman Paul Ryan, entitled The Path to Prosperity and voted for overwhelmingly by Republicans in the House and Senate, meant that \\"Republicans voted to end Medicare\\".Lie of the Year 2011: 'Republicans voted to end Medicare' , PolitiFact.com, December 20, 2011 PolitiFact determined that, though it is true the Republican plan would change Medicare fundamentally by forcing the elderly to use private health plans - the very thing Medicare was intended to substitute for - a radically transformed program could still be termed \\"Medicare\\" so it was not technically true that \\"Republicans voted to end Medicare\\". PolitiFact had originally labeled nine similar statements as \\"false\\" or \\"pants on fire\\" since April 2011. ; 2012 For 2012, PolitiFact chose the claim made by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney that President Obama \\"sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China\\" at the cost of American jobs. (The \\"Italians\\" in the quote was a reference to Fiat, who had purchased a majority share of Chrysler in 2011 after a U.S. government bailout of Chrysler.) PolitiFact had rated the claim \\"Pants on Fire\\" in October. PolitiFact's assessment quoted a Chrysler spokesman who had said, \\"Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China.\\" As of 2016, 96.7 percent of Jeeps sold in the U.S were assembled in the U.S., with roughly 70 percent North American parts content. (The vehicle with the most North American parts content came in at 75%). ; 2013 The 2013 Lie of the Year was President Barack Obama's promise that \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it\\". As evidence, PolitiFact cited 4 million cancellation letters sent to American health insurance consumers. PolitiFact also noted that in an online poll, readers overwhelmingly agreed with the selection. This stands in stark contrast to its October 9, 2008 statement that Obama's “description of his plan is accurate, and we rate his statement True.” ; 2014 PolitiFact's 2014 Lie of the Year was \\"Exaggerations about Ebola\\", referring to 16 separate statements made by various commentators and politicians about the Ebola virus being \\"easy to catch, that illegal immigrants may be carrying the virus across the southern border, that it was all part of a government or corporate conspiracy\\". These claims were made in the midst of the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa when four cases were diagnosed in the United States in travelers from West Africa and nurses who treated them. PolitiFact wrote, \\"The claims – all wrong – distorted the debate about a serious public health issue.\\" ; 2015 PolitiFact's 2015 Lie of the Year was the \\"various statements\\" made by 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Politifact found that 76% of Trump's statements that they reviewed were rated \\"Mostly False,\\" \\"False\\" or \\"Pants on Fire\\". Statements that were rated \\"Pants on Fire\\" included his assertion that the Mexican government sends \\"the bad ones over\\" the border into the United States, and his claim that he saw \\"thousands and thousands\\" of people cheering the collapse of the World Trade Center on 9/11.2015 Lie of the Year: the campaign misstatements of Donald Trump , Angie Drobnic Holan and Linda Qiu PolitiFact.com, December 21, 2015 ; 2016 PolitiFact's 2016 Lie of the Year was \\"fake news\\" referring to fabricated news stories including the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. ; 2017 PolitiFact's 2017 Lie of the Year was Donald Trump's claim that Russian election interference is a \\"made-up story.\\" The annual poll found 56.36% of the 5080 respondents agreed that Trump's \\"Pants on Fire\\" statement deserved the distinction. Raul Labrador's statement that \\"Nobody dies because they don't have access to health care,\\" and Sean Spicer's statement that \\"[Trump's audience] was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period,\\" came in second and third place getting 14.47% and 14.25% of the vote respectively. In its article, PolitiFact points to multiple occasions where Donald Trump stated that Russia had not interfered with the election despite multiple government agencies claiming otherwise. ; 2018 Politifact's 2018 Lie of the Year was that survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting were crisis actors. These conspiracy theories were spread on blogs and social media by sources including InfoWars, and targeted students including Emma González and David Hogg, who became prominent gun control activists in the wake of the shooting and helped organize the March for our Lives. 2019 Politifact's 2019 Lie of the Year was Donald Trump's claim that the anonymous whistleblower who reported possible presidential misconduct got the report of his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \\"almost completely wrong.\\" The whistleblower complaint alleged that President Trump urged President Zelensky to conduct an investigation into Trump's political rival in return for promised military aid.  Reception  PolitiFact.com was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 2009 for \\"its fact-checking initiative during the 2008 presidential campaign that used probing reporters and the power of the World Wide Web to examine more than 750 political claims, separating rhetoric from truth to enlighten voters\\".The 2009 Pulitzer Prize Winners Retrieved August 16, 2010. A Wall Street Journal opinion editorial by Joseph Rago in December 2010 called PolitiFact \\"part of a larger journalistic trend that seeks to recast all political debates as matters of lies, misinformation and 'facts,' rather than differences of world view or principles\\". TV critic James Poniewozik at Time characterized PolitiFact as having the \\"hard-earned and important position as referee in the mudslinging contest—a 'truth vigilante,' as it were\\", and \\"PolitiFact is trying to do the right thing here. And despite the efforts of partisans to work the refs by complaining about various calls they’ve made in the past, they’re generally doing a hard, important thing well. They often do it better than the rest of the political media, and the political press owes them for doing it.\\" Poniewozik also suggested, \\"they need to improve their rating system, to address the irresponsible, the unprovable, the dubious. Otherwise, they’re doing exactly what they were founded to stop: using language to spread false impressions.\\" Mark Hemingway of The Weekly Standard criticized all fact-checking projects by news organizations, including PolitiFact, the Associated Press and the Washington Post, writing that they \\"aren't about checking facts so much as they are about a rearguard action to keep inconvenient truths out of the conversation\\".Lies, Damned Lies, and ‘Fact Checking’ , Mark Hemingway, The Weekly Standard, December 19, 2011 In February 2011, University of Minnesota political science professor Eric Ostermeier analyzed 511 PolitiFact stories issued from January 2010 through January 2011. He found that the number of statements analyzed from Republicans and from Democrats was comparable, but Republicans have been assigned substantially harsher grades, receiving 'false' or 'pants on fire' more than three times as often as Democrats. Ostermeier suggested that this may indicate a bias in the selection of statements to analyze, concluding: \\"The question is not whether PolitiFact will ultimately convert skeptics on the right that they do not have ulterior motives in the selection of what statements are rated, but whether the organization can give a convincing argument that either a) Republicans in fact do lie much more than Democrats, or b) if they do not, that it is immaterial that PolitiFact covers political discourse with a frame that suggests this is the case.\\" PolitiFact editor Bill Adair responded in MinnPost: \\"Eric Ostermeier's study is particularly timely because we've heard a lot of charges this week that we are biased—from liberals [...] So we're accustomed to hearing strong reactions from people on both ends of the political spectrum. We are a news organization and we choose which facts to check based on news judgment.\\" In December 2011, Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy wrote in the Huffington Post that the problem with fact-checking projects was \\"there are only a finite number of statements that can be subjected to thumbs-up/thumbs-down fact-checking\\".PolitiFact and the Limits of Fact-Checking , Dan Kennedy, Huffington Post, December 13, 2011. Matt Welch, in the February 2013 issue of Reason magazine, criticized PolitiFact and other media fact-checkers for focusing much more on statements by politicians about their opponents, rather than statements by politicians and government officials about their own policies, thus serving as \\"a check on the exercise of rhetoric\\" but not \\"a check on the exercise of power\\".

It was developed by original Macintosh team member Donn Denman, with help from fellow Apple programmers Marianne Hsiung, Larry Kenyon, and Bryan Stearns, as part of the original Macintosh development effort starting in late 1981. Andy Hertzfeld said, \\"A BASIC interpreter would be important, to allow users to write their own programs. We decided we should write it ourselves, instead of relying on a third party, because it was important for the BASIC programs to be able to take advantage of the Macintosh UI, and we didn't trust a third party to 'get it' enough to do it right.\\" MacBASIC was released as beta software in 1985, and was adopted for use in places such as the Dartmouth College computer science department, for use in an introductory programming course. In November 1985, Apple abruptly ended the project as part of a deal with Microsoft to extend the license for BASIC on the Apple II. Although Apple retracted MacBASIC, unlicensed copies of the software and manual still circulated, but because MacBASIC was no longer supported by Apple and was not designed to be 32-bit-clean, interest eventually died out. Benchmarks published in the April 1984 issue of BYTE magazine suggested that MacBASIC had better performance as compared to Microsoft BASIC. The language included modern looping control structures, user-defined functions, graphics, and access to the Macintosh Toolbox. The development environment supported multiple programs running simultaneously with symbolic debugging including breakpoints and single-step execution.

She was the sister of Scottish kings Malcolm IV and William I, wife of Conan IV, Duke of Brittany, and the mother of Constance, Duchess of Brittany. Her second husband was Humphrey de Bohun, hereditary Constable of England. Following her second marriage, Margaret styled herself as the Countess of Hereford. Family Margaret's parents were Henry of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon and Northumbria, and Ada de Warenne. She has traditionally been considered the second eldest daughter, younger than Ada, but it is possible that Margaret was the eldest since she married before Ada and was named after their paternal great-grandmother Saint Margaret (while Ada was named after their maternal great-grandmother Adelaide of Vermandois). In 1160, Margaret became Duchess of Brittany and Countess of Richmond by marrying her first husband, Conan IV, Duke of Brittany, Earl of Richmond. Margaret's origins and first marriage were deduced by Benedict of Peterborugh. Together Conan and Margaret had at least four children: * Constance, Duchess of Brittany (c. 1161 – September 1201), married firstly in 1181, Geoffrey Plantagenet, by whom she had three children, including Arthur I of Brittany; she married secondly in 1188, Ranulph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester; she married thirdly in 1199, Guy of Thouars, by whom she had twin daughters, including Alix of Thouars; * At least two children who died young;Judith Everard and Michael Jones, The Charters of Duchess Constance of Brittany and Her Family (1171-1221), The Boydell Press, 1999, pp 93-94 * William (- aft. 1199/1201).Everard, Judith (2000).

It has rough, stringy or fibrous bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and hemispherical, conical or cup-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus resinifera is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, stringy or fibrous, reddish brown bark in long strips on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull green, lance-shaped leaves that are paler on the lower surface and long, wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, dark, glossy green on the upper surface, paler below, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long and with a fine, long point. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical, horn-shaped or beaked operculum. Flowering occurs in December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical, conical or cup-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves protruding strongly.Wild Plants of Greater Brisbane, Queensland Museum, 2003, Michelle Ryan (ed.) Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus resinifera was first formally described in 1790 by James Edward Smith in John White's book, Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales. The specific epithet (resinifera) is from the Latin resiniferus meaning \\"resin-bearing\\". In 1990, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill described two subspecies, and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus resinifera subsp. hemilampra (F.Muell.) L.A.S.Johnson & K.D.Hill (originally described by Ferdinand von Mueller as Eucalyptus hemilampra); * Eucalyptus resinifera Sm. subsp. resinifera. The two subspecies differ in the length of the operculum. In subspecies resinifera it is less than three times as long as the floral cup and in species hemilampra more than three times as long. Distribution and habitat Red mahogany is found in coastal areas from Nowra in New South Wales to Gladstone in Queensland, with disjunct populations further north as far as Coen. It grows in forest on flats, valleys and gentle slopes, preferring soils of medium to high fertility. Subspecies hemilampra occurs between Taree and Gladstone, whilst subspecies resinifera occurs between Nowra and Taree, then disjunctly north of Gladstone.A Field Guide to Eucalypts Volume 1 Brooker & Kleinig page 135 Ecology Red mahogany has wildlife value as a food tree for koalas.  Uses  The timber of red mahogany is well regarded for its high quality, being very hard and heavy, and having dark-red heartwood. It has multiple uses including flooring, panelling, cladding, boat building, railroad ties and general construction. It is also a good choice for making poles and charcoal. E. resinifera has been exported for use as a crop plant on plantations in varying locales in Africa (Madagascar, South Africa and Zimbabwe), Western Europe (Italy and Portugal), and the U.S. (Hawaiian Islands).Larouse Pocket Guide Trees of Britain and Europe page 164  References  resinifera Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland ","title":"Eucalyptus resinifera"},{"id":"24127336","text":"Charles Curtin (1890 – 29 July 1967) was an English professional footballer who played at outside-forward for various clubs either side of the First World War. Football career Curtin was born in Gateshead and started his football career in the village of Ryhope, before joining Norwich City of the Southern League in July 1911. After two seasons at The Nest, in April 1914 he moved to the south coast to join fellow Southern League team, Southampton. He made his debut for the \\"Saints\\" in the penultimate match of the 1913–14 season, when he replaced Sid Kimpton in a 2–1 defeat at Northampton on 18 April. At the start of the next season, Kimpton had regained his place at outside-right, although Curtin replaced him for two matches in September, before taking over at No. 7 permanently at the end of October, with Kimpton switching to centre-forward. Described as \\"a sturdily-built outside-right\\", Curtin was \\"exceptionally fast (and) could turn and leave many of his opponents floundering\\". During the 1914–15 season, his supply of dangerous and accurate crosses enabled Fred Jones, Kimpton and Arthur Dominy to become the chief marksmen in the Southern League. In 1915, he left the club and after the First World War returned to his native north-east with West Stanley of the North Eastern League, before spells with Workington and Caernarvon Athletic.
