The site is referred to as a cromlech by analogy with similar monuments in Western Europe, but it is the only structure of its kind known in the country. Description The site is situated on a low ridge-top above the left bank of the Arda river. It is enclosed on all sides and isolated from external influences. The circle consists of vertical, roughly-shaped, blocks of local hard volcanic rock (rhyodacite). The blocks are trapezoidal in shape, and are approximately 1.2 to 1.5 metres tall, and around 0.9 to 1.2 metres wide at the base, and 0.4 to 0.6 metres thick. Nine blocks still stand and three are now fallen. The vertical blocks are spaced at regular intervals, with smaller stones placed horizontally between them. The circle has an internal diameter of about 10 metres. There is an entrance on the southeast side. There are two smaller structures in the vicinity. One is a 3-metre-wide oval enclosure constructed out of stones located around 15 metres southeast of the cromlech. The other is a slightly larger oval enclosure of the same type, with a diameter of about 6 metres, located around 19 metres south of the cromlech. Excavations The site was discovered and excavated by Georgi Nehrizov in around 1998‚Äì1999. The excavations uncovered decorated pottery, as well as bronze artefacts (a fibula and a pin). These date the construction of the cromlech to the second phase of the Early Iron Age (8th‚Äì6th centuries BC). The two stone enclosures were in use around the same time, and finds of burnt human bone suggest a funereal use. The site continued in use into the late Iron Age.

It was released on IOS on June 22, 2016 by Perchang Games.  Gameplay  In Perchang the player is tasked with getting a certain number of balls from a designated starting point to go into a funnel located somewhere else in the environment to complete a level. The player must get the required number of balls into the funnel in a certain time limit to complete the level. In most levels the path between the start and end points is like Rube Goldberg machine with elements (environmental objects) such as magnets and flippers that need to be properly operated to get the balls to the funnel. The environmental objects are colored red or blue. Tapping the red button activates the objects colored red and tapping the blue button activates the objects colored blue. The player can change the color of the environmental objects which is done by tapping on the object (if the object was red it will become blue and vice versa). As the player progresses through the levels new elements are introduced such as magnets, flippers, fans, portals and more. The game has 60 levels, with 50 being regular levels (arranged in 10 areas) and 10 being bonus levels unlocked by getting a gold metal (done by completing the level in a certain amount of time or less) on all levels in an area. On October 27, 2016, a black mode was added with new zero g levels.  Reception  Perchang got mostly positive reviews. 148 Apps called the game a \\"beautifully minimalist puzzle game\\" and rated it 4 stars out of 5. A reviewer at Pocket Tactics said that the game \\"reminds me surprisingly strongly of playing Angry Birds\\". They gave the game 3 out of 5 stars saying that it was \\"attractive and engaging to think about, less enjoyable for which to perfect solutions\\". Apple'N'Apps gave the game a score of 4.0 out 5 praising that the game \\"combines thought and timing skill\\", has \\"varied contraptions\\", and has a \\"high quality design\\" while criticizing the fact that \\"some levels can be tedious\\" and \\"solutions can also drag out a bit\\". TouchArcade called the game like \\"Marble Madness meets Lemmings\\". The game also reached the Top Charts for paid apps in the US and UK App Stores (it was in #3 position on July 5, 2016).

Introduction  Mega-Merger was developed by Robert Gray Gallager at MIT in 1983. It applies a distributed divide and conquer approach mixed with a rank-based conquer strategy. The algorithm is usually presented through a village-city analogy. Each node in the graph indicates a village, while the edges that connect them are the roads and a rooted spanning tree in a sub-graph is a city. The whole graph is then a mega-city. Mega-Merger pushes villages to bind together to form cities according to each other's rank and edges. Cities are then formed by alliances or by conquering/absorption.  Pre-requisites  Mega-Merger builds a minimum spanning tree over connected graphs provided: * Total reliability: No message is lost in transmission. * UI (unique initiator): A single node starts the protocol. * Bi-directional communications channels: Each edge is bi- directional, communications can travel in both directions. No further restrictions are necessary.  Algorithm  The algorithm assigns to each village a name and a rank, the former usually unique. The latter states the number of friendly mergers that the city has gone through, and the larger it is, the more powerful a city is considered. Moreover, to each edge is assigned a weight: each village/city C has a minimum-weight edge e_{merge}(C, C') also called merge link, that is the edge whose traversal has minimum cost. The algorithm proceeds in consecutive stages until a mega-city is formed. Each city C computes its own merge link and sends a request for merging across e_{merge}(C, C'). The request is handled by C' in the following ways: # Friendly merge: rank(C) = rank(C') land e_{merge}(C, C') = e_{merge}(C', C): If the cities share the same merge link and have same rank, a friendly merge occurs, and the two cities merge into one. A new name is picked for the newly created city, a ruling village is picked and the path from the previous ruler to the node in the merge link is re-oriented such that it leads to the new leader. The new city also has its rank increased by one. Notice as this is the only way two cities can increase each other's rank. # Absorption: rank(C) < rank(C'): If the requesting city has a lower rank, the city in the receiving end enacts an absorption process: C is absorbed like in the friendly merge, but loses its name and the resulting city has the rank of C'. # Suspension: rank(C) = rank(C') land e_{merge}(C, C') eq e_{merge}(C', C) lor rank(C) > rank(C'): In such cases C' freezes the request: it waits to either be absorbed by rule 2 or to merge and increase its rank above the one of C in order to be able to enact rule 1 and absorb C.  Outside messages  No nodes in the graph have a list of villages belonging to their village, hence each time a city wants to look for edges leading outside of it, it has to adopt an ask- reply protocol. The city ruler sends a broadcast message through its spanning tree, and each node x receiving it sends requests to its neighbors, excluding the edges to its child(ren) and parent. The response protocol is as follows: * x.city = y.city: clearly the edge is an intra-edge in C. x and y exchange negative responses. * x.city eq y.city land x.rank < y.rank: x is asking to a city of higher rank. By rule 2 we can assert that no absorption occurs, and y indeed belongs to another city. * x.city eq y.city land x.rank > y.rank: in this case y will delay the answer as by rule 3.  Properties  Mega- Merger holds several properties: * Monotonic rank: Each city C, mega-city excluded, will eventually rise in rank. By rule 1 C could friendly merge, raising its rank by 1; by rule 2 and 3 C will have a merge link (by hypothesis C is not the mega-city) it will either ask a higher-rank city C', getting absorbed and increasing its rank, or wait until C' reaches its level and operate a friendly merge. * rank(C) = K implies C geq 2^k: we have a level increase each time a friendly merge is operated. We compute by induction: on the base case, rank(C) = 0, exactly one village is in C. On the inductive case, two cities C', C s.t. rank(C') = rank(C) = k operate a friendly merge, hence C'-C = C' + C = 2^k + 2^k = 2^{k+1} by inductive hypothesis. * max{rank(C)} leq log n: by the previous rule cities are built up on an exponential base 2, hence the inverse log_{2} n. * Deadlock prevention: Mega- Merger doesn't incur in any deadlock. As shown by rule 3 a city C can wait for a lower-rank city to answer on merge link e: in order to incur in a deadlock such city C' would have to wait on C, and C on C, and so on until a cycle is detected on C^n waiting on C on a merge link e'. But by hypothesis e is the merge-link of C, hence such chain cannot exist. The other deadlock-inducing situation is a request from C to C' where C' has a different merge link than C. Still, as shown by monotonic rank either C' will grow its rank to absorb C, or will consume all its merge links to be the only city in the graph with C. Trivially in such case the two merge links would coincide and C' would be forced into absorption by rule 2.  Termination  Termination is granted by deadlock prevention and total reliability.  Cost  The cost analysis has two components, the stage-cost and the stage upper-bound. A city C enacts a stage by requesting a merge link from its villages and applying one of the above rules according to the desired situation. We can divide this stage in five steps: # Broadcast request for merge link to the leq n nodes in the tree. # Each node forwards an outside? message to its leq n neighbors and waits for their leq n answers. # The nodes then send the answers back to the city ruler by convergecast for a total of leq n messages. # The root then decides on a merge link and sends a message to the elected node. Trivially this message will need to travel height(Tree) leq n nodes. These five phases of request, outside discovery, communication and delivery have a total cost of n + 2n + n + n leq 5n. As for the wasted messages in the outside? between internal nodes, each node x has at most deg(x) - 2 internal edges, or deg(x) - 1 if x is a leaf, for a total of 2m - n wasted internal messages. Now for the number of stages. By the previously presented property on the cities size, each city of level k has geq 2^k, hence the largest reachable rank is log_2{n}. Since cities can merge/be absorbed only once per stage, we have a total of 2m + n + 5n log{n}total messages.  Correctness  Mega-Merger creates a minimum spanning tree by merging sub-trees through the minimum cost path, i.e. the merge link. By definition of minimum spanning tree, a minimum spanning tree is a set of minimum spanning trees connected through minimum- cost paths. By construction Mega-Merger forwards a request through its merge- link, and that sooner or later that edge is going to be part of the tree by deadlock prevention.

R. Jones, \\"Mint Magistrates in the Early Roman Empire\\", Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies, No. 17 (1970), pp. 70‚Äì78. The role of the vigintivirate in a senatorial career is discussed by A.R. Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 4‚Äì8 This was followed by Sospes serving as military tribune of the Legio XXII Primigenia which was stationed in Pannonia at the time; while serving as a junior officer in the legion, Sospes \\"received the decorations appropriate to a legate of praetorian rank, expedit(ione) Suebic(a) et Sarm(atica).\\"Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", p. 38 Syme explains he earned these dona militaria from actions in Domitian's campaigns in Pannonia around 92, in response to the Sarmatians and Suebi having invaded that province and destroying Legio XXI Rapax.Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", pp. 38f This period of military service was followed by his election as the quaestor assigned to the province of Creta et Cyrene. Upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Sospes would be enrolled in the Senate.Richard Talbert, The Senate of Imperial Rome (Princeton: University Press, 1984), p. 16 He returned to Rome, where he held two more of the traditional Republican magistracies: curule aedile, and praetor. Roman provinces of Asia Minor, around AD 100 After completing his year as praetor, Sospes was then appointed to two civilian offices: praefectus frumenti dandi, the officer in charge of the Roman alimentum; and curator coloniarum et municipiorum, the equivalent of the governor of Roman Italy. Syme notes these last two offices are \\"something of a surprise\\": the first was not normally held by \\"men who achieve eminence in war or peace\\", while the second is otherwise not attested before the reign of Trajan.Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", pp. 42f Then a further surprise: the inscription from Pisidian Antioch records he was made legatus Augustus pro praetorus (or governor) of a series of districts ‚Äì Galatia, Pisidia, Phrygia, Lycaonia, Isauria, Paphlagonia, and other districts. Syme provides a possible solution to this puzzle: he notes that the governor of Cappadocia, Lucius Antistius Rusticus, died in office in AD 94; he proposes that on the death of Rusticus that the province was temporarily divided between the two legionary legates, with Sospes, legate of Legio XIII Gemina, assuming control of Galatia and the neighboring districts, while the other assumed responsibility for the parts of Cappadocia bordering Armenia and Parthia. When Rome was able to send a consular replacement ‚Äì Titus Pomponius Bassus, who arrived the next year ‚Äì the two legionary legates returned to their regular responsibilities.Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", pp. 39‚Äì42 \\"After military laurels in Pannonia and the governorship of Galatia, Sospes could look forward with rational confidence to a consulship in 97 or 98,\\" Syme observes. \\"Fortune turned against, with Domitian assassinated in September of 96 and Trajan adopted by Nerva eleven months later.\\"Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", pp. 43f As a relative of a hated ruler, Sospes lost his privileged position. It was not until 114 that Sospes was awarded the consulship by the emperor Trajan. Syme speculates that this achievement was \\"not unalloyed bliss\\": Lucius Caesennius Sospes held the fasces the same year that Trajan marched into Armenia, and the first place he occupied was Arsamosata, where his father had surrendered to the Parthians in AD 62.Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", pp. 46f  Family  It is not known whether Sospes was married, or who his spouse may have been. A Lucius Caesennius Antoninus was suffect consul in 128; it is not known if he was Sospes' son or the grandson of his brother.Syme, \\"Enigmatic Sospes\\", p. 46 and n. 92  References  1st-century Romans 2nd-century Romans Senators of the Roman Empire Roman governors of Cappadocia Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Sospes, Lucius Caesennius ","title":"Lucius Caesennius Sospes"},{"id":"53465651","text":"Gilliat is a surname.

It was situated 20 km outside Rome, in the Alban Hills, in the ancient territory of Ager Albanus (from the legendary Latin city of Alba Longa). Today the remains of the villa are located mostly within the estate of the Pontifical Villas of Castel Gandolfo, and the rest in the towns of Castel Gandolfo and Albano Laziale. The Villa Barberini gardens are open to visitors. Castel Gandolfo and the site of Domitian's Villa History The legendary capital of the Latin League, Alba Longa, was believed to have been founded by the son of Aeneas, Ascanius, around the ancient volcanic crater filled by Lake Albano. But there is no agreement among scholars about the exact location of the ancient city and no archaeological traces. Alba Longa was completely destroyed in the 6th c. BC, and Latium vetus annexed to Rome. With progressive Roman expansion, the Alban Hills became home to numerous patrician suburban villas. In particular the remains of two large villas on the Via Appia Antica, one attributed to Publius Clodius PulcherGiuseppe Lugli, Le antiche ville dei Colli Albani prima dell'occupazione domizianea, Roma, Loescher, 1915 pp. 15-32 and the other to Pompey have been found.Lugli 1915, pp. 33-47 In addition various Republican-era villas nestled on the banks of the lake and beyond. All these properties eventually became, in one way or another, imperial property: by the time of Augustus, the extraordinary concentration of villas gave birth to the term Albanum Caesari. The first imperial villa estate was inhabited by Tiberius, then Caligula and Nero.Antonio Nibby, vol. I, in Analisi storico-topografico-antiquaria della carta de' dintorni di Roma, II¬™ ed., Roma, Tipografia delle Belle Arti, 1848, pp. 546. =The works of Domitian= The first emperors probably contented themselves to live in the most sumptuous existing villas, namely that of Clodius in Herculanum (today in the garden of the Villa Santa Caterina of the Pontifical North American College) and that of Pompeo Albano (now in the municipal public park of Villa Doria). Remains of Villa of Pompey, Villa Doria Domitian, who settled there on a permanent basis, decided to build a new main complex to the villa in the most panoramic position towards both the sea and the lake, and featuring lavish new structures such as a racecourse and theatre. Probably the project was entrusted to Rabirius, architect of the Palace of Domitian on the Palatine. The villa came to occupy six square kilometres according to the calculations of Giuseppe Lugli. Martial mentions the villa as one of Domitian's favoured resorts.Martial V 1.1. [cf. IV 1.5] Suetonius says Domitian had a passion for archery which he practised thereSuetonius, Domitianus, 19 and Pliny suggests he held boating parties on the lake.Pliny ib. 82. 1-4 On the death of Domitian the villa was rarely used by his imperial successors. Some modifications are dated to the second century and in particular to the eras of Trajan and Hadrian. Therefore, it is not unlikely that the emperor Hadrian stayed there waiting for the completion of his Villa Adriana in Tivoli, while Marcus Aurelius lived there a few days using the villa as a refuge during the riots that took place in 175 AD. Description The villa was built on the rim of the ancient volcanic crater filled by Lake Albano (between 100,000 and 5,000 years ago). For this reason, given the uneven ground, the villa was built on three terraces. The terrace structure is not uncommon for Roman villas in the hills: for example the nearby villa in Frascati, the so-called villa of Lucullus, later belonging to Flavia gens, built in terraces on the slope of Tusculum facing Rome: the vast terrace now houses virtually all the historic centre of Frascati. The terraces of the villa of Domitian are narrow and about 500 m long. A fourth (highest) level lies on the plane of the Appian Way. The palace proper stood on the third terrace from the top, in the present church of St. Francis of Assisi and the adjoining building of Propaganda Fide. North of it there was the second terrace, which had a panoramic view of the lake (east) and the sea (west). Finally, on the lower terrace were the Hippodrome and the entrances to the villa. There are also isolated structures connected with the Domitian Villa: the nymphaeum and the docks on the lake shore, the hillside terrace, cisterns and the three aqueducts from Palazzolo, the access road network, the nymphaeum of the Rotunda in the centre of Albano converted into a Catholic church. It was also felt until the beginning of the twentieth century that the Albano Roman amphitheatre was connected to the villa. Today it is not possible to calculate precisely the extent of the imperial properties in this area which certainly included most of today's municipalities of Castel Gandolfo and Albano Laziale. Quite possibly it extended north to at least Bovillae (XIII milestone of Appia Antica), in the south up to Aricia (XVI mile). Also the villa attributed to Pompey was incorporated, the remains of which are now included within the residential area of Villa Doria at Albano. Other remains of a villa of Tiberian age, but inhabited until the fifth century, have been found to the southwest in Cavallacci, at the ring road of Albano. To the east, however, probably the imperial possessions included the entire Lake Albano with the many villas built in the Republican era on the crater (the so-called Augusto Palazzolo, one attributed to Seneca not far away, and others between Marino and Castel Gandolfo). It is not impossible that even the lake of Nemi was part of Albanum Caesare, as Julius Caesar had built a villa in the area, identified as remains at Monte Gentile. In the opinion of Lugli under Domitian the various villas in the imperial property were brought together in one single property. =The palace= The palace had three stories, as shown by the remains of a staircase seen from Lugli. All the walls are made of brickwork reinforced every 80 cm: it does not appear to have used opus reticulatum suggesting a 1st c. AD or later date. The complete reconstruction of the building plan was made by Pietro Rosa. The building was structured around three courtyards, called \\"atria\\" by Rosa. This feature allowed Lugli to recognise the analogy with the complex of Domitian's palace on the Palatine in Rome. It was based on three open spaces: triclinium, peristyle and tablinum. The baths were recognised thanks to the abundance of clay pipes etc. The spa area is located in the righthand central atrium, probably the ancient peristyle. =The second level= Lakeview terrace Avenue of the Nymphaea A hundred metres from the palace in one of the nineteenth-century villas are the remains of a terrace overlooking the lake. Only two walls of substructure are spaced from one another by 15 m. The fact that these structures are in opus reticulatum suggests that this is an early villa, dating from the late Republican era, embedded in the structure of the later villa. Probably between the two walls was a road leading down to the lake shore. The lakeside terrace is accessed through a tunnel dug into the lava rock, cyclopean work whose only purpose was to allow the emperor to climb the gentle slope of the hill to see the lake below. In 1910 the tunnel was cleared from the earth that had filled over the centuries, but since it ended outside the papal property it was closed at the villa Barberini wall. The tunnel is 100 m long and has a single skylight, around the middle. The height of the entrance on the side of Villa Barberini is 2.40 m. The outlet on the side of the lake below was tracked down by Lugli in the wall of the terrace which includes a large brickwork arch 3.75 m wide. Cryptoporticus of Villa of Domitian The Avenue of the Nymphaea This construction is connected to the theatre by a long north-south avenue with four side niches identified by archaeologists as nymphaea. The first nymphaeum from the south is rectangular, 6.20 m deep and has thirteen niches in the walls; the second and the fourth, semicircular, are 2.60 m and 6.85 m wide and have seven niches; the third, rectangular, is 5.50 m with thirteen niches, like the first. In some places wall plaster remains (often 3 cm thick) and even, at least at the time of Lugli, traces of colour. The Cryptoporticus of the Villa Domitiana in the Garden of Villa Barberini The Cryptoporticus The cryptoporticus was used to build up and support the front of the terrace above which ran the avenue of the nymphaea and forecourt of the theatre. Although now very truncated it still has a length of 120 m. At 7.45 m wide, it is probably the largest known cryptoporticus in any villa around Rome, certainly dwarfing any of those of the Villa Adriana at Tivoli. The vaulted ceiling was coffered in stucco of which few traces remain. The east side is carved in part from the rock itself, while the west is pierced by windows providing light: Lugli noted with admiration how each window corresponds to a niche on the other side. At the north end was the statue of Polyphemus found in the Bergantino nymphaeum on the shore of the lake. Various access routes from the Appian Way to the villa converged towards this cryptoporticus and therefore it was a sort of long covered entrance. The theatre Detail of the stucco reliefs in the theatre The theatre is one of the most significant buildings of the villa, with its extraordinary relief panels in the hall of the auditorium. It is the only building to be investigated recently.Hesburg 1978/80: Hesburg H. Von. ¬´ Zur Datierung des Theaters in der Domitiansvilla von Castel Gandolfo : Archeologia Laziale 4 (1981). pp. 176-80 The auditorium was built against the hill, while the orchestra and the stage were on the floor of the second terrace. It was built according to all the criteria of the acoustics of the time, pointing to the west to avoid the interference of the turbulent winds of the north and south. The orchestra's radius to the first seat was of 5.90 m, just 20 Roman feet: therefore Lugli was able to calculate that the total radius of the semicircle of the theatre was 25 m. The first excavation of the theatre was in 1657 by Leonardo Agostini for Cardinal Barberini. Lugli began studying theatre in 1914 and adjourned his studies in 1918 after the refurbishment of the Villa Barberini brought to light other ruins; in particular, another part of the auditorium hall with other stucco panels was discovered in 1917. The theatre is notable for stucco decorations in perspective, similar to painting of the fourth style. It is a frieze consisting of thirteen panels depicting themes related to theatre and one of the most important testimonies to the Flavians, like the paintings of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Some rooms date back to the age of Hadrian, which witness the continuity of use at least until completion of Villa Adriana in Tivoli. =The \\"Hippodrome\\"= The hippodrome is on the third terrace and is a large north- south space 75 m wide bounded by brick walls. It was not possible to establish the length because the wall to the south is not known. The north wall forms a semi-circle and at the centre of this semicircle was a fountain, 7.1 m long and 2.3 wide, decorated with stucco.Lugli 1920, pp. 64-66 However it has been shown to be a garden from the water cisterns and decoration, similar to that of Domitian's palace on the Palatine.ALBANUM AND THE VILLAS OF DOMITIAN; Robin DARWALL-SMITH; p. 150 Under the substructures is a cistern 41 m long. Not far from the structures were found a number of areas of equal width of 4.20 m long and 2.95 m, set against the foundation wall of the second shelf, under the cryptoporticus. =Remains on the shore of the lake= The Nymphaea The two nymphaea (Doric and Bergantino) on the shore of the lake are fascinating and mysterious structures. The Doric nymphaeum was probably rediscovered in 1723, since it is in a memoire of Francesco de Ficoroni (the discoverer of the famous Cista Ficoroni). =The Doric nymphaeum= The Doric Nymphaeum The beautiful Doric nymphaeum on the descent from Castel Gandolfo towards the lake is dated to the Republican age. It has similarities to that at Caffarella. The function of this structure remains obscure but the nymphaeum was a Doric temple perhaps built on the site of ancient Alba Longa. The nymphaeum is a rectangular space of 11 x 6 m with the barrel-vaulted ceiling reaching a height of 8 m, and with niches arranged in two rows. The order of the first floor columns is Doric (hence the name of the fountain), that of the second Ionic. At the centre in front of the entrance is an arch leading into a natural cave, probably an ancient spring. Many scholars believe that it could be the ‚Äúsacella‚Äù (sacrarium) described by Cicero and built by Clodius on the ruins of the ancient Alba Longa. The Nymphaeum is faced with opus reticulatum. There used to be spectacular water works with larger and smaller waterfalls and channels fed with water from one of the aqueducts and from a series of cisterns and pipes installed behind the central back wall. =The Bergantino nymphaeum= On the western shore of Lake Albano, 2 km after the Doric nymphaeum is a circular cave of 17 m diameter. A pool is in the middle of the cave, and the floor was completely covered with mosaics, of which a few fragments remain. Various parts of sculptural groups found in the nymphaeum are now kept at the Pontifical Palace in Castel Gandolfo The Bergantino nymphaeum The docks The first comprehensive study on the docks and neighbouring buildings was completed in 1919 by Lugli and Thomas Ashby. The two eminent scholars explored the lake not only on foot, sometimes wading into the water, but also by aerial survey on board an airship.Lugli 1921 , pp. 17-18 Their conclusion was that the shore was a collection of docks of several private villas or structures of different ages. In particular, the docks are concentrated on the western and eastern shore, while similar structures are not present on the southern bank or to the north. The eastern shore begins at the town of Cantone and ends in the locality of Acqua Acetosa. Here Lugli and Ashby found remains of three adjacent villas dating back to the first century, each with its direct flight of steps to the lake. The western shore starts at the junction of the 140 road to the beach at Castel Gandolfo and continues to the Bergantino nymphaeum at the rowing stadium for the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. On this stretch are the most monumental remains including a cryptoporticus probably related to a villa, and a structure known as a beacon or lighthouse. The first part of the shore at the Doric nymphaeum is dated to the late Republican era, and one or two villas can be recognised which were subsequently incorporated into the Domitian complex. =The rotonda= The Rotonda in Santa Maria della Rotonda This unique building has a cylindrical plan within a cube, similar but smaller to the Pantheon in Rome, also replicating the oculus (central hole).Giuseppe Lugli, La \\"Rotonda\\" di Albano, in Il tempio di Santa Maria della Rotonda , p. 67, Albano Laziale 1972. Its diameter is 16 m and the whole structure is made of opus mixtum. It is unclear why Domitian had this built so far from the residential complex of his villa. In the past it was believed to be a temple dedicated to Minerva and the Sun and the Moon, but Lugli objected that its plan was not of a typical Roman temple, and he therefore believed it was an isolated nymphaeum, a view shared by many today.Pino Chiarucci, La civilt√† laziale e gli insediamenti albani in particolare, in Atti del corso di archeologia tenutosi presso il Museo civico di Albano Laziale nel 1982-1983, pp. 58-59 In the Severan era this structure was incorporated into the perimeter wall of the Castra Albana and adapted for bathing by legionaries: to this phase belong the floor mosaics and the rectangular entrance front. Probably between the ninth and tenth century it was converted into a place of worship, and received the Eastern image of the Madonna dating from the 6th - 7th century. =Water supply= The aqueducts The complex of Domitian's Villa is supplied from the southeast by four aqueducts coming from sources located between the towns of Palazzolo and Malafitto. In many places, ancient aqueducts still feed modern ones or have been in use until a few decades ago. The most ancient aqueduct is the \\"Hundred Mouths\\" so named because it collects water from springs scattered over an area of about 150 m between the towns of Palazzolo and Malafitto; its course is a wide tunnel 1.65 m high that runs along the ridge of the lake to the Colle dei Cappuccini, which it crosses via a tunnel about 500 m long. The tunnelling work was so demanding that the builders wrongly made a reverse slope for about 100 m which they had to fix by raising the aqueduct floor with bricks.Lugli 1918 , pp. 30-33 The aqueduct disappears at the height of the old town of Albano, about 3 m below the ground in Piazza San Paolo. It is very likely that this served originally the villa of Pompey. In the Severan age it must have also served the Castra Albana as the great \\"Cisternoni\\" of the thermae are adjacent to the Rotunda and the Baths of Caracalla. Two aqueducts have sources near Malafitto, called \\"high\\" and \\"low Malafitto\\" depending on the height at which they run. The high Malafitto aqueduct is the only one of the four definitely attributable to the Domitian era. The aqueduct had to serve the whole of the villa building, and to maintain a high flow, the builders had to follow a rather tortuous path through the woods of Selvotta. Finally the aqueduct passed under the Colle dei Cappuccini and ran in a section parallel to the other two aqueducts. In 1904 the last part of the aqueduct was found at the cemetery of Albano, about 2.50 m below the surface today. From there, the tunnel emptied into the great cistern of the villa under the seat of Propaganda Fide. The tunnels not carved into the rock are made of opus reticulatum. The channel is approximately 60 cm wide and about 1.60 m tall. Along the route were found 53 circular wells, the deepest of which is 53 m. The low Malafitto has more opus reticulatum and different channel dimensions that suggest a period immediately subsequent to the Flavian, presumably Trajan or Hadrian. Its route runs almost parallel to the others to the cemetery of Albano but then heads towards the current town of Castel Gandolfo and it seems certain that it leads to the large Torlonia cistern in the dell'Ercolano area. Lugli ruled it out as a service aqueduct of the oldest villa of Clodius but considers it possible that the route may have been rearranged and extended to the Torlonia cistern in the second century to serve the new part of the imperial possessions. He also believes that there was a direct water supply arm to the Roman amphitheatre of Albano Laziale, built with the construction of the Castra Albana. Finally, the aqueduct of Aqua Augusta was identified in 1872 by Giovanni Battista de Rossi due to five memorial stones found in different properties between the Fields of Hannibal at Rocca di Papa, and the slopes of Monte Cavo. The only possible hypothesis is that it served the Roman villa identified on the shores of Lake Albano in Palazzolo, attributed to Augustus by the 19th c. archaeologists. =The garrison= Later history =Abandonment= The African Emperor Septimius Severus built the grandiose structures of the garrison of Castra Albana in 197 AD on the edge of the imperial properties for his loyal veterans of Legio II Parthica. However, decline of the villa also began at this time. The Parthian legionaries and their families established around the camp began to plunder the villa structures in order to use the material for new construction, thus giving rise to the village that would later become Albano Laziale. A second town developed on the northern edge of the imperial properties: in the Middle Ages it was called Cuccurutus and gave rise to the village Castel Gandolfo. The Liber Pontificalis records the donation of virtually all imperial property, and much of the surrounding area, to the cathedral of St. John the Baptist (identified with the Cathedral of Albano, now named after the martyr Saint Pancras), made under Pope Sylvester I (314 - 335 AD) by Emperor Constantine I. We do not know if this donation was real or not, but certainly the imperial villa of Albanum was abandoned. Around the tenth century an ancient nymphaeum of the villa, integrated in the Severan era with the thermal baths of Castra Albana, was consecrated to religious use as sanctuary of Santa Maria della Rotonda, today a revered place of worship of Albano, and known as \\"la Rotonda\\". The villa became the quarry of marble and building materials, similar to that of other ancient buildings: we know for sure that its marbles were used to build and coat the Cathedral of Orvieto in the fourteenth century. The then feudal lords, the Savelli, gave permission to dismantle the facilities of the villa in 1321: the destruction lasted 36 days. The documents of the time outline a real business behind the dismantling of these monuments: Rodolfo Lanciani drew inspiration from these careful studies of smoke to obtain an exemplum on the reuse of the immense marble and stone material of ancient monuments of Rome and its surroundings. =Rediscovery= Giuseppe Lugli (1890 - 1967) was an eminent Italian archaeologist of the twentieth century. He graduated in 1913 with a thesis on the Alban villa of Domitian, and subsequently enriched, corrected and completed his studies about until 1922, publishing four volumes which, with his topographic surveys, are still the main source of information on the villa. In 1919 he made the first archaeological survey aboard the airship \\"Roma \\", accompanied by the director of the British School of Rome, Thomas Ashby. Pope Urban VIII ( 1623 - 1644 ) was the first pontiff to holiday in Castel Gandolfo, the Papal Palace; his nephew Taddeo Barberini bought the villa in 1631 which had belonged to Scipione Visconti, and which contained the most significant contents of Domitian's Villa. The most striking views of the ruins overgrown by vegetation, such as the cryptoporticus and nymphaeum, were described by scholars and diarists from the 15th c. onwards and reproduced in engravings and paintings. In 1929 the Lateran Treaty recognised the 55 hectares of the Pontifical Villas of Castel Gandolfo between the extraterritorial zone of the Holy See in Italy: most of the ruins of the villa became part of the Vatican City State, thanks to the sale of Villa Barberini to the Holy See, historically linked to the papal complex, but until then alien to it. The Pontifical Villas were subjected to a radical reorganization at the behest of Pope Pius XI and even the archaeological inventories, such as the cryptoporticus and the road of the nymphaeum, were cleaned and incorporated.

The subject is the life and music of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (ca.1525-1594), a famous Italian Renaissance composer of sacred music. He is the best-known 16th-century composer of the Roman School. Filmed in March 2009 on locations mainly in and around L'Aquila and Rome, most of the ancient buildings and historical interiors in the city of L'Aquila were destroyed by the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, only a few days after the end of shooting. Palestrina‚Äôs music in the film is directed by Flavio Colusso and the Roman Ensemble Seicentonovecento. The film was also titled The Liberation of Music or Die Befreiung der Musik when released in Germany. Plot ‚ÄúTo achieve artistic and economic independence, Palestrina works with great diplomacy in the shadow of the powerful Roman Catholic Church. Despite strict ecclesiastical rules, he succeeds in modernizing music.‚Äù press communication Arte: Palestrina - F√ºrst der Musik The film starts with the death of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina in 1594. Afterwards his son, Iginio, some of his students and colleagues, members of the Cappella Giulia (Julian Chapel) at St. Peter's Basilica, and also members of the Roman clergy give their personal statements or testimony on Palestrina‚Äôs life and career: from his childhood, when he is trained as a choir-boy in the circle of the \\"Roman School\\" of polyphony founded by Costanzo Festa, to the peak of his career, when the plague and an influenza epidemic take away his two oldest sons and his wife. These testimonies reveal Palestrina as a typical Renaissance artist who takes his destiny into his own hands and maintains his artistic independence in the middle of the greedy Roman clergy, who are more interested in secular politics than in the spirituality of music. He developed a new style in polyphonic art, the genus novus with a balance between word and sound, in which all voices are separate and independent from each other. Palestrina finally liberates music from the word. In this style he composes the famous Missa Papae Marcelli, which, after the Council of Trent, becomes the model for sacred music. After having lost his two sons and his wife, the testimonies reveal with the wink of an eye, that Palestrina, instead of taking holy orders, decided to marry a very rich widow, enabling him to afford the publication of all his scores. In this way his work would never be forgotten. Palestrina‚Äôs music is presented in the film by the Roman ‚ÄòEnsemble Seicentonovecento‚Äô, conducted by maestro Flavio Colusso.

The region was catalogued in 1959 in the extended seconded edition of the Sharpless catalogue. This area is part of the Canis Major OB1 Association, and is a very active area of new star formation. Studies in 1988 found that the bright star illuminating the nebula was 8th magnitude HD 53623 / HIP 34178 with spectral class B1II/III.

It was further revealed that this unseen stellar source produces a carbon monoxide (CO) bipolar outflow with a total mass of solar masses, while the surrounding extended envelope weighs ‚Äì.

GuzmanRalph C. Guzm√°n (1924-October 10, 1985, born Rafael Cortez Guzm√°n) served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State of Latin America in the Carter Administration and was one of the nation's leading Latino educators. He co-founded the Oakes College at the University of California at Santa Cruz and later was appointed Provost at UCSC's Merrill College. Guzm√°n played an influential role in the early years of the Chicano Movement, and was a key figure in the Mexican-American community nationwide. During his time in the State Department, he was responsible for formulating and implementing much of the nation's policy in Central and South America.  Early life and education  Born in Moroleon, Guanajuato in 1924, Rafael Cortez Guzm√°n immigrated to the U.S. as a child during the Depression, and worked for several years with his family in the fields of the Southwest before settling in East Los Angeles. He served in the Merchant Marines and Navy during World War II, participating in the final assault on Okinawa, and returned to complete an A.A. at East Los Angeles Junior College under the G.I. Bill in 1949. After the war, he enrolled at California State University, Los Angeles, where he earned bachelor's (1958) and master's (1960) degrees in political science. In 1955 he was named director of the Alianza Hispano-Americana's (a Mexican American fraternal insurance society) newly founded civil rights department, where he cultivated his skill in developing community support organizations. Along with Fred Ross Sr. and Congressman Edward R. Roybal, Guzm√°n assisted in the founding of the Community Service Organization in the Los Angeles area. Following three years spent serving as Associate Director of the Peace Corps contingents in Venezuela and Peru, Guzm√°n returned to Los Angeles and became one of the few Chicano graduate students (and first to receive a Ph.D. in political science) at UCLA. There, while completing his studies, he was appointed a director of the Mexican-American Study Project, and helped develop The Mexican Americans: Our Second Minority (NY, 1970).  Research and Legacy  Dr. Guzm√°n's research, put forth in The Mexican Americans: Our Second Minority, was essential to the Chicano Anti-Vietnam Movement. His researched showed that disproportionate numbers of Latino Americans were dying in the war. Guzman drew his conclusions from US military records and the surnames of the casualties, identifying Spanish surnames as Latinos. Recently, Pomona College historian Tomas Summer Sandoval revisited Guzman's work using more thoroughly tested surnames lists and confirmed Guzm√°n's conclusions. In the 2015 PBS documentary On Two Fronts: Latinos & Vietnam, which examines the Latino experience during the Vietnam War, Sandoval says in an interview, \\"The Chicano Anti Vietnam War Movement does not exist without the research of Ralph Guzman. He is the verifiable proof of their common sense understanding that this war was disproportionately affecting our community.\\"On Two Fronts: Latinos & Vietnam. Dir. Myl√©ne Moreno.

Very little details have been revealed about the rocket testing facility. Testing the XLR-115 hydrogen fueled rocket engine at the Florida Research and Development Center in Apix  Background and overview  = Background = Starting in 1945, there was heavy research into hydrogen as a fuel source. The Air Force wanted to create a faster plane for spying than the U-2. = Overview = In 1956, Pratt and Whitney along with the United States Air Force decided to buy a 10 square mile piece of land in Western Palm Beach County.  Security  At the time, the western part of Palm Beach County was sparsely populated. Authorities said it was a fertilizer producing town to cover up the operation so that residents would not be suspicious. The name Apix meant Air Products Inc, Experimental. There was also commercial protection to make sure that potential speculators and buyers stayed clear. Land nearby was also platted and had a census marker. Pratt & Whitney bought 9,000 acres near what would today be the J.W. Corbett Wildlife Refuge. For buyers to not know it was United Aircraft (now United Technologies) a third party had bought a ranch and gave it to the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission which then was given to the U.S. Air Force.  Testing  The project's main goal was to test liquid hydrogen as a fuel source for rockets which had been in interest of the United States government since the late 1940s. Apix was part of what was called Project Suntan that was carried out in extreme secrecy from 1956‚Äì1958. The plant could liquefy Hydrogen at approximately rate of a half a ton a day, costing $6.2 million a day ($53,580,135.23 in 2017) and would be transported in an underground pipeline to a testing facility. A second plant was built in 1959 and had a capacity of 30 tons and cost about $27 million. In February 1959 the managers had decided that transporting liquid hydrogen in the underground pipeline took too much energy and decided to close it. Instead, they decided to ship hydrogen in insulated tanks on the Beeline Highway.

As an illustrator and designer, Bietila continues to be involved with the collective that publishes WW3 Illustrated. Along with artist Nicolas Lampert, she curated Drawing Resistance, a traveling exhibition of political art that included many WW3 Illustrated artists. As an artist and activist, Bietila was deeply involved with organizing against the Crandon Mine in Wisconsin in the late 1990s. Her participation in this work includes creation of signs for marches, giant puppets, as well as a series of tombstones that were placed in public locations and which included messages such as \\"R.I.P. Crandon Mine.\\" These tombstones later became part of an art installation at the Riverwest Art Center in Milwaukee. Simensky then created a poster to celebrate the 28-year struggle to prevent the creation of this mine, as well as a 24-foot mural called \\"28 years of People Power,\\" created as part of the Seeing Green art show. Simensky is also active as a curator, including her collaboration on the exhibition \\"Carlos Cort√©z and Allied Artists\\" at Walker's Point Center for the Arts. This exhibition highlights the work of revolutionary artist Carlos Cort√©z, as well as artists he influenced.

Romano is the first and only person ever to run the Tour de France course of 2,000 miles at 30 miles a day, which she ran while the competing cyclists were racing on the course. She was also the first female to run coast-to-coast across the United States unsupported, pushing her gear in a running stroller from Huntington Beach, California, to Charleston, South Carolina. Childhood and education A native of Maine, Zo√´ Romano graduated in 2009 from the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia, where she majored in Spanish and International Studies and began her running career. In 2014 she received the Distinguished Recent Graduate Award from the University of Richmond, her alma mater. Zo√´ is also a writer and currently in an MFA program in creative writing at Queens University of Charlotte, North Carolina, for which she attends summer residencies in South America. She has published in Marathon & Beyond, The Portland Phoenix, and University of Richmond Magazine. Ultra-distance challenges Romano began her cross-country run from California. She followed that first big challenge soon after with a smaller ultra marathon. Romano ran the entire Tour de France course in 2013, pushing her gear in a running stroller. She started her 2,000 mile journey on May 18 in Nice and finished in Paris a day before the peloton, covering the course in nine weeks at the rate of 30 miles a day. The course involved climbing more than 100,000 feet of elevation, the equivalent of scaling Mount Everest three times. She was followed on this run by filmmaker Alexander Kreher, who is producing a film about Romano. A trailer for the film is ready, but the film has not yet been released. \\"When she took the first steps of her 2,000-mile journey . . ., Zoe Romano wasn't sure she'd ever actually finish. She was buzzing with excitement as she stood at her start line in Cagnes-sur-Mer heading toward Marseille. But she was equally nervous and scared, rightly so for someone who was about to cover the entire Tour de France course on foot.\\"Calvi N-D de La Serra panorama While standing in Calvi, Haute-Corse, a town on the northwest coast of the island of Corsica, she had finished 79 days of running, logging an average of 30 miles each day, and said, \\"This just feels surreal because there were so many times I had doubts and felt uncertain. There were times when I could hardly imagine being able to finish on time and in one piece. It feels impossible that it has actually happened.\\"Calvi-Semper fidelis Community involvement and charity work While living in Portland, she was a volunteer coach for TED (conference) TEDxDirigo and a Spanish tutor for students of Greater Portland. She is a former ambassador to the Boys & Girls Clubs and has presented inspirational and educational talks to many local running groups, schools, and community initiatives. Zo√´ received a Key to the City from Mayor Nick Mavodones and had a day of Portland named in her honor. Her fundraising has included work with sponsors and donors to organize giving and cause- marketing campaigns to raise $191,000 for the World Pediatric Project in 2013. She led grassroots efforts to raise $17,000 for Boys & Girls Clubs of America in 2011. Romano formerly lived in Portland, Maine and in Richmond, Virginia. In 2013 she released her TedxRVA video. She gave an account of her adventure philanthropy at a Grand Prix banquet award ceremony of the Richmond Road Runners Club in 2017. She received an honorarium check from the RRRC for her charities and the next day led an early morning trail run near the James River with members of the club. She and her accomplishments have been featured on the Today Show, NPR, CNN and in Runner‚Äôs World.

Telakowska earned a degree from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw in 1931. She was a member of the Sp√≥≈Çdzielnia Artyst√≥w ≈ÅAD (pl), an Arts and Crafts artist collective that encouraged a new Polish artistic identity that included folk art. After World War II, Telakowska joined the Communist government in Poland, creating the Bureau of Supervision of Aesthetic Production (Biuro Nadzoru Estetyki Producji, known as BNEP) in 1946. As the head of BNEP, she commissioned artists (including some from ≈ÅAD) to design many mass-produced Polish goods, under the BNEP motto of \\"Beauty is for everyday and for everybody.\\" In her role, Telakowska protected and sponsored modernist artists. Some artists were suspicious of collaborating with the Communist government during a time of continued political conflict. Ultimately, BNEP shut down, as the value of artist designs was not convincing enough to factory owners. Telakowska went on to found Warsaw's Institute of Industrial Design (Instytut Wzornictwa Przemyslowego, or IWP) in 1950 and served as its first director. The IWP was state-funded, organized within the Ministry of Culture and Art. In this role, she \\"invited artists, ethnographers, art historians, pedagogues, sociologists, and enthusiasts of folk art to contribute to her institute's efforts to develop new forms of sociologist culture in collaboration with working women, peasants, and youth.\\" Telakowska fostered a movement to weave ethnic motifs into a new national artistic identity. Echoing BNEP's slogan, IWP's was \\"Everyday Beauty for All.\\" Telakowska stepped down as director in 1968. IWP continues to publish and foster art and design. Some Polish artists have dismissed Telakowska's legacy as a failed attempt to work with Stalinists. Her work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

Their ancestors and relations in Scotland included the Lairds of Kerelaw Castle in Stevenston, North Ayrshire, of the Cambuskeith branch of Clan Hamilton.  Background  The paternal lineage of American founding father Alexander Hamilton was rooted in Scotland, where his relations were landed gentry known as the Hamiltons of Grange. The Hamiltons of Grange descended from Walter de Hamilton, founder of the Cambuskeith branch of Clan Hamilton, who held lands in Edinburgh by a charter from Robert III of Scotland given between 1390 and 1406. The last Laird of the Hamiltons of Grange, who held the title from 1774 until his death in 1837, was Alexander Hamilton's first cousin, also named Alexander. James Alexander Hamilton was born in Ayrshire, Scotland in 1718. He was the fourth son of Laird Alexander Hamilton of Grange. His mother, Elizabeth Pollock, was the eldest daughter of Sir Robert Pollock, 1st Baronet of Pollock. With little prospect of an inheritance in Scotland, James moved to the West Indies to become a merchant and businessman on the island of Saint Kitts. He and Rachel Faucette (who was of English and French descent), became the parents, out of wedlock, of Alexander Hamilton and his older brother James Hamilton Jr. Alexander Hamilton moved in October 1772 to the Thirteen Colonies (later the United States) to earn an education. He later became the aide-de-camp to General George Washington and first Secretary of the Treasury. He married Elizabeth Schuyler, who was the daughter of Philip Schuyler and Catherine Van Rensselaer, both members of prominent Dutch-American families, the Schuyler and Van Rensselaer families. Elizabeth and Alexander Hamilton were married on December 14, 1780, at the Schuyler Mansion in Albany, New York. They went on to have eight children, thus establishing the Hamilton family in the United States.

Description The sanctuary has been dated to around 5000 BC and is considered part of the Vinƒça culture. It is part of a wider complex of buildings and domestic settlement. The sanctuary building had raised altar-like pedestals and life-size figurine heads together with specially built granary areas. Statues consisted of large clay humanoid figures. A life-sized sculpture of a double-headed goddess stood near the entrance. One of the smaller humanoid figures has horns.

Kourosh Zaim (; born May 17, 1939) is an Iranian author, inventor, engineer, translator, and nonviolent political activist. He was born in Kashan, Iran, on May 17, 1939. A vocal advocate of secular democracy and human rights since youth, Kourosh rose to prominence as a political analyst and Secretary to the Leadership Committee of Iran‚Äôs National Front party, or Jebhe Melli, Iran's largest pro-democracy political organization. Membership in Jebhe Melli has been illegal since 1981. As of 2017, Kourosh is incarcerated in Iran as a political prisoner. He was last arrested on July 16, 2016 for charges of \\"undermining the Islamic Republic\\" and \\"promoting anti-regime activity\\", and is currently serving a four-year prison term in Evin Prison, the sixth time he has been imprisoned for his views since Iran's Islamic Revolution. Much of his time as a political prisoner has been spent in solitary confinement. He has been represented in the past by human rights attorneys Nasrin Sotoudeh and Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi. He is currently being represented by Giti Pourfazel, a well-known human rights lawyer currently planning her immanent retirement due to \\"years of state harassment and threats.\\" Family Kourosh was born in Kashan, Iran, on May 17, 1939, to mother Khanoum Khanima Assadi and father Javad Zaim (deceased), a businessman and political activist. Kourosh is the oldest of four siblings: Soudabeh, Siamak and Bahram. Kourosh's mother is from the Naraghi family, a line of influential Shi'ite clerics. Kourosh‚Äôs great-grandfather Mahmud Zaim was Kashan's largest tobacco cultivator. In 1891, Mahmud organized a rebellion with Iran's other two major tobacco growers, in which they burned their entire crop of tobacco in defiance of the shah's tobacco trade concession to Great Britain. This forced Iran's top cleric, Mirzaye Shirazi, to sign a fatwa against the agreement, which helped foment a people's movement against the trade agreement that came to be called the Tobacco Protest. The Shah was forced to cancel the trade agreement the following year. The Tobacco Protest was the first nationwide rebellion in Iran's modern history. Many scholars believe it to be the moment Iranians realized they could oust foreign exploiters through solidarity which later led to the Persian Constitutional Revolution a few years later.Keddie, Nikki. Religion and Rebellion in Iran: The Tobacco Protest of 1891-92. Frank Cass, 1966, p. 65 Kourosh Zaim's uncle, activist during Constitutional Revolution, PM, exiled, poisoned. Kourosh‚Äôs great uncle, Seyed Hassan i Zaim, a political activist during the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1905‚Äì07), member of Iran's 4th, 5th, and 6th post-revolutionary Parliaments (1921‚Äì25) and Speaker for the Minority Faction, undertook to impeach Reza Shah for totalitarian rule. He was threatened with execution and fled to Europe, where he spent the next 17 years in exile. In 1946, in partnership with Mohammad Mosaddegh, Hassan returned to Iran to create a new minority faction in the parliament. He was elected from his home city of Kashan, but the night after the election results had been announced, an envoy from the Shah came to him posing as a congratulator and offered coffee to him. He was declared dead and buried the next day after the examining coroner reported that his eyes and fingers were still moving and that he should be taken to a hospital. Kourosh Zaim's younger brother. Communist rebel leader and strategist. Imprisoned in Iran with promise and sentence not be executed. Executed. Siamak Zaim, the older of Kourosh's two younger brothers, was a famous leftist and communist thinker who escaped Iran during the Islamic Revolution and fled to Berkeley, California, U.S., where he founded the Communist Party of Iran of the U.S. In early 1982, he snuck back into Iran and became a leader of the 1982 Amol uprising. The revolt was considered an existential threat by the new revolutionary government, and the town was surrounded and all the rebels captured or killed. For being unarmed himself and for actions displaying a desire to protect innocent life and to end the firefight, the Revolutionary Government granted him a prison sentence rather than immediate execution. He was held incommunicado for two years in Evin Prison and then executed by firing squad anyway in 1984. Kourosh's youngest brother, Bahram Zaim, was falsely arrested for being at a movie theater that was taken over by mujahideen fighters. Iran's Revolutionary Guard assumed Bahram was a mujahideen fighter, and imprisoned him for four and a half years. Kourosh was married twice: to an American in 1975, bearing two sons; and to an Iranian in 1985, also bearing two sons. The eldest of these four brothers, Turaj, escaped to the United States during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and is an American artist and activist. In 2009, Turaj focused his activism around his father, whose plight is emblematic of many of Iran's imprisoned and persecuted human rights activists. Scholarship Kourosh has authored many books, translated numerous texts from English into Persian, and published many articles and interviews on both scientific and political topics; including the works of Stephen Hawking and Karl Popper. He taught mathematics at Chicago Technical College (1968‚Äì1970) and advised Business Administration PhD students at Tehran University (2005‚Äì2008). Kourosh has also argued many times for the preservation of ancient Iranian heritage sites, as well as other UNESCO world heritage sites. Prior to his most recent imprisonment, he was advancing his Theory of Fundamental Digital Particles to European researchers of the Higgs boson particle.Kourosh Zaim. \\"The Digital Elementary Particle,\\" Open Science Journal of Modern Physics.

Retrieved . It is a non-invasive, scientific technique with a degree of sensitivity and a neuro-psychological method of interrogation which is also referred to as 'brain fingerprinting'.  History  The methodology was developed by Champadi Raman Mukundan (C. R. Mukundan), a Neuroscientist, former Professor & Head of Clinical Psychology at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Bangalore, India), while he worked as a Research Consultant to TIFAC-DFS Project on 'Normative Data for Brain Electrical Activation Profiling'. His works are based on research that was also formerly pursued by other scientists at American universities, including J. Peter Rosenfeld, Lawrence Farwell and Emanuel Donchin.  Principle  The human brain receives millions of arrays of signals in different modalities, all through the waking periods. These signals are classified and stored in terms of their relationship perceived as function of experience and available knowledge base of an individual, as well as new relationship produced through sequential processing. The process of encoding happens primarily when the individual directly participates in an activity or experiences it. It is considered secondary, when the information is obtained from a secondary source viz. books, conversations, hearsay etc. in which there is no primary experiential component and the brain deals mainly with conceptual aspects. Primary encoding is deep seated and has specific source memory in terms of time and space of occurrence of experience, as individual himself/herself has shared or participated in the experience/act/event at certain time in his/her life at a certain place. It is found that when the brain of an individual is activated by a piece of information of an event in which he/she has taken part, the brain of the individual will respond differently from that of a person who has received the same information from secondary sources (non- experiential). BEOSP is based on this principle, thereby intending to demonstrate that the suspect who have primary encoded information of those who have participated in the suspected events will show responses indicating firsthand (personally acquired) knowledge of the event.  Procedure  # Pretest interview with the suspect in BEOSP # The suspect is acquainted with BEOSP test procedure # Informed consent is obtained Ideally, no questions are to be asked while conducting the test; rather, the subject is simply provided with the probable events/scenarios in the aftermath of which, the results are analyzed to verify if the brain produces any experiential knowledge, which is essentially the recognition of events disclosed. This way, all fundamental rights are protected, as neither there are no questions that are being asked or any answers reciprocated.  Applications  University of Pennsylvania conducted a research along with the Brigham & Women's Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts), Children's Hospital Boston & the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany which determined that Gamma Oscillations in the brain could help distinguish false memories from the real ones. Their analysis concluded that in the retrieval of truthful memories, as compared to false, human brain creates an extremely distinct pattern of gamma oscillations, indicating a recognition of context based information associated with a prior experience.

Originally built during the California Gold Rush, the bridge was located on the O'Byrne's Ferry road between Chinese Camp and Copperopolis. Until the mid-20th century, it was one of the last remaining covered bridges in the state; the bridge was destroyed in 1957 (after an unsuccessful attempt to move it) to make way for the construction of Tulloch Dam. History The bridge was named after the P. O. Byrne ferry which operated on the Stanislaus River as early as 1849 to service gold seekers in the area.http://www.calaverashistory.org/post/obyrnes-and-central-ferry At that time, the crossing locale was known as Waterville and, later, Poker Flat. Bret Harte's The Outcasts of Poker Flat is said to be written of this site. Patrick (or Peter; it is not known which, as he signed all stock certificates as P. O. Byrne) O. Byrne established a river crossing ferry here and determined that there was much future economic prosperity to be gained and chartered the Stanislaus Central Bridge Company that was to erect a steel suspension bridge crossing the Stanislaus River and later to be reached by a railroad from Stockton. Originally a chain cable suspension bridge with a plank floor, it was completed in the spring of 1853 and was to be opened to the public as a toll bridge. Before opening, the bridge was determined to be structurally lacking and requiring additional anchor chains. Nonetheless, a team of oxen and wagon crossed before the official opening of the new bridge and collapsed it. Byrne went on to other endeavors including selling a venture known as the Sacramento Railroad Company to again give railroad access to the gold country with commissioners such as former California Governor Peter Burnett and J. H. Haggin besides P. O. Byrne. It appears that nothing ever came from that speculative opportunity. Nonetheless, the bridge was rebuilt in 1856 by the Table Mountain Bridge Company. This bridge was much stronger, but was destroyed in the Great Flood of 1862, and a new covered cantilever bridge of Howe truss type and reinforced by an auxiliary arch was built that same year.http://www.calaverasenterprise.com/news/article_acc14706-13ae-11e5-b42a-e36a376840af.html Built and run by the Union Bridge Company, a corporation with headquarters at Sonora. Joseph Aldridge of Green Springs was the toll bridge keeper early on into the 1870s, and Joe Pardies profitably operated the toll bridge for many years.http://www.sierranevadageotourism.org/content/obyrnes-ferry-bridge- no-281-california-historical-landmark/siec3db261e97288d82a Fred Burnham, was largely responsible for the Byrne's Ferry bridge being purchased by the counties. In the late 1880s and early 1890s, Burnham was a cattleman in the region and during his annual summer trips into the mountains for better feed he drove his cattle across the bridge at a cost of $25 or $30 for the herd. Because he was dissatisfied with the condition of the bridge, and because he disliked paying the toll fee, Burnham circulated a petition for the bridge to be purchased by the two counties and to be made a free bridge. In 1902, the petition passed and the counties of Calaveras and Tuolumne purchased the bridge for $4,000 and the toll was discontinued. It is claimed that the Californio bandit Tiburcio Vasquez held up the stage running between Chinese Camp and Copperopolis nearby. Wells Fargo posted a reward for his arrest and conviction and a posse was formed at Poker Flat which then crossed the Byrne's Ferry bridge in pursuit of the bandit. Vasquez escaped only to be captured later in San Jose and hanged not long after. Demolition and replacement The Tri-Dam project and the Tulloch Reservoir eventually ended the story of the covered bridge.http://www.calaverashistory.org/article/historical- overview-lake-tulloch-area When filled to capacity, the reservoir backs river water up the canyon for seven miles and forms a large lake that covers the O'Byrne's Bridge site to a depth of eighty feet. In 1957, as the reservoir began to fill, the directors of the two irrigation districts studied the possibility of either burning the bridge where it stood or simply cutting it free from its moorings. But the Calaveras and Tuolumne County Historical Societies and the Copperopolis Community Club, assisted by the Native Sons of the Golden West and many other statewide groups, took an interest in saving the bridge. They started what was known as a \\"DOLLAR\\" campaign to cover the cost of preserving the bridge as a future landmark; estimated at the time to be about $9,000. A plan was developed to move the bridge down-stream to a lagoon created by the reservoir where it could span an inlet and once again become a tourist attraction. The California State Parks Commission endorsed the proposal and a Tuolumne County rancher agreed to donate the property upon which the bridge could be located. However, such plans failed to materialize. On the morning of October 21, 1957, the Calaveras and Tuolumne County supervisors sold the bridge at auction. Several attempts were made to blast the bridge from its supports using dynamite, but the charges were insufficient. As the water rose, the bridge eventually gave up its supports but by then it was partially submerged. Unable to save the bridge, the structure was dismantled and some of the lumber was used to build the nearby resorts. About 3,000 feet upstream from where the old covered bridge stood, a new concrete and steel bridge was built in 1958 at a cost of $458,355.

It was the final battle in the (AKA Sunderkrieg). It was a decisive victory for the Alliance, who were subsequently able to impose their demands through the Treaty of Templin (24/25 November 1317). Background The immediate cause of conflict was a dispute over succession to the Lordship of Stargard following the death in 1314 of Beatrix of Brandenburg, wife of Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg (nicknamed \\"The Lion\\"). Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal (nicknamed \\"The Great\\"), demanded the return of what he considered a fief of Brandenburg, which Beatrix had possessed only as part of her dowry (). Henry countered by calling for military assistance from his allieswho included King Erik of Denmark, John of Werle, and other North German princesand by invading Brandenburg. Waldemar assembled his forces at the walled city of Gransee to oppose them. The battle Waldemar's forces consisted largely of knights in armour; Henry's of foot soldiers. It was conventional military wisdom in those days that heavy cavalry hopelessly outclassed light infantry. (Subsequent patriotic accounts from Mecklenburg even suggested that the Alliance was outnumbered four to one.) On John's advice, the Alliance decided on a surprise attack. Passing through a forest (remnants of which still exist as the Unterbusch), they crossed the M√ºhlenflie√ü near Schulzendorf. (The M√ºhlenflie√ü was a millstream which powered the watermill at Rauschendorf.)This Rauschendorf may be the same place as modern , even though that place is first documented only in 1524. According to the chroniclers, it was the foot soldiers who won the day. The knights, fighting on foot, were immobile and vulnerable.The chroniclers refer to the knights being \\"lifted out of the saddle\\". The result of the battle makes it seem more likely that surprise was complete, and that the Brandenburgers were caught unprepared in their camp. The battle swayed to and fro for several hours, and resembled a massacre.If the chroniclers can be believed. Henry caught an axe blow to the helmet in the initial phase of the battle, and had to be supported from the field; but later returned to fight with undiminished vigour. Seven counts on the Brandenburg side, including Albrecht V of Wernigerode and the Count of Mansfeld, were taken prisoner. Waldemar himself only escaped because other nobles, including von Manseld and Wedigo von Plotho, fought to give him the opportunity. Waldemar and his retinue retreated in some disorder to Gransee, said by Fontane to have been the strongest place in the . On the Alliance side, John III, Count of Holstein-Pl√∂n was captured. Aftermath The victorious Alliance withdrew to Buchholz by way of Rheinsberg and Wesenberg, and celebrated their victory. The two sides now began to negotiate, at first in Zehdenick. The captured noblemen were important bargaining counters. Under the Treaty of Templin, Waldemar was forced to agree to cede Starburg to Mecklenburg. Waldemar died in 1319. His cousin, Henry II, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal, died in 1320, at the age of 12 or 13. The claims of the House of Ascania to the Margraviate of Brandenburg and its possessions (including Starburg) thereupon became extinct, and the quarrel was never revived. Modern times On 30 July 2016, near the 700th anniversary of the battle, the municipal councils of Gransee, Sonnenberg and Schulzendorf, together with the Stargarder Burgverein, dedicated a memorial to the battle. It consists of a plaque which includes a panorama of the battlefield, and historical information by Carsten Dr√§ger, local historian, and by Frank Sa√ü, head of the Stargarden Castle museum.

Figueroa, Laura Ganis, Alexandra Juhasz, Ray Navarro, Steven Okazaki, Catherine Saalfield, Kristin Thomas, and Paul Zakrzewski. These videographers not only made safe sex videos and educational films for healthy living with AIDS, but also gathered oral histories and interviews from diverse group of people suffering from the disease. Carlomusto was part of the Woman's affinity group of ACT UP that focused on bringing visibility to how AIDS impacted women. In 1988, in response to an article by Dr Robert Gould in Cosmopolitan Magazine which said that straight women did not have to worry about AIDS, the Woman's Affinity group, including Rebecca Cole, Maxine Wolfe, Maria Maggenti and Denise Ribble, and Carlomusto organized a direct action against Cosmopolitan Magazine. They interviewed the author of that article, psychiatrist Robert Gould, who had made uninformed statements about women and AIDSSchulman, Sara. (2008, June 30). Interview with Rebecca Cole. Published by the New York Lesbian & Gay Experimental Film Festival in 2010 for the ACT UP Oral History Project. Retrieved from http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/cole.pdf. In February 1987, Testing the Limits Collective founders Gregg Bordowitz and David Meieran filmed the first ACT UP demonstration at Wall Street. They met Jean Carlomusto at this demonstration, who was taping it for Living with AIDS. The filmmakers built up a rapport because they were among the few people at the event with non-professional video equipment. Carlomusto subsequently joined Testing the Limits Collective. Bordowitz and Meieran contacted Hilery Kipness who worked with Downtown Community Television, along with Sandra Elgear and Robyn Hutt from the Whitney program, and together they formed the Testing the Limits collective. This collective created Testing the Limits: New York City, the first direct action AIDS activist video. After working on this film together, Bordowitz joined Carlomusto at the Gay Men's Health Crisis, working together on the Living with AIDS series from 1988 to 1994. Carlomusto, Bordowitz, Catherine Saalfield, Ray Navarro, Ellen Spiro, Costa Pappas, Robert Beck, Rob Kurilla, and George Plagianos went on to form DIVA TV in 1989. Standing for \\"Damned Interfering Video Activists\\", DIVA TV was an affinity group of ACT UP that created short direct action videos at demonstrations, as well as 160 video programs for public access television channels, including the weekly series \\"AIDS Community Television\\" from 1991 to 1996, and the weekly call-in public access series \\"ACT UP Live\\" from 1994 to 1996. Carlomusto participated in the creation of several early DIVA TV videos: Target City Hall, Like a Prayer (1991) and Pride. In 1991, Jean Carlomusto joined Fierce Pussy, a lesbian art collective that produced AIDS-related art and media for ACT UP. In particular, Carlomusto focused on media geared toward lesbians to increase their awareness about the disease. The cumulative work that Carlomusto had done throughout her AIDS activist career helped her produce independent documentaries on the topics of AIDS, lesbians, and LGBT history and culture. Her best known work include the documentaries L is for the Way You Look (1991); Shatzi is Dying (2000); Sex in an Epidemic (2011), and Larry Kramer: In Love and Anger (2015). Independent from her AIDS work, Carlomusto created the personal documentary To Catch a Glimpse (2007), which investigates the mysterious death of her grandmother. Some of Carlomusto's work is now permanently housed in museums such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and has been exhibited in California, Sweden, and South Africa. Jean Carlomusto is currently director of the Television Center and professor in the Communication and Film Department at LIU Post Long Island University in Brookville, New York. Personal life Carlomusto identifies as an Italian- American lesbian from a working-class background. She is a senior student at the Village Zendo in New York City. She is in a relationship with Lori Herbison. Publications Carlomusto, J. (1989). \\"Making It: AIDS Activist Television.\\" Video Guide, p. 18. Carlomusto, J.

Gary Rose, writing in the RadioTimes notes that Al- Khalili, who touched on the topic in his earlier series Atom, takes the subject to a deeper level.

It is at a distance of circa 60 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 7552 is about 75,000 light years across. It forms with three other spiral galaxies the Grus Quartet.  Observation history  NGC 7552 was originally discovered and reported in 1826 by James Dunlop and John Herschel added it in the General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters as number 3977. However, Lewis Swift reported the galaxy independently in on October 22, 1897, at right ascention 9 arcseconds off the location of the galaxy and was included in Index Catalogue as IC 5294.  Structure  NGC 7552 is a barred spiral galaxy, with two spiral arms forming an outer pseudo-ring. The galaxy is seen nearly face on, at an inclination of ‚àº 28¬∞. The one arm is more prominent and the less prominent arm shows no clear continuation with the bar. The bar is dusty, and four huge HII regions are detected in it. The disk features numerous scattered HII regions in an asymmetric pattern. The total infrared luminosity of the galaxy is , and thus is categorised as a luminous infrared galaxy. = Starburst ring = In 1994, Forbes et al. observed a partial starburst ring with 1 kpc radius at Br-gamma with various hot spots. They also detected a small-scale molecular bar and a large reservoir of molecular material, however, no evidence of current activity was detected at the nucleus. The ring is more than 100 parsec wide. The ring is brighter north of the nucleus and there is inhabited by the younger star populations. Brandl et al. detected in near- and mid-infrared nine prominent structures within the ring they identified as star clusters with stellar ages ranging between 5.5 Myr and 6.3 Myr. These clusters account for the 75% of the bolometric luminosity of the starburst ring, with total luminosity of the clusters 2.1 √ó 1010 L‚äô. Numerous supernova remnants have been observed in the ring. Further observations of the galaxy in radio waves showed that NGC 7552 contains three star forming rings of radii 1.0 kpc, 1.9 kpc, and 3.4 kpc as observed by the Very Large Array at 46.9 MHz and the Australia Telescope Compact Array.  Galaxy group  NGC 7552 belongs in NGC 7582 group, also known as Grus group. Others members of the group include the spiral galaxies of NGC 7599, NGC 7590, NGC 7582, which along with NGC 7552 form the Grus Quartet. A large tidal extension of HI reaches from NGC 7582 to NGC 7552, which is indicative of interactions between the group members, yet NGC 7552 hasn't highly disturbed morphology.

She acted in local theatre in Denver, Colorado, and on Broadway, and also co-produced plays in Denver, New York City, and London. She succeeded her father, Frederick Gilmer Bonfils, as manager of The Denver Post in 1933, and eventually became president of the company. Lacking heirs, she invested her fortune into providing for the city of Denver and the state of Colorado, supporting the Belle Bonfils Blood Bank, the Bonfils Memorial Theatre, the University of Denver, the Denver Zoo, the Dumb Friends League, churches, and synagogues. Her estate endowed the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985 and the Colorado Performing Arts Hall of Fame in 1999. Early life and family Helen Gilmer Bonfils was born in Peekskill, New York to American newspaper publisher Frederick Gilmer Bonfils and his wife Belle Barton Bonfils. She and her older sister, Mary Madeline (\\"May\\") Bonfils (1883‚Äì1962), had a strict Catholic upbringing. In 1894 the family moved to Kansas where Frederick ran legal lotteries, and in 1895 to Denver, where Frederick and his partner Harry H. Tammen bought a newspaper that they renamed The Denver Post. In Denver, the Bonfils girls attended an elite private girls' school. Helen attended finishing school at the National Park Seminary in Forest Glen, Maryland. Frederick kept a tight rein on his daughters, forbidding them to date and warning them that \\"the boys were only out for their money\\". Helen became the \\"favored daughter\\" after May eloped at age 21 with a non-Catholic salesman, a move that estranged May from her family for decades. Upon their father's death in 1933, Helen, who still lived at home, received $14 million from his estate. She received another $10 million bequest in 1935 upon the death of her mother, plus newspaper stock and possession of the family's Humboldt Street mansion. May received only a $25,000 annual allowance from a trust, and sued her sister over her mother's estate. After a pitched, three-year legal battle, May was awarded $5 million cash from her mother's estate, some cash from her father's estate, 15% of the Denver Post stock, and additional real estate. The court case divided the sisters even further and they cut off all communication with each other. The Denver Post In 1933 Bonfils assumed the management of The Denver Post and served as secretary-treasurer of the corporation. Her flair for the theatrical extended to her ordering two dozen yellow roses to be placed in the lobby of The Denver Post to welcome her arrival; she drove to the building in a Pierce-Arrow touring car bearing the Colorado license plate \\"#1\\". In 1934 she introduced a free summer series of Broadway plays and light opera staged outdoors at the Cheesman Park Pavilion under the auspices of The Denver Post. Starring Broadway performers in the lead roles and local players in lesser parts, these performances attracted up to 20,000 people per performance, and were staged every year until Bonfil's death in 1972. In 1946 she hired a new editor, Palmer Hoyt, to give the paper more journalistic integrity. In 1966 she became president of the paper and asked Donald Seawell, a theatrical producer whom she had met on Broadway, to move to Denver and become chairman and publisher. Theatrical career Elitch Theatre Bonfils' first love was the theatre. She acted with the Elitch Stock Theatre, helped organize and performed in the Civic Theatre at the University of Denver, performed at the Bonfils Memorial Theatre, and also acted on Broadway under the stage name Gertrude Barton (her mother's maiden name). With her first husband, George Somnes, she co-produced plays in Denver and in New York City through the Bonfils & Somnes Producing Co. Among their hit productions were The Greatest Show on Earth (1938), in which Helen also performed. After Somnes' death in 1956, Helen co-produced plays on Broadway and in London with actress Haila Stoddard and Donald Seawell under Bonard Productions, and co-produced Broadway plays with Seawell under Bonfils-Seawell Enterprises. The latter partnership produced the successful Broadway musical Sail Away (1962), The Hollow Crown (1963), The Last Analysis (1964), and Sleuth, which won the 1971 Tony Award. Marriages Wood‚ÄìMorris‚ÄìBonfils House in 2009 Bonfils met English actor and theatrical producer George Somnes when he was hired by the Elitch Theatre in 1936. They married that year, when Bonfils was 47. The couple ‚Äì always referred to as \\"Helen Bonfils and George Somnes\\" ‚Äì bought a condominium at River House in New York City and resided in Denver at the Humboldt Street mansion. In 1948 Helen sold the mansion to the Conservative Baptist Theological Seminary and purchased the Wood‚ÄìMorris‚ÄìBonfils House, a French Mediterranean Revival mansion at 707 Washington Street in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Denver. The couple's amicable personal and professional partnership ended with Somnes' death in February 1956 due to liver failure. Craving companionship, Helen turned to her chauffeur, Edward Michael \\"Tiger Mike\\" Davis. She married him in April 1959 at the age of 69; he was 28. Bonfils sued for divorce in December 1971 after 12 years of marriage, possibly to preempt any claim Davis might have to her estate. The divorce was granted on the grounds of cruelty. Bonfils retained the rights to her name, and Davis received the Wood‚ÄìMorris‚ÄìBonfils House, $1.6 million in promissory notes, and $50,000 cash. Philanthropy Bonfils Memorial Theatre Denver Center for the Performing Arts Lacking heirs, Bonfils invested her fortune into supporting culture, arts, healthcare, education, and humanitarian causes in Denver and the state of Colorado. She inherited the presidency of the philanthropic Frederick G. Bonfils Foundation after her father's death and between 1936 and 1973 distributed nearly $11 million. This included the Belle Bonfils Blood Bank, established in 1943 in memory of her mother. The blood bank eventually became self-supporting; as of 2004, the Bonfils Blood Center serves 115 Colorado hospitals and healthcare centers and has an operating budget of $57.8 million. Helen further established the Bonfils Tumor Clinic in her father's memory, finished and furnished the Holy Ghost Catholic Church at a cost of $1.2 million, and helped construct the Nurses' Home at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. In 1953 she dedicated the 550-seat Bonfils Memorial Theatre at 1475 Elizabeth Street, corner East Colfax Avenue, in memory of both her parents. As the headquarters for the Denver Civic Theatre, the $1.25 million theatre hosted plays, operas, concerts, lectures, films, and television shows. Helen acted there on numerous occasions. Considered \\"one of the country's most successful community theaters\\", it closed in 1986 and was converted into a Tattered Cover bookstore in 2006. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Bonfils also supported the University of Denver, the Central City Opera, the Denver Symphony Orchestra, the Denver Zoo, the Dumb Friends League animal shelter, the Denver Community Chest/United Way, and many churches and synagogues. In 1948 alone, the Frederick G. Bonfils Foundation distributed more than $1.4 million to churches of different denominations. Helen also underwrote college scholarships for men and women totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Upon her death in 1972, both the Frederick G. Bonfils Foundation and the Helen G. Bonfils Foundation ceased acting as private charities and diverted all funds to a permanent endowment for the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. Donald Seawell became chairman of the board of the new foundation and guided the expansion of the Denver Performing Arts Complex. By the 1990s, the downtown complex had grown to four square blocks and encompassed eight theatres with capacity seating for 9,000. Later years Bonfils became embroiled in a drawn-out legal battle in her later years. In 1960 her sister May sold her Denver Post stock to newspaper baron Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr. on the condition that the stock could never be resold to Helen. With this stake in the company, Newhouse attempted to take over the paper, and Helen sued him. The court case dragged on for 12 years and concluded six months after Helen's death, when an appeals court overruled the district court's ruling and prevented Newhouse from taking over the paper. However, the $5 million spent on attorney fees drained the newspaper's coffers and in 1980 The Denver Post was sold to the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Company. Bonfils was hospitalized for the last six years of her life at Saint Joseph Hospital, where she and her entourage occupied the entire top floor. She died on June 6, 1972, at the age of 82. She was buried in the Bonfils family vault at the Fairmount Mausoleum alongside her parents and first husband Somnes. Her sister May, who had predeceased her in 1962, was entombed in her own mausoleum a short distance away from the rest of the family. Posthumous Bonfils was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. She was named to the inaugural class of the Colorado Performing Arts Hall of Fame in 1999. Bonfils' life and work were recounted in two biographies published after her death. They were: High Altitude Attitudes: Six Savvy Colorado Women by Marilyn Griggs Riley (Big Earth Publishing, 2006) and Papa's Girl: The Fascinating World of Helen Bonfils by Eva Hodges Watt (Western Reflections Publishing Co., 2007). A stage play, The Bonfils Girl by Mike Broemmel and Seth Holley, premiered in Denver, Colorado, in 2016. It stars Cathy Washburn in the title role and is directed by Rich Beall.

The treaty allowed both parties to search vessels of the other for on-board slaves. Among other things, the treaty established two Mixed Commission Courts, one with a seat in Freetown, Sierra Leone and another in Paramaribo, Suriname, which had the power to sentence slavers. The treaty was amended and provided with additional articles by treaties concluded on 31 December 1822, 25 January 1823, 7 February 1837 and 31 August 1848.  Background  In June 1814, William I of the Netherlands, who had been proclaimed Sovereign Prince of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1813 and would become King of the Netherlands on 16 March 1815, forbade Dutch participation in the slave trade by sovereign decree. That was endorsed by the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna on 9 June 1815. It is often argued that William I forbade the slave trade under British pressure, as his return to the Netherlands had not been possible without British support. By abolishing slave trade, William I hoped to regain the Dutch colonies now under British control. That objective was, for the most part, achieved with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. In May 1818, a comprehensive treaty was concluded between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, which allowed the Royal Navy and the Royal Netherlands Navy to inspect vessels they suspected of carrying slaves. If slaves were indeed found on board, both navies were allowed to detain the crew and bring them before one of the Mixed Courts of Justice.  Mixed Commission Courts  The Mixed Commission Court in Freetown sentenced in total 22 Dutch vessels during its existence between 1819 and 1862. The Mixed Commission Court in Paramaribo sentenced only one vessel during its existence between 1819 and 1845, namely, the Nueve of Snauw in 1823.

Uninhabited since the 15th century, recent excavations have revealed it once held a sanctuary dedicated to Apollo in the late Hellenistic period. Description The island which lies 280 metres from the shore of western Cyprus has been uninhabited since the 14th or 15th century. It has an area of 26000 square metres and rises 21.65 metres from sea level. Geologically the island consists of a hard calcarenite crust of Pleistocene marine terraces overlying a soft marl core. The toponym \\"Holy Island\\" is an ancient one. Pliny speaks of an island called \\"Hiera,\\" near Paphos, and Strabo mentions a place called \\"Hierocepis\\" nearby Paphos and Akamas. It is likely that the name refers to the Apollo sanctuary that stood there in the 1st century BC. Excavations The island was first excavated in 1982 by Sophocles Hadjisavvas following a proposal to build a hotel on the island. He quickly established the presence of Hellenistic remains on the island, which halted all further attempts to build on the island. In 1989, Joan Breton Connelly from New York University heard about the work and impressed by the range of the material joined the excavations which have continued since then. The excavations have established three periods of occupation on Yeronisos. Early Chalcolithic (3800 BC), late Hellenistic (80-30 BC), and Byzantine (6th-7th century and 13th century). The most intense of this activity is the late Hellenistic period at a time when Cleopatra ruled Cyprus. Artefacts include coins, pottery, glass, and inscriptions. Limestone amulets, identical to those used in Cypriot sanctuaries of Apollo, point to ritual activity and the worship of Apollo. The island was apparently abandoned following a devastating earthquake in 1st century BC/AD. Low-level activity on the island begins again in the 6th century AD. when a reservoir and animal shelters were built.

The project was announced by La Concha owner Lorenzo Doumani in February 2004. The 42-story condominium tower was to be accompanied by Hilton's Conrad Las Vegas, a Conrad-branded, 37-story hotel that would operate in a separate high-rise building on the same property. The project was initially expected to open in February 2006. In 2005, the project was redesigned to combine the Majestic and the Conrad into a single tower. Later that year, a new two-tower design was announced as a result of rising construction costs, which made the previous one-tower design financially impossible. In 2006, it was announced that the project would again consist of a single tower, with the top 10 floors to be occupied by The Waldorf-Astoria Residences. In 2007, Majestic Resorts filed a request for arbitration against Hilton after the company pulled out of the project. The undeveloped property was sold that year for $180 million. In 2019, Doumani received county approval to build a new version of Majestic Las Vegas on the former site of the nearby Clarion Hotel and Casino, which he had imploded four years earlier. This version of Majestic Las Vegas would be a 45-story, non-gaming hotel with 720 rooms. The project would cost $850 million and stand 620 feet, and would be located near the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Las Vegas Strip. Groundbreaking is expected for 2020, with completion expected in 2023. History In 2001, the 5.4-acre site occupied by the La Concha Motel on the Las Vegas Strip ‚Äì south of the Riviera hotel and casino ‚Äì was approved for a 520-foot hotel tower, as well as a 645-foot condominium tower that would include a shopping mall. The property was owned by Lorenzo Doumani, whose family had owned the motel since its opening in 1961. Doumani was also the chief executive officer of a Las Vegas film company known as Majestic Entertainment. Demolition of the La Concha began in December 2003, to make room on the property for a new project that would replace it. =Announcement= On February 18, 2004, Doumani and Hilton Hotels Corporation announced plans for a $250 million joint project for the property that would consist of the Majestic Resort and Residences ‚Äì a $150 million, 42-story condominium tower ‚Äì and the Conrad Las Vegas, a $100 million, 37-story all- suite hotel. Both towers would feature an Art Deco appearance. The Conrad Las Vegas would be the third Conrad-branded hotel property to be built in the United States. Hilton stated that there were no plans to add a casino onto the property because of a lack of adequate room for one. The hotel would be aimed primarily at business travelers, while also including amenities such as a spa, a fitness center, and a heated Olympic-sized outdoor swimming pool. The hotel suites were to be an average size of , the largest in Las Vegas. The Majestic would be the second-tallest structure in Las Vegas, behind the Stratosphere tower. Although the Majestic would have fewer floors than other resort towers in Las Vegas, several of those floors would have rooms that would be taller than the standard size. Condominium units would range from to , with prices between $850,000 and $3 million. The Majestic would be the first condominium project to be located on the Las Vegas Strip, and would also be accessible from Paradise Road. The project would include the Majestic Court and Marketplace, consisting of of restaurants and shops that would be located on three floors. The project would also include a four-story, 574-space parking garage. A sales office for Majestic was expected to open in late February 2004. The Majestic Las Vegas was to include either 144 condominium units, or 378, while the Conrad Las Vegas would include either 442 rooms, or 378 as well. Lorenzo Doumani also announced that his father, Ed Doumani, would serve as construction manager on the project. Other members of the Doumani family were also partners in the project. The property, occupied by the remaining structures of the La Concha, was expected to be cleared by July 4, 2004, with construction scheduled to begin in November or December 2004. At the time, discussions were underway to choose a contractor. Negotiations were also being held with the Las Vegas Monorail Company to develop a track that would allow the monorail to pass through the new project. An adjacent Peppermill restaurant south of the property was to remain open during the construction. The project was expected to open in February 2006. =Postponements and redesigns= By April 2005, plans for a second tower on the property were cancelled because of a dispute regarding an adjacent condominium project by a different development company, which caused investors to become unsure about the Majestic/Conrad project. The project was redesigned to include only one tower on the property that would combine the Conrad hotel and Majestic condominium units. The La Concha's shell-shaped lobby, the only structure on the property that was not demolished, was converted into a sales office for Majestic. In June 2005, sales for Majestic were put on hold because of rising construction costs. In September 2005, Lorenzo Doumani announced plans for a redesigned two-tower version of Majestic Las Vegas, which was the result of heightened construction costs that had increased 15 percent in the previous 12 months, making it financially impossible to build the project as previously planned. Doumani stated that building one tower would cost $520 million, compared to $600 million for the construction of two towers. In addition, Doumani announced that condominium prices would be raised $200,000 to help finance the project. With the redesign, a 60-story tower would be used for the Conrad Hotel, with 500 suites, while the condominium tower would be approximately 40 stories and would include 560 units. Plans for the redesigned project were to be finalized in early October 2005. Lorenzo Doumani said he was in the process of locating a contractor for the project, after previously signing with a contractor twice that ultimately became too expensive. Groundbreaking was planned for spring or early summer 2006, with construction of the two towers expected to take 22 months. The Doumanis had wanted to use the La Concha's shell-shaped lobby as the entrance to Majestic Las Vegas' shops or to a club. However, the lobby could not be worked into the design. Construction was on hold as of November 2005. In October 2006, it was announced that the project would consist of a single 654-foot tower that would contain the Conrad Las Vegas and the condominiums, while the top 10 floors would be occupied by The Waldorf=Astoria Residences. Construction was scheduled to begin in April 2007, with completion in 2009. In August 2007, Lorenzo Doumani announced that the project was on hold; he later stated that after Hilton was sold to The Blackstone Group in 2007, the company pulled out of the project. In October 2007, the Doumani family sold the undeveloped property to an affiliate of Triple Five Nevada Development Corporation, a real estate development company. The property sold for $180 million, which amounted to a near-record of $33.1 million per acre, and was later put up for sale in 2014, at a price of $16 million per acre. Triple Five still owned the undeveloped site as of 2019. =Majestic/Hilton lawsuits= In 2007, Majestic Resorts filed a request for arbitration, alleging that Hilton broke its 2004 management agreement to join the design, development and construction of the project by pulling out of it. A three-member arbitration panel rejected Majestic's claim and ordered the company to pay Hilton $834,734 to cover attorney fees, as well as an additional $319,817 in costs. Majestic alleged that one member of the panel, Richard Chernick, was biased because of his previous association with the attorney that represented Hilton in the case. The matter had been raised by Majestic prior to the panel's decision, but Chernick declined to excuse himself from the case, and the company withdrew its objection to his presence prior to the decision. Majestic appealed the case to a District Court judge, who ruled in favor of Hilton. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Nevada upheld the decision. In September 2011, Hilton filed a lawsuit against Majestic Resorts and the Doumani family to obtain the $1.1 million from the arbitration case, which the company had yet to receive despite the family's $180 million sale of the property. Hilton alleged that in October 2007, after selling the property, Majestic distributed $169 million to its shareholders ‚Äì members of the Doumani family ‚Äì leaving the company with $355,000 in cash assets. According to the lawsuit, Lorenzo Doumani later distributed $200,000 to himself. Hilton alleged that such transfers of money were fraudulent and were intended to \\"hinder, delay and/or defraud Hilton.\\" Lorenzo Doumani said he would fight the lawsuit. Other legal challenges =Conrad name= On April 11, 2005, a lawsuit was filed against Hilton by the Conrad Hotel, a two-story 30-room hotel in downtown Las Vegas that opened in 1969. The owners of the Conrad Hotel said that Hilton's new hotel was causing confusion among customers; that three letters were sent to executives of the Conrad Hotels brand and were ignored; and that Hilton knew of the Conrad Hotel's existence since April 2, 2004. Hilton filed a counterclaim on May 25, 2005, believing that the hotel did not have the exclusive right to use the name. Hilton also denied the assertion of customer confusion between the two properties. =Icon lawsuits= By April 2005, the Doumanis had concerns that a newly proposed neighboring condominium project to the south, which would be known as Icon and would include two 48-story towers, would overshadow the Majestic/Conrad project and would block its views. The Doumanis also had concerns about traffic flow. The Related Companies, the developer of Icon, held 12 meetings with the Doumanis to devise solutions for the family's concerns. Lorenzo Doumani had previously asked The Related Companies to redesign the back (north) side of their second Icon tower to resemble its front side, so that residents of Majestic would not have to face the Icon tower's brick wall. Doumani later asked the developer to rotate their Icon towers 20 degrees to avoid obstructing the views for Majestic's residents, stating, \\"It won't cost them millions of dollars. They'll spend more on legal fees fighting us than they would just being good neighbors at the end of the day.\\" When the Las Vegas County Commission approved the Icon project in April 2005, Lorenzo Doumani said he would sue The Related Companies. Doumani said that investors became unsure about the project because of the dispute, resulting in the brief cancellation of a second tower on the property. Doumani later said that the lawsuit primarily related to a disagreement regarding access corridors, as well as proposed garbage and loading docks that would be located near the Majestic's pool. Doumani dropped the lawsuit in September 2005, after The Related Companies agreed to relocate the docks. A separate lawsuit had also been filed against The Related Company by Doumani, and was related to an easement that he believed would intrude on his property, although he and the company were discussing a solution. The Icon project was ultimately cancelled. 2019 proposal In May 2019, Doumani received county approval to build Majestic Las Vegas on the former six-acre site of the nearby Clarion Hotel and Casino, which he had imploded four years earlier. For the Majestic project, Doumani spent a year trying to obtain height approval from the Federal Aviation Administration before he could get county approval. This version of Majestic Las Vegas would be a 45-story, non-gaming hotel with 720 rooms, medical offices, and 10 floors of convention space. The resort would also feature six restaurants and a medical wellness spa. The spa would give physical examinations and help people improve their lifestyles. The top of the resort would contain 30 corporate sky suites. Doumani hoped for Majestic Las Vegas to become the most high-end resort in the United States. The project would cost $850 million and stand 620 feet. It would be located at 305 Convention Center Drive, near the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Las Vegas Strip. Groundbreaking is expected for April or May 2020, with completion expected in the first quarter of 2023.

Early life and education  Even at the age of five of six, Robert Mars was experimenting with collage and pop-based themes that would inspire him throughout his career. He is a graduate of Parsons School of Design, New York City. Before committing to being a full-time artist, Mars started out as a graphic designer in New York City and then design director for fashion brands. After spending most of his life in New York City, Mars lived on the west coast in Los Angeles from 1996 to 2001 and in Portland from 2001 to 2005 before returning to east coast to fiercely pursue fine art. Career Mars' artwork is exhibited worldwide including museum collections in Munich, Tokyo, Amsterdam, London, Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Laguna Beach, Paris, Aspen and Naples. Mars' latest solo exhibition in 2016 was at the Evansville Museum of Arts in Indiana, where he will also be an artist in residence and guest lecturer. Alongside Damien Hirst, Mars' artwork was selected for the Absolut Vodka Blank campaign. His largest monumental piece to date was acquired by Philip Morris/Altria for their corporate headquarters in Virginia. In 2015, Mars was chosen for the cover of Neiman Marcus' May Book. Also in the same year, Coca-Cola purchased several existing works and ordered commissions for a world tour celebrating their centennial anniversary of their trademark bottle shape in which Mars debuted his Coca- Cola Popforms. Robert Mars artworks are also in the institutional collections of Coral Springs Museum of Art, International Museum of Collage and New Bedford Art Museum, as well as in the corporate collections of Microsoft, adidas, Nike, Inc., Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Oceania Cruises, Prps, and Monopol Hotel Collection in St. Moritz. Publications In 2017, Mars attained critical recognition from Donald Kuspit, Bruce Helander, and Eleanor Heartney. DTR Modern Galleries produced a publication of a fresh collection of works by Mars along with essays by those aforementioned scholars in Futurelics: Robert Mars Past is Present. * Essays by Eleanor Heartney, Bruce Helander and Donald Kuspit. Styles and techniques From his studio in Connecticut, Robert Mars archives the nostalgia of idealistic Americana culture. In the styles of Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg, Mars explores the mementos of the past, present, and future packaged in layers of resin. With a background in graphic design, Mars uses Xerox transfers of iconic images of celebrities or tokens as the focal point, and then creates a branded paper ecosystem of archived magazines, newspapers, and advertisements that he photocopies, layers with paint, and cements with resin. Mars' style evokes a vintage quality, distressed but bold, that hangs on to a fading era. The artworks are homages to an era after the Great Depression and World War II. The era hosted people such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean, Audrey Hepburn, Jackie Kennedy and Elvis Presley that Mars captures in his artworks as ambassadors of better times. More recently, Mars has also included fashion models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell in his works, as well as Martin Luther King Jr., and tributes to Basquiat.

The Harbor Defenses of New Bedford was a United States Army Coast Artillery Corps harbor defense command. It coordinated the coast defenses of New Bedford, Massachusetts and the nearby Cape Cod Canal from 1900 to 1950, beginning with the Endicott program. These included a coast artillery fort (Fort Rodman, a.k.a. Fort Taber) and an underwater minefield. The command originated circa 1900 as the New Bedford Artillery District, was renamed Coast Defenses of New Bedford in 1913, and again renamed Harbor Defenses of New Bedford in 1925.Stanton, pp. 455-481, 484Coast Artillery Organization: A Brief Overview at the Coast Defense Study Group websiteRinaldi, pp. 165-166Berhow, p. 430-434 History =Early New Bedford forts= ;American Revolution through War of 1812 Two forts were built in the New Bedford area in the American Revolution, a 6-gun (possibly 11-gun)Roberts, p. 407 unnamed fort (later named Fort Phoenix) in 1775 in what is now Fairhaven,New Bedford forts at American Forts Network and the 10-gun Acushnet Fort in 1776 at an uncertain location, possibly on Clark's Point at the site of the later Fort Rodman. The building of the first fort was sparked by the Battle off Fairhaven on 14 May 1775, said to be the first naval engagement of the Revolution. A group of about 30 patriots in the 40-ton sloop Success retrieved two vessels that had been captured by HMS Falcon, taking some British prisoners in the action.First Naval Skirmish of the American Revolution Another major action in the Revolution was Grey's raid on 5‚Äì6 September 1778, in which the Fairhaven fort was destroyed. A force under Major Israel Fearing drove off the British, both at the fort and when they attempted an attack on the town the next day. The fort was then renamed Fort Fearing.Fort Phoenix at FortWiki.com Fort Fearing was renamed Fort Phoenix in 1784, after the mythical bird that \\"rose from its ashes\\", and was rebuilt with Commonwealth resources in 1798, contemporary with but not part of the federal first system of US fortifications. In 1808 both forts were upgraded, Fort Phoenix with state resources mounting 12 guns, and Acushnet Fort under the federal second system of fortifications, mounting six guns. Reports on Acushnet Fort indicate that it was not officially named, but was called the \\"fort at Eldridge Point\\", \\"two miles below the town\\", which may indicate Clark's Point.Wade, pp. 141, 236, 242, 248 The location of Eldridge Point is unclear from references, but the Eldredge family was prominent in the area. Acushnet Fort seems to have been abandoned after the War of 1812, and probably demolished by the 1840s. In the War of 1812, bombarded Fort Phoenix on 13 June 1814 when the local militia refused to surrender some guns. After an exchange of fire Nimrod sailed away. Local accounts differ as to whether she launched boats carrying a landing party that were driven off, or not. This event is confused in some references with an attack by the same ship on Falmouth on 29 January 1814.Fort Phoenix at FairhavenTours.com\\"Falmouth Stood Up to the British\\", Cape Cod Times, 26 January 2014 ;Civil War era Also known as the Old Stone Fort, the \\"Fort at Clark's Point\\" (named Fort Rodman in 1898) began construction in 1857 under the third system of US fortifications, and in 1862 construction became overseen by Henry Robert, author of Robert's Rules of Order and an Army Corps of Engineers officer.Fort Taber Park at New Bedford city website The fort, as built, had emplacements for 72 cannon in three tiers; two casemated tiers plus a barbette tier on the fort's roof.Weaver, pp. 115‚Äì120 Construction was halted in 1867, and the fort as planned was never completed.Fort Rodman at FortWiki.com After the Civil War began in April 1861, it was apparent that the Fort at Clark's Point was still years from completion. Fort Taber, a small earthwork with six cannon, was built nearby with city resources and named after New Bedford's mayor during that period. It provided a temporary defense until the stone fort was garrisoned in 1863. Fort Taber is marked by a stone outline today, directly behind the stone fort. It was noted at the time that the stone fort's presence interfered with effective fire from Fort Taber, and a battery of field artillery was emplaced east of Fort Taber.Fort Rodman article at FortWiki.comFort Taber at NorthAmericanForts.com The Fort Taber name was unofficially used to refer to the Fort at Clark's Point for many years, even by the garrison in letters home, and is used to refer to the stone fort in some recent references. Fort Phoenix was refurbished with eight 24-pounder cannon in the Civil War; it was abandoned in 1876. =Endicott period= The Endicott Board of 1885 recommended a comprehensive replacement of existing coast defenses, and most of its recommendations were implemented. In the New Bedford area this meant new installations at Clark's Point. As with other smaller Endicott installations, all of the new defenses were concentrated at one fort. The Clark's Point area was officially named the Fort Rodman Military Reservation in 1898, in honor of Lieutenant Colonel Logan Rodman, a New Bedford native with the 38th Massachusetts Infantry who died in the assault on Port Hudson, Louisiana in 1863. Armament included two one-gun batteries of 8-inch M1888 disappearing guns, a two-gun battery of 5-inch guns on pedestal mounts, and two two-gun batteries of 3-inch guns on retractable masking parapet mounts.Berhow, p. 206 Along with gun batteries, facilities for planting and controlling an underwater minefield were built. The fort was completed in 1902. =World War I= The American entry into World War I brought many changes to the Coast Artillery and the Coast Defenses of New Bedford (CD New Bedford). Numerous temporary buildings were built at Fort Rodman to accommodate the influx of new recruits. Some weapons were removed from forts with the intent of getting US-made artillery into the fight. Fort Rodman's pair of pedestal-mounted 5-inch guns was transferred to the US Army transport ship USAT Kilpatrick. Both of the fort's 8-inch guns were dismounted as potential railway artillery in 1918, but they did not leave the fort and were remounted in 1919. The 5-inch guns were returned in 1919, but by 1921 they were scrapped as part of a general removal from service of some weapon types. A major upgrade began construction at Fort Rodman during the war, Battery Milliken with two 12-inch guns on long-range barbette carriages, initially in open emplacements. Compared with disappearing carriages, this increased the range of this type of gun from to .Berhow, p. 61 This battery was built 1917-1921. References indicate the authorized strength of CD New Bedford in World War I was five companies, including one from the Rhode Island National Guard. =Interwar= In 1920 Fort Rodman's M1898 3-inch guns were scrapped as part of a general removal from service of this weapon; they were not replaced. On 1 July 1924 the harbor defense garrisons completed the transition from a company-based organization to a regimental one, and on 9 June 1925 the commands were renamed from \\"Coast Defenses...\\" to \\"Harbor Defenses...\\". The 23rd Coast Artillery Regiment was the wartime garrison of the Harbor Defenses of New Bedford (HD New Bedford). This unit was first organized in December 1924 as the 616th Coast Artillery Battalion, but was not activated until 1 February 1940 as the 23rd Coast Artillery Battalion. HD New Bedford was in caretaker status for most of the interwar period, with the 10th Coast Artillery providing a caretaker detachment during at least the later years through early 1940. This caretaker detachment became the nucleus of the 23rd Coast Artillery Battalion, which was gradually activated through mid-1941. In 1938 a battery of two 155 mm guns on \\"Panama mounts\\" (circular concrete platforms) was built at Fort Rodman, probably due to its complete lack of other medium- and small-caliber artillery. =World War II= Early in World War II numerous temporary buildings were again constructed to accommodate the rapid mobilization of men and equipment. In early 1940 the 23rd Coast Artillery Battalion was mobilized to garrison HD New Bedford. In 1942 the two 8-inch guns of Batteries Walcott and Barton were scrapped, leaving only the 12-inch Battery Milliken and the 155 mm battery active. Battery Milliken was casemated for protection against air attack during the war. On 13 September 1943, the 23rd Coast Artillery Battalion was expanded to a regiment due to the construction of new batteries in southeastern Massachusetts, with the transfer of a battalion from the 242nd Coast Artillery. The 242nd was a Connecticut National Guard regiment normally assigned to the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound. Several medium- and small-caliber batteries were built in New Bedford and the Buzzards Bay area during World War II. Chief among these was Battery 210 at Mishaum Point Military Reservation in Dartmouth. It had two 6-inch M1 guns in long-range shielded mounts with a large bunker for ammunition and fire control between them. It currently has a private residence built on the site. A two-gun 155 mm battery was at the location until the 6-inch battery was completed in 1945, along with the harbor entrance control post for New Bedford. The battery in this area served as the examination battery for HD New Bedford. Defending the passage to New Bedford between Dartmouth and Cuttyhunk Island were two batteries of 90 mm dual-purpose guns, one at Barneys Joy Point Military Reservation and one on Cuttyhunk Island, part of the Elizabeth Islands Military Reservation. These were called Anti- Motor Torpedo Boat Batteries (AMTB) 931 and 932, respectively. The AMTB batteries had an authorized strength of four 90 mm guns, two on fixed mounts and two on towed mounts. An additional 90 mm battery, AMTB 933, was on Nashawena Island, just east of Cuttyhunk Island. Protecting the southern entrance to the Cape Cod Canal was a two-gun 155 mm battery on Panama mounts, replaced in 1943 by the 90 mm AMTB 934, at Butler Point Military Reservation in Marion. In early 1944 the US Army (except for the infantry branch) transitioned from a regimental to a battalion-based organization. The 23rd Coast Artillery was reduced to a battalion between 4 February and 12 April 1944. With little threat to the east coast from enemy surface forces, coast defenses were drawn down further. On 7 October 1944 this battalion was absorbed by the Harbor Defenses of New Bedford. The US Navy also participated in defending the Buzzards Bay area with net defenses and submarine-detecting indicator loops, including a station at Gooseberry Neck in Westport (Station 1I).Indicator loops website Following mobilization in 1940 HD New Bedford was subordinate to First Army. On 24 December 1941 the Eastern Theater of Operations (renamed the Eastern Defense Command three months later) was established, with all east coast harbor defense commands subordinate to it, along with antiaircraft and fighter assets. This command was disestablished in 1946.Conn, pp. 33-35 =Post World War II= Following the war, it was soon determined that gun defenses were obsolete, and they were scrapped by the end of 1948, with remaining harbor defense functions turned over to the Navy. In 1950 the Coast Artillery Corps and all Army harbor defense commands were dissolved. Today the Air Defense Artillery carries the lineage of some Coast Artillery units. From the late 1940s through the mid-1970s Fort Rodman served as a military reserve center. Present Except for a pair of fire control towers on Cuttyhunk and Nashawena Islands, the only significant remnants of the Harbor Defenses of New Bedford are Fort Rodman (in Fort Taber Park) and Fort Phoenix. The stone fort at Fort Rodman is in a good state of preservation, but is only open to the public on special occasions. A stone outline marks the location of the Civil War Fort Taber. A museum and a World War II M4 Sherman tank recovered from the tragic Exercise Tiger are in the park. As of 2016, the Endicott batteries at Fort Rodman are fenced off and overgrown, but can be viewed. Many of the garrison buildings of Fort Rodman remain; one of the tenants is the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Fort Phoenix has several 24-pounder Model 1819 cannon made in the 1820s, plus a cannon said to have been captured by the Continental Marines during the raid on Nassau in the Bahamas in 1776. This raid was the first amphibious landing on foreign soil by United States Marines.

Eleven people were held hostage by four men in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Incident Police responded to an attempted robbery by four Sunni Muslims looking for guns, rifles, pistols and ammunition for \\"a holy crusade\\". There was a three- hour shootout. The gunmen were Shulab Abdur Raheem, 24 years old; Dawd A. Rahman, 22; Yusef Abdallah Almussadig, 23, and Salih Ali Abdullah, 26. In 1974, their court case went to the New York Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The defense contended that the four men held up the store in January because they feared attacks by their rivals, the Black Muslims, because the day before the robbery, seven Sunni Muslims were killed in a house in Washington. A jury found them guilty of 41 counts, including murder, kidnapping, and robbery.  Legacy  The hostage crisis was a turning point in the New York City Police Department's approach to hostage situations. Instead of brute force, the police used psychology, firearm discipline and patience to end the siege. These were techniques that were then codified in the department's hostage- negotiating training program.  Parole  In 1998, the New York State Board of Parole released Abdulah Almussudug. The public was not yet aware he had been released when he died in 2003. The convicted killer, Shuaib A.

The primary ingredients in hunter's chicken are saut√©ed chicken and a reduced chasseur sauce prepared using tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, white wine, brandy and tarragon. Several other dishes from around the world share these names; yet each version is very different, with few to no similarities besides the use of chicken. Etymology means \\"hunter\\" in French, which also refers to the chasseur sauce. Hunter's chicken shares the same literal name as chicken cacciatore in Italy ( means \\"hunter\\" in Italian). Overview French hunter's chicken is prepared using saut√©ed chicken that is cooked crisp and a chasseur sauce consisting of tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, white wine, brandy and tarragon. Prior to saut√©eing, the chicken can be dredged in flour. Tomato ingredients can include diced tomatoes, canned crushed tomatoes and canned tomato paste. Additional ingredients in hunter's chicken can include shallots, olive oil, chicken stock and vermouth, and in addition to tarragon, additional spices and seasonings can include marjoram, thyme, bay leaf, salt and pepper. The sauce for hunter's chicken is typically prepared and thickened by the process of reduction. The dish can be garnished with ingredients such as parsley and croutons. Hunter's chicken can become more flavorful after sitting and then being reheated, which allows the flavors of the ingredients to further intermingle.

Ganasi served in the Papua New Guinea Defence Force for 23 years prior to entering politics, rising to the rank of major and serving as an officer in the Bougainville Civil War. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the People's Action Party at the 2002 election and for the Pangu Party at the 2007 election. Ganasi listed his last role prior to entering politics as having been a border administration officer at Daru. He was elected to the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea at the 2012 election, representing the governing People's National Congress. He was immediately elected Deputy Speaker of parliament. However, Sali Subam, the MP Ganasi had defeated at the election, challenged the result in the National Court alleging that Ganasi had committed bribery, and in March 2013 the court ruled in Subam's favour, unseated Ganasi, and ordered a by-election. Ganasi appealed the result to the Supreme Court, which in September 2013 ruled in his favour and reinstated him after seven months out of office. He was frequently acting speaker from mid-2015 until his death due to Speaker Theo Zurenuoc serving as Acting Governor-General, during which time Ganasi was responsible for dealing with several attempted no-confidence motions in the O'Neill government.

After it closed as a cinema in 1932, it was used as a theatre by Millicent Ward and her Company (during which time John Le Mesurier made his professional stage debut there) until 1935 when it reverted to use as a venue for variety shows. During this period of its existence, stars including Lex McLean, Donald Peers, Robert Wilson and The Alexander Brothers performed there. By the 1950s it was in use as a venue in the early years of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It finally closed for theatrical use in 1966, and was then converted into a bingo hall. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was a nightclub known as the White Elephant, before changing its name in the late 1970s to Valentino's.

It aired in the United States on Fox on April 2, 2017. Plot A softball match is being played to little athletic achievement between teams from the Indian Point and Springfield Nuclear Plants. After Homer Simpson collapses on the field, Mr. Burns and the other coach talk about how the market for nuclear energy will be lucrative forever and ever. Mr. Burns heads right away to his alma mater, Yale University, to endow a chair in nuclear plant management, only to learn that the entire student body is now made of \\"highly entitled wusses\\" from the Whiffenpoofs on down, and who follow left-wing views that appall Mr. Burns. He then finds out that running a university can earn him a lot of money from a member of the Skull and Bones society named Bourbon Verlander. Mr. Burns then cuts a deal with Bourbon and withdraws all of his financial support to Yale in order to set up his own branch of the for-profit university system. Back at the power plant, Mr. Burns burns all of his Yale University memorabilia and tells Homer, Lenny and Carl about his new university. The teachers he chooses to run the university are the power plant workers. Homer and the others start working as teachers, but Homer is not doing well with his students and Lisa (who was horrified that Homer became a professor mainly because he didn't take the responsibility of educating people seriously) offers him a DVD box set of inspirational teachers movies. After watching them, he gets better at teaching and Mr. Burns sells Homer to Bourbon. Homer meets Neil deGrasse Tyson, Ken Jennings, Suze Orman, and Robert McKee, and sees them being introduced to a group of young female \\"students\\" who are actually life-like humanoid robots that will all get into Yale and earn \\"financial aid\\" that gets funneled directly to Bourbon. Six months later, Homer ruins Bourbon's integration of the robots at Yale University with a microaggression that makes them all explode. In the final scene, the teachers then start teaching Lisa, Marge, and Bart at the Simpson residence. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, stating \\"But 'The Caper Chase' is just all over the place, with Burns‚Äô return to Yale spurring him to open a for-profit, Trump- style university like those of fellow nuclear plant maven Bourbon Verlander (guest voice Jason Alexander). That plot seems prepared to morph into an inspirational tale of Homer becoming a Dead Poets Society-esque teacher (skinflint Burns staffs the school with plant workers), until Verlander swoops in to whisk Homer away to his super-secret Ex Machina-styled retreat, where he‚Äôs got a scheme going involving an army of Ava-looking robot students working to get government loans. Book in some time for a handful of guest- teacher guest stars (Neil deGrasse Tyson, Suze Orman, Jeopardy champ Ken Jennings, and screenplay guru Robert McKee as themselves), and a very rushed wrap-up where Homer has to short-circuit all the Yale-enrolled robot students before they can make Verlander all that sweet, sweet student aid, and you‚Äôve got a frenetic episode that can‚Äôt decide what it wants to be.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4.5/5 stars, stating \\"Release me, you hound. I love Mr. Burns, unabashedly and bashedly. I can see what Smithers sees in him. All that power in a man so fragile he floats away on cigar smoke and so old his living will is a sword of Damocles hanging over a trap door that leads to a mote of nuclear waste. Every single line, except the 'what what what' bit, is a joy tonight. We‚Äôve come to our understanding of Burns through segmented antics at the expense of all who don‚Äôt like to pay. He is the embodiment of corporate corruption and political shenanigans. He could be his own Koch brother.\\" \\"The Caper Chase\\" scored a 0.9 rating with a 3 share and was watched by 2.13 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.

The film premiered at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival, and aired on ESPN on May 11, 2010. Produced by Hunting Lane Films, the documentary, beyond interviewing N.W.A founding member Ice Cube, interviews other music figures as well as local civic leaders, Raiders owner Al Davis, other Raiders administrators, and contemporary Raiders players, including, among others, lineman Howie Long and running back Marcus Allen. In 1982, after the NFL had blocked the Raiders' planned move from Oakland to Los Angeles, the Raiders and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum had filed an antitrust lawsuit.Dickey, Just Win, Baby. p. 168. After a mistrial, the second jury sided with the plaintiffs, clearing the Raiders' move to Los Angeles.Dickey, Just Win, Baby. p. 172. At this same time, the crack epidemic began to unfold in Los Angeles County's predominantly black communities such as South Central Los Angeles and Compton which, arguably disadvantaged by the economic policies of then-President Ronald Reagan, witnessed large increases in gang violence, illegal weapon use, and police brutality. By 1987, as Los Angeles hip hop, with its dance sounds and party raps, struck some residents as increasingly out of touch, Niggaz with Attitude (N.W.A), had begun recording what it called \\"reality rap.\\" Joining the national stage in 1988, N.W.A would favor a unified look representing its hometown area. Donning black, one of the Raiders' two colors, and Raiders ball caps, N.W.A extended the Raiders brand's reach and penetration. Ice Cube, a South Central native and Raiders fan, maintains that this backstory is crucial to understanding the Raiders franchise's interaction with Los Angeles.

Biography He was born in Cork in 1950 and was educated there. He acquired Irish at school and from sojourns in the Gaeltacht of West Kerry. He was a member of an group of poets at University College Cork in the late 1960s who chose Irish as a creative medium and were closely associated with the modernist poetry journal Innti, founded by fellow poet Michael Davitt (1950-2005). They were influenced by the work of Cork poet Se√°n √ì R√≠ord√°in, by the musician and composer Se√°n √ì Riada, and by popular American culture. Greg Delanty, writing for Poetry International, claimed that a fundamental achievement of √ì Muirthile and other members of the Innti group was to adapt the language to a contemporary urban landscape in a way that reflected the counterculture of the sixties.  Writing  √ì Muirthile has been described as a poet of immense formal and musical mastery who read deeply in the classical and neo-classical poetry of the Irish language. He studied French literature as a student and this influenced his work. He translated poetry by Guillaume Apollinaire, Fran√ßois Villon, Jacques Pr√©vert and Anne H√©bert. His first collection of poetry was Tine Chn√°mh (1984). This received the Irish American Cultural Institute‚Äôs literary award and an Oireachtas prize for poetry. He subsequently published a number of other collections. In 1996 he received the Butler Award for his novel Ar Bhruach na Laoi. Several plays by him have been staged.

Not much is known about his family or education, apart from the fact that his father was a merchant and he took over the business when his father died. He attended the National Academy of Design in the early 1840s and frequently exhibited paintings there over the next four decades. Beginning in 1846, he spent several years traveling around Europe for further informal study of art, much of it in Rome. Paintings from this period of Lake Nemi and ancient Roman ruins were praised by critics. On his return to the United States, Wotherspoon was elected an associate member of the National Academy of Design, and he became a founding member of the Artists' Fund. The painter Eliza Pratt Greatorex studied with him for a time. Wotherspoon's style was strongly influenced by the Hudson River School, and many of his earliest American landscapes were views of New Hampshire's White Mountains.

Clarke soon became a labor organizer and recruiter for the United Auto Workers union. Her first project took on disparities between the men's and women's restrooms at the plant raising concerns that the men's restroom had many more sinks for washing after shifts than the women's. The difference added to the women's workday as they waited in long lines. It was the long wait times that allowed Clarke to raise awareness and organize women to become part of the union. Her efforts organizing workers at the plant into the United Auto Workers union survived a major company re-organization from Curtiss-Wright Corporation to North American Rockwell manufacturing company. After 22 years in the aircraft industry, Clarke was the first African American woman to be elected to the executive board of the UAW local 927. In 1969, she left the industry and took a job as a clerical worker at Columbus City Hall where she was supportive of a strike among the city's sanitation workers who were part of the AFSCME Local 1632 union. After the strike, Clarke was instrumental in organizing clerical workers to join the local 1632 union, a task completed by the end of 1969. From 1980‚Äì1992 Clarke served as the secretary-treasurer of the AFSCME Local 1632 union and was a member of the AFSCME Local 1632 Chapter 108 as a retiree. John Lyall, president of AFSCME Ohio Council 8 spoke of Marie Clarke noting that \\"when we say we are standing on the shoulders of those who came before us, we‚Äôre talking about people like Marie Clarke. She knew the power of solidarity and was a great believer in direct action. Her accomplishments should inspire us all.\\" Clarke has said that ‚ÄúI have always felt that serving the public was a special kind of work.

It was built in 1883 as Browerville was springing up around a newly built railroad line. The simple wooden building with a false front contained retail space on the ground floor and a community meeting hall upstairs. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 for having local significance in the themes of commerce and exploration/settlement. It was nominated for being a highly intact example of the vernacular commercial architecture erected in Minnesota's railroad boomtowns. Description The Kahlert Mercantile Store is a two-story wood-frame building with a footprint. It has the squared-off false front typical of 19th-century rural and frontier towns. However the second floor rises a full story to accommodate the meeting hall, whereas most such buildings had a truncated upper floor. The Kahlert Store lacks any basement. The building is covered in clapboard siding broken by two-over-two sash windows. A balcony once projected from the front fa√ßade. It was removed around 1910, likely to accommodate improvements to the adjacent street or sidewalk. The only other major exterior alteration is the addition of a sliding garage door near the rear of the north wall. History The Kahlert Mercantile Store was established by brothers William and Ferdinand Kahlert. They were early settlers of Todd County who arrived in 1870, initially homesteading in Hartford Township. In 1882 the Sauk Center and Northern Railway‚Äîa subsidiary of the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway‚Äîbuilt a rail line nearby. Although mostly intended to access railroad-owned timber land, the rail line sparked the establishment of several towns along its route, including Browerville. Although a small village had been coalescing in Hartford Township, most of its business owners quickly relocated to the new trackside town, and the Kahlert brothers followed suit in 1883. Their building, at the corner of Main Street and 6th Street, used the same false- front style as most of the other early construction in Browerville. They operated a general store and grocery out of the ground floor. Despite competition from several similar stores in town, the Kahlerts prospered and even expanded into an adjacent building by 1900. Over the same period the meeting hall they'd established on the upper floor served as a popular venue for local gatherings, social events, and church services.

Early life  Robert Endean was born in December 1925 in Abermain, NSW and was raised in Abernethy. He attended Cessnock High School and won a scholarship to study at the University of Sydney taking a B.Sc. with Honours in Zoology in 1948 and a University Gold Medal. He took his M.Sc from the same in 1949, supervised by marine biologist, Professor William Dakin. He took his PhD at the University of Queensland in 1958.  Career  Endean worked as a Secretary, and later chair and president of the Great Barrier Reef Committee from 1954‚Äì75. It was during this time that the Heron Island Research Station passed to the control of the University of Queensland. Endean took up work as an Assistant Lecturer in 1950, rising to the position of Reader in 1964 at the University of Queensland. Endean's primary research was the study of the toxicology of marine organisms. particularly the crown-of-thorns starfish, acanthaster planci. He became an advocate for the environmental protection of the Reef, principally from the crown of thorns starfish, and his publications and outreach work into the impacts of the starfish on coral ecology, led to the formation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) in 1975. Endean accompanied Hans Hass on his first expedition to the Great Barrier Reef. In 1967, Endean accompanied the Belgian Scientific Expedition that conducted studies of the Great Barrier Reef. In the 1960s, Endean worked with Roche Laboratories to establish a research base at the Heron Island Research Station, and study a number of active compounds found in marine organisms for medical research. He published 160 scientific papers and books during his career. His report prepared for the Queensland government into the outbreak of the crown of thorns starfish outbreak was dismissed in 1970. A later report to the Commonwealth government was also tabled, for which Endean continued to provide research submissions. Endean was a member of the World Health Organisation's Expert Advisory Committee on Food Additives. He was Deputy Chair of the Heron Island board which oversaw the Research Station. He was a spokesperson on reef ecology, and had advised the community widely on toxins and marine pharmacology and biology. Endean retired from the University of Queensland in 1990, after 40 years of association with the Zoology Department.  Legacy  Endean died on 6 October 1997 on Heron Island, shortly before he was due to give an address at the Australian Coral Reef Society. He was survived by his partner Dr Ann Cameron with whom he worked and daughter Dr Coralie Endean. A reef was named for him ‚Äì the Bob Endean Reef off Mission Beach, Queensland.

Casa Susanna was a popular weekend destination in Jewett, NY for cross-dressing men and transgender women in the early 1960s. The bungalow camp was run by Susanna ValentiSusanna Valenti (born Tito, a name which she went by for many years) immigrated to the United States from Latin America in the mid-1940s. She wrote numerous articles for Virginia Prince's Transvestia. Susanna's time and place of death are unknown: the last known mention of her was her contribution to the 100th issue of Transvestia in 1979. and her wife Marie, who also ran a wig store in town. History Marie purchased the 150-acre property in the mid-1950s, and she and Susanna originally dubbed it Chevalier D'Eon Resort. They charged $25 for a weekend, which included food, lodging, and makeup lesson. Hidden away in the rural Catskills, Casa Susanna provided much-needed privacy to its guests in a time when publicly cross-dressing was a criminal offense. However, guests occasionally visited the town of Hunter to shop, where they were met by a range of reactions. Some were negative, but many locals saw them as reliable customers. Casa Susanna was a haven for its guests to go to and celebrate their \\"inner girl\\" without persecution. There, they could be happy and comfortable, participating in activities like gardening and Scrabble in elegant 1950s-style heels and dresses. Most guests at Casa Susanna were married and considered themselves heterosexual men who enjoyed cross-dressing, but many others later identified as transgender and lived out their lives as women, including Virginia Prince and Susanna herself. Photography for transvestites in the 1950s was both affirming and extremely dangerous. Sending negatives to a professional developer who might call the police was out of the question, so Casa Susanna appointed an official photographer from one of its own: Andrea Susan. Andrea took many photographs of her fellow guests and developed them at home. Although Polaroids were popular for their instantaneous development, Andrea's photography was of higher quality, and she could be trusted. She put the negatives in the possession of her mentor Dick, who had gifted her her photo development equipment. When Dick threw them away, they made their way to a Manhattan flea market in the mid-2000s. There, they were found by Robert Swope,Not the Robert Swope of Vagina Monologues fame. ‚Äúa gentle punk rocker turned furniture dealer,‚Äù who bought every photograph he could find and published them into a book with his partner Michel Hurst. The release of this book fifty years later led many former attendees of Casa Susanna to come forward and share their experiences, allowing the resort to be documented. Without this chance encounter, Casa Susanna may have been lost to history. Influence The book Casa Susanna which was a collection of photographs from the home inspired the Tony-nominated play Casa Valentina by Harvey Fierstein.

The 2002 Adelaide Festival had a vision markedly different from previous festivals, and intentionally moved away from the typical arts festival model used across the world. Sellars critiqued what he described as a ‚Äúshopping trolley‚Äù approach to arts festival management,Radio National Perspective where \\"exotic tidbits are brought to the table of an overstuffed population\\"The Sydney Morning Herald, pg. 15, Wednesday, April 12, 2000 i.e. a director fills the ‚Äòfestival trolley‚Äô with pre-existing work from around the world, rather than generating it locally.

This unrealistic expectation may have come from Sellar's work in American contexts where private support is much more common, whereas in Australia the mix of government, corporate and philanthropic funding is markedly different, especially in Adelaide where few major corporations have their headquarters.Caust, Jo.

A replacement ad was aired consisting of a series of written inspirational quotes about the arts, ending with a voiceover saying ‚ÄúIt doesn't matter what you think so long as you think‚Äù. Festival Program Launch Partly due to the September 11 attacks and collapse of Ansett Airlines, the festival program launch had to be pushed back from early October to October 31, 2001, which meant that Sellars would not be able to attend since he was to be in Paris at the time to direct an Opera.Caust, Jo.

The title traces its origin from the times of the Old Pahang Sultanate, and was historically known simply as Shahbandar ('harbourmaster'). The territory under the jurisdiction of the Shahbandar was the royal capital, Pekan, and its surrounding area stretching from Bebar river to Kuala Lepar, which mostly lies within the Pekan constituency. During the reign of Raja Bendahara Tun Ali, the title was renamed with the additional prefixes Orang Kaya Indera ('Mighty' or 'powerful nobleman'), thus it was later known as 'Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar'. The title is the fourth most influential among the four major chiefs, because the Shahbandar lived in the vicinity of the capital, and tended to become the monarch's minister or chief executive officer. Role Historically, the Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar was one of four major chiefs () who wielded very wide powers in Pahang. They had the authority to impose taxation, and to decide all criminal and civil cases except those which involved capital punishment. Their power was limited only by the capacity of the monarch to restrain them, which varied according to their proximity to Pekan ‚Äî the further from the court, the greater their authority. Their districts were subject to the ruler granting monopolies () on certain goods. They were obliged to appear at Pekan once a year in the month of Muharram to pay the monarch homage () and a form of tribute (). During wartime, they were required to take to the field with men, arms and food. The installation of the monarch was incomplete unless the Orang Besar Berempat assisted. The Pahang constitutional theory was that the Orang Besar Berempat and, to a lesser degree, the other chiefs were the foundation upon which the monarch's authority rested. During the time of the Johor Empire, the four major chiefs gave allegiance to the Sultan of Johor through his viceroy, the Bendahara. In time, with the sovereign being a distant figure, their allegiance tended to become more a matter of loyalty to the Bendahara personally. This became formally sealed with the establishment of the Pahang Kingdom in the late 18th century.  Titles and style  The full title and style for this peerage in the Malay language is Yang DiHormat Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar. It placed at the front of the holder's name and his other Malay styles and titles.. For example, :Yang DiHormat Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar ke-10 Tun Abdul Razak Hussein. This is different from Peerages in the United Kingdom where the title and style placed at the back of the name. The first wife of the holder will carry the full title and style ‚Äî Toh Puan Indera. Succession The titles of the Orang Besar Berempat were hereditary. When a chief died, his successor was required to make a ceremonial offering to the monarch before his appointment was approved. This usually took the shape of gold-hilted kris, but other forms of offering were permissible. If the eldest son of a deceased chief were unfit for the succession, it was proper to appoint a younger son, a brother, or a nephew to the chieftaincy. Shahbandar family The present members of the Shahbandar family claim matrilineal descent from To' Tuan, a Bugis chief who settled in Pahang about 1722, married a Pahang lady, and was said to have improved the art of silk weaving in his adopted country. The patrilineal ancestor of the family is To' Tondek, the first Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar. After the death of Ali, the seventh Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar, the title went to a non-family member Che Osman, son of Imam Perang Indera Mahkota Gendut. On Che Osman's death, the chieftaincy reverted to the old family in the person of Dato' Hussein. The incumbent titleholder is Najib Razak, who is the former Prime Minister of Malaysia.

His historical work has included several international populations and more recently has focused upon mortality in the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts. His contemporary research focus grows from his extensive work on environmental justice and environmental health issues in the United States and has most recently involved the field of social epigenetics. He and his colleague Dr. Kathleen Arcaro at UMass-Amherst, who is responsible for the breast milk project, are studying both the biochemical make-up of breast milk and epigenetic damage to breast cells, using bio-assays from a large population of nursing women along with their social history.

When she was little, she and her family moved to Plum Creek. Her mother taught Blizzard and her sister how to create art using a pit-fire method. During the Great Depression, she left school in order to be part of the National Youth Administration. She worked in a munitions factory in Bristol during World War II and after that, worked at a textile mill in Chilhowie until 1958. Blizzard had contracted black lung and lost one of her lungs. Her husband was crippled in an accident in a coal mine and eventually their marriage failed. Her husband died in 1954. Blizzard developed paranoid schizophrenia after these events and her art helped her deal with visions she saw and the feelings she needed to work through. She began making art for sale in the late 1950s and sold her pottery in her daughter, Mary's, store. In the early 1980s, her neighbor, Michael Martin, contacted a friend to take some of Blizzard's work to a gallery in Buckhead run by Judith Alexander where Jonathan Williams discovered her work. Blizzard died in Glade Springs on June 2, 2002.

It was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places on 3 January 1989. History Peter von Scholten The property was originally a copyhold (arvef√¶ste) under Christiansholm. The original Belvedere was built in 1842. The house was adapted for Peter von Scholten in 1848. He had just returned from the Danish West Indies where he had served as governor-general and emancipated slavery immediately prior to his departure from the islands on 14 July 1848. Peter von Scholten was also the owner of a property at Bredgade 45 in Copenhagen. His wife Lise died in 1949 and a few years later he moved to Altona where he lived with his daughter and son-in-law until his death in 1854. Drawing of the house by Henrik Steffens Sibbern from 1870 One of Belvedere's later owners was the financier and industrialist Isaac Wulff Heyman. He commissioned the architect Henrik Steffens Sibbern to adapt the building in 1870. The property was purchased by Ilva-founder Hans J√∏rgen Linde in 1989. The house was subsequently put through a comprehensive renovation. It received an award from Gentofte Municipality in 1994. In 2011, Belvedere was purchased by Axcel- Managing Partner Christian Frigast. Architecture The house has widen siding. It has a central projection topped by a verenda on the first floor.

The glasses and two points represent the face of Jiang Zemin. The latin letters below stand for \\"na√Øve\\", which is Jiang's quote in one of the most famous Moha videos. Moha (, ), literally \\"admiring toad\\" or \\"toad worship\\", is an internet meme spoofing Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and paramount leader. It originated among the netizens in mainland China and has become a subculture on the Chinese internet. According to another explanation, it comes from China's social media Baidu Tieba. In the culture, Jiang is nicknamed h√°, or \\"toad\\", because of his supposed resemblance to a toad. Netizens who m√≥h√° (worship the toad) call themselves \\"toad fans\\", \\"toad lovers\\" or \\"toad worshippers\\" (), or \\"mogicians\\" () which is a wordplay on (, magician) in Mandarin.See: Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese. Another nickname for Jiang is \\"elder\\" or \\"senior\\" (), because he once called himself an \\"elder\\" or \\"senior\\" when he was berating Hong Kong journalist Sharon Cheung who questioned him. A video clip recording this event spread on the internet and led to the rise of the culture, which later greatly rose in popularity around 2014, when Hong Kong was experiencing a period of political instability. Initially, netizens extracted Jiang's quotes from the video and imitated his wording and tone, for parody and insult. However, as the culture developed, some imitations have taken to carrying affection toward him. The quotes for imitation have also evolved to include what he said during his leadership, and in his personal life. The Internet meme has been censored in China.  Origins  In October 2000, Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee- hwa, went to Beijing to report to Jiang Zemin. On October 27, 2000, when Jiang Zemin and Tung Chee-hwa met with reporters before the formal talks, Hong Kong journalist Sharon Cheung questioned whether Jiang Zemin had appointed the Hong Kong Chief Executive in the election, which made Jiang Zemin angry.  Materials  Jiang Zemin The materials of moha usually come from three famous videos about Jiang called \\"Three Pieces About Toad\\" (). # In the first video, Jiang lashed out at Hong Kong journalist Sharon Cheung in Zhongnanhai when he met with Chee-hwa Tung, Chief Executive of Hong Kong at that time. Ms. Cheung asked if Jiang supported Tung's campaign for Chief Executive, which Jiang affirmed. Cheung then asked if it meant the Chinese government had already decided internally to re-appoint Tung. This made Jiang very upset, and criticized her for twisting his words to \\"make big news.\\" Jiang then continued to criticize the Hong Kong media on the whole, claiming that they need to learn to ask more meaningful questions, even stating that \\"Mike Wallace of the US is at a much higher level than you are.\\" # The second is the famous interview by American journalist Mike Wallace that Jiang referred to in the previous video. In this interview, Wallace and Jiang talked about many touchy subjects, such as democracy and dictatorship in China, freedom of the press, Falun Gong, and the Tiananmen square incident. # The third video is recorded when Jiang came back to China United Engineering Corporation (Jiang worked there for some years), and Jiang recalled his experience in the video. He also talks about Deng Xiaoping's decision to appoint him as leader of China, and what he considered his achievements during his years of leadership. There is also a heavy focus on elements of Jiang's appearance as well, in particular his very large and thick rimmed glasses, slicked back hair, high-waisted trousers, and unusually wide smile. Toad worshippers also extract some sentences from these videos for spoofing like \\"too young, too simple, sometimes naive\\" (originally in English).  Notable statements  Some most famous statements from Jiang are listed below. Note that phrases in italics were originally said in English. = Interview with the Hong Kong press = * \\"I did not say I would handpick him [Tung Chee-hwa]. You asked me if I support Mr. Tung; I said I support him.\\" * \\"Re-election will still have to follow the [Hong Kong] Basic Law, have to... Of course, our decision is very important too!\\" * \\"I feel that you journalist people still have to learn a bit! You're very familiar with those Western values, but after all, you're still too young!\\" * \\"(Mike) Wallace from America, is far better than you guys. I have talked jovially with him.\\" * \\"There is one good thing about you. Whenever things happen somewhere in the world, you'll run over there faster than the Western reporters. But all the questions you ask... too simple! Sometimes naive!\\" * \\"Pardon. As an elder, I need to tell you something. I'm not a journalist, but I've seen too much. It's necessary for me to teach (tell) you some life experiences.\\" * \\"Whenever I meet you, I want to say... There's an old saying in Chinese‚Äî'Keep silent and make a fortune.' That's the best way.\\" * \\"You people, don't want to...try to...make a big news! Saying that it's already decided internally, and then take me out for criticism. You people, naive!\\" * I'm angry! I guess I displeased you guys today. = Interview with Mike Wallace = * \\"You mean I'm a dictator?\\" * \\"Even under extreme situations, our soldiers have demonstrated restraint.\\" (referring to the Tank Man) * \\"Do you trust the Falun Gong?\\" * \\"All men are created equal.\\" = Visiting China United Engineering Corporation = * \\"This thing (book) you made for me. Excited!\\" * \\"The Politburo has decided. You will be new General Secretary! I said please find a better candidate! I'm really not being modest; I'm the mayor of Shanghai, why should I be going to Beijing?\\" * \\"Then I recited two lines of poetry: 'One should uphold his country‚Äôs interest with his life, he should not do things just to pursue his personal gains and he should not be evade responsibilities for fear of personal loss.'\\"() (poem by Lin Zexu) ** What he actually said was \\"two poems\\" (), which should be a mistake, as he then recited two lines of poetry () from the same poem. * \\"During my years in Beijing I haven't done much, just three things.\\" # Establishing a Socialist market economy. # Adding the Deng Xiaoping Theory to the constitution. # Proposing the Three Represents. *\\"If there's any other achievements, it is to forbid the army from doing business.

GRNN was suggested by D.F. Specht in 1991. GRNN can be used for regression, prediction, and classification. GRNN can also be a good solution for online dynamical systems. GRNN represents an improved technique in the neural networks based on the nonparametric regression. The idea is that every training sample will represent a mean to a radial basis neuron.https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/7779/ch2.pdf?sequence=14 Mathematical representation : Y(x) = frac{sum_{k=1}^N y_k K(x, x_k)}{sum_{k=1}^N K(x, x_k)} where: * Y(x) is the prediction value of input x * y_k is the activation weight for the pattern layer neuron at k * K(x, x_k) is the Radial basis function kernel (Gaussian kernel) as formulated below. =Gaussian Kernel= K(x, x_k) = e^{-d_k/2sigma^2}, qquad d_k = (x-x_k)^T(x-x_k) where d_k is the squared euclidean distance between the training samples x_k and the input x.  Implementation  GRNN has been implemented in many computer languages including MATLAB, R- programming language, Python (programming language) and Node.js. Neural networks (specifically Multi-layer Perceptron) can delineate non-linear patterns in data by combining with generalized linear models by considering distribution of outcomes (sightly different from original GRNN). There have been several successful developments, including Poisson regression, ordinal logistic regression, quantile regression and multinomial logistic regression that described by Fallah in 2009. Advantages and disadvantages Similar to RBFNN, GRNN has the following advantages: * Single-pass learning so no backpropagation is required. * High accuracy in the estimation since it uses Gaussian functions. * It can handle noises in the inputs. * It requires only less number of datasets. The main disadvantages of GRNN are: *Its size can be huge, which would make it computationally expensive. *There is no optimal method to improve it.

Disappearance On the night of October 18, 1949, Dorothy's husband, magistrate Jules Forstein, left home for the evening. He later called Dorothy and told her that he would not arrive home until late. When he returned home, he was very surprised to find his two children, Edward and Marcy, clinging together in a bedroom. They were both crying \\"Mommy's gone!\\" Marcy told her father that roughly 15 minutes previously, she had been woken by a noise and had gone downstairs, where she had seen a middle-aged man in a brown, peaked cap carrying her unconscious mother down the stairs over his shoulder. When she asked him what he was doing, he patted her head and told her, \\"Go back to sleep, little one. Your mom is fine.\\"Robert Nash, Jay (1977) Among The Missing, p.121, . from Marcel Dassault's account and he then left and locked the door.  Investigation  Police initially doubted Marcy's story but believed it after a psychiatrist interviewed her and confirmed she was apparently telling the truth. The theory first posited by police was that someone with a grudge against her husband due to his job had targeted her. This was seen as most likely given that five years previously, a home intruder had stolen nothing but had severely assaulted Dorothy. On this occasion, too, nothing was stolen from the house. No fingerprints were left behind by the intruder, nor were there any signs of forced entry, just as in the previous assault. A large search was conducted to find Forstein, as the police asked for a check of all unidentified women and requested reports from hospitals (including mental hospitals), hotels, morgues and convalescent homes all across the country. Captain James Kelly of Philadelphia's detective bureau sent out 10,000 notices to police departments and institutions with the description of Forstein.

In this conformer, the dihedral angle of the A‚ÄìB bond and the C‚ÄìD bond is greater than +150¬∞ or less than ‚àí150¬∞ (Figures 1 and 2). Anti-periplanar is often used in textbooks to mean strictly anti-coplanar, with an A-B C-D dihehedral angle of 180¬∞ (Figure 3). In a Newman projection, the molecule will be in a staggered arrangement with the anti-periplanar functional groups pointing up and down, 180¬∞ away from each other (see Figure 4). Figure 5 shows 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane in a sawhorse projection with chlorine and a hydrogen anti-periplanar to each other. Syn-periplanar is similar to anti-periplanar. In the syn-periplanar conformer, the A and D are on the same side of the plane of the bond, with the dihedral angle of A‚ÄìB and C‚ÄìD between +30¬∞ and ‚àí30¬∞ (see Figure 2). {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Figure 1: Functional groups A and D are anti-periplanar  Figure 2: Functional groups are considered periplanar if they have a dihedral angle less than ‚àí150¬∞ or greater than +150¬∞ or ‚àí30¬∞ to +30¬∞. Adapted from a figure by Dreamtheater published on Wikimedia Commons.  Figure 3: Representation of a strictly anti- coplanar conformation. A, B, C, and D are in the same plane and the dihedral angle between A‚ÄìB and C‚ÄìD is 180¬∞.  Figure 4: Newman projection showing A and D anti-periplanar.  Figure 5: Sawhorse projection of 2-chloro-2,3-diemthylbutane showing Cl and H anti-periplanar. }  Molecular orbitals An important factor in the antiperiplanar conformer is the interaction between molecular orbitals. Anti-periplanar geometry will put a bonding orbital and an anti-bonding orbital approximately parallel to each other, or syn-periplanar. Figure 6 is another representation of 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane (Figure 5), showing the C‚ÄìH bonding orbital, œÉC‚ÄìH, and the C‚ÄìCl anti-bonding orbital, œÉ*C‚ÄìCl, syn-periplanar. The parallel orbitals can overlap and become involved in hyperconjugation. If the bonding orbital is an electron donor and the anti-bonding orbital is an electron acceptor, then the bonding orbital will be able to donate electronegativity into the anti-bonding orbital. This filled-to-unfilled donor-acceptor interaction has an overall stabilizing effect on the molecule. However, donation from a bonding orbital into an anti-bonding orbital will also result in the weakening of both of those bonds. In Figure 6, 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane is stabilized through hyperconjugation from electron donation from œÉC-H into œÉ*C-Cl, but both C‚ÄìH and C‚ÄìCl bonds are weakened. A molecular orbital diagram shows that the mixing of œÉC‚ÄìH and œÉ*C‚ÄìCl in 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane lowers the energy of both the orbitals (Figure 7). {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Figure 6: The C‚ÄìH bonding orbital is aligned with the anti-bonding orbital of C‚ÄìCl and can donate into the anti-bonding orbital through hyperconjugation.  Figure 7: The energy of both the C‚ÄìH bonding orbital and the C‚ÄìCl anti-bonding orbital lower when they mix. }  Examples of anti-periplanar geometry in mechanisms = E2 mechanism= A bimolecular elimination reaction will occur in a molecule where the breaking carbon-hydrogen bond and the leaving group are anti-periplanar (Figure 8). This geometry is preferred because it aligns œÉC-H and œÉ*C-X orbitals. Figure 9 shows the œÉC-H orbital and the œÉ*C-X orbital parallel to each other, allowing the œÉC-H orbital to donate into the œÉ*C-X anti-bonding orbital through hyperconjugation. This serves to weaken C-H and C-X bond, both of which are broken in an E2 reaction. It also sets up the molecule to more easily move its œÉC-H electrons into a œÄC-C orbital (Figure 10). {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Figure 8: In an E2 mechanism, the breaking C‚ÄìH bond and the leaving group are often anti-periplanar. In the Figure B is a general base and X is a leaving group.  Figure 9: The C‚ÄìH bonding orbital is mixing with the C‚ÄìX anti-bonding orbital through hyperconjugation.  Figure 10: In an E2 mechanism molecules generally prefer an anti-periplanar geometry because it aligns molecular orbitals and sets up the molecule to move electrons in a C‚ÄìH bonding orbital into a œÄC-C bonding orbital. } = Pinacol rearrangement= Figure 11: Mechanism of a pinacol rearrangement. The C‚ÄìC bonding orbital is aligned with the C‚ÄìO anti-bonding orbital, which facilitates the methyl shift. H‚ÄìA is a generic acid. In the pinacol rearrangement, a methyl group is found anti- periplanar to an activated alcohol functional group. This places the œÉC‚ÄìC orbital of the methyl group parallel with the œÉ*C‚ÄìO orbital of the activated alcohol. Before the activated alcohol leaves as H2O the methyl bonding orbital donates into the C‚ÄìO antibonding orbital, weakening both bonds. This hyperconjugation facilitates the 1,2-methyl shift that occurs to remove water. See Figure 11 for the mechanism.  History, etymology, and misuse The term anti-periplanar was first coined by Klyne and Prelog in their work entitled \\"Description of steric relationships across single bonds\\", published in 1960. ‚ÄòAnti‚Äô refers to the two functional groups lying on opposite sides of the plane of the bond. ‚ÄòPeri‚Äô comes from the Greek word for ‚Äònear‚Äô and so periplanar means ‚Äúapproximately planar‚Äù. In their article ‚ÄúPeriplanar or Coplanar?‚Äù Kane and Hersh point out that many organic textbooks use anti- periplanar to mean completely anti-planar, or anti-coplanar, which is technically incorrect.

Its text is drawn from letters between English composer Benjamin Britten and his first romantic interest, Wulff Scherchen. This orchestral song cycle forms a section within Chan's larger work Voices and Instruments. The work was commissioned by Queensland Symphony Orchestra and premiered at the 2016 Brisbane Festival on 22 September 2016. Scherchen died six weeks before the concert, at the age of 96, and the concert was dedicated to his memory. Both Arts Hub and The AU Review included the song cycle in their Top Ten shows at the 2016 Brisbane Festival. It is one of 4 works shortlisted for Orchestral Work of the Year in the 2017 Art Music Awards. The work has been broadcast in its entirety twice by ABC Classic FM, in November 2016 and January 2017. A complete performance lasts approximately 40 minutes. The world premiere was performed by tenor Andrew Goodwin, saxophonist Michael Duke and the Queensland Symphony Orchestra under conductor Paul Kildea, the noted Britten biographer.  Historical background  Wulff Scherchen was a young German man, the son of the conductor Hermann Scherchen. Though they first met in Siena, Italy when Britten was 20 and Scherchen nearly 14, the romantic friendship did not begin until four years later when Scherchen had started living in Cambridge. This relationship hit a crisis when World War II broke out and Scherchen was incarcerated as an enemy alien. He was deported to a Prisoner of War camp in Canada (Camp 23). Throughout the relationship, Britten and Scherchen corresponded. \\"The one person constantly in my thoughts and on my mind without fail was you. No one else occupied my heart, my mind or my body,‚Äù wrote Scherchen to Britten in 1941. Lyle Chan discovered this story via the book and film Britten's Children by John Bridcut. Chan met Scherchen after learning that he was alive at the age of 95 and living in northern New South Wales with his wife of over 70 years under the name John Woolford, which he had assumed after his release from enemy alien internment in 1941. In 2015 Scherchen consented to have these letters turned into a song cycle. Chan theorized that Britten's own works contain a coded symbol of Scherchen, the saxophone, and so this instrument was given a solo role.

It is the first ever such panpulmonate slug to be discovered at such depths. It is the only known member of its family group. Its radular formula is 1.1.2. Physical description Adults have a body length of approximately 9 mm. The animal's head includes two pairs of tentacles, one set of labial tentacles and another set of rhinophores, both sets of which are cylindrical, solid, and taper at their tips. The eyes are located just behind the rhinophores. The animal's creeping foot is three times the width of its head and tapers to a point at the posterior of the animal. The anterior end of the foot also has a pair of propodial tentacles. The animal's head is brown, and the tentacles and foot are semi-translucent. A distinct black stripe extends from the dorsal part of the cephalic tentacles and proceeds to the end of the animal's foot. The body includes a transparent notum which is free and oval-shaped. The notum is as wide as the foot and extends well over half of the body length. Some of the internal organs can be viewed through this structure. The mantle and foot are also covered in small granular white spots. There is no shell, no gills, and no mantle cavity. The animal is able to partially retract its head beneath the notum when disturbed. Anatomy =Nervous system= The nervous system is euthyneurous. The cerebral, pleural, and pedal ganglia form the typical molluscan pre-pharyngeal nerve ring. Each cerebral ganglion connects via a broad nerve to its corresponding labial and rhinophore tentacle, though there is no rhinophore ganglion. The animal also lacks optic ganglia and accessory ganglia. Despite the presence of eyes, there appears to be no optic nerve. The pedal ganglia each send one nerve anteriorly and two posteriorly to control the foot. These ganglia are separated by a long, thin commissure and have one statocyst and statolith each, attached dorsally. It has one subintestinal ganglion, one visceral ganglion, one osphradial ganglion, two gastro- esophageal ganglia, one left parietal ganglion, and two buccal ganglia, along with the necessary commissures and connectives. =Reproductive system= The reproductive system is hermaphroditic and monaulic. The ovotestis forms an incomplete ring around the sides of the large digestive gland. The ampulla is large and tube-shaped. Phylogeny Among the most interesting results of molecular studies of this deep-sea animal are that it is closely related to mesopsammic or limnic acochlidiids, and especially the evidence of its sister- group relationship with the amphibious and terrestrial Aitengidae, despite extreme differences in habitat.

In 1857, she took in children from the Washington County Infirmary, thus organizing the first children's home in the state of Ohio. Ewing taught school in Ohio before becoming a missionary among the Choctaw. Ten years later, upon her return to Ohio, she founded a home for destitute children. Through her efforts, the Ohio Legislature passed a bill in Columbus, which entitled every county to establish a children's home. Ewing also authored a comprehensive historical report on the origin and growth of the children's home movement in Washington County. Early life and education Catherine A. Fay was born in Westboro, Massachusetts, July 18, 1822. Her parents, William (a veteran of the War of 1812) and Elizabeth (Lankton) Fay, lived comfortably. She was the seventh of eleven children, of whom all grew up and nine reached an advanced age. On her father's side, Ewing was descended from Huguenot ancestry. Through the mother's influence, the 12 children became Christians in early life. Ewing's mother was of Scotch descent, and in the long line of Christian ancestors, there were many ministers and missionaries. In 1835, the family removed to Washington County, Ohio, and settled east of Marietta, near Marietta College. The father came here both to aid the struggling college and to give his sons the benefit of its advantages. Ewing attended the Marietta Female Seminary, remaining in Marietta through her girlhood, even as her health began to decline. Career =Educator and missionary= Ewing offered herself to the American Board for Foreign Mission work among the Native Americans, who were at that time included in the field of the Board's activities. She was 18 when she left home and became a mission teacher among the Choctaw, who had been removed in 1830 from their homes in the South to Indian Territory. Her salary as a teacher was US$100 a year plus her board. For 10 years, she labored among the Choctaw, much of the time the only non-Native American among them, living beyond the nearest post office. In the fall of 1853, while working as a missionary among the Choctaw, a physician called upon Ewing and asked her to visit a poor family where the mother, a New England woman, had died leaving five small children. They had been committed to his care, and he was trying to find homes for them, their drunken father having deserted them. The physician wanted Ewing to adopt a little girl who as two years old. She took the youngest for a little while, and became deeply attached to the child, but she felt the decision was impracticable as she was a poor teacher, hundreds of miles from home. The child was then taken by a married couple. Following a drunken fight, the child was thrown down the steps of the house and killed. This affected Ewing so deeply that she became determined to have a home of her own where she could care for orphan and homeless children. To achieve this objective, she began saving every dollar possible. Eventually, however, malaria and nervous exhaustion compelled her return to Marietta. =Philanthropist= Her father, sympathizing with her purpose, assisted Ewing to some extent, so from these and other sources she gathered a modest amount from sympathetic friends, borrowed $150, till her resources amounted to $500. In 1857, she purchased of land at Moss Run, about east of Marietta, and set about building. Meanwhile, soon after her return from the missionary work, she had chanced to visit the county infirmary, and was drawn to the young children there, living in the same environment with adults. These children were often diseased and depraved, but she fell in love with them nonetheless, and determined to make for them a home. Many thought her crazy, others suspected a moneymaking scheme, some appreciated her motives and sacrifices and helped her. On 1 April 1858, in a cottage of two rooms, she received from the County Poor House, nine children, all under 10 years of age. The county agreed to pay her $1.00 a week (The Marietta Register said the sum was $0.75 a week) and half the expense of medical attendance and burial in case of death. Each child was to have a new suit of clothes when brought to her, but for all other needs she was herself to be responsible. The first few weeks were very hard ones, the trustees of the district school refusing to allow the children to attend school because they were paupers, and they were unwilling to have their own children associate with them. After a lawsuit, she obtained permission to send them to school, but the children were taunted as poorhouse children. A few months later, before the ensuing winter, she moved into the new home with 20 rooms, and the first children's home was an accomplished fact. Its cost was $2000, and in five years, $4000 had been expended on the property. She also built her own schoolhouse and engaged a teacher. After the American Civil War broke out in 1861, many soldiers' children were added to her care. Her allowance for the increased cost of living was brought up to $1.25 a week and in response to her appeal for such children, the State opened at Xenia, Ohio a home for soldiers' orphans. For 10 years, she successfully managed the home and cared for 101 needy children of Washington County. She faced problems of feeding and clothing so many, especially in war times, when prices went up and the attention of those who had helped her before was drawn away. There was also the issue of sickness when diphtheria and scarlet fever invaded the home. =Activist= But Ewing knew that the need of other counties was as great and some even greater. As early as 1862, she began an \\"agitation\\" for a State law in behalf of neglected children. She personally went to Columbus and pleaded with the Legislature. In 1864, she conferred with the commissioners about the process at the state legislature to bring about this change. The bill was presented that year but failed. In 1865, it was again presented and rejected. Finally in 1866, a bill prepared by Hon. Samuel S. Knowles of Washington County was passed, authorizing the county commissioners throughout the state to establish children's homes. So the plan which she at first thought of only as a relief to her own Children's Home became in the course of time the means of creating homes in the different counties of the state. Washington County was one of the first to act under this law, and a farm of was purchased for this purpose. When all was ready for the children's arrival, she was asked to take the superintendency of the home, in 1870. But she declined the offer as she had married by then. Personal life In 1866, at the age of 44, she married Archibald S. D. Ewing (1828-1900), who had been an adviser and assistant on her farm. After 1867, she lived quietly in Marietta, still active in good works. For many years, she taught the primary department of the Presbyterian Sunday School, and was ‚ÄúAunt Katie‚Äù to a large part of the children and young people in the upper part of the city. She was interested in the temperance cause. Though the Ewings had no natural children, Mrs. Ewing had adopted five. She died April 4, 1897, leaving her property by will to the Missionary Society of the women of Marietta but this society had a temporary existence and had disbanded at the time of the death of her husband, so by direction of the Probate Court it was divided among her brothers and sisters and their heirs.

During World War II he assisted with the development of the calutron as part of the Manhattan Project. He returned to Berkeley in 1945 to lead the construction of the cyclotron, and spent the rest of his career there. Biography Robert Lyster Thornton was born in Wootton, Bedfordshire, England, on 29 November 1908, the son of Dudley L. Thornton, a mechanical engineer, and his wife Katherine Foster. The family emigrated to Canada when his father worked for the Canadian Pacific Railroad. He entered McGill University, earning his B.Sc. in 1930 and then his Ph.D. in 1933, writing his thesis on \\"The Stark effect for krypton; Stark intensities in hydrogen and helium\\" under the supervision of John Stuart Foster, an expert on the Stark effect. His results were subsequently published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. In 1933, Thornton came to the University of California in Berkeley on a Morse Traveling Scholarship from McGill University. He joined Ernest Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory, one of nine scholars from the British Commonwealth who worked there in the 1930s. He was one of the early pioneers of the cyclotron, a group that included Bernard Kinsey, Franz Kurie, Edwin McMillan, Arthur Snell and Stanley van Voorhis. Indeed, it was in a 1935 paper he co-authored with Lawrence and McMillan that the term \\"cyclotron\\" first appeared. He later bemoaned the fact that little valuable physics was done owing to the Radiation Laboratory's preoccupation with the cyclotrons and the detectors, but he was involved in an exploration of the Oppenheimer‚ÄìPhillips process. In 1938 he married Mary Elizabeth (Betty) Edie. They had two daughters, Katherine (Katy) and Margaret (Peggy), and a son, Denis. Other universities were eager to secure cyclotron technology, and Thornton helped the University of Michigan set up one in 1935. In 1940 he left Berkeley for a position as an associate professor at Washington University at St. Louis, where he again built a cyclotron, but he returned to Berkeley in 1942 at Lawrence's request to assist with the development of the calutron. This was a device for uranium enrichment using electromagnetic separation, as part of the Manhattan Project, the effort to develop atomic bombs during World War II. He worked in Boston with Stone and Webster, and eventually became assistant director of the Process Improvement Division of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. During the war he became a naturalized US citizen. After the war ended he returned to Washington University at St. Louis, where Arthur H. Compton was building up the physics department. Compton offered Thornton directorship of the new nuclear laboratory there, but Thornton turned down the offer. He also declined an offer of directorship of the Chalk River Laboratories in Canada. Instead, he returned to Berkeley in 1945 to head the work on the new cyclotron, the completion of which had been delayed by the war. Under a special arrangement between Lawrence and Robert Gordon Sproul, the president of the University of California, Thornton was made a professor of physics at the Radiation Laboratory. In the early post-war years, the 184-inch cyclotron would be at the forefront of physics, being particularly useful in the exploration of the meson. Thornton became a regular professor at the University of California in 1948, and started teaching courses in mechanics, and electricity and magnetism. He found he enjoyed teaching. Thornton became the assistant director of the Radiation Laboratory in 1954, associate director in 1959, and associate director of program and planning in 1967. He retired in 1972, but worked part-time at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory for another ten years, after which he returned to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory as a consultant. His wife Betty died in 1974. In 1977 he married again, to Sigvor Hamre, the widow of Haakon Hamre, a professor of Scandinavian language and literature at Berkeley. He died in Berkeley on 28 September 1985. He was survived by his wife Sigvor, daughter Peggy and son Denis; his daughter Katy had died in a plane crash in 1966.

TWS believes that animals have as much right to their life as humans. TWS is working towards building the first No-kill animal shelter in Lahore. Currently they have been helping animals from different foster homes.  History  Todd's Welfare Society was started on 6 March 2016 after a heart breaking incident. A dog, later named Joanne, was shot multiple times on the face by guards in Lahore on 5 March 2016. Joanne's heartless murder shocked, Kiran Maheen, the founder of TWS, and to prevent such incidents from occurring again, TWS was formed the very next day. TWS was named in the memory of Toddy, their founders pet dog. Toddy was stolen from outside his home 7 years ago, in April 2010. He was never found.  Vision  They envision an animal friendly community; a society where stray animals are not killed; where every companion animal is spayed and neutered; where every animal and pet is treated kindly, with respect and compassion  Services  Their services include: * Animal Rescue * Animal Relocation * Animal Aid * Foster * Awareness Programs * Adoptions  Work  Since March 2016, TWS has rescued over a 200 cats, dogs, eagles and donkeys. From those rescued, over 50 have been adopted to good homes. Todd's Welfare Society has over 15 permanent members, over 30 volunteers and have steady volunteer programs with different schools (LGSi, & TNS). Over the course of 10 months (June'16 - March'17), more than 60 volunteers have worked with TWS . They have regular field visits and awareness drives with different schools (Bloomfield, City School etc.). Todd's Welfare Society's' founder, Kiran Maheen, has also been invited to different events, such as TEDx Sialkot and TEDx Lahore, to talk about her work, and to inspire people to stand up for animal rights. Apart from having a foster home in Cavalry, they have also rented new premises for another foster home in Burki, and have acquired land to start construction of their shelter.  Future aim  TWS wants to open the first, state of the art, no-kill animal shelter in Lahore. Apart from that they also want to start a massive TNR program in Punjab to decrease the population of dogs and cats and to decrease the occurrence of rabies in animals. They also want to start yearly awareness conferences and have programs in different schools and universities where they can learn more about animal rights and care.

This species was previously placed in the genus Platysticta, but recent phylogenetic studies has revealed that the genus Platysticta is actually confined to Sri Lanka. For the South Indian species, formerly known as Platysticta deccanensis, morphological and molecular analyses demonstrated that it does not belong to the Sri Lankan clade and a new genus Indosticta is erected to accommodate it. Description and habitat It is a medium sized damselfly with bluish-white face and black-capped brown eyes. Its thorax is cinnamon brown with a black mid-dorsal carina. Its wings are transparent with yellowish-red pterostigma framed in black nervures. Abdomen is dark-brown up to segment 7 and segments 8 to 9 are azure blue bordered below with black. Segment 10 is blackish-brown. Anal appendages are black. Female is similar to the male; but its thorax has a bit dark patches in the dorsum and the sides. There is a narrow ante-humeral pale blue stripe and another similar blue stripe bordering the black area of the mesepimeron. Abdomen is similar to the male; but segment 8 unmarked and segment 9 with a large oval pale blue dorso-lateral spot. It is known to occur close to Myristica swamps and streams with dense riparian vegetation. Laidlaw described it from the Kingdom of Cochin.

Only the bowl of the vessel is preserved and currently kept at the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi.  History  The chalice was a donation by King Bagrat III and his mother, Queen Gurandukht, to the new church at Bedia, which was completed in 999. The base of the vessel was subsequently lost and restored in the 16th century at the behest of Germane Chkhetidze, Metropolitan Bishop of Bedia, as mentioned in a Georgian inscription. The item was preserved in the sacristy of the Ilori Church, when the historian Dimitri Bakradze visited it in 1865 and reported the danger of its being lost. The base then again disappeared. The surviving bowl was removed to Tbilisi, in the Treasure Chamber of the Georgian State Art Museum, now Georgian National Museum, in 1930.  Description  The bowl of the Bedia vessel is 14 cm high and 14 cm in diameter; it weighs 752 g. The piece is made of one sheet of gold, with all figures and details worked in repouss√©. The entire outer surface is framed and divided into 12 segments by a continuous arcade. The figures depicted are the enthroned Christ Pantokrator and the Virgin Hodegetria on the opposite side. Between them are standing figures of ten apostles, five on each side, holding rotuli in their hands. Christ is identified by a Greek inscription and all apostles by the Georgian texts; there is no inscription associated with the Virgin. The Georgian-language inscription just below the rim, in finely carved asomtavruli script, mentions King Bagrat and Queen Gurandukht. The Bedia chalice is notable for the orderly and rhythmic composition and decorative details which are endogenously Georgian, but exhibit some stylistic affinities with the contemporary Byzantine ivory icons and enameled chalices in the Treasury of San Marco, Venice. Yet, robust monumental effect of the artwork of the Bedia chalice is unparalleled.

Earlier he served Lahore High Court as a judge from the year 2006 up to 2011. He was only son of famed chief justice of Pakistan Hamoodur Rehman. Family Identity Hon‚Äôble Mr. Justice Iqbal Hameed ur Rahman is a scion of a noble family that has its roots in the legal fraternity since pre-partition of the Indian subcontinent. He hails from a very respectable Bengali Muslim family of Patna, India. His Grand father Khan Bahadur Dr. Dawdood-Ur-Rahman MB, FRCS was of aristocratic Bengali origin and a Bangla speaking person living in Patna, India and was the first Muslim Civil Surgeon of undivided Bengal, who secured his FRCS degree from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, London. His paternal uncle, Maudood ur Rahman was a barrister, who later became a Judge of the Chief Court Calcutta. His maternal grand father late Mr. Ashraf Ali Khan was a barrister and a practicing Advocate in Calcutta High Court and was also a member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly in Calcutta and was later elected as Deputy Speaker of the said Assembly before partition. His illustrious father late Hon‚Äôble Mr. Justice Hamoodur Rahman was appointed as Advocate General of East Pakistan in 1953, from where he was elevated to the Bench as judge of the Dhaka High Court in 1954. In addition he remained as the Vice Chancellor of University of Dacca (1958-60). He was appointed as judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 1960 and was made the Chief Justice of Pakistan in 1968. His father was one of those widely respected individuals in the history of Pakistan, who through his exalted character and dedication to his country had left such imprints, which will be followed by the generations unborn, with dignity and pride. He was author of the \\"Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report\\" which inquired into the circumstances leading to the breakup of Pakistan in 1971. Besides revealing the causes of the dismemberment of Pakistan, the said report gave an honest and courageous account of the events that led to the said tragedy. He was also the Chairman of Presidential Commission on Education (1964), Chairman Law Reform Commission (1967), member United Nations Committee on Crime Prevention and Control (1972-73) and Chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology (1974-77). Early Life Hon‚Äôble Mr. Justice Iqbal Hameed ur Rahman was born in Dacca in 1956. On the elevation of his illustrious father as judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the family shifted to Lahore in 1960, where Mr. Iqbal Hameed ur Rahman started his primary education from St. Anthony High School, Lahore. After doing his Matriculation from the said institution, he joined Government College Lahore, from where he did his Intermediate in 1973 and Graduation in 1975.

After the promulgation of Provisional Constitutional Order 2007, he was asked to take oath under the PCO. Like his courageous counterparts he stood for the rule of law in order to preserve the dignity and honor of his institution and the Constitution of Pakistan and refused to take oath under the PCO. He and his counterparts were subjected to an insurmountable mental anguish but no inducement or threat could deter him from his chosen path. He sacrificed his tenure of eleven years of judgeship at the altar of truth and rule of law with such dignity that the soul of his noble father would always be proud of him. He and his brother judges in the Lahore High Court ignited such flame in the heart of this nation that not only led to a great social awakening but also bound this society with the rule of law. In 2009, an unfortunate incident happened in Gojra in which certain members of the Christian Community were burnt alive by a mob. Mr.Justice Iqbal Hameedur Rahman was entrusted with One Man Tribunal of Inquiry in respect of Gojra incident in the year 2009.

He has been a member of the Election Commission of Pakistan. After passing of the 18th Amendment and establishment of Islamabad High Court, he was elevated as the first constitutional Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court on 03.01.2011, where he served till 22 February 2013. On 24 February 2013 He was appointed to the Supreme Court of Pakistan as a Senior Judge and served as such till 24 October 2016. Resignation During his tenure as Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court, few officers were appointed in the Islamabad High Court during the period 2011 and 2012, against which in adjudicating a reference application filed by the Islamabad High Court Bar association, the Supreme Court of Pakistan had come to a categorical conclusion that judges involved in the appointments have acted \\"in complete disregard of the mandate given by the Rules framed under Article 208 of the Constitution\\" and had been involved in \\"cherry picking by deliberately ignoring merits of the candidates.\\" The IHC Bar Association has taken very serious note of this matter, consequent to which Justice Hameedur Rahman tendered his resignation by writing resignation letter in his own hand on 23 October 2016, from the office of senior Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The reason although not disclosed in the resignation letter, yet it was presumed that he has voluntarily accepted the liability, since some of the appointment was made during his tenure, although the major appointments were made thereafter during the tenure of the next Chief Justice Mr. Justice Muhammad Anwar Khan Kasi. Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan (SCBAP) President Barrister Syed Ali Zafar welcomed and appreciated the resignation of Justice Iqbal Hameed-ur-Rahman as Judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.https://dailytimes.com.pk/50166/judges- resignation-has-enhanced-scs-esteem/ Patriotism Being a Bengali speaking person, Justice Iqbal Hameedur Rahman and his father Chief Justice of Pakistan Mr. Justice Hamoodur Rahman did not support the Independence movement of Bangladesh in the year 1971, nor they opted for Bangladesh, rather remained stricter to the Patriotism for Pakistan.Due to their such patriotic attitude,the basic Bengali identity of them were practically disappeared in Pakistan and both of them are highly respected in Pakistan as patriotic Pakistani Citizen.

The Ambara church is located in the Gudauta District, Abkhazia/Georgia, on the cape of Myussera, close to the mouth of the Ambara stream. The Ambara church complex consists of a half- ruined three-nave basilica, a stone fence and remains of several additional secular structures, dated by scholars from the 8th to the 10th century. The basilica has a roughly processed ashlar stone surface, a two-storey narthex and an upper gallery on the west facade. The main nave vault bears traces of the Late Medieval reconstruction. The Ambara church is one of the tourist destinations in Abkhazia. The area is reportedly increasingly being littered.

It is named after the Georgian king Bagrat, either Bagrat III or Bagrat IV, and traditionally dated to the late 10th or 11th century. The castle stands in ruins on a hill on the left bank of the Basla (Besleti) river, in the south- eastern portion of Sukhumi, measuring 55 x 27 m in total area. The surviving structures are walls, rising to 10-12 m in height, of an oval-shape edifice with a rectangular tower guarding the entrance gateway, which shows traces of tunnels. Archaeological digs, supervised by Mikhail Trapsh in the 1950s, revealed remains of fortified structures, wine jars, jugs, glazed pottery, and other items dating from the 12th to the 14th century. The naming and dating of the castle is based on a local legend recorded in the 19th century, but architectural evidence suggests the structure can be of a later date, serving as the seat of the eristavi of Tskhumi, as Sukhumi was known in the Middle Ages. The historian Yuri Voronov also conjectured that castle might have hosted the queen-regnant Tamar of Georgia during her stays in Abkhazia in the early 13th century. It also functioned as a shelter for the local elite, including the Shervashidze family, in case of danger. In the 16th century, when the town's chief settlement moved to the west, on the right bank of the river, the castle was abandoned and left to fall in ruins. Georgia has inscribed the castle on its registry of Cultural Monuments of National Significance and reported, in 2015, its condition as in an urgent need of conservation.

The name means \\"dirty\\" in Amharic. The site is located in the southaestern part of Addis Ababa. It has been in operation for about 50 years and, in 2014, was about 36 hectares but shrinking as the result of regulation. A community of hundreds of rubbish pickers lived and worked there. They were known as \\"scratchers\\" as they typically carried a metal hook to pry open the waste which was compressed and delivered by garbage trucks. In 2016, the local authority tried to close the site and relocate dumping to a new landfill site at Sendafa but opposition by local farmers caused the rubbish collectors to move back. In March 2017, a landslide at the site killed more than 113 people, as recovery continues the death toll is expected to rise. The country announced three day-national mourning, following the incident. Communications Minister, Negeri Lencho declared that 38 males and 75 females, lost their lives in this tragic event. One resident attributed the accident to construction work, as bulldozers were levelling the site for a biogas plant. A 50 (fifty) megawatt waste-to-energy plant is being built nearby at Reppie to burn rubbish to generate electricity. Operation Dumping of waste at Koshe landfill began in 1964, prior to that year, it was an unofficial site for burning dead animals. The landfill is located in Southwest Addis Ababa within the boundaries of Nifas Silk-Lafto and Kolfe Keranio. When Koshe became active, the surrounding area was sparsely populated and beyond the municipal master plan for Addis Ababa. Though, it was the only landfill in the capital city, few documented environmental studies were conducted or published for over 40 years. Koshe is not a fenced site and has an inadequate buffer between it and other land use activities such as farming and schools, exposing many residents to environmental and health risks. In addition, the area is open to temporary and permanent scavengers. The landfill hosts about 500 scavengers who sell recovered materials from the waste to businesses and farmers. The facility is being gradually phased out and replaced by a sanitary landfill in Oromia Special Zone, as of 2014, close to 17 hectares have been closed. Part of the land has been put to use including the construction of a ring road highway, siting of a proposed recycling center and a waste to energy project. In August 2016, protesting farmers blocked the pathway to the new landfill forcing the municipal government to direct solid waste disposal back to Koshe. Hazards Koshe's unstable garbage mounds regularly experience landslides of varying degrees of severity, most of them minor. One landslide at Koshe led to the deaths of over 113 people who lived in the dump. Another landslide on the 10 June 2019 killed an elderly man.

Mid-day , a newspaper in India had revealed how the NGO had collected donations under the pretext of helping the victims, but kept all or most of the money. After the report, the organisation pledged to give the victims their money. The Mumbai Police have finally booked the founder, Ria Sharma. Ria maintained her innocence through all statements given to Mid-day and after further investigation by online media agency, The Logical Indian, it was found that the newspapers facts didn't add up. https://thelogicalindian.com/fact-check/make-love-not-scars/ . Ria finally released a statement on her official Facebook handle with evidence of the newspapers unfactual reporting. Her post received tremendous online support which led to Mid-day wanting to mediate. https://www.facebook.com/ria13sharma/posts/10156278311842990?tn=K-R Ria's side of the story was then published by DNA newspaper shedding further light on Mid-days reporting https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-acid-attack- activist-ria-sharma-accuses-paper-of-biased-reporting-after-getting-booked- for-duping-acid-attack-victims-2592485 In June of 2018, the Mumbai police filed a closure report in Ria's case and exonerated her of all charges. The closure report further confirmed that she was falsely implicated and it is yet to be determined if Sharma will press charges of her own.

Its purpose was to promote the development of public libraries in rural areas through federal funding. It was passed by the 84th U.S. Congressional session as the H.R. 2840 bill, which the 34th President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law on June 19, 1956. To receive funding, states needed to submit a plan to the Commissioner of Education that demonstrated how the funds would be used, whether for library personnel, books, or equipment. Thus, making state and local governments prioritize the improvement of their libraries while also establishing their own initiatives and objectives. Since federal government was not favorably looked upon at the time, the law stated multiple times the state‚Äôs authority regarding any decisions toward the library‚Äôs goals, management, or collection. However, up until 1961, Indiana was the only state that did not accept federal funds. Governor Harold Handley believed that by accepting the funds, ‚ÄúHoosiers would be brainwashed with books handpicked by the Washington bureaucrats.‚Äù U.S. Representative John Brademas of Indiana vehemently disagreed. It was reported that Gov. Handley rejected approximately $700,000 to improve the library services. Overall, the LSA had a major positive impact on libraries throughout the rest of the country. And additional 5 million books and other informational and educational materials were secured for rural communities. Many libraries noted a 40% or more increase in book circulation as well, along with a 32% increase in interlibrary loans. Other accomplishments included 288 bookmobiles for rural communities and 800 new library staff members. Multitype and public library systems were being established due to the LSA as well. And when the Library Services and Construction Act became effective in 1964, the formation of regional and statewide library networks continued to grow. The LSA was set to expire in 1961, but plans were already in motion to prolong the act. On May 26, 1960, the Senate passed a five-year extension without a single opposing vote. Only a few years later, the Library Services and Construction Act would be introduced replacing the Library Services Act.

He won the Mavericks Big Wave Surf contest in 2009. In March 2017 he completed the first solo, unsupported stand- up paddle board (SUP) crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. He did it while supporting charitable organizations. He has also set other SUP world records. His efforts moved an obscure sport onto the forefront of many important media outlets. Background In February 2010, Bertish competed at the 2009/10 Mavericks Surf Contest near Half Moon Bay, Northern California, winning the $50,000 big-wave surf competition. Watched by 50,000 spectators, the contestants experienced waves in excess of . Bertish arrived at the competition without his equipment and had to borrow a board to compete. In 2016, a failed attempt at crossing the Atlantic on a stand-up paddleboard occurred. The boat was piloted by Nicholas Jarossay, a French citizen who was rescued a week into his trip. Solo Atlantic crossing In a 93-day trek, Bertish successfully completed a solo, unassisted and unaided crossing of the Atlantic Ocean on a stand up paddle board, going from Morocco to Antigua. The feat was the culmination of five years of preparation. On 6 December 2016, Bertish set out from a marina in Agadir, Morocco, in a custom-built stand-up paddle craft on a journey of and 120 days across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean island of Anegada in the British Virgin Islands. His $120,000 craft was designed by Phil Morrison, a naval architect, and resembles a connected row-boat and a stand-up paddle board, called ImpiFish. It weighed , which Bertish now considers to have been \\"too light.\\" It had a \\"number of technological amenities such as a satellite phone, a radar device, a MacBook, a water maker\\" carrying the amount of fresh water he needed was impractical. On 9 March 2017, he arrived in Antigua at English Harbour becoming the first person to cross the Atlantic on a stand-up paddle board. He made the journey unsupported and unassisted in 93 days. Initially he wanted to continue to Florida, but due to forecasted poor weather made his landfall in Antigua. The craft was self-righting if it capsized, avoiding the possibility of turtling. Gear included a life raft, flares, and an emergency grab bag. An integral part of maintaining stability in adverse weather was the use of sea anchors. Bertish averaged a day, surpassing his planned daily. Paddling was mainly done at night to avoid sun exposure. The attempt was made in order to raise money for several South African charities to feed, school and provide medical operations for children and succeeded in raising $412,000. The charities include Signature of Hope Trust, the Lunchbox Foundation and Operation Smile. The attempt had been sponsored by the financial group Carrick Wealth. In addition to gaining the Guinness World Record for being the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a stand-up paddle board, Bertish also set another world record during the attempt by travelling the furthest distance solo, unsupported and unassisted over open ocean in a day of . In fact, he set at least three world records during the crossing; and promised to pay for a charitable surgery for each of them. Adventurer Previously he completed a 3¬Ω-day paddle and a \\"source to sea\\" run-paddle-bike descent of the Thames River, with an English Channel SUP bonus crossing. Unofficially and off the South African coast, he set the world record for 12-hour open ocean paddling, covering almost aided by \\"great downwind conditions.\\" The previous record was held by an American. Honours Bertish has been chosen, as one of 100 visionary people, to contributed a 250 word essay to be included in a 3D book. The 3D book will be designed by artist Ron Arad and will be a world first and printed in zero gravity. Called, Genius: 100 Visions of the Future, it is organised by the Albert Einstein Foundation Initiative for the Inspired by Einstein Project.

Legislative status  According to the law, all pension payments are made from the Pension Fund of Ukraine. The Pension Fund of Ukraine monitors the target use of funds that go to payouts. The Pension Fund of Ukraine shall, in accordance with the established procedure, submit proposals to the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy of Ukraine on the issues of formation of the state pension policy and control the implementation of official legislative acts. Activities of the Pension Fund of Ukraine are subordinated and coordinated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine through the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine.  Pension reform  The implementation of pension reform proceeds through the gradual introduction of a three-tier pension system: * The first tier is a Solidarity system * The send tier is Mandatory Accumulation System * The third tier is Voluntary Non- State Pension Savings System The main objectives of the pension reform are: * to raise the living standards of pensioners; * to establish the dependence of the size of pensions on the numbers such as earnings and length of service; * to ensure the financial stability of the pension system; * to encourage citizens to save money on old age; * to create a more efficient and effective system of administrative management in pension provision. The three-tier pension system will allow the distribution of the three components of the risk associated with changes in the demographic situation (which is more sensitive to the solidarity system) and fluctuations in the economy and in the capital market (which is more experienced by the accumulation system).

History  The station opened on 28 August 1841 by the Blyth, Seghill and Percy Main Railway. The station was situated on the A190 Station Road, south of the level crossing. After the footbridge subsided in 1940 due to a wartime barricade, all of the trains used the down platform. The principal goods traffic was bricks; this ceased in 1963. The station was closed to passengers on 27 June 1964 and closed completely on 7 June 1965. Reopening proposals There have been proposals to reintroduce passenger services to part of the former Blyth and Tyne Railway system since the 1990s; Denis Murphy, the then Labour MP for Wansbeck, expressed support in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate in April 1999 and again in a debate in January 2007. The Railway Development Society (renamed Railfuture in 2000) also endorsed the proposal in 1998. Later, in 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£34 million proposal to restore passenger services from to . In the early 2010s, Northumberland County Council (NCC) became interested in the reintroduction of passenger services onto remaining freight-only sections of the network. In June 2013 NCC commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme. The GRIP 1 study was received by NCC in March 2014 and in June 2015 they initiated a more detailed GRIP 2 Feasibility Study at a cost of ¬£850,000. The GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between Newcastle, Ashington and possibly a new terminus to the east, at , was feasible and could provide economic benefits of ¬£70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034. The study suggested that due to the short distance between the former stations at Seaton Delaval and only one, rather than both, of them should be reopened. At the time it was suggested that, subject to funding being raised for the ¬£191 million scheme, detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021 though by October 2018 such works were yet to begin. After receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC initially announced that they were preceding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail but such a report was not commissioned at the time. Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to work towards the reintroduction of a passenger service onto the line, encouraged by the Department for Transport's November 2017 report, A Strategic Vision for Rail, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. Consequentially, NCC commissioned a further interim study in November 2017 (dubbed GRIP 2B) to determine whether high costs and long timescales identified in the GRIP 2 Study could be reduced by reducing the initial scope of the project but the report failed to deliver on this. The county council has, however, continued to develop the project, announcing an additional ¬£3.46 million in funding for a further business case and detailed design study (equivalent to GRIP 3) to be completed by the end of 2019, with the first passenger services potentially being introduced on the line in 2022. However, the revised proposals, released in July 2019, are reduced in scope from the plan considered in the 2016 GRIP 2 study and propose 4-phase project to reduce the initial cost of the scheme. The revised plans appear to suggest that Seaton Delaval, rather than Seghill, has been selected for reopening but even on its own, Seaton Delaval has been excluded from the initial ¬£90 million phase and is instead proposed as part of Phase 2 of the project. In Phase 4 it is proposed to add a passing loop in the vicinity of the station. The North East Joint Transport Committee's bid for ¬£377 million of funding from the UK Government's ¬£1.28 billion Transfroming Cities Fund, submitted on 20 June 2019, includes ¬£99 million to fund the first phase of the Newcastle to Ashington Northumberland Line project, while further work is ongoing to secure additional public and private investment.

The main nave is lit through three windows in the southern wall and with one window, each on the western wall and in the altar. The church have many common architectural features with similar basilicas in eastern Georgia. The church was completely reconstructed in 1902 at the behest of Princess Eugenia Maximilianovna of Leuchtenberg, wife of Duke Alexander Petrovich of Oldenburg, a member of the Russian imperial family, who turned Gagra into a spa. On 9 January 1903 it was consecrated as the Church of Saint Hypatius. At the same time, the old fortress of Abaata was demolished to pave way to the construction of a hotel. In the Soviet era, the church building was used as a museum of old weaponry. The church underwent some renovation in 2007 and it was restored to Christian use in 2012.

The Kamani Monastery is located at the village of Kamani in Abkhazia/Georgia, north of Sukhumi. The monastery building is a 1980s construction on the foundations of a medieval church. The locale of Kamani, also known as Komani, is associated in the local Abkhaz-Georgian legends with Saint John Chrysostom, who allegedly died there after being exiled from Constantinople to the Black Sea coast. In 1884, the Greek scholar Konstantinos Vrissis visited the area and conjectured that it was Kamani, not Comana Pontica, where John Chrysostom died and was initially buried. Only the foundation survived of a medieval stone monastic building, a hall church design without a protruding apse. In the 1880s, under the Russian rule, a Christian convent was founded there, but it fell in disuse with the arrival of the Soviet power in the region. In the late 1980s, the church was rebuilt through the efforts of the Abkhaz Yuri Anua. In 1990, Ilia II, Catholicos Patriarch of Georgia, consecrated the church. In July 1993, during the War in Abkhazia, the monastery was stormed by the Abkhaz separatist forces; Yuri Anua and the Georgian priest Andria Kurashvili were killed. In 2001, a group of Abkhaz monks returned to the Kamani monastery, which was transferred by the Sukhumi government, in 2011, in possession of the self-proclaimed Abkhazian Orthodox Church.

However, the plan was realised around the 1780s by Diwan Purnaiah when working for Tipu Sultan. A monarchy of Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar IX was in place during the period, after whom Chamarajapuram is named.

History  The Tsebelda fortress is an architectural complex consisting of ruined towers, Christian chapels, a palace, necropolis, and several other structures. It is erected on two cliffs more than 400 m high above the Kodori river gorge. The extant structures at Tsebelda are identified with the Tsibilium/Tzibile of the Classical authors, such as Procopius of Caesarea. It appears to have been a chief fortress in Apsilia, a vassal principality of the Lazic kingdom in the 6th century. The fortress dominated the confluence of three major routes from the northern Eurasian steppe on their way to the Black Sea. Around 550, during the Lazic War, the Laz notable Terdetes betrayed his king Gubazes and handed the fortress of Tzibile over to the Persians. The Apsilians retook the fort, but refused to accept Lazic rule until persuaded to do so by the Byzantine general John Guzes.  Current state  The law of Georgia treats the monument as part of cultural heritage in the occupied territories. In January 2017, Georgia, followed by the United States Mission to the OSCE, accused the Russian military of having put the historical site of Tsebelda under risk of destruction after a nearby located 19th-century Polish cemetery and a church were demolished in order to build a shooting range. Officials from breakaway Abkhazia confirmed the damage during a firing range construction but did not elaborate further details. The Russian Defense Ministry denied any involvement.

History  The church is dedicated to St. Simon the Canaanite, who, according to the 11th-century Georgian Chronicles, preached Christianity in Abkhazia and Egrisi and died and was buried at the town of Nicopsia, to the north of Abkhazia. A nearby grotto is associated by popular legends with the site of martyrdom of St. Simon. The church before the 1880s reconstruction The design of the extant church dates to the 9th or 10th century and is influenced by the Byzantine and Georgian art traditions, but the church site seems to be two centuries older. At the time when the Georgian historian Dimitri Bakradze visited it in the 1850s, the church was abandoned, but still standing except for the collapsed dome. The church suffered greatly when the local landlord, Major Hasan Margani removed its blocks of stone for the construction of his own mansion. Later, in the 1880s, the church was reconstructed, using blocks of white hewn stone, to its current state. The church is adorned with images of Christian symbols such as a fish, lion, and cross curved in relief. Current condition Georgia has inscribed the church on its list of cultural heritage and treats it as part of cultural heritage in the Russian-occupied territories with no known current state of condition.

Career Arnestad studied violin at the Music Conservatory in Oslo, and also studied in France, Germany, Holland and Belgium. In addition to conventional compositional studies, Arnestad also studied African and Oriental music styles. Arnestad‚Äôs compositional output is characterized by strong expressionistic traits with works that feature fragments of neo-classical ideals as well as serialism. His primary compositional focus was acoustics and exploration of harmonic structure and polarity. Studying acoustic theory, Arnestad developed a tonal system based on interference notes. Within this system, tones that are part of an interference-timbre are considered as consonant harmony, and those that are not are viewed as dissonant. The interference-timbre sound serves as structured, solid harmonies, as points of rest and calm in polyphonic development, while the dissonant harmonies are treated as dependent and disquieting. Orchestral works constitute a considerable portion of Arnestad's compositional output. Arnestad was also active as an orchestrator, and his treatment of timbre in the pivotal work INRI (1952‚Äì58) has been characterized as almost brutally expressionistic. One of Arnestad‚Äôs most widely recognized orchestral works is Aria Appassionata (1962), a work in which interference- tonality is combined with twelve-tone technique to form an emotionally-charged tonal language. Additional key works in Arnestad‚Äôs output includes his violin concerto from 1962, and \\"Suite i gamle danserytmer\\" (1966), which is based on \\"The Blacksmith and the Baker\\" for baritone and chamber orchestra, with libretto by Johan Herman Wessel. Arnestad has also composed works for chamber orchestra, voice and piano. Arnestad served as a member of the Norwegian Society of Composers‚Äô advisory board from 1974 to 1979 and was a member of the same organisation‚Äôs scholarship committee from 1971 to 1981.

It called for a repeal of the Eight Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, which bans abortion in nearly all cases, by recognising \\"the right to life of the unborn\\". The protest was organised by Strike 4 Repeal, an ad-hoc, non-affiliated group of activists, academics, artists and trade unionists organising for abortion rights in Ireland. The main march was in Dublin, with 10,000 people on O'Connell Bridge, and later many outside other government buildings. Despite the name \\"strike\\" some people took paid holidays that day. There were also protests in Galway, Limerick, Cork & other cities & towns around Ireland. A protest was also held outside the Irish Embassy in London. It was inspired by a similar Black Protest in Poland several months earlier, which itself was inspired by the 1975 Icelandic women's strike. The march, and repeal movement, was criticised by some anti-abortion writers. Some participants thought the coverage of the event on RT√â, Ireland's national broadcaster, was insufficient, and organised a follow-up picket of RT√â studios. In 2016, the Irish government convened a Citizens' Assembly to make non-binding recommendations on this constitutional ban on abortion, and it was still deliberating on the day of the protest. the Assembly hasn't finished its work. The protest also took place as details about the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam were being revealed, with some posters referencing those events.

Keppel, a criminology professor at the University of Washington, is approached by Detective Dave Reichert to help profile a serial killer preying on prostitutes in the Seattle, Washington area. Keppel agrees over the objections of his wife Sande, who is tired of him spending more time with crime scene investigations than with her. Keppel receives a letter from serial killer Ted Bundy, whom Keppel had helped send to death row, offering to \\"consult\\" on the case. Keppel conducts a series of interviews with Bundy under the guise of wanting his expertise. In reality, he is hoping that Bundy will reveal details of his own murders before he is executed. Bundy is little help in profiling the killer, whom he dubs \\"The Riverman\\", but he does shed light on his own pathology, particularly his need to \\"possess\\" his victims, even to the point of necrophilia. Finally, Bundy confesses to several unsolved murders in the vain hope that Keppel will delay his execution. Meanwhile, Keppel and Reichert question a suspect, Gary Ridgway, and take a DNA sample.

The given name \\"Deane\\" refers to the family connection with the Deanes of Guiting Power, Gloucestershire.G. Lipscomb, The History and Antiquities of the County of Buckinghamshire (J. & W. Robins, London 1847), II, p. 579, mentions the tomb at Buckingham of Anne, widow of Edward Deane of Pinnock (Temple Guiting, Gloucestershire) and her daughter Jane (died 1670), late the wife of Stephen Monteage, Merchant.The old D.N.B. articles on Stephen Monteage, vol. 38, and Stephen Poyntz disagree as to whether Jane Deane was the wife or the mother of Stephen Monteage (d. 1687) - whose birth mother was Anne Mehoult. John Monteage's will of 1724 includes bequests to his nephew Stephen Poyntz, to Stephen's brothers William, Deane and Joseph Poyntz, and to his sister Hannah Poyntz: John's principal heir and executor was Stephen Monteage the younger, son of Deane Monteage. Stephen Poyntz was educated at Eton College, a king's scholar and in 1702 captain of Montem. On 17 February 1703 he was admitted to King's College, Cambridge, and became in due course a Fellow there, graduating B.A. in 1706, and M.A. in 1711. Diplomat Shortly after he left college, Poyntz travelled with William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire; and he was also tutor to the sons of Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend, with whom he was at The Hague in 1709 and 1710. He acted as Townshend's confidential secretary, communicating on his behalf with the English ambassadors abroad, and, through his chief's influence, he moved into the diplomatic service. Poyntz was commissary in 1716 to James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope, the Secretary of State. Poyntz was made envoy-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Sweden in July 1724. Sir Robert Walpole complained about sums he drew from the Exchequer to secure Sweden's support, but he managed to defend the reputation of Sir John Norris against accusations going back to the Great Northern War. In 1728 he was sent as commissioner to the Congress of Soissons, where he made the acquaintance of George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, and he remained in France until the summer of 1730. He obtained the French agreement to dismantle the fortifications at Dunkirk, regarded as a deft diplomatic coup as well as a political triumph for the Whigs in London. Courtier On the formation of the household of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, second son of George II, Poyntz was appointed as the young Duke's governor and steward of the household. He continued as a trusted adviser. About 1735 he purchased from the Hillersdon family an estate at Midgham in the parish of Thatcham, near Newbury, Berkshire; the Duke spent some of his early years there. Poyntz played a significant part at court. He acted in 1734 as the medium of communication between the king and queen and an Austrian envoy. It was in his rooms at St James's Palace that Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough in 1735 acknowledged that Anastasia Robinson was his wife. In 1735 Poyntz was created a privy councillor and received a sinecure post. Associations and death Poyntz was a friend of Samuel Richardson the novelist, a patron of James Ferguson the astronomer, and helped the scholar Elizabeth Elstob by a recommendation of support to the Queen. He died at Midgham on 17 December 1750, and was buried there. Works Poyntz was the author of the long and anonymous Vindication of the Barrier Treaty (1712). It was a work praised at the time. Family Poyntz married, in February 1732‚Äì3, Anna Maria Mordaunt, daughter of the Hon. Lewis Mordaunt, brigadier-general, and maid of honour to Queen Caroline of Ansbach. She had been a great beauty, addressed by Samuel Croxall in his poem The Fair Circassian. They had two sons‚ÄîWilliam of Midgham (d. 1809), and Charles, prebendary of Durham‚Äîand three daughters, Margaret Georgina, Louisa, and Sophia. Louisa died unmarried. Sophia married Sir Roger Martin.https://books.google.com/books?id=yZhcAAAAcAAJ&pg;=PT8&lpg;=PT8&dq;=anna+maria+mordaunt&source;=bl&ots;=JwbTBxutH1&sig;=ACfU3U17FhO2uQtw- YVrO50jDzzIslfeew&hl;=en&ppis;=_c&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiNu7PByqboAhWpiOAKHS4wBhw4FBDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q;=anna%20maria%20mordaunt&f;=false Margaret Georgina became the wife, at Althorp, on 27 December 1755 (the day after he came of age), of the future John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer. Anna Poyntz was in great favour at Versailles in August 1763, when she cured Madame Victoire of the stone. She died at Midgham on 14 November 1771, and was buried there.

While an estimated 10% of the population of Mexico is indigenous, it is the least represented in higher education. According to estimates, only between 1% and 3% of higher education enrollment in Mexico is indigenous. In response to this inequality, the General Coordination for Intercultural and Bilingual Education at the Ministry of Education established Intercultural Universities with the active participation of indigenous organizations and academic institutions in each region. These institutions are located in densely indigenous areas and, though they allow for diversity in enrollment, they are especially intended for the indigenous population. Founded on the principle of intercultural education, they aim to foster dialogue between different cultures and represent a way of responding to both the historical and more recent demands of indigenous peoples. In congruence with the recognition of diversity, Intercultural Universities do not propose a fixed approach to their educational activities. While assuring the respect of some basic principles, each university defines its curriculum according to the needs and potentials of the region in which it is located. Students are engaged in activities that relate them to the surrounding communities through research and development projects, with the aim of working and contributing to the development of their territory, their people and their culture. Twelve Intercultural Universities are currently operating with a total enrollment of approximately 7,000 students and a high proportion of female students. Despite the challenges of financing, of students' living conditions and of political vulnerability that these universities face, they represent an important contribution to the achievement of educational equity.

A claim having been paid, the assured's rights of claim will be subrogated to the insurer, who may consider proceeding against a party who has caused the damage.

For instance, if the charterer exceeds laytime, demurrage will have to be paid; and if the charterer cannot comply with a Notice of Readiness (NOR), the shipowner may repudiate (cancel) the contract of carriage and claim damages for any loss.Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbHThe Mihalis Angelos Carriage conventions In most contracts of carriage the carrier has greater bargaining power than the shipper, and in the 19th century English judges developed rules to protect the weaker parties.M'Andrew v Adams (1834) 1 Bing NC 29 Beginning with the Hague Rules, the various conventions set out to codify and develop such common law principles by providing an international set of basic standards to be met by the carrier, with a view to establishing a universal framework of legal rights and duties. In practice, however, the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on a wide array of exemptions from liability ...such as \\"Act of God\\", \\"Perils of the Sea\\" and \\"negligence in navigation or management of the ship\\").e.g. Hague-Visby Rules Art. IV (1) & (2)Principles of the Carriage of Goods by Sea -Paul Todd Also, whereas up until about 1885,The Glenfruin (1885) 10 PD 103 the carrier's duties were deemed to be strict, by 1905 the duty became one of \\"reasonable care\\" or \\"due diligence\\" only.McFadden v Blue Star Line [1905] 1 KB 697 The Hague Rules of 1924 effectively codified, albeit in a diluted form, the English common law rules to protect the cargo owner against exploitation by the carrier. Nearly 50 years later, the Hague-Visby \\"update\\" made few changes, so that the newer Rules still applied only to \\"tackle to tackle\\" carriage (i.e. carriage by sea) and the container revolution of the 1950s was virtually ignored. The Hague-Visby Rules both excluded cabotage carriage, and declared that deck cargo and live animals were not to be considered as \\"goods\\" (although the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 provided that cabotage, deck cargo and live animals are to be covered in English contracts). The enormous list of exemptions to liability in Article IV made the Rules seem biased in favour of the carrier. As a result, The United Nations produced its own Hamburg Rules which were both more modern and fairer to cargo-owners; but while these have been enthusiastically adopted by developing nations, the wealthier ship-owning nations have stuck to Hague- Visby. In 2008 the final text of the Rotterdam Rules was agreed at UNCITRAL. UNCITRAL: United Nations Commission of International Trade Law. These Rules are very extensive, with over 90 Articles against 11 in Hague-Visby. Although the Rotterdam Rules are up-to-date and address multimodal carriage, they have, nine years later, yet to be in force. It now seems doubtful that the Rotterdam Rules will ever be adopted, but there is a slim possibility that a cut-down version of the Rules (\\"Rotterdam Lite\\") might find favour. China has effectively adopted the Hague Rules. The USA, which tends to shun conventions and instead rely on homespun legislation, has its own statutes. These comprise the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (a mildly updated version of the Hague Rules for goods in foreign commerce), and the Harter Act (for mostly domestic carriage).Lexolology report Relevant statutes and sources * Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 - UK * Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 - UK * Carriage of Goods by Sea Act - (USA) * Harter Act - USA References International trade law * International law ","title":"Law of carriage of goods by sea"},{"id":"53470842","text":"Lt Col John Du Plessis Langrishe FRSE DSO (11 September 1883‚Äì28 February 1947) was a British physician, soldier and landowner.

It is located at a distance of circa 60 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 5643 is about 100,000 light years across. NGC 5643 has an active galactic nucleus and is a type II Seyfert galaxy.  Observation history  The galaxy was first reported by James Dunlop on May 10, 1826 with his 9-inch reflector telescope and described it as exceedingly faint. The galaxy was also spotted by John Herschel and added it in the General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters as number 3572. The galaxy is located only 15 degrees from the galactic plane.  Structure  NGC 5643 is a grand design spiral galaxy, with two well-defined, symmetric arms. In the circumnuclear region are present and other dust spirals, but the two main dust arms are wider. The galaxy is seen nearly face on, at an inclination of ‚àº 27¬∞. = Active galactic nucleus = ALMA and VLT. The galaxy has a low- luminosity active galactic nucleus of Seyfert 2 type and is also a luminous infrared galaxy. The galaxy has a double sided diffuse radiojet. The galaxy exhibits an extended emission line region elongated in a direction close to the radio position angle of 87¬∞¬±3¬∞. Chris Simpson et al. analysed images takes from WFPC2 camera of the Hubble Space Telescope in [O III] Œª5007 and HŒ± and found emission extending eastward for at least 1.8 kpc and in the [O III]/HŒ± map a well-defined V-shaped structure that they identified as the projection of a tridimensional ionisation cone, which shares the same axis with the radio emission. A dust lanes perpendicular to this axis obstructs the nucleus from direct view. A disk of material was found when the data cubes of VLT were analysed. It is aligned with the nucleus and circles it and it possibly provides gas to the active galactic nucleus. The mass of the supermassive black hole has been estimated based on the galaxy stellar velocity dispersion to be 106.4 M‚äô. It has been proposed that the gas outflow has led to star formation on two locations on the bar of the galaxy which lie at the location where the gas from the nucleus encounters the dense material of the bar. Via observations of the galaxy from XMM Newton telescope in 2009, the galaxy is found to be a Compton‚Äìthick active galactic nucleus. Also the galaxy emits soft X-rays, mainly from photoionized matter. The prensence of the compton- thick column which obstructs the nucleus was confirmed from observations by NuSTAR. = Ultraluminous X-ray source = In 2004, Guainazzi et al. detected in the images from XMM-Newton an ultraluminous X-ray source, named NGC 5643 ULX1, located within 0.8 arcminutes from the nucleus. The source outshone the nucleus in X-rays and if it is located within NGC 5643 its luminosity is over 1040 erg/s. Its luminosity is variable.

Supernovae  NGC 5643 has been home of two supernovae, SN 2013aa and SN 2017cbv. SN 2013aa was discovered by Stuart Parker from New Zealand on a 30-s unfiltered CCD image taken on 13.621 UT February 2013, as part of the Backyard Observatory Supernova Search, at magnitude 11.9.

History  The Willy-Brandt House opened on 18 December 2007, on what would have been Willy Brandt's 94th birthday, in his home town of L√ºbeck. The establishment of a memorial in Willy Brandt's hometown was suggested by G√ºnter Grass, Nobel Prize laureate for literature, who had maintained political ties to him since the 1960s. The city of L√ºbeck provided a patrician house in need of restoration on K√∂nigstra√üe 21 for the museum. It was an assembly house of the Zirkelgesellschaft, a fraternity of long-distance merchants, before it became the seat of the Supreme Court of the Four Free Cities (Bremen, Hamburg, Frankfurt am Main and L√ºbeck) in the 19th century. It was later used as the State Archive of the Hanseatic city as well as a public library. After years of vacancy, the cost of renovating, converting and furnishing the building came to a sum of 3.8 million euros. The federal republic contributed 2.8 million euros and the German Foundation for Monument Protection contributed one million euros.Josephine von Zastrow: Die Willy- Brandt-Gala ‚Äì Ein Festtag f√ºr L√ºbeck.

As a reporter, he attended the Nuremberg Trials, after which he recognized the difficulties Germany faced after the war. His time as the governing mayor of Berlin saw events such as the Berlin ultimatum, the building of the Berlin wall, Kennedy's visit and the step-by-step policy. As a foreign minister and afterwards Chancellor, Brandt followed Ostpolitik, a policy of building relationships with Eastern bloc countries, and called for European unification. A smaller exhibition room shows election campaign posters from 1972, the so-called Willy-Wahl which Brandt won by a landslide victory. In the final, largest room of the exhibition, international themes are presented: Willy Brandt's \\"global commitment\\" for the resolution of North-South disparities, the promotion of peace and freedom, and the assertion of human rights.

Poland has an embassy in Hanoi and Vietnam has an embassy in Warsaw. The relationship between these two nations can be described as special because they both share historical parallels, although they are very culturally different from one another and they are geographically very far apart. Both Poland and Vietnam have had a long history of struggles against powerful foreign invaders such as Russia and China. These shared historical struggles are mentioned in the Vietnamese poem My dear, Poland My dear, Poland, Le Van Hieu (in Vietnamese) by the Vietnamese poet T·ªë H·ªØu. History Embassy of Vietnam in Warsaw While the two nations have little in common due to their geographical positions, they undeniably share historical parallels. Poland and Vietnam are the most ancient nations in Europe and Asia, respectively. More importantly, both Poland and Vietnam were given credit for having repelled the invasions from two of the most powerful empires in history; Poland repelled the invasion from the Ottoman Empire and Vietnam repelled the invasion from the Mongol Empire. It could be said that Poland saved Europe from the threats of Ottoman Empire and Vietnam saved Southeast Asia from the threats of Mongol Empire. Also, both nations have contributed to producing some of the most popular, charismatic and revered national heroes in their respective histories. Poland produced such national heroes as John III Sobieski, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, J√≥zef Poniatowski, Witold Pilecki, Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, Casimir Pulaski, Witold Urbanowicz, Pope John Paul II; whereas Vietnam has Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn, Tr·∫ßn H∆∞ng ƒê·∫°o, V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p, Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u, Tr∆∞ng Sisters, Nguy·ªÖn An, L√Ω Long T∆∞·ªùng. Some of these figures are also revered outside their nations. For example, Urbanowicz is popular in Britain. Pulaski and Ko≈õciuszko are revered in the U.S. L√Ω Long T∆∞·ªùng is a well-known figure in Korea and Nguy·ªÖn An is well-known in China. Both nations also share some commonalities in how brutally they were treated by the foreign powers. In their long historical struggles for independence, the Poles and the Vietnamese both had to fight many powerful invaders. Usually, Poland and Vietnam had to fight Russia and China, respectively, and they both very often had to suffer destruction and devastation. In the recent history both nations were also occupied by strong powerful nations. Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, whereas Vietnam was occupied by Vichy France and Japanese Empire during the World War II. They were the brutal victims of massacres launched by these imperial forces. Both nations also resisted very bravely. Poland launched Warsaw Uprising to resist against the Nazi Germany and the Vietnamese started August Revolution to fight against the colonial rule of the French and the Japanese. As such, Vietnam received much sympathy from Polish co-workers when they arrived in North Vietnam in 1960s and the Vietnamese immigrants in Poland also perceived Poland in a similar manner because of their historical parallels. When Vietnam were subject to global condemnations and embargoes that were raised by the United States and China, both the Polish government and the Solidarity movement expressed solidarity with Vietnam's fight against the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. It was an act that led to the deployment of Polish troops in Cambodia under the UN mission to help stabilize the political situation in Cambodia.https://polandin.com/39483727/polish-un-military- mission-to-have-a-documentary In 1946, the future founder of Israel, a Polish Jew, David Ben-Gurion, met H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh in Paris. His desire of establishing Israel and the historical impression from Ho to Poland was considered as the first unofficial tie between Vietnam and Poland. Official diplomatic relations were established in 1950. Janusz Lewandowski, representative of Polish delegation during the Geneva Accords at 1954, had protested the idea of separating Vietnam into two parts that proposed by the Government of newly- established People's Republic of China. To monitor the Geneva Accords, the International Control Commission (ICC) consisting of diplomats and soldiers from Poland, India and Canada was set up. The chairman of the ICC was always Indian while the Canadians were expected to support South Vietnam while the Poles were expected to support North Vietnam. In practice, the ICC did not work as expected with the Indian delegation often taking a more pro-North position than the Polish delegation who contrary to expectations proved to be more neutral. Poland‚ÄìVietnam relations grew from the 1950s and 1980s student exchange programs, during which time both Poland and Vietnam were socialist republics under the grasp of the Soviet Union.Nowicka, p.216-217 Both states were members of Comecon. During the Vietnam War, Polish diplomats in North Vietnam collaborated with Italian diplomats in South Vietnam in order to seek peace and end the Vietnam War. The first effort was the \\"Maneli Affair\\" of 1963 named after the Polish commissioner on the ICC, Mieczys≈Çaw Maneli. The \\"Maneli Affair\\" involved a proposal to end the war and ultimately set up a federation of North Vietnam and South Vietnam. The second effort of 1966 was known as Operation Marigold. In Marigold, Janusz Lewandowski of the ICC met with the American ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., presenting an offer on behalf of North Vietnam to open peace talks provided the American stopped bombing North Vietnam first. =Polish Catholic influence in Vietnam= Throughout history of their relations, Poland had played, both unofficial and official role, on the growth and buildup of Roman Catholicism in Vietnam; since Roman Catholicism is the major religion in Poland. In 17th century, Polish Catholic Jesuit, Wojciech Mƒôci≈Ñski, visited Vietnam in a tour through Asia, and had documented about Vietnam as the first Polish official record of the country.http://misjejezuici.blogspot.com/2012/07/wojciech- mecinski.html Pope John Paul II, who was of Polish descent, had canonized all Vietnamese Catholics died from 1533 to protect Christianity as Vietnamese Martyrs in 1988. The Polish Pope opted an open opportunity to establish relations with Vietnam; and had recognized the importance of Our Lady of La Vang, a Marian apparition in La Vang. He had also expressed desire to rebuild the La Vang Basilica in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the first vision. His message was instrumental, leading to the Government of Vietnam to acknowledge the importance of La Vang in Christian history of Vietnam.https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul- ii/en/letters/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19990716_madonna-la-vang.html The Polish Pope remained a revered figure among Vietnamese, both Catholics and non-Catholics, even when he died in 2005. The Polish Pope was also seen as having laid the framework to normalization of relations between the Holy See and Vietnam Archbishop Marek Zalewski, who is the second Vatican non- residential representative to Vietnam, is from Poland.http://www.catholic- hierarchy.org/bishop/bzalew.htmlhttps://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2018-05/pope- francis-nuncio-singapore-vietnam-zalewski.html He played a minor role, yet facilitated an unofficial link on the ongoing normalization between Holy See‚ÄìVietnam relations,http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Mgr-Marek- Zalewski%E2%80%99s-new-task-as-new-nuncio-in-Hanoi-44050.html which was seen with the direct result of Vatican's decision to establish a permanent representative in Vietnam and accepted by the Vietnamese regime,https://zenit.org/articles/seventh-meeting-of-the-vietnam-holy-see- joint-working-group/ moving further to possible future establishment of official tie between two entities and lax of suppression on Catholicism in Vietnam by the Vietnamese regime.https://www.romereports.com/en/2018/12/20/holy-see-to-have-permanent- representative-in-vietnam/ Cultural relations  The 10th-Anniversary Stadium has been called the center of the Vietnamese-Polish community. The Vietnamese community is also served by a number of non-governmental organizations, run by the community itself.

In 2015, Poland offered to loan Vietnam EUR 250 million as a form of official development assistance.http://www.vir.com.vn/poland-vietnam-65-years-of- friendship-and-cooperation.html The financial co-operation framework agreement was eventually signed between the two countries in 2017. In the same year, Adamed Group made the largest direct Polish investment in Vietnam by acquiring a controlling stake in Davipharm Co. Migration There has been significant migration of Vietnamese people to Poland estimated to be between 30,000-40,000 forming the largest non European migrant community in Poland. Following the Polish transition to a capitalist economy in 1990, and the reforms of Vietnam at 1986, Poland became a more attractive immigration destination for the Vietnamese people, in particular, small entrepreneurs; this triggered a second, larger wave of Vietnamese immigrants to Poland.Nowicka, p.216-217 Many began as vendors in the open air market bazaar at the 10th-Anniversary Stadium selling clothes or cheap food; , there were between 1,100 and 1,200 Vietnamese-owned stands in the area. (in Polish) in Warsaw there were an estimated 500 Vietnamese restaurants, mostly serving fast food.

It was first serialized on Jinjiang (http://www.jjwxc.net/) from January 2007 to August 2007 and first published by Uei-Shiang Co., Ltd. in Taiwan. Its simplified Chinese version was later published by China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Publishing Corporation in July 2016. It was translated into Thai and published in Thailand in December 2016. The storyline is Song Yao's long journey through transmigrations, to and fro between immortal and mortal world. The fiction depicts the struggling of several main characters and their entangled destinations (their ‚Äúdebts‚Äù to each other) and finally comes to a happy end. Translation of the Title Ê°ÉËä±ÂÄ∫ can be directly translated as Peach Blossom Debt. The sense-for-sense translation could be Romance of Love Debt, since peach blossoms are used as a symbol of love in Chinese culture. World Setting The world setting of this fiction is based on Chinese local mythology, Taoist culture and Buddhist culture: There are 3 worlds: mortal world of human beings, Heavenly Palace of the immortals (The immortals mainly origin from Taoism) and Western Paradise of Buddhas. Mortal human beings and animals can become immortal by practice Taosiam or Buddhaism or, like Song Yao, by taking the elixir pills. Immortals and Buddhas can visit each other in Heavenly Palace and Western Paradise. The souls of both the immortals and the mortals can go through transmigrations or samsara. The immortals' transmigrating as a mortal is a part of their practice or a way to pay the karma/debt for what they have done before. Main Characters and terminologies (With Chinese) Immortal Song Yao (Chinese ÂÆãÁèßÂÖÉÂêõ): The leading character and narrator of this story.

She married then-Foreign Secretary William Wyndham Grenville, Baron Grenville, on 18 July 1792. The Grenville family already had links with the Pitts, through Pitt the Elder's marriage to Hester Grenville, William Grenville's aunt; both Anne Pitt and William Pitt the Younger were his familiar cousins. Grenville's uncle, The Marquess of Buckingham, dominant in the Grenville family, was keen on the match (and arguably her ¬£20,000 dowery); and her father, Baron Camelford, was also supportive. The marriage appears to have been affectionate and was lasting, although without issue. Grenville went on to be Prime Minister from 1806-7. In 1804, Anne Pitt inherited the considerable wealth of her brother \\"the half-mad Lord\\", Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford, who had been killed in a duel, and amounting to ¬£500,000 in value, including Boconnoc House and estates, and Camelford House in London.

It is now a Latin Catholic titular see.  History  The city of Cedi√¶ was situated in modern Oum-Kif, in present Algeria. It was important enough in the Roman province of Numidia (in the papal sway) to become one its many suffragan sees, but like most faded completely, plausibly at the seventh century advent of Islam. The first record of the diocese, from 256, mentions bishop Secondinus, partaking in the council called at Carthage in 256 by Saint Cyprianus on 'lapsed Christians', who accept forced idolatry to avoid martyrdom; he died a martyr himself at Cirta in 259, mentioned in the Vetus Martyrologium Romanum under 29 April. Francesco Lanzoni believes him identical to the saint Secondinus venerated throughout southern Italy.Francesco Lanzoni, Le diocesi d'Italia dalle origini al principio del secolo VII (an. 604), vol. I, Faenza 1927, pp. 178‚Äì1179. Later Cediae adhered to the heresy Donatism, like its bishop Fortis, participant at the council called in Carthage in 484 by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, where it had no Catholic counterpart, and probably exiled afterward like most Catholic bishops. The last recorded bishop, Secundus, may still have been Donatist. Archeological digs found remnants of a basilica, probably from the Donatist period, and numerous sarcophagi, one of which is inscribed with a dedication of the church to bishop Secundus.

Description and history The Robbins Stoeckel House stands south of the village center of Norfolk, on the west side of Litchfield Road just south of the Mountain View Inn. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a dormered gable roof, and an exterior finished in stucco and wooden shingles. A gambrel-roofed ell extends from the north side. A fieldstone chimney rises on the front facade, near the junction between the original main block and the ell. The house was built in 1907 to a design by Alfredo S.G. Taylor, a New York City-based architect who spent many summers in Norfolk. Taylor is credited with more than thirty commissions in Norfolk. This house exhibits a number of signature Taylor elements, including windows with small panes in both square and diamond configurations, the half-round window in the end of the gambrel gable, and the position of the entrance at the crook of the ell. The ell, although it was added in the 1920s for a subsequent owner, was also designed by Taylor.

Jungle had started to emerge in the United Kingdom a couple of years earlier but despite its growth, albeit slow, in the United States, no jungle albums were available on the American market. Moonshine conceived the album as a primer for jungle music for American shores, using music from British jungle label SOUR Records, and as a spin-off to their fast tempo techno compilation series Speed Limit 140 BPM+. Law of the Jungle was the first jungle album released in the United States. The music on the album features typical jungle characteristics including influences from ragga, dub and dancehall, cut-up breakbeats, rude boy motifs and lyrics of urban alienation. The album sold 15,000 copies in the United States and was a major critical success, with many critics describing the album as a great introduction to jungle music. Furthermore, the album has also been credited as helping spread popularity of the genre in the United States. In 1999, music critic Ned Raggett named the album the 15th greatest album of the 1990s, and the decade's greatest compilation album. Background Jungle music emerged circa 1992 in London and Bristol, characterised by its pulsating, fast tempos (150 to 200 bpm),Noys, Benjamin. Into the Jungle, Popular Music, Vol. 14, No. 3 (Oct., 1995), pp. 321 relatively slow and lyrical reggae-derived basslines, breakbeats (often cut-up using breaks such as the Amen break), and other heavily syncopated percussive loops. According to Tim Haslett of CMJ New Music Monthly in his review of Law of the Jungle, described the original jungle sound present on the album as \\"constructed of sped-up drum breaks from '70s funk records from everyone to James Brown to Jimmy Castor and Hermann Kelly.\\" New York Magazine meanwhile described its influence from hip hop and \\"dancehall, dub and techno music that's distinguished by a frantic speed, a deep, detached bass pulse and a staicky surface of radio sound bites and unintelligble ragamuffin-style vocals,\\" citing the genre's similarity to \\"early punk rock‚Äìat least in its tempo, noise levels and desired effect on the more conservative segments of British society.\\" While jungle music's underground spread was large in its native United Kingdom, it was \\"slowly but surely\\" reaching North America, where much of the music was unavailable. As no albums of jungle were available in the United States, Law of the Jungle was conceived and distributed by Moonshine Music, an american electronic label primarily known for releasing techno music, as a jungle compilation for American shores under exclusive licence from British jungle label SOUR Records (Sounds of the Underground), whose catalogue, all of which was recorded at Trinity Studios in London, is used on the album. It was the first spin-off to Moonshine's Speed Limit 140 BPM+ series of compilations of fast-tempo techno music. Credited as executive producer, Stephen Levy compiled the album with David Stone, mastered it with Dave Aude West Hollywood studio The Still and is credited alongside Stan Endo for art direction. Mateo drew the illustration on the album cover. Music Shy FX (pictured in 2004). Described by Simon Reynolds as \\"containing some of the fiercest examples of this ragga-jungle style,\\" all the music on Law of the Jungle was licensed from SOUR Records, who have referred to the album as \\"the key\\" to their American success. Prior to the album's release, the music on the album was notoriously difficult for jungle enthusiasts in the United States to find on import. Ned Raggett, writing about the album for Freaky Trigger, described the album as a product of when jungle music was \\"freed from a variety of attentions\\": \\"this was when a bunch of characters just thought, 'Hm! Wonder what happens if‚Ä¶'.\\" The music is \\"heavy on the gangster/rude boy vibe,\\" reflected in the titles of \\"Hustling,\\" \\"Original Gangsta,\\" \\"Heartless\\" and \\"Original Nuttah\\", and in the lyrical delivery throughout the album, with \\"some of the most aggressively fun vocabs and ways around things vocally than most could ever dream of.\\" The \\"dub bass moves and the drop-ins of shotguns and echo,\\" which have been compared to Lee Perry, give the music a dancehall vibe, which, according to Raggett, is \\"why you have Junior Dan going on about being heartless with a sweet-touched reggae backing at points even while the drums are going wonderfully nuts all around him.\\" Many of the songs concern urban alienation, and while, according to Raggett, \\"staying one step ahead of capture\\" in the \\"urban jungle\\" was not necessarily a new subject for music, the speed to the music is essential, \\"because this isn't being cool and head-nodding, it's bolting forward.\\" \\"Reflection does not belong here,\\" wrote Raggett, \\"and there's no real point in big chants when the next sudden shift is around the corner. But the thing is that it's not all that, because then it wouldn't be fun. And fun is paramount.\\" =Songs= Shy FX and UK Apache's \\"Original Nuttah\\", as well as \\"Original Gangstah,\\" also by Shy FX in collaboration with Gunsmoke, were described as the album's highlights by Tim Haslett of the CMJ New Music Monthly, citing the songs' energy and \\"aura of promise and excitement recalling the exhilaration surrounding Run-DMC's 'Sucker MC'.\\" The former song samples an \\"ambient drone\\" from \\"Black Sunday\\" by Cypress Hill which, according to Simon Reynolds, \\"underscores the G-funk thread running from London, Los Angeles and Kingston,\\" while the latter track, a \\"snare drum- dominated\\" song which \\"unforgettably shouts the terrors and joys of black London,\\" samples dialogue from Goodfellas. \\"Blow Out Jungle VIP\\" by Bass Selective features a \\"discosalsa piano line, synth strings and diva vocals slammed into it all.\\" \\"Heaven n' Hell\\" by MC Olive n' Slam Collective features brooding samples in its background. T. Power's \\"Elemental\\" features a sampled quote about \\"the beast man\\" in its introduction and has been described as \\"a strange tightrope-walk of music, clean and clinical without being dead.\\" Critics have noted its \\"razor sharp drum cuts start up\\" and \\"synths and noises.\\" \\"Hustling\\" by Booyaka Crew features vocals from dancehall musician Tippa Irie. Release and reception Law of the Jungle was released on 18 October 1994 in the United States by Moonshine Music, and was the first jungle compilation released in the United States. The album was the first spin-off of Moonshine's Speed Limit 140 BPM+ series. Moonshine sent copies of Law of the Jungle with VHS copies of the BBC jungle music documentary Anatomy of a Fresh Vibe to journalists in order to improve their knowledge on jungle. In addition to CD, the album was also released on red vinyl. Law of the Jungle sold 15,000 copies, and in 1995 became a success with radio, reaching number 1 on CMJ's Top 25 Dance chart, compiled from the magazine's RPM chart which combined airplay reports of electronic music from numerous commercial, non-commercial and college radio stations. Tim Haslett of CMJ New Music Monthly said Law of the Jungle was an \\"exemplary album\\" for jungle music, a \\"splendid collection of tracks [documenting] a genre that has arisen out of a specifically Black British context,\\" and a \\"an outstanding introduction\\" to the genre. New York Magazine also called the album an \\"excellent introduction\\" to jungle music, and was \\"worth it, if only so you can I.D. the crashing new sounds hurling out of clubs this month.\\" Simon Reynolds of Vibe was favourable, claiming the album to contain \\"lovely\\" ragga-jungle music, while reviewing the album alongside the fifth edition of the Speed Limit 140 BPM series, whose \\"intelligent drum and bass\\" music he said was more \\"provocative\\" than Law of the Jungle. Norman Weinstein of Wired called the album a \\"smartly compiled anthology\\" and recommended it alongside Crammed Discs' compilations Renegade Selector and Jungle Vibes. As the first jungle album released in the United States, it helped spread the reach of the genre in the country. Critical acclaim for the album has also not waned over time, with the album being seen as a major jungle compilation; in 1999, Ned Raggett of Freaky Trigger ranked the album at number 15 in his list of \\"The Top 136 or So Albums of the 90s\\", the highest ranked various artists album on the list. Raggett said \\"this wasn't the first jungle collection, and it may not have all the notable early tracks. Oh, but does it kick, thrive, live, flow,\\" and concluded: \\"Music that could contain the universe that conservative rock jerks and self-righteous ambient types hated. Of course it is brilliant.\\" Larry Flick of Billboard called the album \\"sizzling.\\" Track listing # U.K. Apachi / Shy FX ‚Äì \\"Original Nuttah\\" (A. Williams, A.W.

The battle was fought near the tiny village of , near Bras≈Çaw, Grand Duchy of Lithuania (present-day Belarus), between the Russian corps of Prince Yuri Dolgorukov and the Tatar regiment of the Grand Duchy, commanded by . The battle ended in a Russian victory, as the Lithuanians were forced to retreat and the Russians occupied Bras≈Çaw.  Prelude  Prince Dolgorukov's corps (9000 soldiers) crossed the Daugava River on 22 May, with the majority of the troops and tabor crossing at Dyneburg, while the rest of the troops under the command of General Johann von Rautenfeld crossed the river at Kras≈Çaw. Both columns of the Russian corps then moved on Bras≈Çaw. Soon after crossing to the other bank of the Daugava, Rautenfeld sent his Don Cossacks to scout the town of Druja. Cossack intelligence indicated that a Lithuanian Tatar banner under the command of Rotmistrz Rej≈ºewski was stationed in the town. Upon their return, the Cossacks smashed a detachment sent by Kirkor's regiment, and captured two Lithuanian Tatar uhlans. Rautenfeld immediately sent a detachment of 160 soldiers. However, when Rej≈ºewski learned of the advancing Russians, he withdrew to G≈Çƒôbokie. Rautenfeld gave up the pursuit and continued to march on Bras≈Çaw, which he occupied on 26 May.  The battle  There are two known accounts describing the battle of Opsa - one by Szymon Zabie≈Ç≈Ço, and the other by J√≥zef Su≈Çkowski. According to Zabie≈Ç≈Ço, when Rautenfeld took Bras≈Çaw, the bulk of Dolgorukov's corps marched on Opsa. The vanguard was made up of 100 Cossacks led by Captain Belogorodtsev. Belogorodtsev sent a seven-man scout detachment, who stumbled on a similar reconnaissance troop from Kirkor's Tatar regiment. This led to fighting in the vicinity of Opsa, during which Kirkor's regiment fought against a Cossack force of a few hundred men led by Colonel Kireyev. After a few hours of fighting, the Lithuanian regiment was forced to retreat. Rotmistrz Mi≈Ç≈Çaszewicz was captured, and Lieutenant Achmatowicz was severely wounded. Zabie≈Ç≈Ço believed that a few dozen Russian soldiers were killed. Su≈Çkowski writes that Kirkor's regiment watched the movements of the Russian troops. Rautenfeld encircled Opsa on the night of 25 May, with the aim of neutralising the Lithuanian Tatar force. Kirkor wanted to avoid being captured by the Russians, so he threw his regiment into a desperate attack, which allowed him to break out of the encirclement and retreat. During the fighting, the Lithuanians lost 300 troops, and the Russians lost between fifty and 300 men.

The theater hosted many types of entertainment, including boxing matches, dances, and moving pictures. The theater was exclusively used as a gym by 1917 as automobiles and movie houses became more prevalent, allowing soldiers to seek entertainment elsewhere.

Development Scott McCloud's The Morning Improv initially ran from August 2001 to June 2002, during which McCloud spent an hour or two every day of the week to slowly develop an experimental webcomic. For each webcomic in the Morning Improv series, McCloud picked a title that was sent to him by one of his fans and based the rest of the story around it. McCloud continued The Morning Improv in July 2003, after a year-long hiatus, using a slightly different mechanism to select a title. Rather than picking a title himself, McCloud set up a system to allow his readers to \\"vote\\" for one of ten submitted titles by donating small amounts of money to McCloud through BitPass. The series stopped in June 2004, finishing with a webcomic using Daniel Merlin Goodbrey's Tarquin Engine. A few of McCloud's The Morning Improv webcomics have been critically praised.

In May 2012, the heads of state of Botswana, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania gathered in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, for a two-day Summit for Sustainability in Africa, in the company of several public and private partners. At the summit, they adopted the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa.  A multi-year process  By adopting the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa, these ten countries have engaged in a multi-year process. They have recommitted to implementing all conventions and declarations promoting sustainable development and undertaken to: * integrate the value of natural capital into national accounting and corporate planning and reporting processes, policies and programmes; * build social capital and reduce poverty by transitioning agriculture, extractive industries, fisheries and other natural capital uses to practices that promote sustainable employment, food security, sustainable energy and the protection of natural capital through protected areas and other mechanisms; and * build knowledge, data, capacity and policy networks to promote leadership and a new model of sustainable development and to increase momentum for positive change.  Beyond GDP  The overall objective of the Declaration was ‚Äòto ensure that the contributions of natural capital to sustainable economic growth, maintenance and improvement of social capital and human well-being are quantified and integrated into development and business practice.‚Äô This statement was propelled by the signatories‚Äô realization that GDP has its limitations as a measure of well-being and sustainable growth.  Follow-up  The interim secretariat of this initiative is being hosted by the Department of Environmental Affairs within the Botswanan Ministry of Environment Wildlife and Tourism, with technical support from Conservation International, a non- governmental organization. Conservation International has pledged funding for a situational analysis which will provide baseline information on where the ten countries stand with respect to the agreed actions outlined above and set priorities for moving forward. Since the 2012 summit, an implementation framework has been drafted to track progress. = Gabon = In 2012, Gabon adopted Emerging Gabon: Strategic Plan to 2025. The Strategic Plan identifies two parallel challenges: the need to diversify an economy dominated by oil exports (84% in 2012) and the imperative of reducing poverty and fostering equal opportunity. In conformity with the Gaborone Declaration, natural capital is to be integrated into the national accounting system. The plan also foresees the adoption of a national climate plan to limit Gabon‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions and forge an adaptation strategy, among other moves to foster sustainable development. The National Climate Plan was presented to the president in November 2013 by the National Council on Climate Change, a body created by presidential decree in April 2010. The government has also created a joint Centre for Environmental Research with the University of Oregon (USA) that will focus on the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change and environmental governance, including the development of ecotourism. The share of hydropower in Gabon‚Äôs electricity matrix is to progress from 40% in 2010 to 80% by 2020. In parallel, inefficient thermal power stations are to be replaced with clean ones to bring the share of clean energy to 100%. By 2030, Gabon plans to export 3 000 MW of hydropower to its neighbours. Efforts will also be made to improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution in such areas as construction and transportation. This new paradigm is to be ensconced in a law on sustainable development which will create a fund compensating the negative effects of development. This law was adopted in August 2014. The law has raised some concerns in civil society as to whether it will protect the territorial rights of third parties, particularly those of local and indigenous communities. The three pillars of Emerging Gabon: Strategic Plan to 2025 are: * Green Gabon: to develop the country‚Äôs natural resources in a sustainable manner, beginning with an inventory of 22 million ha of forest (85% of the land cover), 1 million ha * of arable land, 13 national parks and 800 km of coastline; * Industry Gabon: to develop local processing of raw materials and the export of high value-added products; * Services Gabon: to foster quality education and training, in order to turn Gabon into a regional leader in financial services, information and communication technologies, green growth, tertiary education and health. In order to adapt university curricula to market needs, existing universities will be modernized and a Cit√© verte de l‚Äô√©ducation et du savoir (Green City of Education and Knowledge) will be created in the heart of the country in Boou√©. Constructed using green materials and running on green energy, this complex will group a campus, research centres and modern housing. Foreign universities will be encouraged to set up campuses on site. = Botswana = It was Botswana which hosted the Summit for Sustainability in Africa in 2012. In 2013, Botswana initiated the development of a National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. A climate change policy will be developed first, followed by the strategy.

Commissioned in 1929 for a scion of the Vanderbilt family and completed in 1932, it is the first successful residential commission of William Lescaze, and the first documented example in the United States of an International Style country house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history Sun Terrace is located in an isolated rural setting near the geographic center of New Hartford. It is set on a wooded ridge southwest of the town center, its east flank traversed by Stub Hollow Road. The house is set at the crest of the ridge, with expansive views to the west and southwest. It is a 1-1/2 story structure, with a frame of steel finished with cement stucco. It is an asymmetrical but roughly rectangular mass, with a flat roof, cantilevered decks, and a prominent curved wall section. It has grouped windows, including at some of its corners, and is generally devoid of exterior ornamentation. A spiral staircase provides access between the rooftop terrace and lower outside spaces. Interior features include a curved soapstone fireplace, and extensive use of fluorescent lighting, a technology in its infancy at the time of the house's construction. The house was commissioned from William Lescaze, a Swiss architect, in 1929 by Frederick Vanderbilt Field, a scion of the Vanderbilt family railroad fortune who was disinherited for his political views. Lescaze was at the time also designing the PSFS Building, the nation's first International style skyscraper. When completed, this house was the first country house of that style, being preceded in residential architecture only by the Lovell House of Richard Neutra.

The present ch√¢teau on the site was constructed from the mid-18th century; parts of the original castle remain.Ministry of Culture: Ch√¢teau History Humbert II de Thoire built the castle at Poncin in 1180. It was one of the favourite residences of the lords of Thoire-Villars, who kept their court of accounts there. In 1290,Charles-Laurent Salch, Dictionnaire des ch√¢teaux et des fortifications du Moyen √Çge en France, 1987, 1304 p. (), p. 921. it was rebuilt by Humbert IV de Thoire. On 19 October 1308,Marie-Claude Guigue, Topographie historique du d√©partement de l'Ain, Bourg-en-Bresse, Gromier Ain√©, 1873, p. 298. Humbert V, lord of Thoire and Villars, had it entirely remodelled and sold it, for 7,500 livres viennoises, in suzerainty to the lord de la Tour du Pin, Jean II de Viennois, dauphin of Viennois who returned it to him in fief lige. The rights passed in turn to the Counts of Savoy, recognised by acts of 16 October 1375 and 7 February 1385. On 29 October 1402, Humbert VII, last of the lords of Thoire-Villars, \\"heavy with years and troubles\\", sold the seigneurie of Poncin to Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, along with all of his lands in Bresse and Bugey, keeping the use of them until his death, which came on 7 May 1423. The castle stayed with the House of Savoy for a century and a half. Poncin was forsaken by the Dukes of Savoy, who seldom went there. It was, among others, included in the dowery of Anne de Chypre, widow of Louis, Duke of Savoy, and in that of Claudine de Bretagne, Viscountess de Bridiers (La Souterraine), widow of the Philip II, Duke of Savoy, dowager of Annecy, Ch√¢teauneuf in Valromey (Songieu), Poncin and Cerdon, who made a residence of it for a time. In April 1513,Samuel Guichenon, Histoire de Bresse et de Bugey. Partie 2., Jean Antoine Huguetan & Marc Antoine Ravaud, Lyon, 1650, p. 87Charles III, Duke of Savoy included it, with Cerdon and some other territories in Bugey, in the dowry of Philiberte de Savoie, his sister, Marquise of Gex and Fossan (Fossano), wife of Giuliano de' Medici, Duke of Nemours, Marquis of Suriane (Soragna) and Chazene. She died in 1524 without children. Having made her brother her heir, Poncin reverted to Savoy. On 7 November 1531, the lordship of Poncin and its castle, with that of Cerdon, was given to Charles de la Chambre, Baron of Meximieux and Sermoyer, in exchange for lands in Loyettes. On 18 September 1565, Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, took de la Chambre's lands at Poncin and Cerdon in exchange for the lordships of P√©rouges and Montr√©al, granting them in appanage to Philip, Duke of Nemours. The Dukes of Nemour, throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, made important modifications to the castle. Their descendants retained ownership until the 18th century. In 1601, the castle was entirely dismantled by Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron, on the orders of King Henri IV. In 1717, the land was given to Artus-Joseph de la Poype-Saint-Jullin who partially reconstructed. Around 1750, it passed to the Quinson family. Gaspard Roch de Quinson, wanting to install gardens, restored the terrasses for this purpose in 1760. The Quinsons still owned it at the time of the French Revolution. At the Revolution, the ch√¢teau was sacked and severely damaged. It remained abandoned for forty years, until a new mayor of Poncin, monsieur Jantet, bought it in 1831 to create a very beautiful English garden. The ch√¢teau then became the property of Joseph Savarin de Marestan who had been named conseiller de la pr√©fecture of l' Allier. he came from an old Bugey family, ennobled at the end of the 17th century, which had provided a succession of bodyguards and musketeers to the king and had, in 1815 been given the title Baron de Marestan. The modern ch√¢teau is privately owned and not open to the public. It has been partially listed (fa√ßades and roof, remains of the ancient fortification, terrasses, supporting wall and gardens) since 1973 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

The programme is structured as a trimester programme, conducted from January/February to October/November of each year. Conservation specialisms within the programme include the conservation of historic metals, stone and mortar, artwork on paper, and ceramics. Masters programme A conservation masters programme, relying in part on course work and partly on a research project, is currently under development at this institution. The Institute has indicated its intention to seek accreditation for such a M.Sc Technical Conservation programme during 2021 or 2022. Faculty of Commerce This institution's second faculty has developed a short course series titled \\"Entrepreneurship for the Non-urban Context\\". Relying on established though neglected traditions, this short course series revisits unexpected approaches, offering express relevance for entrepreneurship in the present time - and with particular application to rural settings. Elisabeth FitzHugh Conservation Library The Institute is home to a comprehensive conservation textbook and reference library, which supports the study programme. The formerly privately held Elisabeth FitzHugh conservation volume collection forms the core of the library collection held at the Institute, also lending its name to the research collection overall.

He was mainly active in the fields of optics and solid-state physics.  Biography  Ben Nijboer was born as the eldest son of Roelof Nijboer and Janna Klamer. He grew up in Groningen where he visited the Rijks H.B.S; one of his teachers in mathematics was professor Dr O. Bottema from Delft. In 1932 at the age of sixteen he enrolled as a student in mathematics and physics at the Groningen University and after his bachelor's degree he majored in theoretical physics. His teachers were the future Nobel laureate in PhysicsFrits Zernike, dr. H. C. Brinkman and dr. R. Kronig. He graduated with distinction in 1937. On August 16, 1941, he married in Vries Ali Wildeman (1913-2017). From their marriage three daughters were born.  Work and research  After his graduation in 1937. Ben Nijboer spent a year in Bristol on a scholarship in the group of the future Nobel laureate Nevill Mott. He worked on a problem concerning semiconductors, by his own account \\"without much enthusiasm.\\" He came in contact with Jewish physicists who had emigrated from Germany, amongst whom Herbert Fr√∂hlich, Heinz London and Walter Heitler. He published his first article in 1937 (with C. J. Bouwkamp) in Physica: Bemerkungen √ºber Feldstarkeabh√§ngigkeit der dialektrischen Konstante und Kerneffekt . On return from England, he was drafted for military service, which was extended for an additional year as a consequence of the mobilisation. His conscription ended with the demobilisation in May 1940. His first paid job was being a teacher substitute in Groningen; he substituted for a teacher who was court-martialed to three months imprisonment for surrendering to the Germans before he shot his last bullet. = Doctoral research = In the summer of 1940, he was professor Zernike's assistant at the University of Groningen. In the context of his doctoral research, he explored a problem in theoretical optics: optical imaging in a microscope. The problem here is how to account for the effect of diffraction, combined with the geometric image defects due to the lens not being ideal. His teacher Zernike had developed a computational method for the case of spherical aberration and Nijboer managed to expand this for astigmatism and coma. Van Kampen, N.G. In memoriam Ben Nijboer. The results are known as the Nijboer-Zernike theory. In 1942 he acquired his Ph.D. with his dissertation The diffraction theory of aberrations. At the beginning of the 21st century, this theoretical work was revived as a consequence of advances in the chip lithography. In 2002, sixty years after Nijboers dissertation, his research was followed up with the Extended Nijboer Zernike (ENZ) Analysis & Aberration Retrieval by researchers at the Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven and the TU Delft. = Work in Princeton = A Fulbright scholarship enabled him in 1949 to work in Princeton, New Jersey (USA) at the Institute for Advanced Study for a year. He stayed there from September 1, 1949 to June 1, 1950 and met physicists like Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann, Abraham Pais, Rudolf Peierls and Freeman Dyson. He worked with George Placzek and L√©on Van Hove on the theory of neutron diffraction. The nuclear reactors, due to their large-scale production of neutrons, offered a new possibility for the study of solids and liquids, from which more information could be derived than from the X-ray scattering. An X-ray is a snapshot of the position of the atoms, while neutron scattering gives information about their movements. The interpretation of this information required a theory, which was developed by Placzek, Van Hove and Nijboer. Since then, this is the basis of this entire field of research.N.G.van Kampen, Levensbericht L.C.P. van Hove, in: Levensberichten en herdenkingen, 1992, Amsterdam, pp. 21-26 = Professor in Utrecht = In 1950 he was appointed by the University of Utrecht as a lecturer, with the teaching assignment of physics for chemistry students. In 1955 he studied for 6 months at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. On May 27, 1955 he was appointed as professor of theoretical physics at Utrecht. His inaugural address was titled: Electrons and nucleons, the building blocks of matter . His closest colleagues were L√©on Van Hove and Nico van Kampen. In 1961, Van Hove left for CERN in Geneva and Ben Nijboer became his successor as professor-administrator of the Institute for Theoretical Physics. In 1964-1965 he worked for a year at the 'Argonne National Laboratory' in Chicago (USA). Together with his PhD students Ben Nijboer studied several subjects: various aspects of the construction of Crystal with F. W. De Wette and J.J.J. Kokkedee, the theory of Van der Waals equation with MJ Renne and K. Schram. On August 1, 1984 he retired from the university at the age of 68. Between 1937 and 1988 he published 54 scientific articles. In 1988 he published his last (with Th Ruygrok) in the Journal of Statistical Physics, titled On the energy per particle in three- and four- dimensional Wigner lattices '.

The algorithm expands on traditional Monte Carlo aggregation which operates by placing candidates together and selecting a subset at random. Each member of this subset is then asked for an opinion usually by filling out a form. A resultant opinion scalar can be generated by application of the Softmax function over the generated form set. However Monte Carlo Polarization goes a step further and attempts to construct the subset with the greatest standard deviation in response, referred to as the form data response eigen-norm vector scalar. http://omlc.org/~prahl/pubs/pdfx/ramella05a.pdf  Origin  The idea of Monte-Carlo Polarization was firstly invented in Athens, (more commonly known as Thens), by Errikos Babudopoulos in 1978, but was mostly used in research in the 1990s by famous mathematicians, such as Grigori Perelman, in proving the soul conjecture.  Inception  The origins of Monte Carlo polarization came from the following observations made in early 1922: # All opinions are valid # Some opinions are more valid than others Where the validity of an opinion is defined by the Emotional Intelligence Hierarchical metric space, using the obvious distance function.  Procedure  Given an array A of n elements with values or records A0 ... An‚àí1, sorted such that A0 ‚â§ ... ‚â§ An‚àí1, and target value T, the following subroutine uses Monte Carlo Polarization to find the index of T in A. # Set L to 0 and R to n ‚àí 1. # If L > R, the search terminates as unsuccessful. # Set m (the position of the middle element) to the floor (the largest previous integer) of (L + R) / 2. # If Am < T, set L to m + 1 and go to step 2. # If Am > T, set R to m ‚Äì 1 and go to step 2. # Now Am = T, the search is done; return m. Extract the emotional category isofunctor morphismvector and append this to the business manifesto. Note: This can be done in matrix form. This is left as an exercise for the reader. http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/pubs/matrix1_SICOMP.pdf  Other forms  Although this a very recent cutting-edge technique, it has seen a couple of variations upon the basic algorithm in the last couple of month, most notably JSON driven resolution methods. the basic idea is that instead of supplying the algorithm with n records, it is more useful to provide the algorithm with emotional meta-data to guide its search and improve its complexity beyond the usual logarithmic bounds and this by a factor of log(n)/2. It allows to select intermediate m values for the search index and skew them towards the wanted emotional value in the initial records.  Applications  The acceleration structures permitted by the Monte Carlo Polarization consist mainly in BVH and EBVH hierarchies. The logical subdivision of the kernel space leads to a logarithmic complexity, which is key to the scalability of the sentient analysis tools. A key application is the direct targeting of hidden nodes in neural networks. By applying a Monte Carlo Polarization filter to the input layer of the neural system, hidden layers will be systematically and dynamically selected based on user-defined characteristics. Only the specified layers and units will receive and process the data. Compared to standard drop- off methods, Monte Carlo Polarization is both more effective and more secure. Instead of having all nodes receiving the data and selecting output from a subset, the unnecessary nodes are directly filtered out. The result is a greatly increased level of accuracy and protection, as unreliable and malicious nodes will be left out, and a higher degree of efficiency. The neural system that is created using the aforementioned method is the basis for many Computer Vision projects. A specific highlight is the American web- animated sitcom \\"F is for Family\\".  Node.js support  Monte Carlo polarization can be easily deployed through Node.js. npm --save install monte-carlo The library provides a basic implementation of Monte Carlo polarization, and shows the kernel space learning algorithm applied to session tokens. The native support of JSON files by NodeJS's JavaScript language is an example of the application of JSON Driven Monte Carlo Polarization. Being a cutting edge technology, researchers are experimenting the expandability of the current technology to support Asynchronous Transport Protocol for JSON, and to provide an API for classic AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) interface by tunneling the data through Socket.IO packets secured by blockchain technology.

Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma. Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma. The Brothers Halbertsma were three brothers born in the Frisian village of Grou towards the end of the 18th century, who played a role of crucial importance for the development of a written literature in the Western Frisian language.Breuker, p. 587.Hemminga, p. 56.Jensma, p. 197. These three brothers were: *Justus (or Joast) Hiddes Halbertsma (1789‚Äì1869).Breuker, p. 588. He studied theology in Amsterdam, and afterwards was a Mennonite minister in Bolsward and since 1822 in Deventer. He was a somewhat distant and cerebral author of short stories and poems. In his works ideas were more important than emotions. Besides his literary achievements he was also a scholar of linguistics, and with his (unfinished) Lexicon Frisicum he took the first step towards the composition of a dictionary of the Western Frisian language.Breuker, pp. 588‚Äì591.Wiersma, pp. 10‚Äì12. *Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma (1792‚Äì1852).Breuker, p. 591. He kept their father's bakery running after the untimely death of both their parents in 1809, later becoming an international merchant in dairy products (mainly butter and cheese). He lived in Grou his entire life, and wrote for the most part humorous rhymes and poems. Those were generally not of the same literary quality as his brothers' works, but became quite popular with the common man.Breuker, pp. 591‚Äì592.Wiersma, p. 9. *Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma (1797‚Äì1858).Breuker, p. 592. He studied medicine in Leiden and Heidelberg, and became a physician in Grou. His poems and short stories were much more emotional than those of his brother Justus, and his poetry in particular is still very much admired.Breuker, pp. 592‚Äì594.Wiersma, pp. 9‚Äì10. His oeuvre included the poem De Alde Friezen,Oppewal and Boorsma, pp. 90‚Äì93. which in 1875 became the national anthem of the Western Frisian people.Schroor, p. 2831. Apart from these three writers, who are usually meant when speaking of the 'Brothers Halbertsma', there was a fourth brother, who did not produce any literary work: *Binnert Hiddes Halbertsma (1795‚Äì1847). He took over the family bakery which had been kept going by his brother Tsjalling until he was old enough, and became a baker in Grou. Later he sold the bakery and started a new business trading in staves for wooden barrels. Under the leadership of his son Hidde Binnerts Halbertsma and his grandson Pieter Goslik HalbertsmaSchroor, p. 1125. this company evolved into Halbertsma Houtbewerking N.V., which was taken over in 1990, and since is part of the Faber Halbertsma Group.Schroor, p. 1124. The Brothers Halbertsma were all born in the house of their parents on Kowemerk (\\"Cow Market\\") street in Grou, a village in the central part of the Dutch province of Friesland.Wiersma, p. 7. They were sons of the baker and small-time merchantOppewal and Boorsma, p. 16. Hidde Joasts Halbertsma (1756‚Äì1809)Terpstra, p. 317. and his wife Ruerdtsje (or Riurtk) Tsjallings Binnerts (1767‚Äì1809).Wiersma, pp. 7‚Äì8. Two children who were born later died in early childhood,Terpstra, p. 316. the little boy in 1803, and the little girl in 1805. Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother. Ruerdtsje Binnerts was a scion of a prominent family in Grou. Her people were Mennonites, and although her husband had been raised a Calvinist, he converted after marrying her. From Justus' letters Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman, a loving mother, and a deeply religious person.Wiersma, p. 8. About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a mariner before his marriage. He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases. In 1784, he published a long Dutch-language poem under the title Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland (\\"Terrible Ice-drift and Flooding in Gelderland\\"). From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents were a family trait. The Brothers Halbertsma were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Justus was just twenty years of age, Tsjalling seventeen, Binnert thirteen, and Eeltsje only eleven.Wiersma, pp. 8‚Äì9. Later, Justus and Eeltsje started to write short fiction and poetry which can be considered folk literature.Wiersma, p. 11. As Justus acted as editor for Eeltsje's work for his entire life, their poetry and prose were strongly connected from the very beginning and for the most part published together.Breuker, p. 593. For that reason the linguist Foeke Buitenrust Hettema would later describe Halbertsma as the 'literary agent' of his brothers Eeltsje and Tsjalling. In 1822, Justus and Eeltsje's early works were collected under the title De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar (\\"Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket\\"), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37. This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young.Breuker, p. 597.Twerda, p. 297. This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's. Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time. A second, expanded edition of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages of a larger size.Terpstra, p. 313.Twerda, p. 298.Wiersma, pp. 5, 11. After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (De Noarger R√∫n oan Gabe Skroar), 1840 (Twigen √∫t in Alde Stamme), 1854 (Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen), and 1858 (De Jonkerboer and Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonst√™d).Brothers Halbertsma 1958, pp. 589‚Äì594. Eventually, contributions by the third brother, Tsjalling, were also inserted. After the death of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff.Breuker, p. 604.Wiersma, p. 5. In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of Rimen en Teltsjes (\\"Rhymes and Tales\\").Breuker, pp. 603‚Äì606. This work is now thought of as the national book of Western Frisian literature, and although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critics,Breuker, pp. 594‚Äì596. it is undeniable that Rimen en Teltsjes and its predecessor De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries. In 1949, author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave \\"the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected.\\"Wadman, p. 14. As of today Rimen en Teltsjes still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics.

He transferred to the 15th Hussars on their return from Corunna, serving with them during the Burdett riots of 1810 and the Luddite disturbances in the Midlands and Lancashire of the following years. In 1813 he exchanged as a captain to the 21st Light Dragoons at the Cape, where he acted as aide-de-camp to the newly appointed governor, Lord Charles Somerset. Whilst stationed there he commanded a military detachment, made up of volunteers from regiments at the Cape, which occupied the remote desert island of Tristan da Cunha soon after the arrival of the Emperor Napoleon on Saint Helena and also fought a duel with the transexual army surgeon James Barry. He rose through the ranks to lieutenant (17 May 1810) and captain (5 November 1812). In 1817, he went with his regiment to India, serving with a squadron employed as a field force in Cuttack, on the frontiers of Orissa and Bihar, during the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817‚Äì19. The 21st Dragoons (except a detachment on Saint Helena) were disbanded in England in May 1819 and Clo√´t√© was placed on half- pay. In 1820, he was occupied as deputy-assistant quartermaster-general, in superintending the landing and settling of a large body of government immigrants, known as 1820 Settlers, on the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony.

The site was initially excavated in 2010 by a joint team of the Middle Mekong Archaeological Project and the Department of Heritage of Laos. Perhaps most important is the site's status as one of the stone jar burial sites from iron age Laos, the most famous of which is the Plain of Jars. Test excavations in 2010 included two trenches. Finds from trench B included a circular stone disk, possibly made of limestone or a similar material. The initial reports listed the possibility that the disk represented a jar covering or grave marker similar to those found on the Plain of Jars. The B trench also included the remains of four pots, one of which was directly under the discovered disk and accompanied by loose remains. The single datable piece of material that has thus far been recorded was from the lowermost portion of the excavation and gave a date of c. 13,000, which could indicate an earlier site not recorded. The site also included a Buddhist painting on the cave walls that villagers believed was from the 1950s.  Looting  The interior has been almost entirely destroyed by looters, though initial reports suggested the damage was not critical. When the archaeologists returned in 2013, they characterized the site as almost entirely destroyed. Villagers stated that the looters were after the fine sediment inside the cave that could be resold as gardening soil elsewhere.[null Lewis, H., J. White, and B.

She was raised in Monto, Queensland, and in Rockhampton, where she also learned to play cricket. In November 2009, Hill made her debut for Queensland Fire. In 2011, she moved to the Sunshine Coast to pursue a career in professional cricket. Injury prevented Hill from having much of an impact on the 2011‚Äì12 Women's National Cricket League season. The following summer, she had limited opportunities due to competition from other pace bowlers, but still played five of the eight WNCL matches and nine of the 12 T20s.

In southeastern Russia, during years of outbreaks S. jacobsoni often attacks healthy trees along forest edges or standing alone along roads and in fields and gardens, making it an important pest for elm trees there. Reported hosts include Ulmus davidiana, Ulmus japonica, Ulmus laciniata, Ulmus propinqua, Carpinus betulus, and Pyrus ussuriensis.  Description  Body length is 3‚Äì5 mm long. The general color is dark-brown and shining, with lighter legs, elytra and antennae. The forehead of males is depressed and red hair covers its edges, which are curled toward the middle of the forehead. Female forehead is convex, bearing a medium longitudinal groove. Longitudinal wrinkle near the mouth and vertex punctured in both sexes. The pronotum is somewhat longer than wide (7:6 ratio). It is covered with coarse punctures that are larger at the edges, particularly at its anterior. The length of the elytra is almost equal to their combined width. The elytra have longitudinal grooves made of large round punctures. The spaces between these grooves contain rows of smaller punctures, which are irregular on the first two inter-groove spaces, but form regular single lines on the others. The abdomen is covered with short reddish hairs, which are denser on the first two and the last segments. The abdomen of males is concave toward the rear, with a steep depression on the second abdominal sternite, and bearing a horizontally extended finger-shaped tubercle on the middle of the posterior edge of the second abdominal sternite. This structure distinguishes it from other Russian Scolytus species. Males also have bumps on the 3rd and 4th abdominal sternites, which females lack.  Life cycle  The usual flight period is June‚ÄìJuly in southeastern Russia. The female bores a vertical egg gallery (5‚Äì7 cm in length and up to 2.5 mm of diameter) below the bark of the trunk or thick branches of declining elms, either standing or fallen, including elms burned by grass fires, and also on healthy elms when beetle population is high or if the elms stand a short while away from the forest. Eggs are laid on the sides of this gallery on the inner surface of the bark. Long galleries contain about a hundred eggs. Upon hatching, larvae bore their own galleries perpendicularly from the egg galleries, close to one another, often touching adjacent larval galleries, but rarely intersecting. Larvae pupate in mid‚ÄìJuly. Adults emerge in late July and early August. Soon after emerging, adults feed on thin young branches of elms, chew the thin bark and part of the sapwood, thus making grooves that run along or around these branches. There is usually a single generation per year. Sometimes there is a second generation, which flies in July‚ÄìAugust, and lay eggs in mid‚ÄìAugust. Their larvae develop in September, and reach near full larval maturity prior to the winter. Larvae overwinter. Several species of Chalcidoidea parasitoids use S. jacobsoni larvae as their host.  Distribution  This species has been reported from southeastern Russia (Primorsky Krai province and Sakhalin island), northeastern China (Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces), and Japan. The only North American report is with a single S. jacobsoni specimen caught in the wild in 2009 in the Vernon landfill in southern British Columbia, Canada, with a Lindgren funnel trap (multiple black funnels aligned vertically to mimic a tree trunk, with a collection vial at the base, to collect insects associated with trees) baited with a Scolytus multistriatus pheromones lure and an ultra high release ethanol lure. More traps were deployed in and around this area the following years but this species was never caught again.

In February 1871 he was elected to the post-defeat National Assembly where he supported the Legitimist faction. Subsequently, he stood on three successive occasions for election to the Senate (upper house), but without success.  Biography  Francisque-Marie- Joseph Ramey was born in the Ch√¢teau de la Bastie d'Urf√© at Saint-√âtienne-le- Molard, in the Loire department. He came from a political family. His grandfather, Marie-Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Ramey de Sugny, had been briefly imprisoned during the Terror, but had survived long enough to be released following the fall of Robespierre. Francisque-Marie-Joseph Ramey de Sugny was elected to the National Assembly on 8 February 1871, representing his natal department in the legislature. Reflecting the rural traditionalism of his region, he belonged to the catholic monarchist faction in the chamber, backing the restoration of a monarchy and the dismissal of the republican President Thiers, and opposing the Constitutional Laws which established the Third Republic and the Wallon amendment. He was also Conseiller g√©n√©ral of the Canton of Saint-Just-en-Chevalet between 1852 and 1880, and then again between 1887 and 1904. Between 1880 and 1887 the position was held by a republican. His term in the National Assembly ended in 1876 and in the election of 30 January 1876 he was a candidate for the department, but he lost out narrowly to another (moderate) republican, Lucien Arbel. The constitutional crisis of May 1877 triggered another general election. Ramey de Sugny was a candidate again, but again without success. The margin of his defeat at his third attempt to gain election to the Senate, in 1879, was greater still.

History  The temple is in Thukkachi village, on the banks of the Arasalar River, east of Kumbakonam. The village derives its name from Durga Achi, after the goddess Durga seen in the temple, which over time got corrupted to become Thukkachi. The original temple was built by Rajendra Chola I (ruled between 1014-1044 CE). Legend says that Vikrama Chola suffered from vitiligo and visited many temples to pray for respite from the disease. Lord Abathsahayeswarar (Shiva) visited him in his dream when he was camping near Thukkachi, and asked him to worship him for 48 days.

Founded as the New-York Petroleum Exchange, in 1884 the exchange reported oil clearances amounting to 2,373,582,000 barrels, averaging 7,782,000 barrels per day. That year the exchange also began trading in stocks, bonds, and other securities. The institution merged with the competing exchange New-York Mining and National Petroleum Exchange on February 28, 1885, forming the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange. History By December 1883, the New York Times wrote that \\"much interest\\" was being shown in a proposed consolidation between the competing New-York Petroleum Exchange and the New-York Mining Stock and National Petroleum Exchange. The matter was voted on by both exchange members on December 22, 1883. At the vote, members of the New-York Mining Stock and National Petroleum Exchange largely favored consolidation. However, the New-York Petroleum Exchange saw 269 in favor and 250 against, out of a total membership of around 688. Afterwards, a joint committee of three members from each Exchange was proposed, for the drafting of a new constitution and by-laws prior to any consolidation. On March 11, 1884, it was reported that the governing board of the New-York Mining Stock and National Petroleum Exchange had voted against consolidation 29 to 2. One of the reasons given was that the National Exchange treasury contained $204,000, while the New-York Petroleum Exchange only had $74,570. However, a resolution was passed that members of the New-York Petroleum Exchange could join the National Exchange. The Times reported on August 8, 1884 that \\"An animated meeting of the New-York Petroleum Exchange was held yesterday afternoon for the purpose of considering the subject of amending the constitution of that Exchange so as to permit the members to trade in stocks, bonds, and other securities.\\" On September 24, 1884, the Governing Committee of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) sent notices to Stock Exchange members who were also New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board members, stating that according to Stock Exchange rules, membership could not be retained in both. At a meeting held on December 10, 1884, the New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board amended its constitution. The amendment limited membership to 2,000, with members above an initial 1,700 required to pay a $2,000 initiation fee. In late December 1884, the president of the New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board L. H. Smith issued key facts. Among them, membership was listed at 1,004 at the time, with plans to increase the building fund to potentially build a building to accommodate the exchange. For 1884, the exchange reported oil clearances amounting to 2,373,582,000 barrels, averaging 7,782,000 barrels per day. On February 3, 1885, the Governing Committee of the exchange voted not to radically remodel their building at Broad-street. The competing exchange New-York Mining and National Petroleum Exchange merged with the New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board on February 28, 1885. The new institution was named the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange.

The title traces its origin from the times of the Old Pahang Sultanate, and was historically known as Maharaja Indera Pahlawan. The territory under his jurisdiction is Chenor, and land between the Bera and Kuala Luit (corresponding to most of Maran constituency, and some parts of Bera constituency). During the reign of Raja Bendahara Tun Ali, the title was renamed 'Orang Kaya Indera Pahlawan', with the added prefixes 'Orang Kaya'. The title is the third most influential among the four major chiefs, since his territory is the second most closer to the capital after Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar . Role Historically, the Orang Kaya Indera Pahlawan was part of the Orang Besar Berempat ('four major chiefs') that wielded very wide powers in Pahang. They had the authority to impose taxation and to decide all criminal and civil cases except those which involved capital punishment. In fact, their power was limited only by the capacity of the monarch to restrain them, and it varied according to their proximity to Pekan, the further from the court, the greater their authority. They were obliged to appear at Pekan once a year to menjunjung duli ('pay homage'). They had to pay a form of tribute called banchi to the monarch. Their districts were subject to serahan; the obligation to buy, at exorbitant prices, goods the monopoly for the sale of which, in certain localities the ruler was in the habit of granting to one of his favourites. In the month of Muharram. they appeared at court with offerings. In the time of war they were required to take the field with men, arms and food. The installation of the monarch was incomplete unless the Orang Besar Berempat assisted thereat. The Pahang constitutional theory was that the Orang Besar Berempat and, to a lesser degree, the other chiefs were the foundation upon which the monarch's authority rested. During the time of Johor Empire, the four major chiefs gave allegiance to the Bendahara as representing the Sultan, but, in time, the sovereign being to them a nebulous figure, their allegiance tended to become more and more a matter of loyalty to the Bendahara personally. This became formally sealed with the establishment of Pahang Kingdom in the late 18th century. Succession The titles of the Orang Besar Berempat were hereditary. When a chief died, his successor, before approval of his appointment, was required to make a ceremonial offering to the monarch. This usually took the shape of gold-hilted kris, but other forms of offering were permissible. If the eldest son of a deceased chief were unfitted for the succession, it was proper to appoint a younger son, a brother, or a nephew to the chieftaincy. Genealogical tree The present family of Orang Kaya Indera Pahlawan claim matrilineal descent from a Minangkabau, To' Gemok who came to Pahang following the route by Ulu Serting, Penarik and Bera, and founded a settlement in Chenor. The first mention in records of this chieftaincy was in 1740 when Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah summoned the chief to Pekan. The original territory of the Chenor fief was the land extending from the Bera to Kuala Luit. The Chenor chiefs are related to the royal family of Pahang through Tun Ismail, who is the second son of Tun Ali by his wife Cik Wan Ngah.

They were the primary armament of the Soviet Union's first cruisers built after the Russian Civil War. History The 180mm Pattern 1931-1933 weren't a single model of gun, but instead were a family of related guns, either built from converted /50 Pattern 1905 guns which were relined down to or they were newly built guns. The original guns were constructed of a three piece A tube, reinforced by two layers of outer tubes and a jacket. The lengths of these guns varied between 56-60 calibers and their weights varied, but their performance was similar. :The main variants of gun and mount were: :* 180mm/60 B-1-K Pattern 1931 - Naval guns converted from earlier 203mm guns in MK-1-180 single turrets. :* 180mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 - Newly built naval guns in MK-3-180 triple turrets. :* 180mm/56 Pattern 1933 - Coastal artillery built from converted 203mm guns in open MO-8-180 or MO-1-180 single mounts and MB-2-180 twin turrets. :* 180mm/56 Pattern 1933 - Railway artillery converted from earlier 203mm guns on TM-1-180, single gun, shielded mounts. Naval Use 180mm/60 B-1-K Pattern 1931 - In 1927 work on the former Imperial Russian Navy Admiral Nakhimov-class cruiser Krasnyi Kavkaz was restarted after being halted in 1917 following the October Revolution. It had been planned to arm the Krasnyi Kavkaz with eight 203mm guns in double turrets, but it was found impossible to mount this much armament on such a small and lightly constructed hull. Instead four smaller caliber 180mm/60 B-1-K Pattern 1931 guns were mounted in single turrets. Early testing found that the muzzle velocity for these guns was abnormally high which reduced barrel life to only 55-70 rounds, so the guns were derated and smaller propellant charges were used. 180mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 - Since the pattern 1931 wasn't satisfactory a new gun design with a lower muzzle velocity and shorter barrel length designated the 180 mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 was produced. Early prototypes were of built-up construction, but in 1932 the technology for producing loose liners was purchased from the Italian firm of Ansaldo. Later 180 mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 guns were constructed of a loose liner, A tube, jacket and breech ring. The 180 mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 were manufactured with two different styles of liners, one had shallow rifling and the other had deep rifling, the two liners were not interchangeable and required different ammunition. The shallow rifled liners still only had a life of 55-70 rounds, but the deeply rifled liners had a life of 320 rounds. In 1933 the Soviets purchased plans for the contemporary Raimondo Montecuccoli- class light cruisers from the Italian firm of Ansaldo. This new class of cruisers was known as the Kirov-class and were armed with nine 180mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 (7.1 in) guns in three MK-3-180 triple turrets. Like their Italian contemporaries the Kirov-class cruisers suffered many of the same design flaws. These included abnormally high muzzle velocity and poor barrel life. Shot dispersion due to the guns being mounted too closely together on a common cradle and crowded turrets which hampered crew efficiency, ammunition handling and rate of fire. Coastal Artillery 180mm/56 Pattern 1933 - Coastal artillery built from converted 203mm guns. The barrels for these guns were shortened from the original 60 calibers to 56 calibers and they were mounted on open MO-8-180 or MO-1-180 single mounts and MB-2-180 twin turrets. Ballistic performance was similar to the 180mm/60 B-1-K Pattern 1931, these guns also had short barrel lives and reduced charges were used to prolong barrel life. These guns were deployed in defensive emplacements along the Pacific, Arctic, Baltic and Black Sea coasts. Railway Artillery 180mm/56 Pattern 1933 - Railway artillery built from converted 203mm guns. The barrels for these guns were shortened from the original 60 calibers to 56 calibers and they were mounted on TM-1-180, single gun, shielded mounts. Ballistic performance was similar to the 180mm/60 B-1-K Pattern 1931, these guns also had short barrel lives and reduced charges were used to prolong barrel life.

With a market share of 9%, Rijk Zwaan is the number four vegetable breeding company worldwide. The family-owned company breeds over 25 different types of vegetables, including lettuce, tomato, cucumber, bell pepper and cabbage. History =Foundation and growth= The founder of the company, Mr Rijk Zwaan, came from a family of seed growers and seed traders living in the Dutch town of Enkhuizen, which evolved into a centre for the seed production industry in the late nineteenth century. In 1924 Zwaan opened a shop selling seeds on the street called Zwaanshals in Rotterdam. In order to select plants himself and hence gain more control over the seed quality, he arranged for his own seed production and breeding facilities to be built in Bergschenhoek in 1932. In the period following the Second World War, there was explosive growth in the horticulture sector. Westland, Zwaan‚Äôs key sales area in the west of the Netherlands, became an important region for the production of vegetables in greenhouses. The company grew rapidly in the second half of the 20th century and the headquarters were moved to De Lier in Westland in 1970. In 1964 the first foreign subsidiary was set up, in Germany. From 1980 onwards the international market became increasingly important for the company and the number of facilities outside the Netherlands grew. =Management buyout= In 1986 the Zwaan family decided to sell their shares in the company to BP Nutrition because of a lack of successor within the family. BP Nutrition invested in Rijk Zwaan for the first two years, but the multinational then changed its strategy and put the organisation up for sale in 1989. The board of directors, employees and even customers vigorously opposed sale of the business to parties that wanted to dismantle or merge the breeding company. They wanted the company to remain intact and independent. With financial support from employees and the Cebeco-Handelsraad agricultural and horticultural cooperative, the board of directors succeeded in buying the company from BP Nutrition. Since the 1990s, the company‚Äôs progress has been characterised by internationalisation and new technology. In 1989 the organisation became a shareholder in biotechnology company Keygene. In 2004 the breeding company set up a second research facility in Fijnaart. Since 1989, Zwaan has opened an average of one new facility a year outside of the Netherlands. Products The Rijk Zwaan product portfolio mainly comprises fruit vegetables, leafy crops, root crops and cabbage types. Varieties of said crops are selected based on traits including flavour and texture, consistency, production value and health and nutritional values. The company breeds vegetables and sells the seeds produced from them. =Developing new varieties= The breeding of vegetable varieties is focused on crossing plants with usable traits and selecting the best offspring. To do this, the breeders make use of the diversity that nature has to offer in combination with market knowledge and modern technology. Much of the research in vegetable breeding is aimed at selecting offspring more precisely and working more efficiently. This facilitates the faster development of varieties with the traits demanded by the vegetable chain (growers, processors, traders and consumers) such as resistances. The growing conditions and sales markets for vegetables differ widely around the world, which makes it necessary to develop varieties that are specifically suitable for particular local production conditions and market situations. Rijk Zwaan does not develop varieties that are governed by regulations for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). =Seed production and logistics= Vegetable seeds are a natural product. They must be produced under ideal conditions and quality control is essential. The seeds that Rijk Zwaan produces around the world are shipped to the Netherlands for cleaning and checks of their purity, variety authenticity, seedborne diseases and germination vigour. Some seeds are also subjected to extra treatment, such as encapsulation - to make them easier to sow - or a coating against germination diseases. =Support and sales= The company sells seeds and shares its knowledge with customers. To assess whether crops are suitable for local conditions, the varieties are trialled in practice by growers around the world. By sharing knowledge about production techniques and product sales, Rijk Zwaan helps growers to improve their yields. This is especially the case for small, local growers in countries where vegetable production is still in its infancy. When advising growers, Rijk Zwaan collaborates with governments, NGOs and other (local) partners. The company also exchanges information with other partners in the vegetable chain, such as retailers, food manufacturing companies, vegetable processing companies and restaurants.
