Snyder in extreme limited animation. Plot Young Alice, having become a celebrity for her adventures in Wonderland, is in her bedroom dreaming about visiting Paris and sharing adventures with the storybook girl Madeline. While no comment is made as to where this Alice comes from or what time the film is set in, Alice seems to be American, as she likes cheeseburgers and is having a great deal of trouble when it comes to getting to France. As Alice points out, ‚ÄúGetting to Wonderland was easy ‚Äì all I had to do was fall down the rabbit hole. But let‚Äôs face it ‚Äì it takes money to get to Paris!‚Äù. As Alice dreams in her bedroom, a talking mouse named Fran√ßois rides a bicycle into Alice's bedroom and wants to conduct a survey about her favourite cheeses. Alice wants to join Fran√ßois in his native Paris, so Fran√ßois uses a cheese that his company makes, which uses the same magical mushroom she ate in Wonderland as an ingredient, to shrink Alice to rodent size. Together, they ride through Paris, where Fran√ßois narrates a series of short stories with a Parisian theme. The film includes brief adaptations of five short stories: *Eve Titus' Anatole *Ludwig Bemelmans' Madeline and the Bad Hat *Crockett Johnson's The Frowning Prince *James Thurber's Many Moons *Ludwig Bemelmans' Madeline and the Gypsies. In the end, when Alice finally meets her, it turns out that Madeline dreams of being Alice in Wonderland. Cast *Norma MacMillan as Alice *Luce Ennis as Queen *Howard Morris as Grand Wizard, King (The Frowning Prince), The Frowning Prince *Carl Reiner as Anatole *Trinka Snyder as Princess Lenore *Allen Swift as Fran√ßois, Narrator, King, Lord High Chamberlain *Lionel Wilson as Jester, Royal Mathematician, Royal Wizard, Minstrel Production Alice of Wonderland in Paris was created by the team of Gene Deitch and William L. Snyder, who had previously collaborated on Munro, which won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film in 1961. The filmmakers (along with Rembrandt Films) were also responsible for producing the 1960‚Äì1962 Tom and Jerry theatrical cartoons for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and also were one of the producers of the Popeye animated TV series for King Features Syndicate, aired on ABC between 1960 and 1963. Attracted to the economy and beauty of Prague, Deitch and Snyder produced cartoons for both cinema release and cartoons based on short stories for school educational film use. Five of these stories were placed in the feature with new Alice sequences to be released as a feature film in the West. Actors Carl Reiner, Howard Morris and Allen Swift provided the voice performances, and Canadian actress Norma MacMillan provided the voice of Alice. Alice of Wonderland in Paris runs 52 minutes, which is somewhat short for a feature film release, and it was presented for its 1966 U.S. theatrical distribution on a bill with the short film White Mane. It was originally distributed in the U.S. theaters by a company called Childhood Productions; Paramount Pictures re-released it in the 1970s as Alice in a New Wonderland, and White Mane was also part of the bill.

Early life He was born on March 21, 1877 in M√∂lln, in the Province of Schleswig-Holstein. Gattungsgeschichte method Gressmann carried over the work of Gunkel in which he used the Gattungsgeschichte method of Biblical study (otherwise known as Form Criticism) and applied it to the books of Exodus, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 & 2 Samuel and 1 & 2 Kings, in the Old Testament.Clements, R. E. A Century of Old Testament Study (Cambridge: Lutterworth Press, 1994), 16. He took a traditio-historical approach in examining these passages, aiming to examine individual units so as to glean from them their original setting and purpose. Conflict with the ideas of Wellhausen Gressmann was significant in that he disagreed with the ideas of Julius Wellhausen, another eminent Biblical scholar, on the dates of the Decalogue (more commonly known as the Ten Commandments). Whereas Wellhausen placed the date at a relatively late stage in the history of Israel, Gressmann argued that, as they bore no evidence of having been influenced by Canaan, they must have been composed at a far earlier stage in Israel's history.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1902, a catastrophic flood washed away the previous bridge. Shortly after, the town of Caneadea hired the Groton Iron Bridge Company for a replacement span; the new bridge was completed in November 1903. The bridge was nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion C for its engineering significance as a surviving early twentieth-century bridge. In a NYSDOT survey, it was the oldest and longest of two surviving camelback truss bridges in New York. The bridge was listed on the National Register on November 19, 1998. In 1993, the Allegany County Department of Public Works declared the bridge unsafe and it was closed because the county could not afford to replace it. The closure was an inconvenience, forcing some drivers to go south and cross the river at Belfast before heading back to Caneadea. The Save the Caneadea Bridge Committee worked for the next fourteen years to raise funds for rehabilitation; an undisclosed sum was raised, plus about $550,000 in state funding. The bridge reopened in 2007, and the remaining $9,037.42 was assigned for maintenance. The bridge was closed again on June 26, 2012, because of structural deterioration. In August 2012, an engineering firm was hired to study what would need to be done to reopen the bridge to traffic. Design The bridge consists of a single-span steel truss, measuring , resting on cut stone abutments. It is a pin-connected, camelback Parker truss design, set about above the river. The ends of the bridge retain the original metal cresting and decorative plates bearing the bridge company name and former town names.

It was directed by Yoshihiro Nishimura and Naoyuki Tomomatsu and premiered at the New York Asian Film Festival in June 2009. It is based on a manga of the same name by Shungiku Uchida.  Plot  In a typical Tokyo high school a perpetually teenage vampire named Monami (Yukie Kawamura) falls for her classmate, Mizushima (Takumi Saito), who happens to already be the reluctant boyfriend to the vice principal/science professor's daughter, Keiko (Eri Otoguro), a leader of a Sweet Lolita gang. The ensuing love triangle leads Keiko to seek the assistance of her father who, unbeknown to his daughter, moonlights as a Kabuki-clad mad scientist with the school nurse as his assistant. The pair experiment on students in the school basement hoping to discover the secret of reanimating corpses (akin to the work of Victor Frankenstein). Their hopes are answered when they discover a solution of Monami's blood holds the properties to bring life to dead body parts and inanimate objects. The story begins to unfold after Mizushima carelessly accepts a honmei choco spiked with Monami's blood, turning him into a half vampire. When Keiko discovers their secret, she attacks Monami but accidentally throws herself off the school roof in the process. Her premature death leads to her father using the blood solution to transform her into a vicious Frankenstein's monster determined to get revenge against Monami. From then on Monami and Keiko battle each other in the pursuit of winning Mizushima's heart, regardless of his feelings towards either of them. Monami ultimately kills Keiko by using her powers to turn droplets of her blood into spikes that rip the flesh off the latter's body and leaves her skeleton impaled at the top of Tokyo Tower. At the end Keiko's father turns himself in a Franken Advanced Composite Life Form with use of Monami's blood, and it is revealed that Igor was turned into a vampire by Monami a hundred years ago, and that Mizushima is only one in a long succession of boyfriends.  Cast   Subculture references  The film parodies subcultures prevalent in Japan, including ganguro and Lolita. Wrist cutting is a theme that returns from Nishimura's 2008 film, Tokyo Gore Police. Release In the United States, the film was released on 26 June 2009 from American Film Market.

In 1982, Bonilla's team began to develop in vitro propagation techniques of Britain's Robert Edwards, in Spain. Life Bonilla was born in 1944 in Valencia, Spain. He is a son of Francisco Bonilla Mart√≠ and Mar√≠a Dolores Musoles Barber. He is married and has three children. He comes from a family of gynecologists: his uncle, Prof. Miguel Mart√≠ Pastor (President of the Royal Academy Of Medicine of Valencia, Spain); his father, Prof. Francisco Bonilla Mart√≠ (President of the Spanish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology); and now his son, Dr. Francisco Bonilla Bartret. Career Educated by the Jesuits, Bonilla graduated in Medicine from the University of Valencia in 1967, and received his PhD from that University in 1970. He had further study in Germany and Switzerland with Otto K√§ser. At that time, the first experimental apparatus for ultrasound in Gynecology were being developed. His family financed the acquisition of the first three devices in 1969, which were installed at the Hospital Cl√≠nico Universitario of Valencia, in the old maternity hospital La Cig√ºe√±a and his own private practice, and he introduced obstetric and gynecologic ultrasound in Latin America in 70s. Bonilla got his first professorship in Cadiz in 1977, but continued to work in his home town as a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Valencia, where it developed its teaching since 1979. He was head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Hospital Cl√≠nico de Valencia until his retirement in 2014. Among other responsibilities, he has held the presidency of the International Federation of Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy from 1978 to 1986, the World Organization president gestosis the years 1985 and 1986, and chairmanship of the Committee for the Study of Female Breast of the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology from 1989 to 1998.

In 1982, Bonilla's team began to develop in vitro propagation techniques of Britain's Robert Edwards pioneering in 1984 the first test tube baby gestate in Spain. The embryo, however, died in the womb, so it was the clinic Dexeus of Barcelona that won the first birth in Spain that same year. It was in 1985 when Bonilla's team scored the first birth, and six pregnancies at the Hospital Cl√≠nico de Valencia, making it the pioneer of the Spanish public health in this area. In 1990, he was involved with Dr. Pellicer and Dr. Remohi, in founding the Valencia Infertility Institute (IVI), the first Spanish institution dedicated entirely to assisted human reproduction.

Usually annual, occasionally perennial, Polanisia is native to North America, and is found throughout much of Canada and the United States. It favors full sun, mesic to dry conditions, and barren, sandy or gravelly soils, even highly disturbed areas where there is little other ground vegetation. It looks similar to a close relative, the spider flower (Cleome). The scientific name of the genus derives from the fact that the plant has numerous, long stamens of unequal lengths (from Greek polys, \\"many\\", and anisos, \\"unequal\\"). The name of the species, dodecandra means \\"having 12 stamens\\". The common name clammyweed refers to the sticky, or clammy, residue left on hands after handling the plant. Polanisia grows from tall and the vegetation and sap have a noticeable odor described as smelling unpleasant, sulphur-like, \\"strong and rank\\". The leaves, about long, are made up of three palmate leaflets. The stems are covered in glandular hairs, and numerous flowers are borne in terminal racemes (May‚ÄìOctober). Each flower has four white or cream petals about long, and reddish purple stamens extend well beyond the petals (hence the \\"red whisker\\" clammyweed nomenclature). The seedpods are long, slender capsules long. They contain multiple small reddish brown seeds approx . Polanisia seedpods project upward (whereas Cleome pods project out or down).

In 1969, nine years after independence, the Somali central government began many national development projects. SNAC was born out of the 1972 government decree, which called for a standard orthography for the Somali language. The Somali National Academy and its supporting institutions played an important role when it came to researching and understanding Somali history, culture and folklore. The center's first president was the Somali linguist who invented the Somali National Script, Shire Jama Ahmed.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, \\"Cultures and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwoord Press : 2001), p. 72 Area of responsibility Somali National Academy of Culture collected and stored volumes of material which was previously in the hands of private individuals. SNAC administration and staff had direct collaborations with other higher learning institutions such as the Gaheyr and Lafoole universities. Garhey University later became the Somalia National University (Jaamacada Ummada Soomaaliyeed). Public institutions in Mogadishu including the Somali National University, received significant improvements and expansion throughout the 1970s and 80s. There were a number of Somali government ministries which housed material for the Somali National Academy of Culture. These ministries included education (Waxbarashada), National Guidance Hanuuninta), higher education (Tacliinta Sare), Movie Agency (Wakaalada Filimada) and other government centers. Use as a research center The Somali National Academy of Sciences, Arts and Culture presented any new material among other places, at either the National Theatre (Tiyaatarka Qaranka) or National Museum (Madxafka Qaranka), both situated in Mogadishu.

Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1951, 1986), vol. 1, pp. 318, 320, 334, 335, 341, 346, 349, 351, 354, 357, 363, 364‚Äì365 (notes 6 and 7), 367; vol. 2 (1952), p. 592. In 202, Minucius Thermus may have been the military tribune named Thermus who served in Africa under Scipio Africanus.Appian, Lib. 36; Broughton points out that Friedrich M√ºnzer accepts the testimony of Appian, despite questions of reliability. As a tribune of the plebs in 201, Thermus and his fellow tribune Manius Acilius Glabrio opposed the desire of Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus to have Africa as his consular province.Livy 30.40.9‚Äì16. Thermus was also responsible for legislation confirming peace with Carthage after the Second Punic War.Livy 30.43.2‚Äì3; Polybius 15.18‚Äì19; Cassius Dio frg. 57.82‚Äì83; Zonaras 9.14. His actions may reflect on the earlier connection with Scipio, whose imperium in Africa was extended into 201 so he could finalize the treaty, as a result of which he received the cognomen Africanus. Minucius Thermus was curule aedile in 198. From 197, he served on the three-man commission (triumviri coloniis deducendis) in charge of establishing colonies located at the mouths of the Volturnus and the Liternus (in Campania), at Puteoli, Castrum Salerni, and Buxentum.Livy 32.29.3‚Äì4 and 34.45.2; Velleius Paterculus 1.15.2. As praetor in 196, he was assigned to Hispania Citerior (\\"Nearer Spain\\").Livy 33.24.2, 26.1‚Äì4 and 43.7‚Äì8. He was possibly acting as proconsul when his military success at Turda in Spain, where he defeated the Turboletae people, gained him the honor of a triumph.Livy 33.44.4‚Äì5; 34.10.5‚Äì7. Thermus was elected consul in 193 and assigned Liguria as his province. From his base in Pisa, he waged war against the Ligurians with little success.Livy 34.55.6 and 56.3‚Äì7, 35.3.1‚Äì6 and 6.1‚Äì4 and 11.1‚Äì13; MRR1 p. 346. Among his officers was the prefect M. Cincius Alimentus. His command was extended for the following year, during which time he defeated the Ligurian forces near Pisa.Livy 35.20.6; 35.21.7‚Äì11. He remained as proconsul in Liguria for 191‚Äì190, until he was instructed by the senate to transfer command to Scipio Nasica. He was denied a triumph upon return.Livy 36.38.1‚Äì4 and 40.2; 37.2.5; 37.46.1‚Äì2. In 189‚Äì188, Thermus took part in the ten-man commission (decemviri) who assisted the proconsul Manlius Vulso in concluding the treaty with Antiochus III and making a settlement in Asia.See also Q. Minucius Rufus: Diplomatic missions. Broughton notes that Appian (Syrian War 39) is mistaken in calling Thermus a chiliarch (œáŒπŒªŒØŒ±œÅœáŒøœÇ) as a Greek equivalent of his Roman rank. Thermus went with Manlius to administer the oath that ratified the treaty.Polybius 21.43.1‚Äì2; Livy 38.39.1. He was killed while returning through Thrace with Manlius.Livy 38.41.3, 46.7 and 49.8.

Camp history The camp was opened in October 1939 as Oflag IX- AMattiello (1986), p.206 to house POWs from the British Royal Air Force and the French Arm√©e de l'Air.WO208/3293 The National Archives Official Camp History O9A/H & O9A/Z The camp was renamed Oflag IX-A/H (Hauptlager, \\"Main camp\\") in June 1940, after Oflag IX-C at Rotenburg an der Fulda became a sub- camp (Zweiglager) designated Oflag IX-A/Z.Mattiello (1986), p.207 The first person to escape from the camp was Flight Lieutenant Howard Wardle in August 1940, but he was recaptured and sent to Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle.Reid (1952), p.65 On the 21 October 1940 the POW Eric Foster was one of twenty-six selected to move to Spangenberg from Dulag Luft. In his autobiography Foster stated \\"Dulag Luft had been described as the best camp in Germany... Spangenberg was described as the end of hope.\\" Foster explained though the Schloss, upon arrival, looked like a fairy castle from a Hans Christian Andersen story, he would soon learn to hate the castle as a POW camp. He noted the castle had foul smelling hogs in the moat. The manner of the guards upon arrival was rough and very unpleasant when compared to other camps and the discipline was unusual and severe. Foster described the sleeping quarters as a former Banqueting Hall used as a dormitory. This dormitory was at the top of a spiral stair case and this room had very bad lighting. The lighting in the room came from four fifteen watt bulbs. The room consisted of many double bunk beds. The camp was closed in February 1941 but reopened in July when it was used for housing RAF and British Army officers. Many of the prisoners were temporarily transported to Torun, Poland in this time frame. On 3 September 1941 three RAF officers, Dominic Bruce, Peter Tunstall and Eustace Newborn, escaped disguised as members of a civilian Swiss Red Cross Commission. They passed through the gate and then, wearing faked Luftwaffe uniforms, headed to an airfield near Kassel intending to steal a Ju 52, which Newborn had flown before the war, and fly home. Unfortunately, they were detected before they could start the plane, so they decided to find another less well guarded aerodrome. After ten days, they were challenged by a former Spangenberg guard and arrested. The Germans marched the prisoners east on March 29, 1945, and some 25 escaped as they left the castle (see Eric Foster's autobiography). The Americans liberated the camp's inmates at Lengefeld unterm Stein on 4 April.http://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/index.php/the-march- east-1945-ebook.html Spangenberg Castle was destroyed by American bombs after Oflag IX A/H had left.

He played college football at Western Reserve University, now known as Case Western Reserve University, from 1938 to 1940 and then in the National Football League (NFL) with the Detroit Lions in 1941. After serving in World War II, Belichick began his coaching career. From 1946 to 1949, he was the head football coach and the head basketball coach at Hiram College. He continued on as an assistant coach in college football with stints at Vanderbilt University (1949‚Äì1952), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1953‚Äì1955), and then for 34 years at the United States Naval Academy (1956‚Äì1989). Belichick's son, Bill, is the current head coach of the NFL's New England Patriots. His grandsons, Stephen and Brian, serve as position coaches for the Patriots ‚Äî outside linebackers and safeties, respectively. Playing career After graduation from Struthers High School, Belichick played college football at Western Reserve, now known as Case Western Reserve University, where he played at fullback. Most notably, he was a member of the 1938 team, who went a perfect 9‚Äì0, and the bowl- qualifying 1940 team, where he scored several touchdowns in his senior season. During the school's first and only bowl game, the 1941 Sun Bowl victory over Arizona State, he scored the first touchdown of the game. After graduation, he worked as an equipment manager for the Detroit Lions. The team was struggling, and Belichick reportedly told the coach, Bill Edwards, \\"I can do better than most of the guys you've got.\\" Edwards, who had coached Belichick at Western Reserve, agreed, and signed him as a player. Although the team's fortunes did not improve, Belichick had some success, scoring a 65-yard touchdown punt return in a loss against the New York Giants. During a portion of his military time during World War II, Belichick played for the successful 1942 Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets football team.http://allthingsbillbelichick.com/blog/in- memoriam-steve-belichick Coaching and scouting career In 1942, Belichick joined the United States Navy, serving in both Europe and the Pacific. After he completed his service in 1946, he became the head coach at Hiram College, southeast of Cleveland. In 1949, he left Hiram to become the backfield coach at Vanderbilt University, where he spent two seasons before joining the University of North Carolina as an assistant to George Barclay in 1953. Both the Vanderbilt and North Carolina coaching jobs were alongside Belichick's former collegiate and professional head football coach, Bill Edwards. In 1956, Belichick joined the United States Naval Academy staff under Eddie Erdelatz, where he served primarily as a scout for over 30 years. His book Football Scouting Methods (Ronald Press, 1962) became a standard, described by Charley Casserly as the best book on the subject he had read, and by Bleacher Report as the \\"Bible\\" of football scouting. In 1982, Nick Saban was on the Navy football staff with Belichick. Personal life Steve Belichick was the youngest of five children born to Marija Barkoviƒá and Ivan Biliƒçiƒá, who immigrated to the United States in 1897 from Draganiƒá, Karlovac, Croatia and settled in Pennsylvania. After their marriage, the couple changed their names legally to Mary and John Belichick, reportedly at the suggestion of Immigration Center. In 1924, the family moved to Struthers, Ohio, where Steve Belichick maintained strong ties with the local Croatian community. In 1951, he married Jeannette Ruth Munn, with whom he had one child, Bill. Their son is currently the head coach of the New England Patriots and has cited his father, with whom he began analyzing game film at the age of 10, as his chief early influence. Legacy Located inside the Wyant Field House at DiSanto Field in Cleveland, the 4500-square foot Steve Belichick Varsity Weight Room is utilized by the Case Western Reserve Spartans football team. Belichick was inducted into the Case Western Reserve University Athletics Hall of Fame for both football and basketball in 1976. The Belichick Library on the campus of the United States Naval Academy was principally donated by Steve Belichick, and consists of books on football strategy and history, as well as Navy Football memorabilia. His son has contributed to it in recent years, and it is considered one of the largest collections of football-related works outside of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The sons find employment by fixing mechanical things as odd jobs and maintain two traction engines. The film, which is 65 minutes long, consists of interviews with the Page family, interspersed with footage of them going about their lives in the forest. It was shot using natural light on 16mm colour film. The sound is mono and there is no voice-over narration. The film was previewed at the 1971 Berlin International Film Festival, and the first reviews were in the West German press. The British press subsequently picked it up resulting in short positive reviews by John Russell Taylor, David Robinson, George Melly, Dilys Powell. After its distribution it was also positively reviewed by Philip Oakes. In 2009 the film was released on DVD for the first time. To coincide with this it had showings at various cinemas. A reunion of the director and crew and a question and answer session was held at the London showing.

Birmingham Metropolitan College is a further and higher education college with 10 campuses distributed within Birmingham, England. The college was created in 2009 as an amalgamation of Matthew Boulton College and Sutton Coldfield College. The main site is Matthew Boulton College based at Jennens Road in Birmingham City Centre. In addition to the existing campuses and facilities, there are proposals for the construction of a new campus in Perry Barr, although these plans are currently on hold due to funding issues. The college is a member of the Collab Group of high performing schools.  History   Matthew Boulton College  The origins of Matthew Boulton College are related to the Municipal Technical School, which was located on Suffolk Street in Birmingham. Construction commenced on the college on 18 November 1893 and it was opened on 16 September 1895. The purpose-built premises were used by 34 staff and approximately 2,000 students. The classes available were Chemistry, Physics, Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, Metallurgy, Mathematics, Handicrafts and Typography and Drawing. By the mid-1930s, a new site had been acquired in Gosta Green and another college called the College of Technology, Commerce and Art was constructed, although construction was delayed by World War II. The Gosta Green site became the UK's first College of Advanced Technology (CAT), later Aston University, receiving its royal charter in 1966. In 1957, it was decided to rename the separate Suffolk Street building and in November 1957, it became the Matthew Boulton Technical College, named after Matthew Boulton, a prominent local industrialist of the Industrial Revolution. During the 1950s and 1960s, a new college was constructed on Sherlock Street and the courses were moved there in a phased approach throughout the 1960s. By the late 1990s, these premises had become unfit for purpose and it was deemed uneconomic to refurbish them, so Matthew Boulton College sought a new location on Jennens Road in the Eastside area of the city in late 1999 close to the Aston University Campus. The site was purchased by the college from Aston University in 2003 and a three-month demolition programme on the site commenced in September 2003. Construction started in January 2004 and was completed by July 2005 to allow the building to be opened to students for the new academic year in September 2005. The project cost ¬£37.9 million, ¬£13.2 million was given by the Birmingham and Solihull Learning and Skills Council, the largest awarded in the Midlands and the second largest in the country to a college of further and higher education. Construction cost approximately ¬£23 million. Bond Bryan Architects were commissioned to design the scheme while Davis Langdon were appointed to manage the construction and costs of the project. The Sherlock Street buildings were purchased by the regional development agency Advantage West Midlands and were demolished in late 2008.  Sutton Coldfield College  James Watt Campus in June 2010 Sutton Coldfield College originated in 1896 as a technical school, then expanded in 1964 as a further education college. Preparations for the further education college began in the 1950s when its purpose-built facilities at Lichfield Road were constructed. In 2003, plans were submitted to the Government for North Birmingham College, formerly Brooklyn Technical College, to be merged with Sutton Coldfield College. The plans were laid before Parliament on 19 May 2003 and subsequently approved by Margaret Hodge. North Birmingham College was then dissolved with all of its property being transferred to Sutton Coldfield College on 1 August 2003, with the college buildings becoming the Great Barr campus (It is now known as BMC's 'James Watt Campus'). In 2006, plans were put before Parliament for the merger of Josiah Mason Sixth Form College and Sutton Coldfield College. They were approved by the Secretary of State and Josiah Mason College was dissolved on 1 August 2006, with its properties being transferred to Sutton Coldfield College. A new Sixth Form Centre, designed by SMC Hickton Madeley Architects, at the Lichfield Road campus was completed in 2001. Also recently completed is an Amenities Building and a new entrance to the Design Centre. The 1950s buildings at the Lichfield Road campus underwent an extensive refurbishment in 2008 which also saw the partial demolition of the Student Services building which was then reconstructed to become the Business Development Centre.  Merger  In 2008, Matthew Boulton College and Sutton Coldfield College collaborated in providing courses. In the same year, they applied to the Government to allow the two colleges to merge, and also applied for funding from the Learning and Skills Council for the construction of a new ¬£42 million campus on a former dairy site alongside the River Tame, in Perry Barr, named the Riverside. To allow the merger of the two colleges, Matthew Boulton College was dissolved and all of its properties transferred to Sutton Coldfield College. The merger to create 'Birmingham Metropolitan College' was approved by the Secretary of State in June 2009 and came into effect from 1 August 2009. Upon the merger, the new college had a combined student population of 27,000, making it one of the largest further and higher education institutions in the United Kingdom. Before the 2013‚Äì2014 academic year, the college prohibited garments obscuring the face, for which it was congratulated by the Prime Minister, David Cameron.http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/428921/David-Cameron-backs- Birmingham-college-s-decision-to-ban-Muslim-veils-for-security-reasons  Campuses  Birmingham Metropolitan College manages eight campuses within Birmingham, most of them the result of previous college mergers. The main site is Matthew Boulton College in Birmingham City Centre. Sutton Coldfield College at Lichfield Road in Sutton Coldfield is home to the college's administrative offices, a sixth form college and further education facilities. The buildings were mostly constructed in the 1950s as purpose-built structure although the college also obtained the Grade II* listed Moat House which was built in the 17th century by Sir William Wilson. They also obtained the Old Art School, further up Lichfield Road adjacent to Bishop Vesey's Grammar School, which is now being used as a performing arts centre. On Sutton Coldfield High Street is the college's Media Centre which is based within the Emmanuel Court office complex. The college has a separate campus in The Mall Sutton Coldfield, also known as the Gracechurch Shopping Centre, in Sutton Coldfield town centre that serves as the college's IT campus. Another campus in Sutton Coldfield is the Design Centre, a specially converted building on the periphery of Sutton Coldfield town centre. There are two campuses in the Erdington area of north Birmingham; Slade Road and Mason Road. The Slade Road campus was originally occupied by Josiah Mason College until it merged with Sutton Coldfield College. Josiah Mason College also occupied another campus in Castle Vale that is now occupied by Birmingham Metropolitan College. The Castle Vale campus was completed as part of the C3 complex on the High Street in December 2005 at a cost of ¬£3.7 million and shares the building with Castle Vale Library. The building was designed by Associated Architects and was officially opened on 6 March 2006. The building received funding from the council, European Regional Development Fund and the Learning and Skills Council. There are 27 public computer terminals and an additional 60 study places in the building. The distinctive building features a curved double-height corner feature, topped by a sharp Tecu Bronze-clad apex. The other campus, James Watt Campus, located in north Birmingham is the Great Barr facility that was formerly North Birmingham College, and before that Brooklyn Technical College. Matthew Boulton campus, formerly the main Matthew Boulton College building, serves as the second largest campus for Birmingham Metropolitan College. The nine-storey building is located on Jennens Road in the Eastside district of Birmingham City Centre, adjacent to Aston University.  Riverside campus  Plans for a new campus for Sutton Coldfield College in the Perry Barr area of Birmingham came to light in 2005. The site chosen was the former Express and Avonmore Dairy complex on Aldridge Road and the initial plans included the construction of a four-storey building, which received approval from Birmingham City Council in November 2005. The services offered at the Great Barr and Mason Road campuses were to be consolidated into the single campus at Aldridge Road. The sale of the campuses would fund the construction and plans were put forward for the construction of 89 houses and 31 flats of two and three storeys on the Great Barr campus site. The merger of Josiah Mason College and Sutton Coldfield College led to the plans being put on hold in 2006. Work towards the start of construction of the campus were due to commence in 2007 following the appointment of Christine Braddock as college principal from Matthew Boulton College. However, the college decided to change the plans following the merger so that the services at the Josiah Mason campus and Castle Vale campus could be incorporated onto the site. Tendering for a contractor commenced in March 2008. The new designs by Nicholas Hare Architects LLP for the campus were unveiled in mid-2008 and the project progressed with appointment of various companies to help manage the project. In August 2008, Concept were appointed as project managers while BAM Construction were appointed to construct the scheme and BAM Design were appointed as structural engineers. and the planning application was submitted on 16 October 2008. The planning application was approved by the city council on 18 December 2008. The approved designs included a six-storey building with of space on the site. The scheme is estimated to cost ¬£44 million. It was believed that construction would commence in April 2009 with completion due for the start of the new academic year in September 2010. Construction of the campus was reliant on the college being able to obtain a ¬£21 million grant from the Learning and Skills Council. However, in early 2009, the Learning and Skills Council announced that they were putting a freeze on capital programmes due to a lack of funds. LSC then announced that they would launch a cost-cutting programme. There were worries that the Riverside scheme could be classed as a \\"rebuild\\" by LSC, who had announced that a small number of \\"rebuild\\" projects would receive full funding. In July 2009, Sutton Coldfield College learned that it was not one of the thirteen shortlisted colleges to receive funding, placing the Riverside project in jeopardy as the college would only be able to apply for funding next in 2011.  Stourbridge campus  Stourbridge College was formed in 1958 as the Foley College of Further Education and College of Art, through the merger of the Stourbridge College of Art (founded in 1848) and the Stourbridge Technical School (founded in 1891). It was renamed Stourbridge College of Technology and Art in 1979. The college became a further education corporation in 1992, after the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The college merged with BMET in 2013. The main campus, built during the 1970s, is situated south of Stourbridge Town Centre. A second campus opened in 1990 within the buildings of the former Longlands School, after the school had closed to merge with High Park School to form the Ridgewood High School. A third campus opened in 2001 at the Merry Hill Waterfront, some four miles away in Brierley Hill. An additional Brierley Hill campus opened in September 2011, housing a new Art and Design centre, with a new technology centre currently being planned for the same site. Stourbridge College was closed down in 2019, leading to a call for enquiry from Stourbridge's MP, Margot James, alongside students being transferred to nearby Dudley College and Halesowen College, although many students chose not to - many citing issues with travel time and cost.

Among many honors, he became an honorary Companion of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Grey was born on 13 November 1875 and educated at the Erasmus Smith School in Dublin and as an engineer at the Crystal Palace School of Engineering. Grey's first job was as a staff writer for The Autocar. His secondary role as the magazine's aviation specialist resulted in a commission from Iliffe and Sons, Ltd. to edit a penny weekly aviation paper called The Aero. In 1911, in partnership with Mr E V (Later Sir Victor) Sassoon, Grey founded The Aeroplane, remaining as editor of the influential weekly until November 1939. He was a man of decided opinions as evidenced in his editorials for the magazine over three decades. Unfortunately for him these included strong support for the fascist dictators of Italy and Germany, which played no small part in his leaving the magazine. Grey took over as editor of the annual issues of Jane's All the World's Aircraft from 1916 to 1940. After leaving The Aeroplane, Grey served from 1939 as air correspondent of The Yorkshire Evening Post and the Edinburgh Evening News as well as various overseas journals. Grey also wrote a number of aviation books including A History of the Air Ministry (1940), The Luftwaffe (1944) and The Civil Air War (1945), the latter an opinionated review of likely post-war airline development and Britain's role in that process. \\"Anyone who read C G in the 'twenties and 'thirties without having met him might have supposed his critical references, and sometimes perverse and acid comments, reflected his nature and personality. Nothing could have been further from the truth. As long as we knew him he was a gentle and kindly man, always charming and generous to his friends, among whom he numbered rivals. Today there are men on Flight's staff who recall a kind word of encouragement here or a spot of advice there from the one-and-only C G, particularly when they were taking their first tentative steps in the hard and competitive world of journalism. His goodwill continued to be reflected in frequent correspondence. From the first to the last occasion upon which we talked to him, he never once failed to express either an original thought or to reveal an unexpected viewpoint on some current topic. Neither his writing nor his conversation was ever lacking in humour and regardless of one's age.\\" \\\\- Flight Magazine, 18 December 1953, published after Grey's death on 9 December 1953.

It is in the Thomas Combe collection at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.Tate Britain: Past Exhibitions The painting portrays a scene from the Bible. Two of Noah's daughters-in-law nurture the dove that has returned to the Ark bearing an olive branch. This is the second of Millais's paintings with biblical themes, following The Eve of the Deluge. Millais had some intention of producing a \\"pendant\\" painting titled The Dove's First Flight, but never did so. Millais's original plan for the painting was to include the figure of Noah, as well as including several animals in the background. The final omission of these other figures is thought to have been due to his desire to have the painting ready for the Royal Academy exhibition of 1851. The Return of the Dove to the Ark was first put on public display at the Royal Academy in April 1851. Millais was surprised to learn that some Roman Catholics who viewed it believed it to be an allegory for the return of the country to the \\"true faith\\". It was praised by John Ruskin and Th√©ophile Gautier, among others. Ruskin was so taken with it that he wished to buy it when he first saw it, but it had already been sold to the collector Thomas Combe, superintendent of the Clarendon Press, who owned many other Pre- Raphaelite works of art.Ashmolean Museum: Collections Online.

Hannibal is located on Wisconsin Highway 73 and County Highway M north of Gilman, in the town of Cleveland. Today Hannibal is quiet, but once it was a bustling little economic hub at the junction of two logging railroads. History In 1903 the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway cut up through the forest and swamps from the south, reaching the site of Hannibal before continuing to Jump River and beyond. The owners of the railroad named this stop \\"Hannibal\\" because they had previously run a business in Hannibal, Missouri. The Eau Claire, Chippewa Falls, and Northeastern Railway (a.k.a. Omaha) came through Hannibal from the west shortly after, on its way to Hughey on the Yellow River. The two railroads shared a depot where they crossed. These were logging railroads, built primarily to extract logs from the forests that covered the area.Nagel, Paul. S.M.&P.; RY. - The Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway, 1979. The first structure in Hannibal was a boxcar beside the SM&P;'s tracks. A little town quickly grew up at the crossing, with sawmills, saloons, the Kearney hotel, and dance hall, another hotel, a grade school, a livery stable, a blacksmith shop, a shoe shop, a meat market, Burss's general store, and Keefer's store. By 1910, all these were in place, mainly serving logging operations nearby. In 1912 the \\"Hannibal Manufacturing Company\\" was established southwest of the railroad junction, making lath, shingles and wagon wheel hubs. At its peak the mill ran around the clock and employed 30 men. In 1913 the Presbyterian church was started and the Guinn Brothers store opened, with an opera house upstairs. But that was probably the peak of the boom. A fire destroyed some businesses in 1913. Hannibal Manufacturing ceased operation in 1916. With major logging done, the SM&P; Railway finally shut down in 1934 and the Omaha in 1939. But the lumber companies sold the cut-over land to families and logging was replaced by farming. A cream collection station opened in Hannibal in 1915, and the Farmers Union Feed Store in 1923. A cheese factory operated there from 1924 to around 1945. A four-year high school opened on the west side of town in 1937 and operated until 1955. After that the building served as a grade school into the 1990s, and is now a Baptist church. Larmon's store and a gas station also operated into the 1990s. The town's post office closed on May 25, 2011. Now no businesses remain - only homes and the two churches, sprinkled among empty lots and old buildings. The one-time boom town is now usually quiet.

Harjo typically paints geometric forms composed of blocks of highly saturated color that form both abstract and highly stylized representational figures. The mosaic nature of his painting is reminiscent of Seminole patchwork clothing. He also works in pen and ink, allowing his comic influences to show through. Through printmaking, Harjo is able to experiment with texture and subtler palettes. His work is known for its humor, either in comical imagery or in witty titles.

All those things have inspired me at some point in my creativity. And he summarizes his artistic philosophy: It has always been my contention that one's art speaks from the soul of the artist and remains viable and open to the influences of the artist's environment. Forms, colors, and movement keep it from stagnating and allow it to grow as the artist matures and develops. I feel that my art covers a wide range of emotions, from serious to humorous, and that the colors I used radiate a sense of happiness and joy.

The result was a decisive victory for the Swedish Army. Prelude The Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, William V, as a Protestant ally of Sweden had campaigned in Westphalia, Ruhr area and the Sauerland, successfully reducing the imperial presence there. The imperial defense of the Weser area in 1633 was led by Jobst Maximilian von Gronsfeld.Guthrie (2003), p.238 The battle was preceded by a Swedish siege of the nearby imperial-held town of Hameln, laid in March 1633 with support of Hessian and L√ºneburgian troops.Bed√ºrftig (2006), p.73 Battle On 8 July, the Swedish army commanded by George, Duke of Brunswick- L√ºneburgJaques (2007), p.448Guthrie (2002), p.252 and Marshal Dodo zu Innhausen und Knyphausen faced an Imperial relief army commanded by Field Marshal Jobst Maximilian von Gronsfeld, Count John (Johann, Jean) of Merode and Lothar Dietrich Freiherr von B√∂nninghausen. Merode commanded 4,450 infantrymen and 1,245 cavalry troops, Bonninghausen 4,475 infantry and 2,060 cavalry, Gronsfeld 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. The armies met near Hessisch-Oldendorf, northwest of Hameln. Both armies attacked, a rare event in the Thirty Years' War, which besides Oldendorf only occurred in the Second Battle of Breitenfeld.Usually, one of the armies (the less numerous one), would take on a defensive position, while the other army (the more numerous one), would attack if its leader, having evaluated the defense of the opponent, found an attack promising. Guthrie (2003), p.121.Guthrie (2003), p.121 The left wing of the Swedish forces was commanded by the general of Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel and later imperial field marshal Count Peter Eppelmann Melander von Holzapfel.Guthrie (2003), pp.237-238 Subsequently, field marshal Torsten St√•lhandske led a Swedish brigade.Guthrie (2003), pp.46-47 Field marshal Gottfried von Geelen participated later in the battle on the imperial side.Guthrie (2003), p.201 Gronsfeld was captured after his wing was routed by Melander,Guthrie (2003), pp.238-239 leaving over 3,000 dead and wounded and 1,000 prisoner. The Swedes lost 700 soldiers.Burschel (1994), p.272 Aftermath The Swedish victory in Oldendorf and the subsequent victory in the Battle of Pfaffenhofen on 11 August balanced their defeat in the Battle of Steinau on 10 October. Overall, Swedish and Imperial forces were \\"on even terms\\" in 1633.Guthrie (2003), p.28 This only changed in the following year. While the Swedish forces won the Battle of Liegnitz on 8 May and the Battle of Landshut on 22 July, their defeat in the Battle of N√∂rdlingen on 6 September 1634 brought about a change in the balance of power.Guthrie (2003), p.29 Melander, the Swedish commander at Oldendorf, intrigued with the Holy Roman Emperor in 1635 to merge Hesse-Kassel's forces into the Imperial army and have Hesse-Kassel sign the Peace of Prague. These plans failed, and personal quarrels led him to leave service and to re-enter it as the Imperial commander of Westphalia in 1645. The Peace of Prague reconciled many Protestant states with the Holy Roman Emperor, most notably the Electorate of Saxony. As a consequence, Sweden's and Hesse-Kassel's forces stood alone against a growing anti-Swedish, pro-Habsburg coalition in 1635 - a disequilibrium eventually stirring France's intervention in the Thirty Years' War. In 1647, Hessisch-Oldendorf became the winter quarters of the Swedish army commanded by Carl Gustaf Wrangel retreating from Bohemia, followed by the then imperial commander Melander who took his quarters in Hesse.Guthrie (2003), p.234 Gallery File:Dodo von Knyphausen, Nordisk familjebok.gif|Dodo von Knyphausen File:Georg (Braunschweig-Calenberg) Residenzmuseum Celle.JPG|George, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg Notes Sources References Bibliography    Category:1633 in Europe Oldendorf 1633 Oldendorf 1633 Oldendorf 1633 Category:Battles in Lower Saxony ","title":"Battle of Oldendorf"},{"id":"24169621","text":"Northiam railway station is on the Kent and East Sussex Railway. It is located to the west of the level crossing on the A28 road linking the Kentish village of Newenden and the East Sussex village of Northiam. Having served the area for over sixty years, the station closed with the line in 1961, but was later reopened in 1990 by the Kent and East Sussex Railway heritage organisation.  History  Running in board Northiam was one of the original stations on the line opened by the Rother Valley Railway between Rolvenden and Robertsbridge in 1900. All the original three stations were slightly removed from the villages which they were purporting to serve; Northiam, which was in fact closer to Newenden, lay to the north of Northiam village.Course, E., p. 41. As with all K&ESR; stations except , Northiam had a simple wooden-frame, corrugated iron clad station building. A long curving passing loop ran between two platform faces; Northiam was the only station south of Tenterden to be afforded such facilities, possibly on account of its location half-way between and Tenterden. Two sidings led into a small goods yard and cattle dock to the south of the station. This saw use when, during the early part of the 20th century, Howse & Co. held fortnightly livestock sales in a nearby field. Two simple wooden bungalows were later erected in Northiam's goods yard as staff accommodation. By the 1950s, the second platform had fallen into disuse and British Railways had installed catch points to the goods yard sidings to prevent wagons rolling on to the main line.Scott-Morgan, S., p. 25. Regular passenger services on the line were withdrawn on Saturday 2 January 1954,Garrett, S., p. 47. the line between Tenterden and Robertsbridge remaining open for goods traffic until 12 June 1961.Course, E., p. 52.  Present day  Station looking east. Passenger services returned to Northiam on 19 May 1990 when the Kent and East Sussex Railway Preservation Society extended its operating line to the station. The project had required extensive repairs to the bridge over the River Rother on the Kent/East Sussex county boundary which, at , is the longest bridge on the line.Mitchell, V. and Smith, K., plate 45. The extension project featured in a 1989 episode of Challenge Anneka, the challenge being to restore the extant station building and lay sufficient track to allow a train to enter within 48 hours. The deadline was met and at 6.15pm on Sunday 23 July 1989, SECR P class locomotive no. 1556 was the first locomotive to return to Northiam station. The episode was broadcast on 20 October 1989. The extension was officially inspected on 14 May 1990 after completion of the track layout, installation of a water crane, surfacing of the platforms, rebuilding of the level crossing and erection of a new toilet block.Garrett, S., p. 99. The first services ran on 19 May 1990, and on 4 June 1990 the station was officially reopened by the Duke of Gloucester. The Northiam extension led to a record number of passengers using the line‚Äî81,934‚Äîthe highest since 1913. Initially only the Up platform was brought into use, it having been decided to reinstate the unrestored Down platform once the extension to Bodiam had been completed.

Ltd. 0930.hk) and the Chinese state-owned China Forestry Group Corporation (CFGC).State owned China Forestry Group Corporation (CFGC) website Sino-Forest Corporation (Sino-Forest) () () claimed at one time to be one of the leading commercial forest plantation operators in China. In 2011, the company was accused of fraud and found itself under investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Ontario Securities Commission. On March 30, 2012 Sino- Forest filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada. It also announced that the company would be sold or restructured, with the proceeds going to its creditors. On July 13, 2017, the OSC released its decision finding that Sino- Forest and four individuals, including former CEO Allen Chan, committed fraud.  History  The company was formed in 1994 and subsequently claimed that its principal businesses included the ownership and management of tree plantations and complementary manufacturing of downstream engineered-wood products. The company claimed to derive most of its revenue from the sales of wood fibre needed to produce industrial, commercial and residential wood products. Sino- Forest also held a majority interest in Omnicorp Limited, an investment holding company listed in Hong Kong (HK:0094) that in turn claimed to import wood fibre into China. Sino-Forest's common shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol TRE from 1995 until they were suspended in 2011, and its corporate office were in Mississauga, Canada. Sino-Forest had a market capitalization of just over $5 billion in November 2010. As of September 30, 2009, Sino-Forest claimed to have had approximately 757,000 hectares of trees under management and over 700,000 hectares of trees available to be acquired under six long-term master agreements. The company claimed to have plans to replant 200,000 hectares by 2012. Management further claimed that it expected to benefit from China's economic stimulus plan, which included further infrastructure development, rebuilding after Sichuan's 2008 earthquake and building of affordable housing for rural areas. Business segments At the end of September 2010, Sino-Forest Corp had claimed approximately 757,000 hectares of forest plantations located in southern China. Its principal business segments include Wood Fibre Operations (i.e. the ownership and management of plantation trees, the sale of standing timber and wood logs, the trading of wood products sourced domestically and internationally) and Manufacturing and Other Operations (i.e. downstream engineered-wood flooring and panels, seedling nurseries, greenery services). Subsidiaries Sino- Forest Corporation owned an interest of approximately 60% of Omnicorp Limited (to be renamed Greenheart Group Limited upon shareholder approval), a Hong Kong listed company (HK:0094). In addition, Sino-Forest owned HK$212 million of convertible bonds of Omnicorp, which if fully converted would increase Sino-Forest's interest to nearly 60% of the enlarged issued share capital of Omnicorp. The principal activities of Omnicorp's subsidiaries claimed to consist of log harvesting, lumber processing and marketing and sales of logs and lumber products to China and other countries around the world. Omnicorp claimed to own 60.4% of the harvesting and other rights in a 184,000-hectare hardwood forest concession in Suriname, South America and Sino-Forest, through its wholly owned subsidiary Sino-Capital Global Inc. owned the remaining 39.6%. Omnicorp also intended to acquire a high quality radiata pine plantation in New Zealand upon satisfaction of certain conditions as announced on November 3, 2010. ARCPE Sino-Forest Applied Research Centre for Pearl River Delta Environment (ARCPE) officially opened on 22 June 2009 at the Hong Kong Baptist University. The Centre remains active with Sino-Forest name. Reported financial position as of December 31, 2010 The company's claimed assets grew significantly from 2004 to 2010. The reported assets were: * 2004 $0.7 billion * 2005 $0.8 billion * 2006 $1.2 billion * 2007 $1.8 billion * 2008 $2.6 billion * 2009 $3.9 billion * 2010 $5.7 billion The December 31, 2010 audited financial statements reported Sino-Forest had: * $5.7 billion of assets * $2.4 billion of liabilities * 395 million of net income Fraud allegations On June 2, 2011, shares in Sino Forest plummeted following the release of a negative research report by Carson Block of Muddy Waters Research, which made allegations that Sino-Forest had been fraudulently inflating its assets and earnings, and that the company's shares were essentially worthless. Muddy Waters claimed that Sino Forest was a \\"multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme\\" that was \\"accompanied by substantial theft\\". Sino Forest rejected the allegations of fraud and launched an independent investigation by PricewaterhouseCoopers.Canadian regulators order Sino-Forest executives to resign - DealBook/New York Times, 26 Aug 2011 Shares in Sino Forest fell by 82% following publication of the Muddy Waters report,Sino-Forest Shares Surge After Wellington Management Discloses 11.5% Stake - Bloomberg, 5 July 2011 with prominent investor John Paulson selling his entire stake in the company at a $720 million loss.Paulson May Deal Clients $720 Million Loss - Bloomberg, 21 June 2011 On June 30, debt rating agency Standard & Poors downgraded Sino-Forest's long-term corporate credit rating from \\"BB\\" to \\"B+\\". A second downgrade to \\"B\\" followed on August 23. On August 15, 2011, Sino-Forest announced that the results of the PwC probe into the allegations would be delayed to the end of the year due to difficulties in gathering data from the Chinese companies involved.Sino-Forest Investigation Extended - Wall Street Journal, 16 Aug 2011 Suspension of Trading of Shares On August 26, 2011, the Ontario Securities Commission suspended trading of the shares of Sino-Forest, stating that the company had engaged in practices they \\"knew or should have known\\" perpetuated a fraud.Ontario regulator accuses Sino-Forest of fraud, halts trading of its shares - The Canadian Press, 26 Aug 2011 The OSC also initially ordered that five directors of Sino-Forest resign, but rescinded this demand a few hours later as the Ontario Securities Act does not allow the commission to summarily force the resignation of a company director without a hearing.Sino-Forest Trading Halted, OSC Rescinds Order - Bloomberg, 26 Aug 2011 Bankruptcy Protection On March 30, 2012, Sino-Forest filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada under the framework laid out in the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. On April 4, 2012, Sino-Forest's auditors, Ernst and Young, resigned. Defamation Lawsuit On March 29, 2012, one day before filing for bankruptcy protection, Sino-Forest sued Muddy Waters in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for defamation. Sino-Forest sought damages of $4 billion. In response to the lawsuit, Muddy Waters stated that Sino's bankruptcy protection filing vindicated its accusations since the company would not require bankruptcy protection if it was really generating close to $2 billion in cash flow. Settlement of Investors' Lawsuits In 2015, the firm's auditors Ernst and Young, a group of financial institutions (Credit Suisse Securities (Canada) Inc., TD Securities Inc., Dundee Securities Corp., Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Scotia Capital Inc., CIBC World Markets Inc., Canaccord Financial Ltd. and Maison Placements Canada Inc.), and former Sino-Forest chief executive David Horsley paid $117 million, $32.5 million and $5.6 million respectively to settle investor's lawsuits.  Ontario Securities Commission Decision  On July 13, 2017, the OSC released its decision finding that \\"Sino-Forest, Chan, Ip, Hung and Ho engaged in deceitful or dishonest conduct related to Sino-Forest‚Äôs standing timber assets and revenue they knew constituted fraud.\\" The OSC also found that the individual respondents violated Ontario securities law by misleading commission staff during the investigation.

He was the archbishop of Archdiocese of Santo Domingo from 1788 to 1798 and archbishop of \\"Santaf√© en Nueva Granada\\" (now known as the Archdiocese of Bogot√°) from 1798 to 1804. From a wealthy family, he entered the Dominican Order in 1743 at M√°laga, Spain, teaching philosophy during 1751-1756, theology, 1756-1758, and Holy Scriptures, 1758-1761. He moved to C√°diz, the seafaring gate of trade to the American Spanish Empire and earned a doctorate of divinity in nearby Jerez de la Frontera in 1767 He became a prior to sieges of the Dominican Order in M√°laga, Almer√≠a, Cabra, Ciudad Real and Do√±a Menc√≠a, training teachers of Christianity, dictionary editors and administrative tutors in aboriginal American Indian languages, North and South America, after the middle of the 16th Century. In 1788 Charles III of Spain proposed to Pope Pope Pius VI that Portillo be chosen as Archbishop of Santo Domingo, the primate siege of America, created in 1546. Difficulties on the Island of Hispaniola around 1798 led him to move the supposed remains of seafarer and discoverer Christopher Columbus to La Habana, Cuba, being kept at the Convent of San Juan de Letr√°n. Portillo was proposed by the Spanish Crown to the Roman Pope in 1798 as a Bishop of Trujillo, Peru, but instead Portillo became Archbishop of Bogot√°, a much higher position.

The action at Werl had been preceded by a general plundering of Vest and Recklinghausen by troops of Hermann Friedrich Cloedt and Martin Schenck which alienated the farmers and merchants of Westphalia from Gebhard's cause, although not specifically from Protestantism. Schenck used trickery to take the fortress at Werl, but was not able to completely overpower the guard. The arrival of a superior force outnumbering his by about 10 to 1, under the command of Claude de Berlaymont, cornered him in within the city's walls. In his subsequent withdrawal, he took a couple dozen civilian hostages, and escaped with his booty across the Rhine river. Context When Gebhard converted to Calvinism, married Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben in 1583, and declared religious parity for Protestants and Catholics in the electorate, the Cathedral chapter elected a competing archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria. Gebhardt refused to give up the ecclesiastical see, holding it with armed force where necessary; Ernst called in his brother, Ferdinand, for military assistance. Initially, the conflict was limited to troops of Waldburg, and the competing archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria. By 1585, these forces were stalemated, and each sought outside support, Waldburg from the Dutch and Ernst of Bavaria from the Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. L. Ennen, Geschichte der Stadt K√∂ln, Cologne, 1863‚Äì1880. 21 July 2009. The Sack of Westphalia In March 1586, Martin Schenck von Nydeggen took 500 foot and 500 horse to Westphalia, accompanied by Hermann Friedrich Cloedt, the commander of the fortified town of Neuss. Their goal was to secure two primary fortifications at Recklinghausen and Werl for Gebhard, and leave them fortified against attack by either Ernst's forces or those of the Duke of Parma. They crossed the Rhine river, and plundered several towns in Westphalia, including Hamm, Soest, Unna, Vest, and Waltrop, as well as the farmsteads and villages between them. In the course of their campaign, they also desecrated several churches, removing all the icons, tapestries, and furnishings, and, in Soest, harassing the clergyman. Johann Heinrich Hennes, Der Kampf um das Erzstift K√∂ln zur Zeit der Kurf√ºrstenpublished 1878, pp. 156-162, 21 July 2009. Cornered in Werl The Electorate of Cologne, circa 1580. The City of Cologne, although part of the archdiocese, was not part of the Electorate. After plundering Vest Recklinghausen, on 1 March Schenck captured Werl through trickery. He loaded a train of wagons with his soldiers and covered them with salt, a valuable commodity. When the wagons of salt were seen outside the city, the guards opened the gates and they were admitted at once. The \\"salted soldiers\\" then over-powered the guards and captured the town.Hennes, p. 157. Some of the defenders escaped to the Werl citadel. Schenck and his troops stormed it several times, but were turned away. When they could not capture the well- fortified citadel, they thoroughly sacked the city, theoretically to discourage any citizens from helping the guards in the citadel.Hennes, p. 158. Count Claude von Berlaymount, also known as Haultpenne, collected his force of 4000 and besieged Schenck in Werl, surrounding the city with heavy artillery and horse. Although he had a seemingly overwhelming force against Schenck's mere 500 or so soldiers, he was reluctant to shell the town. Although Schenck and Cloedt were surrounded outside, and attacked inside from the several hundred guards in the Werl citadel. They tried to break out once, but were forced back into the city, leaving some 50 of their own soldiers outside the gates when they were shut; these soldiers then escaped into the forest, and attacked several nearby farmsteads, waiting for their commanders to break out again.Hennes, p. 158-59. Inside the fortress Cloedt and Schenck loaded their wagons, this time with all their booty, took 30 magistrates as hostages, and attacked Haultpenne's force, killing about 500 of them, and losing 200 of their own. After fighting their way through Haultpenne's force, they made their way to Kettwick, and crossed the Rhine above Dortmund. Cloedt returned to his command at Neuss, which in a short time was surrounded and destroyed by Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. Schenck to Venlo on the Neuss river.Hennes, p. 159. Result For Schenck, the battle, and the campaign in Westphalia, was a success. He entered Westphalia as a soldier of fortune, and he left as a soldier with a fortune. Once he crossed the Rhine, he deposited his fortune and his wife in Venlo, and went to Delft to report to the Philip William, Prince of Orange. While there, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the English Governor-General of the Dutch, knighted him by order of Elizabeth I, and presented him with a chain valued at a thousand gold pieces.Ernest Alfred Benians The Cambridge Modern History, New York, MacMillan, 1905, p. 708. For Gebhard, the 1586 Battle of Werl specifically, and the sack of Westphalia generally, provided him with no specific gains and with some very concrete losses. Schenck failed to secure any reasonable fortresses for the long-term, which isolated Gebhardt's territories, and his forces, from any possible assistance from the Protestant princes in the east; they would have to fight through the Spanish army to send him any aid. The assets Schenck did acquire were largely plundered from farmers and merchants. Although they enhanced his and his soldiers' resources, they did little for Gebhard's declining financial situation, which, by this point, was in dire straits. Furthermore, little more than a paid brigand, Schenck alienated the population of Westphalia, if not from Protestantism at least from Gebhard's cause.Benians p. 708; Hennes, pp. 152-166. In the larger picture of the Cologne War, the failure of the Westphalia campaign and Schenck's retreat from Werl marked the beginning of the end for Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg's tenure as archbishop and prince- elector of Cologne. Once the Spanish threw their army into the fray, the balance of military force shifted rapidly to the Catholic side. The loss of the archbishopric of Cologne to the Catholic contender, Ernst of Bavaria, resulted in the consolidation of Wittelsbach authority in northwestern German territories, the Jesuit-run establishment of a Catholic Counter-Reformation stronghold on the lower Rhine, and the consolidation of Spanish bridgeheads on the Rhine river, via which Philip of Spain could assault the Protestant Dutch provinces.Benians p. 708; Citations Category:Counter-Reformation Category:Duchy of Westphalia Werl Category:1586 in Europe Werl 1586 Category:1586 in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Eighty Years' War (1566‚Äì1609) ","title":"Battle of Werl"},{"id":"24169688","text":"Pelican Lake is a lake located in Oneida County in Wisconsin.

By 2014, 26 cases had been documented in the medical literature, many in people with M√ºllerian dysgenesis who were engaging in urethral intercourse unknowingly. However, the stretching of the urethra required by this form of intercourse has also reportedly resulted in a complete and permanent loss of urethral sphincter control (urinary incontinence); furthermore such intercourse presents a very high risk of bladder infection to the receptive partner. It can also lead to permanent dilation of the urethra and incontinence during intercourse. Presenting symptoms of unintentional urethral intercourse include primary infertility, dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), and incontinence. More serious consequences include evisceration via the urethra and bladder rupture.

The plot events and related characters are described below using in-universe tone. Plot summary In this scenario, the adventurers follow a river and cross the desert to find an evil abbey. The adventure details a number of wilderness encounters. This scenario opens in a small village on the border of the Republic of Darokin. The party has answered the call to defend the Republic against the recently unified human and humanoid tribes of the vast Sind desert, bordering Darokin to the northeast. Having missed the departure of the main army, they are tasked with seeking out more information on the mysterious figure behind the enemy armies (the titular desert nomads). In the adventure that follows, the adventurers must tackle a series of wilderness encounters, including journeying up a sluggish river to its source, passing through a dismal salt marsh, crossing an inhospitable desert, and searching for a pass through the high and forbidding mountain chain on the far side of the desert. If successful, the adventure ends at an abbey situated on a mountain spur above the alpine meadows, after which the player characters may proceed with the second module in this series, the Temple of Death. Publication history X4 Master of the Desert Nomads was written by David Cook, with art by Tim Truman, and was published by TSR in 1983 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. This module was the first in the Desert Nomads series. Reception Imagine magazine's Doug Cowie reviewed X4 favorably. Although he felt it featured a \\"scarcely original plot,\\" the author had \\"built onto the stereotype with intelligence and imagination\\". As an example, Cowie noted that the players are hired, not as an elite force, but as part of the army reserve, consisting of \\"undesirables and unusables\\". According to Cowie, the module features a hazardous wilderness journey and several dungeon-style encounters. He thought that the designer \\"has done a good job of creating the atmosphere of a land at war\\" including encounters with patrols and even an enemy army. Cowie noted that the latter is \\"the kind of complicated encounter that most designers shy away from but David Cook handles it well.\\" Another large-scale encounter involves 100 bandits and 40-50 caravan guards and, according to Cowie, Cook provides a \\"perfectly workable system which allows the whole battle to be fought in a reasonable amount of time.\\" Cowie called the final encounter area a \\"classic corridors-and-rooms setting\\" with a \\"fine, threatening atmosphere and some good NPCs.\\" He also praised \\"a lovely twist in the plot that could put an unwary party into a lot of trouble.\\" The only drawback, Cowie thought, is that to progress to the end the players need to \\"make the correct deductions and choose the right courses of action at certain stages,\\" so those who prefer completely free player choice should \\"look elsewhere.\\" Calling it a \\"good module with some particularly noteworthy sections\\" he concluded his review by noting: \\"If you can accept the need for some player guidance and prompting, you will find it a worthwhile and enjoyable experience.\\" Rick Swan reviewed the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 71. Swan noted, \\"Not only does 'Master of the Desert Nomads' provide welcome relief from the tedious dungeon exploration all too common in TSR D&D; modules, it's a genuine epic in every sense of the word.\\" He complemented the encounters, saying they are \\"not only exciting in themselves, they also provide alert players clues and insights about the Master and his evil secrets,\\" and that \\"the DM will have no problem keeping track of the action.\\" He calls the ending \\"somewhat of a cheat,\\" because the characters never encounter the Master in this adventure, and felt that \\"the entire module is really just a prologue\\" to 'Temple of Death' and \\"it isn't very satisfying just played by itself.\\" He concluded by saying that, \\"Taken together, the 'Desert Nomad' series is one of the most imaginative and exciting adventures produced by TSR in quite a while.\\" References Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules Category:Mystara ","title":"Master of the Desert Nomads"},{"id":"24169735","text":"Obelya Metro Station () is a station on the Sofia Metro in Bulgaria.

The ground is compact and is lined on all sides by trees, with its northern side overlooked by residential housing. The Bounty was used intermittently by Hampshire County Cricket Club in the early 20th-century, before Hampshire began to play there annually from 1966 to 2000. The ground is owned by the Basingstoke Sports and Social Club and is used in club cricket by Basingstoke and North Hants Cricket Club. The ground has a capacity for major matches of 2,500, while its end names are called the Town End to the north and the Castlefield End to the south. History Cricket is believed to have been played at May's Bounty or in its vicinity as far back as 1855. The ground was originally known as The Folly, but was renamed in honour of Lt Col John May, a member of a Basingstoke family of brewers, who bought The Folly from Thomas Burberry to preserve it for sporting use, with the ground being donated to the cricket club playing there as a gift or \\"Bounty\\". The current Basingstoke and North Hants Cricket Club was founded in 1865, with the club playing at May's Bounty since then. The first match which was recorded at the ground saw Basingstoke play a United South of England Eleven.A match in progress at May's Bounty in 2005. The steeple in the background belongs to \\"All Saints Church\\" and the high rise office block in the distance is situated in Basingstoke town centre. Hampshire first played first-class cricket there in 1906 against Warwickshire in the County Championship, which Warwickshire won by 107 runs. The maiden first-class century there was also scored in this match by Warwickshire's Sep Kinneir. Hampshire played there just once more before World War I, playing Derbyshire in 1914, which saw Hampshire's Arthur Jaques taking what remains the best match figures at the ground with figures of 14/105. Hampshire would not return to the ground until 1935, when Hampshire played Surrey in the County Championship. It was during this match that Andy Sandham scored his hundredth hundred. The following season Hampshire played two first- class matches there, against Nottinghamshire and Cambridge University. In the match against Nottinghamshire, Hampshire made their lowest first-class total at the ground when they were dismissed for just 61. Hampshire played a final first-class match there before World War II against Worcestershire. Prior to the war, Hampshire had lost six of their seven matches at May's Bounty, including three by an innings. First-class cricket didn't return to the ground immediately after the war, with Hampshire next playing there in 1951 against Oxford University. It wasn't until 1966 that the ground started to become an annual feature on Hampshire's fixture list. The following season the ground held its first List A match when Hampshire played Lincolnshire in the 1967 Gillette Cup. The 1970s saw some records made at the ground which still stand to this day, including the best innings figures in first-class matches, made by Glamorgan's Malcolm Nash, whose spell of swing bowling in 1975 returned figures of 9/56. Other records made in that decade saw both the highest and lowest List A team totals, 251 and 43 respectively. The highest score in List A cricket at the ground was made in 1974 by Barry Richards against Glamorgan. Over the coming three decades the ground held one first-class and one List A match each season, an arrangement which lasted until the 2000 season, after which Hampshire centralised all their matches to their new Rose Bowl home. During his sustained period of use by Hampshire, the county played 35 first- class matches and 30 List A matches. A view of the ground looking north toward the Town End. Hampshire's Robin Smith hold the record for the most first-class runs at May's Bounty, having scored 977 runs at an average of 69.78, with six centuries. This despite Smith missing many matches due to Hampshire's Basingstoke fixture clashing with Smith's England Test duties at Lord's. Glamorgan's Alan Jones holds the highest individual first-class score at the ground, making an unbeaten 204 in 1980; this is the only double century to be made at the ground. Mark Nicholas and Gordon Greenidge also had favourable records at the ground. Cardigan Connor took the most wickets at the ground, with 40 wickets at a bowling average of 27.77, with the pitches typically favouring seam bowling and often producing low scoring encounters, despite the small size of the boundaries. In January 2007, Hampshire announced their intention to return to May's Bounty in 2008. In 2008 they played a single first-class match against Durham, which was a repeat of the grounds final first-class fixture in 2000, with Hampshire defeating that seasons eventual county champions by 2 wickets. Hampshire played a further two first-class matches there, in the 2009 County Championship against Yorkshire, and in the 2010 County Championship against Durham. However, the ground wasn't included on Hampshire's fixture list for 2011.

It was written by David Cook and published by TSR, Inc. in 1983. The module is intended for player characters of levels 6-10. Plot summary In Master of the Desert Nomads, the tribes of the Sind Desert have rallied together under the leadership of the enigmatic figure known as the Master, and it is the mission of the player characters to neutralize this threat to the Republic. In Temple of Death, the characters approach the Black Mountains and traverse the Great Pass through them to reach the land of Hule. Having negotiated the Great Pass, the adventurers must cross the \\"sanctified land\\" of Hule. Hule is an oppressive totalitarian state in which social orders are carefully defined, and where the Master's stronghold is located. The characters must make their way to Hule's capital without attracting the attention of the Diviners. The adventurers then need to penetrate the Dark Wood, to find the Temple of Death. The scenario includes wilderness, town, and dungeon encounters. Publication history Temple of Death was written by David Cook, with art by Tim Truman, and was published by TSR in 1983 as a thirty-two page booklet with an outer folder. It is the second part of the two-part Desert Nomads series, following Master of the Desert Nomads. Reception Dave Morris reviewed Temple of Death for White Dwarf #55, giving the module a rating of 10 out of 10 overall. Morris felt that David Cook \\"constructed a logical, continually challenging, imaginative and vividly portrayed adventure\\", and declared, \\"Frankly, I have not seen a better D&D; scenario than this.\\" Morris also praised the artwork by Timothy Truman. Morris felt that this module was \\"perhaps one of the three or four best role-playing supplements for any system\\" and gave it a superlative rating, adding, \\"my only regret is that the adventure was designed for Expert rather than Advanced rules.\\" Rick Swan reviewed the adventure in The Space Gamer #71, writing that the module: \\"soars with surprises at every turn\\", with locales such as \\"a zombie palace made entirely of fungus, a flying ship manned by skeletons, and a ladder of light that extends to the moon.\\" He also found the maps and illustrations \\"attractive and functional\\", and said the views of the Temple would help players visualize the unusual structure. He cautioned that because the adventure is largely set in the wilderness, it will challenge the Dungeon Master to keep the players headed in the right direction. He felt that the Master is \\"somewhat of a letdown\\" as he is \\"a pretty dull guy in light of what's come before\\". Swan felt that \\"the two Desert Nomads adventures can't enjoyably be played on their own\\" but concluded that \\"Taken with Masters of the Desert Nomads, Temple of Death is great fun\\". Steve Hampshire reviewed the scenario for Imagine magazine. He felt it was \\"well presented\\" and \\"thought out carefully\\", but contained \\"a few traps for the unwary DM\\" (e.g. a walled town without any gates shown on the map). Hampshire also thought the pace of the module uneven as the fast pace of the early encounters drops when the player characters go on an overland trek \\"of no special significance\\" ‚Äî whilst the finale \\"will stretch the abilities of most parties to the limit\\". In conclusion, Hampshire considered it a \\"fairly good module\\", but \\"not particularly inspired and rather marred\\" by some errors. He conjectured that the problems might be the result of not enough playtesting.

Roux claimed to be the reincarnation of Christ and was thus named the \\"Christ of Montfavet\\", a village on the commune of Avignon where he lived then. He wrote three books containing the doctrines of the religious group, including the rejection of several dogmas commonly accepted by the main churches (Jesus' divinity and resurrection, the existence of the Devil, and the accuracy of the Gospels, among other things). Vegetarian diet, high degree of proselytism and miraculous healings were the main practices of the organization. The group grew quickly in France and some other countries, counting several thousands of faithful, but memberships are currently on the decline. After Roux's death in 1981, the Universal Christian Church was replaced by the Universal Alliance, a cultural association founded in August 1983 and led by one of Roux's daughter. In the 1950s, the religious group was the subject of criticisms in the media when some faithful and their children died after having refused medical treatments, and was classified as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary report established by the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France. Founder Born on 14 June 1903 in Cavaillon from an unbeliever father and a Catholic mother, George Ernest Roux quickly abandoned the faith after reading Plato's works, and became factor in 1920. In the late 1920s, he went to Paris to try an artistic career, and composed, among other things, a poem (Le Cercle d'airain), a novel (Le toit de paille), and a one- act play (Le Bienheureux). On 12 April 1928, he married Jane Robert, and they had together six children raised in Catholicism. Then he founded a symphony orchestra and composed an opera (L'Aur√©ole) in 1939, but the beginning of the World War II forced him to resume service as inspector at the post office in Avignon, where it stayed until December 1953. His meticulous work earned him being appointed assistant inspector sorting of letters. In 1947, he said to have a gift of healing and began to miraculously heal thousands of patients in his detached house named \\"La Pr√©f√®te\\" in Montfavet, bought in 1933 by his mother. He published three spirituality-related books which explained his doctrine. In 1947, then in 1950, he revealed to his family that he was the incarnation of Jesus Christ, then made it publicly known in February 1954. On 15 August 1973, Roux even claimed to be God. He died on 26 December 1981. Organization In the early 1950s, some followers of Roux created the Christian Agency of Information (Agence Chr√©tienne d'Information, ACI) in the 10th arrondissement of Paris, 18 rue d'Enghien. From 1953, they published two monthly leaflets: Lumi√®re and Le T√©moin de la vie. On 24 December 1952, Roux, then known as the Christ of Montfavet or Georges-Christ, founded the Universal Christian Church whose faithful were widely named the Christ's Witnesses. There was no hierarchical structure: the local groups were informal and autonomous, but the most important ones (in Avignon, Paris, Strasbourg, Toulon) formed associations for organizational purposes. Roux's daughters Genevieve and Jacqueline, Jacqueline's husband Ren√© Van Gerding, and Ren√©'s sister Eva participated in the development of the church, while Roux lived cloistered in his property in Montfavet. On 15 June 1983, the Universal Alliance officially replaced the Universal Christian Church. Its statutes, filed at the Prefecture of Avignon, were modified in 2004. With about 500 subscribers, this cultural association aims to air and translate Roux's writings and to organize conferences by Jacqueline Roux. Sociologist R√©gis Dericquebourg defined the Christian Agency of Information as a \\"movement\\", the Universal Christian Church as an \\"ecclesia\\" and the Universal Alliance as a \\"circle\\". He considered the Universal Alliance a \\"network of thought and spirituality circles\\", which perpetuates Roux's teachings and has a Quaker and charismatic-related spirituality. Beliefs The doctrines are contained in three books written by Roux: Journal d'un gu√©risseur (1950), Paroles du gu√©risseur (1950) and Mission divine (1951),  * and explained in the monthly magazine Messidor, published from 1951 to 1977. Roux presented himself as a persecuted prophet, said to be Christ and to carry out the law of love unfulfilled by God's representatives including Jesus. He wrote a strong criticism of Christian churches deemed as apostate, asked in a letter Pope Pius XII to officially recognize his reincarnation and sent open letters to priests, occultists and theosophists. Roux denied the existence of the Devil, original sin, Jesus' virgin birth and resurrection, and the truthfulness of the Gospels. He taught that everyone could be a healer with prayer and blessing if he had faith in him. Roux announced the Last Judgment for 1 January 1980 at the latest and said that the Universal Alliance would have to spread across the world. In 1953, some disasters, including outs levees in the Netherlands and earthquakes in the Greek islands, were used by the religion as proof of the proximity of the Apocalypse. According to Le Monde, followers said in 1954 to believe in flying saucers. According to R√©gis Dericquebourg, this movement presents a new version of Christianity: there is no syncretism, but it is strongly tinged with Gnosticism and can be described as a \\"Christic esotericism\\". The founder was successively a mystagogue, then a prophet, and the group was first based on a personal and prophetic charisma, then a sacramental charism, then a group charism. The group defines itself as \\"christian\\", then \\"christic\\", also developed environmentalism and the \\"idea of a symbiosis between man and nature as the foundation of health and spiritual improvement\\". Practices In the Universal Christian Church, religious ceremonies began with a modified version of \\"Our Father\\" and ended with a meal together. The crucifix was not used. There were five sacraments: baptism, marriage, confirmation-communion, communion of mind in meetings, and funeral. The religious group proposed, but did not required, a vegetarian diet excluding cannings, potatoes, sugar, salt, alcohol, tobacco and tea. The faithful actively participated in proselytism by distribution of leaflets and door-to-door, and there was sometimes stands in some fairs of major cities and parades of sandwich boards in Paris. Several members, including veteran Jean Thos in Paris, were candidates for legislative elections of 2 January 1956; in its political program, the religious movement said wanting to follow God's will and pointed social issues as homeless, armament, exploitation of workers by employers. It obtained about 10,000 votes in six departments. In the Universal Alliance, there is no sacrament. The meetings, now called \\"communion of the flesh\\", are composed of spontaneous dialogues under divine inspiration. Evangelism is no longer required and children attend the public school. Membership Membership of the Universal Christian Church reached a peak of 5,000 between 1955 and 1960, in about fifty local groups (Marseille, Nantes, Paris, Strasbourg, Toulon, etc.). Members seem primarily urban, from middle class (teachers, employees...), and Catholic disillusioned by traditional religions. However, membership gradually decreased in subsequent years mainly because of Roux's death and various incidents in the late 1950s which reflected some difficult relationships with the society (child deaths, negative statements in the press, destruction of premises belonging to the group...). in the 2000, they are about 3,000 members of the Universal Alliance worldwide spread in francophone countries, Germany, Italy, U.S. and some countries in Africa,Anicet Kashamura, Culture et ali√©nation en Afrique: essai sur la vie quotidienne dans une soci√©t√© ali√©n√©e, 1972, p. 93 and shared out into fifty communities, and about 1,000 in France. Groups are mainly located in the Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur region and the Aude department. In the 1990s, Belgian press reported presence of followers and conferences by Jacqueline Roux in the country. Reception In the 1950s, refusals of medical treatments led to the death of several children, including a 13-year boy in October 1953, a young girl in March 1954, and a three-month baby in September 1954. These cases were the subject of a strong coverage in the press, particularly in Paris-Match. For their part, the church's leaders often tried, in news conferences, to justify these deaths, presenting them as \\"rewards offered to Christ\\". Deaths of adults were also mentioned in media (e.g. Willy Baruch in March 1954, Raymond Joutard in July 1954). However, Roux was never sued for unauthorized practice of medicine. In 1995, the Universal Alliance was included in the list of cults of the report by the French parliamentary commission. In 1996, Jacqueline Roux wrote to Alain Gest, a member of the commission, to question this classification, highlighting financial transparency, democratic nature and compliance with the law of her association. Because of its particular doctrinal views, the religious group is criticized by main Christian churches, including evangelical associations.

Developed by GAU Entertainment and published by Sega, the game was released in 1993.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. The player assumes the role of Ranger X, piloting a powered exoskeleton who leads the fight back for his home planet against the invading Rahuna forces.Ranger X manual (Sega Genesis, US) Ranger X is equipped with a jet pack and an assortment of weapons. The jet pack allows for short periods of flight, the duration of which is limited by the jet pack's temperature. Upon overheating, the player must land and wait for cool down. Alongside Ranger X's standard pulse rifle, the player has access to various special weapons including a flamethrower and homing attacks. Unlike the pulse rifle, the special weapons drain a power bar, which can only be recharged when Ranger X is in a bright light source. This special arsenal can be increased by collecting power ups scattered across the levels. On certain levels, the player may also control a supporting vehicle - an Ex-Up, such as Indra - a futuristic motorcycle, a premise described as \\"RoboCop on a Harley\\". Indra can move and fire independently of Ranger X, although Ranger X can enter it to take advantage of its separate shielding. The game is split across several levels, each of which is introduced via a wire frame 3D cutscene detailing a specific target objective. The player must battle through enemy forces and destroy all target objectives, followed by the stage boss, in order to progress.  Development and release  Ranger X was first project to be developed by GAU Entertainment (now Nex Entertainment), a Japanese video game developer founded by former Wolf Team staff, with both Toshio Toyota and Toshio Yamamoto serving as designers, with artist Ree Senfhu co-creating the pixel art, in addition of Yoshinobu Hiraiwa acting as composer and Noriyuki Iwadare creating the sound effects. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). The team recounted the project's development process and history through various Japanese publications. Ranger X was the first project to be developed by GAU Entertainment for the Sega Genesis. Yamamoto claimed that the team created Ranger X with a lot of intuition without copying other titles, not wanting to be bounded with the need to imitate others, as their goal was to make a Sega Genesis game of high- quality. However, Yamamoto commented that the team did not thought about the graphics but due to the emphasis on creating a polished game, the visuals ultimately had \\"a lot of shine too.\\" Yamamoto remarked that the team did not use game design documents, as the team added elements on the fly when memory space was available. Both Toyota and Yamamoto wanted the animations to feel intricate, as robots have more possibilities and the team worked to make as much animations as possible for sprites. Toyota had thought about creating a side-scrolling robot action game on Sega Genesis for a time, not using any example as he dislikes imitating others while also stating that the team started with a question regarding what makes a game fun, with Ranger X being the final result. Toyota stated GAU created custom software tools that allowed the team with pushing the hardware capabilities of the Mega Drive to its limits. Toyota also stated that working with the Sega Genesis was easy to develop for despite various issues, claiming that increasing the number of colors on-display was easy through hardware tricks while remarking that the Genesis's problem with colors \\"isn‚Äôt so much a numerical/quantitative problem, as it is a question of subtlety on the designer‚Äôs part.\\" As Ranger X is an action-shooter game, Hiraiwa wanted exciting and lively sounds as a basis but he went towards a darker tone for compositions, leaning towards surrealism and energetic, which matched his personal view of the title. Hiraiwa stated that the choice of colors reflects the music's tone, which lead him to write 23 songs with a rock and progressive rock touch as he did not want music feel similar to each other. Iwadare spent time creating unique sound effects not heard in other games at the time while making patches with tonal variety for the guitar sound, stating that sound effects are \\"more on par with the music in terms of importance.\\" Ranger X was first published by Sega in Japan on May 28, 1993, then in Europe on August 1993 and later in North America on October of the same year.  Reception  Critical reception was generally positive. Mega praised the tactical opportunities offered by the different weaponry, and the need to manage the supporting vehicle. Similar sentiments were echoed in Sega Force Mega and GamePro, who felt that \\"the unique dual action of flying and riding a motorcycle gives this game a step up against over other shooters\\". The graphics impressed, with some reviews claiming that Ranger X had broken through the Mega Drive hardware's color limitations. Almost every aspect of the graphics were praised, from the detail of the backgrounds, to the clarity of the sprites, and even the presentation of the cutscenes. EGM felt that Ranger X featured \\"some of the best graphics ever seen on the [Mega Drive]\\". MegaTech however, noticed that the game exhibited \\"a bit of sprite flicker when things get busy\\". Not all criticism was positive, while some felt the difficulty was just right, and welcome in an age of \\"too-easy games\\", others felt that it could be too difficult for novices. Some reviewers at EGM also found the controls lacking, making effective movement difficult and frustrating. Still, the game received recommendations from the majority of critics, with Mega concluding that \\"it's so chocka full of imagination, that you'll be left wondering why other shoot 'em ups are so repetitive\\".

The school is located adjacent to Couch Park. The playground at Couch Park doubles as the playground for the school. History Couch School In 1913 Portland voters were asked to consider a school budget that included new construction to modernize Portland schools. The dilapidated \\"Couch School\\", an 1883 structure that had recently closed to contain an outbreak of smallpox, would be torn down, and a new Couch School would be built in 1914 at a cost of $177,000. The architect for the new school was Floyd Naramore, newly employed as architect and superintendent for Portland Public Schools. Naramore was responsible for many Portland school designs including Benson Polytechnic High School and Shattuck School. Reflecting modern standards of the day, Tudor Revival was chosen as the style for Couch School. Both the 1883 school and the 1914 school were named for Captain John Heard Couch, an early settler whose land became known as the Couch Addition when Northwest Portland was platted. Metropolitan Learning Center In 1968, Portland Public Schools began an experimental study environment at Couch School designated the Metropolitan Learning Center. Starting with 150 students from Couch School and other sites, the center encouraged students to create their own instructional environment‚Äîstudents were free to pursue subjects that interested them rather than following a strict curriculum set by teachers. Moreover, students were not grouped by age and did not receive grades. The center worked with Portland State College, later Portland State University, and Reed College to offer student teachers a central role in classroom instruction. Couch School and MLC shared the same principal, Amasa Gilman. According to Gilman, the plan resulted in fewer discipline problems and higher attendance than at the conventional Couch School. Gilman continued as principal of MLC until 1975, when Portland Public Schools transferred him to a new location. His removal sparked protests among MLC students and staff. Eventually, the distinction between the conventional Couch School and the experimental learning center it was hosting was dropped, and the entire school came to be known as the Metropolitan Learning Center. In 2016, the Northwest District gas explosion occurred two and a half blocks away from MLC while many 10th grade students were taking their PSAT/NMSQT tests. Students were evacuated to the school district headquarters. Student profile In 2016, 91% of the school's seniors received their high school diploma. Of 35 students, 33 graduated and 2 dropped out.\\"Metropolitan Learning Center: Schools Guide\\". The Oregonian. Archived from the original on December 1, 2017. The student population during the same year was 79.9% White, 9.1% Hispanic, 2.1% Asian, 1.6% African American, 0.2% Native American, and 7% mixed race. As of 2017, less than five percent of MLC students are learning English as a second language.\\"Metropolitan Learning Center: Schools Guide\\". The Oregonian. Retrieved December 1, 2017. In 2019, 17 out of 21 students graduated, and 4 dropped out. Academics According to MLC's 2017‚Äì2018 school profile, the school began \\"as a challenge to the notion that educational rewards must be extrinsic and maintains the belief that personal relationships between staff and students are paramount.\\" Accordingly, MLC does not issue letter grades, instead using a four category rating system (\\"Exceeds\\", \\"Proficient\\", \\"Developing\\", or \\"Does Not Meet\\") to evaluate students. Each category is assigned a grade point average range to show how the ratings can be translated onto a 4.0 scale.  Athletics and Extra- curriculars  MLC had a short-lived high school basketball team called the Underdogs. Elementary and Middle schoolers often have their own rec sports teams through Portland Parks & Recreation. Elementary and Middle school students sign up for electives which take place two or three times a week in the afternoon. Each term brings new elective choices which are taught by teachers, parents, older students, and other volunteers on a variety of subjects. The High School has multiple clubs including a yearbook club. The now defunct Portland Chapter of the National Youth Rights Association, known as the Portland Student Rights Association, was based at MLC.  In Popular Culture  The beginning of the 1993 made-for-TV short film Without Warning: Terror in the Towers with James Avery, George Clooney, and Andre Braugher was filmed on the blacktop of MLC. In Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, MLC is used as the interior of Jamie's school. A scene in Drugstore Cowboy showed the characters escaping and passing MLC.

Her work on Caliphate also made her a Pulitzer Finalist again, \\"[f]or dissecting the power and persistence of the ISIS terror movement, through relentless on-the-ground and online reporting, and masterful use of podcast storytelling.\\" In May 2018, the reliability of Huzaifa's story had received concerns from television journalist Diana Swain of CBC News, who suggested that he may be \\"lying\\" to The New York Times.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/isis-abu-huzaifa-investigators-1.4669769 In September 2020, the Canadian ‚ÄúAbu Huzaifa‚Äù whose real name was Shehroze Chaudhry, was arrested by Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and charged under Canadian hoax laws for fabricating his story on social media of traveling to Syria and joining ISIS, which was covered by the Caliphate podcast produced by The New York Times. His case is ongoing.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/shehroze-chaudhry-terrorism- hoax-charge-1.5739814 In response to criticism of Caliphates depiction of Chaudry's story, the Times announced on September 30 that the paper would begin a \\"fresh examination\\" of the series' reporting.

He was styled His Highness Duke Paul Frederick of Mecklenburg. German soldier and sailor Duke Paul Frederick Charles Alexander Michael Hugh of Mecklenburg was born in Schwerin, the eldest child of Duke Paul Frederick of Mecklenburg and his wife, Princess Marie of Windisch-Graetz. Duke Paul Frederick was a grandson of Frederick Francis II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg. Shortly after his birth he became the youngest soldier in the world when he was admitted as a soldier into the German Imperial Army and assigned to the 15th Mecklenburg Dragoons by Emperor William I. Duke Paul Frederick and his siblings were raised as Roman Catholics and were brought up in Venice, where his family became friends with Cardinal Sarto (later Pope Pius X), who was a regular visitor to the family. On 21 April 1884 Duke Paul Frederick's place in the line of succession to the throne of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was superseded by his uncles after his father renounced his own and his descendants' rights of succession. However, in the event of his uncles' families becoming extinct, Duke Paul Frederick's line could succeed, as long the successor converted from Roman Catholicism to Protestantism. Despite being put into the Army shortly after his birth, Duke Paul Frederick eventually pursued a career in the German Imperial Navy. He rose to the rank of lieutenant and in 1902, while serving on the training ship , crossed the Atlantic to visit the United States of America and cruise in the Southern waters of the country.

He was disqualified at the restoration of the monarchy from holding any public office. Early life Christopher Packe was son of Thomas Packe of Kettering or Grafton, Northamptonshire, and Catherine his wife, was born about 1593. He seems to have been apprenticed at an early age to one John Kendrick, who died in 1624, and left him a legacy of ¬£100. Packe married a kinswoman of his master Kendrick, set up in business in the woollen trade on his own account, and soon amassed a large fortune. He was an influential member of the Drapers' Company, of which he became a freeman, and he served the office of master in 1648. On 9 October 1646, by an ordinance of parliament, he was appointed a trustee for applying the bishops' lands to the use of the Commonwealth. cites: Husband, Collection of Publicke Orders, 1646, 922‚Äì5. Political career His connection with municipal affairs began on 4 October 1647, when he was elected alderman of Cripplegate ward. On midsummer day 1649 he was chosen one of the sheriffs of London and Middlesex, and on 2 October following was elected alderman of Cornhill, but declined to desert Cripplegate ward. cites: City Records,'Repertory', Reynardson and Andrews, fol. 504 b) His wealth, ability, and zeal for the parliamentary cause soon brought him extensive public employment. In 1649, and perhaps earlier, he was one of the commissioners of customs. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1650, p. 611. He was also a prominent member, and subsequently governor, of the Company of Merchant Adventurers, and probably on this account was frequently appointed, with other aldermen, to advise the council in commercial controversies. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1653-1654 pp. 64‚Äì5, 1654 pp. 148, 315, 1655‚Äì6 pp. 176, 316, 523. According to Thomas Burton's 'Diary' (1828, i. 308‚Äì10), Packe fought hard at the meeting of the committee of trade on 6 January 1656 ‚Äì 1657 for the monopoly of the Merchants Adventurers (of which he was then governor) in the woollen trade. The committee, however, decided against him. In 1654 he was one of the treasurers (with Alderman Vyner) of the fund collected for the relief of the Protestants in Piedmont. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1654, passim. This involved him in considerable trouble. The money was kept back for several years; various instructions were given him by the council for its disposal, and nearly ¬£8,000 of the amount was lent by the treasurers to public bodies. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1659-60, p. 589). Ultimately the matter came before the House of Commons, which resolved, on 11 May 1660, that the money should be paid to the treasurers by ¬£2,000 monthly from the excise, the house also \\"declaring\\" detestation of any diversion of the money. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1660-1 ; cf. also State Papers, Dom. 1657-8 and 1659-60 passim. Packe was also one of the city militia, and treasurer at Avar, receiving in the latter capacity threepence in the pound on all contributions received or paid by him. cites: Mystery of the Good Old Cause, 1660, pp. 44‚Äì5. Packe became Lord Mayor on 29 October 1654, and on 26 March 1655 the Protector, on the advice of the Council of State, thanked him and the rest of the militia commissioners of London \\"for their forwardness in execution of their trust\\". cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. Ser. 1655, p. 96. He received orders from the Council on 3 July to prevent a meeting taking place \\"in the new meeting-house at Paul's\\" at which one John Biddle was to argue against the divinity of Jesus Christ. cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. Ser. 1655, p. 224. The council also appointed him one of the committee of trade on 12 July, cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. Ser. 1655, p. 240. and he was knighted by Oliver Cromwell at Whitehall on 20 September. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1655, pp. 393-4. On 31 October he was made an admiralty commissioner. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1655. p. 402. Packe was also chosen with others on 15 November 1650 to meet the committee of council appointed to consider the proposals of Manasseh Ben-Israel on behalf of the Jews. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1655-6, p. 23. On 25 March 1656 he was appointed one of the commissioners for securing peace in the city of London. cites: Cites: State Papers, Dom. 1655-6, p. 238. In the following August Packe was presented by the hackney coachmen with a piece of plate to support them in keeping out the parliamentary soldiers who were then seeking civil employment as coachmen among other jobs. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1656-7, p. 75. The sum of ¬£16,000 was still due to the state from Packe and his fellow commissioners of customs, and, after several petitions and inquiries by the treasury, Packe and two others were discharged from a share in the obligation, but Alderman Avery and Richard Bateman were not acquitted. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1656-7, pp. 84, 253‚Äì4, 291‚Äì2, 1657‚Äì8, pp. 8‚Äì9, 106‚Äì7. In September 1657 Packe appears as one of the committee of Parliament for farming the customs, cites: State Papers, 1657-1658, p. 94. and on 25 March he was made, with Sir Thomas Vyner, treasurer of the fund for the relief of Protestant exiles from Poland and Bohemia. In January 1655-6 Cromwell and his council proposed to send Packe, with Whitelocke, on an extraordinary embassy to the king of Sweden, so as \\"to manifest the engagement of the city in this business, and in it to put an honour upon them\\". cites: Whitelocke, Memorials, 1682, p. 619. Packe was a representative of the city in Cromwell's last parliament, summoned on 17 September 1656, and on 23 February 1657, although he was not the author, he brought forward his celebrated \\"remonstrance\\", afterwards called the \\"Humble Petition and Advice\\", desiring the Protector to assume the title of king, and to restore the House of Lords. Although was agreed to by the House of Commons, cites: Journal, vii. pp. 496, 512. Cromwell turned down the offer to become king possibly due to the pressure placed upon him by republicans in the army and Parliament. Instead a modified Humble Petition and Advice was accepted with Cromwell keeping the title of Lord Protector and able to nominate his successor, the creation of a second parliamentary chamber and triennial parliaments. Packe, with another city alderman, Robert Titchborne, was a member of the new House of Lords early in 1658. The new lords obtained no right of precedency over their brother aldermen. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1663-1664, pp. 371‚Äì2. On 11 May Packe lent ¬£4,000 to the state to pay the wages of the fleet lately returned into port. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1658-9, pp. 17, 290. On the Restoration Packe signed a declaration, 5 June 1660, together with the lord mayor, one of the sheriffs, and ten other aldermen, of \\"their acceptance of His Majesty's free and general pardon, engaging by God's assistance to continue His Majesty's loyal and obedient subjects\\". cites: City Records, Repertory,' Alleyne, fol. 83. But he was included by the commons (13 June 1660) in a list of twenty persons who were to be excepted from the act of general pardon, and to suffer certain penalties, not extending to life, to be determined by a future act of parliament. This clause was thrown out by the Lords on 1 August; but on the next day they resolved that sixteen persons, among whom Packe was included, should be disqualified from holding in future any public office or employment under penalty of being excepted from the act of pardon. cites: Parliamentary History of England, 1808, iv. 70-1, 91. Packe was accordingly, with six other Commonwealth lord mayors, removed from the office of alderman, his last attendance at the court of aldermen being on 7 August 1660. His interest at court, however, nearly availed him to procure a baronetcy for Christopher, his younger son, a grant for which was issued on 29 March 1666; but, for some unknown cause, the title was not actually conferred. cites: State Papers, Dom. 1665-6, p. 322, 1666-7, p. 467. Packe's city residence was in Basinghall Street, immediately adjoining Blackwell Hall, the headquarters of the woollen trade. cites: Stoave, Survey of London, 1720, bk. iii. p. 68. He also had a suburban house at Mortlake. cites: Lysons, Environs of London, 1796, i. 375. On 2 March 1649 ‚Äì 1650 the lease of the manor of Prestwold in Leicestershire was assigned to him by the corporation, who held it in trust for the orphan children of John Acton. cites: City Records, 'Repertory,' Foot, fol. 74. Shortly afterwards this manor, with the neighbouring one of Cotes, was assigned to him by Sir Henry Skipwith, the stepfather of these orphans. cites: Nichols, Leicestershire, vol. iii. pt. i. p. 354. Later life After his forced retirement from public office, he spent the remainder of his life at the mansion of Cotes. He also purchased on 19 January 1648 ‚Äì 1649, for ¬£8,1741. 16s. 6d., the manor of the bishops of Lincoln at Buckden in Huntingdonshire, which was for some time his occasional residence. Packe died on 27 May 1682, and was buried in Prestwold church, Leicestershire, where there is a fine monument to his memory on the north wall of the chancel. notes: \\"figured and described in Nichols's Leicestershire, vol. iii. pt. i. p. 360, and plate 53.\\" The Latin inscription states that he was about eighty-four years old at his death. Family Packe married three times: first, to Jane, daughter of Thomas Newman of Newbury, merchant draper, by Ann, daughter of John Kendrick, who was mayor of Reading in 1565; secondly, to Anne, eldest daughter of Simon Edmonds, alderman of London; and thirdly, to Elizabeth (born Richards), widow of Alderman Herring. He had no issue by his first and third wives; but by his second wife, Anne, who died in 1657, he had two sons, Christopher and Simon, and three daughters, Anne, Mary, and Susanna. Packe is an ancestor of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on his mother's side. The Packes bore for their arms argent, on a chief azure, three anchors or.

Mining operations Domestic The company's key mines are in Inner Mongolia and Tibet. Chang Shan Hao (CSH) is the gold mine in Inner Mongolia and will produce about 200,000 ounces in 2014 according to the company's guidance. In 2008, Ivanhoe Mines sold a controlling stake of 42 percent in Jinshan Gold Mines to China National Gold. The two companies also agreed to establish a \\"Strategic Chinese Exploration Partnership.\\" The company began developing the Jiama gold and copper mine in Tibet in 2008, undertaking a $520 million investment that was then the largest mining project in the province. To maintain good relations with local communities, the company announced the hiring of 191 locals and stated 35% of the workforce was non-Han, the highest percentage of any mine in China. A landslide in March 2013 buried a worker's camp, killing 83 miners, two of whom were Tibetans. Government officials explained that the landslide was caused by a \\"natural geological disaster\\" rather than related to mining work. An article by The Economist questioned the building of a worker's camp in an area of hazardous geology. In April 2016, China Gold acquired an 82 percent stake in the Jinfeng gold mine in southern Guizhou province from Eldorado Gold for $300 million. Subject to regulatory review, the purchase was approved in September of the same year. International In pursuit of additional gold mining assets, the parent company and its international development subsidiary, China Gold International Resources, is active in scouting for overseas gold mines. Explaining the acquisition strategy to the South China Morning Post, Song Xin, the chief executive of China Gold International Resources, stated the company was zealous in scouting for gold, copper, and silver mines across the world in both developed and developing countries. He stated that the company's current preference is for acquisitions and partnerships in countries close to China, specifically Mongolia, Russia and in Central Asia, but is also eyeing Canada, Australia and the US and destinations for investments. Africa The company has been in talks with Banro, a Canadian gold mining company, to form a joint venture to develop mines and the supporting electricity supply in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Preliminary talks between the miners were reported in April 2011 when the companies signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU). China Gold made a bid at the end of 2012 for the Tanzania operations of Barrick Gold in a deal that would have exceed $2 billion. However the deal didn't go through because of disagreements that included the sharing of surprise tax increases levied by Tanzania to take advantage of the capital gains bonanza from a successful deal and indemnification for a past violent episodes between Barrick and villagers. Despite this setback, enthusiasm for deal making was reiterated in a September 2013 comment made by China Gold executive Jerry Xie to Reuters when he stated the company continued to look for big potential deals. In December 2013, China Gold acquired Soremi, a copper mining subsidiary located in the Republic of Congo, from the Gerald Group, a US-based metals trading company. This marked the beginning of a joint venture between China Gold and the Gerald Group to further develop the project. In 2014, China Gold chief executive Song Xin confirmed that talks about investments into the African assets Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. were no longer active, after talks had started in the previous year. Central Asia CNGC in January 2012 acquired the Kuru-Tegerek Copper-Gold deposit, a copper and gold mine located in the Kyrgyz Republic, for $21 million from the Chaoyue Group. The mine contains 97.36 tons of gold and 1.02 million tons of copper. Other business areas The company is mainly engaged in mining. However, it also has a retail business offering custom-designed gold and silver bars. Outside of mining and minerals, the company is involved in irradiation sterilization services to food, medical, and cosmetics companies in China, Hong Kong, and Macao. Subsidiaries are also engaged in contract engineering, import and export, and labor services for more than 40 overseas companies. China Gold also produces gold industry news publications and is the official news outlet for the Shanghai Gold Exchange and Shanghai Diamond Exchange. It is the only Chinese company representing China on the World Gold Council Board.

Birth and death dates as given in the ODNB which differ from those in the older DNB Life Packe, born in Norwich in 1760, was son of a quaker merchant belonging to a family which claimed connection with that of Sir Christopher Packe, lord mayor of London. Packe showed an early taste for painting, but at first was engaged in his father's business. On that, however, being seriously injured by pecuniary losses, Pack adopted painting as a profession, and came to London. He made friends with John Hamilton Mortimer, and also obtained an introduction to Sir Joshua Reynolds, making some good copies of the latter's portraits. In 1786 Packe exhibited a portrait of himself at the Royal Academy, and in 1787 two more portraits. He then returned to Norwich to practice as a portrait-painter, and shortly after went to Liverpool. Having a recommendation from Reynolds to the Duke of Rutland, then viceroy in Dublin, he resided there for some years, and obtained success as a portrait-painter. About 1796 he returned to London, and exhibited at the Royal Academy two portraits, together with \\"Gougebarra, the Source of the River Lee, Ireland,\\" and \\"Edward the First, when Prince of Wales, escaping from Salisbury, is rescued by Mortimer.\\" Pack returned to Dublin in 1802 where he flourished and he continued exhibit and teach. In 1812 he was president of the Society of Arts in 1812 and was vice-president of the Royal Hibernian Society in 1814. By 1820 his fortunes were waning and in 1822 left Dublin and returned to London. Pack contributed works in oil and watercolours to the British Institution for 1825 until 1839 and had some works displayed at the Royal Academy in 1822 and 1840. In exhibition catalogues his name appears as \\"C. Pack\\", \\"F. C. Pack\\" or \\"F. Christopher Pack\\". He also made landscapes in pastels, and reproduced some of his earlier Irish views in aquatint (the proofs of which were signed \\"F. Chris Pack\\").

Other oil fields are shown in gray. The Beverly Hills Oil Field is a large and currently active oil field underneath part of the city of Beverly Hills, California, USA, and portions of the adjacent city of Los Angeles. Discovered in 1900, and with a cumulative production of over 150 million barrels of oil, it ranks 39th by size among California's oil fields, and is unusual for being a large, continuously productive field in an entirely urban setting. All drilling, pumping, and processing operations for the 97 currently active wells are done from within four large \\"drilling islands\\", visible on Pico and Olympic Boulevards as large windowless buildings, from which wells slant diagonally into different parts of the producing formations, directly underneath the multimillion-dollar residences and commercial structures of one of the wealthiest cities in the United States. Annual production from the field was 1.09 million barrels in 2006, 966,000 barrels in 2007, and 874,000 in 2008, and the field retains approximately 11 million barrels of oil in reserve, as estimated by the California Department of Conservation. The largest operators as of 2009 were independent oil companies Plains Exploration & Production and BreitBurn Energy.DOGGR database: well production sums Setting Detail of the Beverly Hills Oil Field, showing its position relative to Beverly Hills and Los Angeles, and also showing the locations of the four active drilling islands. A fifth, inactive drilling island west of Beverly Hills High School is not shown. While the oil field is unusual for being entirely within the confines of a large city, it is but one of many in the Los Angeles basin which are now overbuilt by dense residential and commercial development. The field is long and narrow, about four miles (6 km) long by a half-mile to mile across. Its long axis is aligned in a generally east-west direction, extending from the vicinity of the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Glen on the west, east along Pico Boulevard, past La Cienega and Fairfax Avenue, to around the intersection of Pico and Hauser. From north to south the field is much narrower, extending near the middle of the field from near Monte Mar Drive in Los Angeles to about two blocks north of Olympic Blvd in Beverly Hills. The total productive area of the field, projected to ground surface, covers about . In most oil fields, wells are drilled at optimum spacing for petroleum extraction with the boreholes going straight down into the target formations. Since this method of field development is not possible in a large city with no open land, all the wells tapping into the Beverly Hills field are clustered into four drilling islands‚Äîoil production and processing facilities tightly packed into windowless, soundproofed buildings‚Äîso as to have a minimal impact on adjacent land uses. The westernmost of these buildings, containing wells and which accesses the designated West Area of the field, is on the grounds of Beverly Hills High School at the corner of Olympic Blvd. and Heath Avenue, just southeast of the baseball diamond. This facility also houses storage tanks, several oil-water separator units, a pump house, compressor house, and an office building.Horowitz, p. 8. A facility similar to the one adjacent to Beverly Hills High School, operated by BreitBurn Energy, is north of Pico between Doheny Drive and Cardiff Ave. Yet another drilling island, the largest of the four, containing over fifty active wells and operated by Plains Exploration & Production, is north of Pico between Genesee Avenue and Spaulding Avenue. This drilling island also contains wells that angle northeast into the Salt Lake Oil Field. Within the boundary of the adjacent Cheviot Hills Oil Field, and on the grounds of the Hillcrest Country Club about south of the intersection of Pico Boulevard and Century Hill East, is a fourth, smaller drilling island, operated by Hillcrest Beverly Oil Corp. This small drilling island includes 12 active wells directionally drilled into the Beverly Hills Oil Field, as well as several others drilled into the Cheviot Hills Field.California Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources The operators of a fifth drilling island, located at the northern corner of Avenue of the Stars and Constellation Boulevard in Century City, finished abandoning it in 1990. Originally constructed in the 1950s on what was then an unused back lot of Twentieth Century Fox Studios, its production steadily declined in the 1970s, and by 1989 the last well was shut down. Land use changes and soaring real estate values contributed to its elimination.DOGGR 1990 Annual Report, p. 15‚Äì16.

Frost, Urban Development of Oil Fields in the Los Angeles Basin Area, 1983 to 2001. Publication No. TR52, California Department of Conservation. p. 2. Geology Beverly Hills Oil Field Structure Map The field is a faulted anticlinal structure with oil trapped by a combination of structural and stratigraphic mechanisms. Bounding the field on the south is the Brentwood-Las Cienegas Fault, and the field ends on the west near the Santa Monica Fault Complex. The minimum depth to the larger deposits of profitably extractable oil varies from about 5600 to about below ground surface, or 5400 to below sea level (as the approximate elevation of this portion of the Los Angeles Basin is about 200 feet). The uppermost producing unit was the first to be discovered, and consists of oil-bearing structures called the Wolfskill Zone, within the Repetto Sands, a Pliocene-age feature principally in the western part of the field. Oil in these sands is mainly found in pinch-out structures, in which oil is trapped in more permeable sub-units within impermeable sands. Underneath this unit, separated by an unconformity, is the larger Modelo Formation, consisting of several sand units: the D/M Sands (the topmost), the Hauser Sand, around below sea level, and the Ogden Sand, around below sea level. Beneath the Ogden Sand is a nodular shale unit, also grouped with the Modelo; it contains no oil. Both the Ogden and the Hauser are richly productive, while a few oil-bearing pinch-outs are found in the D/M sand, which otherwise forms an impermeable cap to the Hauser. The deepest unit in the field which is being pumped is a portion of the Ogden Sands in the East Area of the field, discovered in 1967, which is at an average depth of . According to BreitBurn Energy, one of the two principal producers on the eastern part of the field, there were 600 million barrels of oil originally in place; since 111 million have been recovered, about 489 million remain. They do not state what percentage of that reserve is recoverable using current technologies. Reinhard Suchsland, Geology and Production History of the East Beverly Hills Oil Field, Los Angeles Basin, California. History, production, and operations BreitBurn Drilling Island Oil was discovered in the northern Los Angeles basin in 1893, not far from the city center, and development of the Los Angeles City Oil Field was fast. By 1895, that field was producing over half of the oil in the state, and drillers began looking for even more new oil prospects around the basin, attempting to match the enormous finds taking place simultaneously just over the Tehachapis in Kern County. In July 1900, W.W. Orcutt drilled into the Wolfskill zone of the Repetto Sands, about below ground surface, discovering the Beverly Hills Field. While the oil was of reasonably good quality‚Äîit was light, with a high API gravity between 33 and 60, although with a high sulfur content‚Äîdevelopment was slow, since the Wolfskill find was relatively small, and other fields in the Los Angeles basin were growing almost as fast as operators could drill new wells. The eastern portion of the field‚Äîknown simply as the East Area‚Äîis the most productive, and is also the most recently discovered of all the major oil fields in the Los Angeles Basin, as it was not found until 1966. It reached its peak production quickly, within two years of discovery, reporting 11.8 million barrels for 1968. In 1988, BreitBurn Energy bought a portion of the Beverly Hills Field, intending to apply modern mapping and secondary recovery technology to the mature oil field, as previous operators were moving out, in favor of easier prospects in less highly regulated environments.Megan Sever: \\"Urban Oil Drilling\\", GeoTimes Field operators began using waterflooding in 1968 in several pools in the East Area (now operated by BreitBurn and Plains). In this method, produced water is reinjected into the reservoir to increase pressure (as oil is pumped out, internal reservoir pressure naturally decreases, resulting in a reduced pumping rate; a common way to restore pumping rates is to reinject wastewater into the reservoir to restore the original reservoir pressure). Water reinjection is also a convenient means of wastewater disposal, which in an urban setting is a practical problem, as the volume of water pumped from the reservoir often exceeds that of crude oil; while oil fields in isolated areas often use large evaporation ponds for water disposal, that luxury is not available for crowded urban sites with higher environmental standards. For example, in 2008, the California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) reported 882,953 barrels of oil produced from the field, but 8,732,941 barrels of water. Of this, 7,280,887 barrels were reinjected back into the reservoir.DOGGR Beverly Hills Field production query.DOGGR Beverly Hills Field injection query. Since many of the residents of the area own the mineral rights to their properties, they are entitled to royalty payments from the oil produced from underneath their land. In 1975, there were 6,200 individuals getting such payments. Development of the field has not been without controversy. The drilling island adjacent to Beverly Hills High School occasioned a series of lawsuits in 2003, in which parents of students at the school, observing what they believed to be excess rates of certain cancers among those exposed to toxins emitted from the facility, attempted to have it shut down. Plaintiffs claimed that a \\"cluster\\" of 280 cancers‚Äîprimarily Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and thyroid cancer, recorded over a period of about 30 years‚Äîwere caused by emissions of volatile organic compounds (including benzene and toluene) from the drilling island, currently hidden behind sound walls. Samples of air taken near the site by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) showed nothing unusual, and the cases were thrown out in 2006 and 2007. The judge who dismissed the cases, Superior Court Judge Wendell Mortimer, Jr., said that he was unpersuaded that the facility caused any harm, and also \\"found no evidence that the school district was aware of any danger.\\" Additionally, the University of Southern California Medical School stated that the particular cancers noted in the lawsuits are not known to be caused by exposure to petroleum and its byproducts.

Robert Glover (1544 ‚Äì 10 April 1588)Oxford DNB (2004) was an English Officer of Arms, genealogist and antiquarian in the reign of Elizabeth I. In the College of Arms, he rose to the rank of Somerset Herald of Arms, serving in that capacity from 1571 until his death in 1588. As marshal and deputy to his father-in-law, William Flower, Norroy King of Arms, he participated in heraldic visitations throughout northern England.DNB (ed. Lee 1903)Norcliffe 1881, p. vii Life and work Robert Glover was the son of Thomas Glover of Ashford in Kent. He was appointed Portcullis Pursuivant of Arms in 1567 at the age of 24.Raines 1870, pp. x, xiii Glover was well respected among contemporary kings of arms. He was especially highly regarded for his accuracy and extensive professional knowledge and was regarded as an authority by the highest officials.Raines 1870, p. xi Around 1570, he married Elizabeth Flower, daughter of William Flower, Norroy King of Arms. They had five children: Thomas, John, Robert, Ann, and Mildred. Glover served as his father-in-law's deputy until his death. Glover was promoted to Somerset Herald of Arms in 1571. On 9 March 1580 Flower obtained a patent from Queen Elizabeth joining Glover with himself for the office of Norroy; the patent states that Flower was then eighty-two years of age. In 1582, Glover accompanied Lord Willoughby to Denmark to invest Frederick II with the Order of the Garter, and in 1584 he accompanied Robert Cooke, Clarenceux King of Arms in attendance on the Earl of Derby when he presented the Garter to Henry III of France. Glover died on 10 April 1588, aged 46, and was buried at St Giles-without- Cripplegate, London. His widow Elizabeth was left with five children and no way to provide for them; she was remarried within months and named as \\"Elizabeth Woolward\\" in her father's will, dated October of that same year. Visitations In 1530, Henry VIII had issued an instruction governing the conduct of heraldic visitations, in which Clarenceux and Norroy Kings of Arms (or their deputies) were to tour their areas of authority, recording coats of arms and pedigrees of armigers, with powers to forcibly prevent the bearing of unauthorised arms.Wagner 1946, pp. 20‚Äì21 Flower's visitations began in 1563‚Äì64 and his last visitation was in 1575, with Glover acting as his deputy. The entry books of Flower's visitations of Yorkshire in 1563‚Äì1564 (printed, 1881), of Lancashire, 1567 (printed, 1870), of Nottingham, 1569 (printed 1871) and of Durham, 1575 (printed, 1820) are preserved in the College of Arms in London. A manuscript of the 1567 visitation in Glover's hand (in the British Museum) is frequently described as Glover's Visitation. This manuscript forms a folio volume of 104 pages, and includes the pedigrees of 112 families, each illustrated with armorial bearings. Glover himself completed visitations of Cheshire in 1580 on behalf of Flower (published 1882),Rylands 1882 of Staffordshire in 1583,Verasano 2001, pp. 130‚Äì31 and of Yorkshire in 1584‚Äì85 (privately printed 1875). Genealogy Glover was also an antiquarian and an early genealogist. Originally, visitations were written in narrative form and emphasised recording of armorial bearings. Glover introduced the copying of charters and other documents into the visitation records to support claims of ancestry, a marked innovation over the practice of his predecessors. Glover left a number of manuscripts at his death. His pedigrees were used by the antiquarian William Camden in creating his Britannia (1594); indeed Ralph Brooke's attack on Camden accused him of misusing and misunderstanding Glover's work.Duncan-Jones 2001, p. 100. His nephew Thomas Milles edited Glover's Nobilitas Politica et Civilis for publication (London, 1608). His manuscript genealogies of the nobility in Latin were translated and edited by Milles, with assistance from Sir Robert Cotton, Robert Beale, Camden, Nicholas Charles, Michael Heneage, Thomas Talbot and Matthew Pateson, under the title The Catalogue of Honor, or Treasury of true Nobility, peculiar and proper to the Isle of Great Britaine (London, 1610). Glover's manuscripts A Catalogue of Northern Gentry whose surnames ended in son and Defence of the Title of Queen Elizabeth to the English Crown remain unpublished. His Ordinary of Arms was printed in Edmondson's Complete Body of Heraldry (1780).

E. F. Britten for Alfred Tennyson's poem St. Simeon Stylites, based on Simeon Stylites, the first of the pillar saints. The Lady of Shalott William Edward Frank Britten (1848 1916) was a British painter and illustrator. It is known that he worked in London, England starting in 1873 and that he stayed in the city until at least 1890. Britten's work ranged in style from to traditional Victorian to Pre-Raphaelite, and his artistic medium ranged from paintings to book illustrations. His paintings have mostly been praised by critics with his illustrations having been treated as either neutral or favourable by reviewers. Biography William Edward Frank Britten was born in 1848 in Lambeth, LondonEngland & Wales, FreeBDM Birth Index to William Goodwyn Price Britten and Ellen Eliza Richardson. On 23 July 1866, he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Arts in Piccadilly, London, as a probationer and on 3 January 1867 he was accepted as a student. He began to flourish as a painter after 1873, when he began to hold exhibitions for his works at the Royal Society of British Artists. He worked on designs for six of the eight spandrels under the Dome of St Paul's Cathedral in London, including drawing the cartoons for three of the prophets, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, after the death of the artist, Alfred Stevens, who had originally been commissioned to draw them but only completed Isaiah. Britten was also approached to provide designs for the remaining four spandrels - representing the four evangelists, the first of which, St Matthew, had been completed to Watts' design in 1866. Once again, Britten completed the scheme - this time passing off some of the work as his own, rather than Watts's.The Dome - Decorative scheme www.explore-stpauls.net In April 1883, Sir Charles Dilke ordered from Mr. W. E. F. Britten, the painter, whom Leighton had commended to him, a portrait of his brother Ashton who had recently died. It \\"proved to be very good\\".The Life of the Rt. Hon. Sir Charles W. Dilke VI by Stephen Gwynn. In 1891, Britten had Charles Voysey (architect) design a studio for him at 17 St Dunstans Road, London W6 8RD. This building is recognised as one of Voysey's first and best Arts and Crafts buildings and is still extant.Architects and Architecture of London by Kenneth Allinson. Britten spent most of his time working in London and worked as an illustrator and a contributor to magazines. It is known that he was working in the Pimlico area in 1890.Houfe 1981 p. 244 There is a suggestion that he worked in Russia for a period on a commission for the Czar, but no firm evidence of this has been found. In c.1912 Britten was giving instruction at the Glasgow School of Art: \\"Professor W. E. F. Britten superintends figure and landscape composition\\".The Royal Scottish Academy School of Painting in Every Woman's Encyclopaedia\\". c1912 He was married twice; in 1873 to Rebecca Ling (1853-1901) and in 1901 to Rachel Alice Kime (1870-1950); he had four children, two from each marriage. Britten died in 1916 in Kingston, Surrey, England.England & Wales, Death indexWeintraub 1989 p. 107 Works Britten followed in the neoclassical tradition of Frederick Leighton and Albert Moore. In terms of actual productions, he ranged from working as a decorative artist to paintings. In style, his designs varied from those that followed the tradition of Victorian classicism to those that were influenced by Pre-Raphaelite paintings. His works are located at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Britten illustrated the last published poem of Christina Rossetti before her death for the 1894 issue of Magazine of Art.Kooistra 2002 p. 44 Also, he served as illustrator for: *Contributions to The Graphic Magazine (1885‚Äì1886) *Algernon Charles Swinburne's Carols of the Year (1893) *Moira O'Neill's The Elf-Errant (1895) *Edmund Gosse's translation of Baron de la Motte Fouque's Undine (1896) *Alfred Tennyson's The Early Poems of Alfred Lord Tennyson (1901), including the poems: The Lady of Shalott, Mariana, \\"The Deserted House\\", Oenone, The Lotos-Eaters, St Simeon Stylites, \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\", \\"Sir Galahad\\", and Break, Break, Break *Mrs Bellamy's Diamonds (1905) Critical reception A contemporary review by Alfred Baldry, in referring to the ceiling panel work Britten created for the South Kensington Museum, says that they \\"deserve to be praised as true decorations properly conceived and rightly managed.\\"Baldry 1902 pp. 44‚Äì45 Another contemporary review by Rose Sketchy says that Britten uses a wash technique \\"with fluency, as is shown by his successful illustrations to Mr. Swinburne's 'Carols of the Year' in the 'Magazine of Art' in 1892-93. Since that time his version of 'Undine,' and illustrations to Tennyson's 'Early Poems,' have shown the same power of graceful composition and sympathey with his subject.\\"Sketchley 1903 p. 29 Other reviews on the mentioning the Swinburne series appeared in the January, February, and May issues of The Critic, but they simply acknowledge Britten as the illustrator for that Swinburne's \\"December\\", \\"Carol\\", and \\"May\\". However, two of the reviews were more favourable. A 28 January 1893 review notes, \\"A sonnet by Swinburne, 'January,' is framed in an interesting drawing by W. E. F. Britten.\\"The Critic 1893 pp. 12, 120, 354, 53 A review for 6 May 1893, a review claims, \\"In the series of pictures and sonnets of the months by Mr. W. E. F. Britten and Mr. Algernon Charles Swinburne, both poet and painter have done their best for April\\".The Critic 1893 p. 300 In the 20th century, art historian Simon Houfe said that Britten \\"excelled as a decorative artist, placing his subjects in elaborate frames, the Shaftesbury Tribute in The Graphic of 185 is a good example.\\"  Gallery  Complete illustrations for The Early Poems of Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1901) W.E.F.

Description The meaning of the word Sankamphaeng in the Thai language is fortification or counterfort. It is a fitting name to describe this mountain range that effectively constituted a natural buttress between the Khorat Plateau and the plain of Central Thailand. The mountain chain runs in a WNW- ESE direction. The northern part of the Sankamphaeng mountain range merges with the southern end of the Dong Phaya Yen Mountains, which run roughly in a north-south direction at the southwestern boundary of the Khorat Plateau. To the east this range connects with the D√¢ngr√™k Mountains, a longer system running in an east-west direction that stretches into Laos. The southern mountainsides of the range drain into the Prachinburi River. The range is divided in two compact massifs where the highest elevations are in the west. The highest point in the Sankamphaeng Range is the 1,351 m high Khao Rom, also known as Khao Khiao. Other peaks are 1,326 m high Khao Laem, 1,313 m high Khao Chan, 1,112 m high Khao Falami, 1,142 m high Khao Sam Yot, 1,052 m high Khao Inthani, 1,071 m high Khao Fa Pha, 1,017 m high Khao Kaeo, 821 m high Khao Salat Dai, 805 m high Khao Samo Pun, 787 m high Khao Laem Noi, and 824 m high Khao Phaeng Ma. Finally, 875 m high Kao Kamphaeng and 558 m high Kao Dan Fai Mai are at the eastern end of the western massif, where there is a valley through which passes Hwy 304 (AH 19), between Kabin Buri town and Nakhon Ratchasima. The eastern massif begins at 992 m high Khao Lamang, 949 m high Phu Sam Ngam, and 843 m high Khao Tap Tao. At this point a branch of the massif extends northeastwards with 748 m high Khao Chawae and 723 m high Khao Plai Lam Katuk, connecting with the southern end of the Dong Phaya Yen Range. Further east there are two mountains with the name \\"Khao Yai\\", a 776 m high Khao Yai located north of 761 m high Khao Thuang and a 796 m high Khao Yai located to the south. Further eastwards the average height of the peaks descends to around 400 m and Hwy 348 crosses in this lower area from north to south where the range connects with the D√¢ngr√™k Mountains.Map of Bangkok and 22 nearby provinces, PN Map Several rivers originate in the Sankamphaeng mountains, of which the Mun River flowing eastwards is the largest. Another important river is the Klong Praprong.Nuntana Pontawepitanun, Sugarcane Industry Zoning in Eastern Thailand Administratively, most of the area of the range is under Prachinburi and Sa Kaeo Provinces, with smaller parts in Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Nayok, and Saraburi Provinces. There are sandstone outcrops in the south and north of the range. Shales and schist are also present. In the southern side steep slopes made of granite and conglomerates can be seen. Limestone is present towards the eastern end close to the Dangrek Mountains. History Around 1922 a group of people from Ban Tha Dan and Ban Tha Chai villages in Nakhon Nayok Province built a settlement in the forest in the western part of these mountains. Up to 30 households cultivated the newly deforested land. The area was formally recognized by the government and classified as \\"Tambon Khao Yai\\" within Pak Phli District, although the nearest mountain named \\"Khao Yai\\" was at the other end of the range. Owing to its location and distance from the authorities, the new subdistrict soon became a refuge for criminals and fugitives. After an attempt by government forces to capture the outlaws in the area, the villagers were relocated onto the plains some 30 km away. In 1932 the tambon status of Khao Yai Subdistrict was cancelled. In 1959, then Prime Minister of Thailand, Marshall Sarit Thanarat, coordinated the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of the Interior in order to initiate a process where areas of the country could be officially set aside as national parks. Khao Yai National Park was subsequently established on 18 September 1962 and was declared by royal proclamation in the Thai Government GazetteGovernment Gazette (Book 79, Section 89) as the first national park in Thailand. The park was named after the defunct Tambon Khao Yai. Boonsong Lekakul, one of the 20th century's most famous conservationists in Thailand, played a major role in the establishment of the protected area. During the Vietnam War there was a US military Air Defense Radar Station of the 621 TCS Tactical Control Squadron, at the top of Khao Rom, also known as Khao Khiao, the highest summit of the range.Khao Khieo RTAB (Green Hill), Thailand In 1982 a road was built that made it easy for Bangkok residents to reach the main protected area of the mountains.‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏á‡∏™‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏Ñ‡∏π‡πà‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏î‡∏ó‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏≠‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ô: ‡∏≠‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏´‡πà‡∏á‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏ç‡πà. ‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏°‡∏û‡πå‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Ñ‡∏î‡∏µ, 2543 (Thai) Ecology The protected areas of the range face problems of encroachment.

He is the protomartyr of the Lemko people. He was trained as an Orthodox priest, and was executed by the officially Catholic state of the Austro-Hungarian Empire as a Russophile after his conversion to the Orthodox Church. After his execution, his wife was imprisoned in Talerhof, where his son, also named Maxim Sandovich, was born.  Life   Early life  Maxim Sandovich was born in Zdynia, Galicia, in family of Tymoteusz (or Timofej) and Krystyna Sandowicz. His father owned a farm house and was a chanter in the local Greek-Catholic church of the Protection of the Mother of God (pl). The mother was a housewife. He graduated from a four-class school in Gorlice and started his studies at a Gymnasium in Jas≈Ço. He then moved to the same school in Nowy SƒÖcz. Among his colleagues he distinguished himself with religiosity; He planned to join the monastery. On the other hand, he had poor academic results, so he had to quit his high school after four class. Without parental consent, he then entered the novitiate of the Basilian Order, in the Monastery of Krechov. After three months, in 1904, he left the congregation, disappointed with the spiritual level and general atmosphere of the monastery.  In Russia  In the same year Maxim Sandovich went to Russia, where secondary school education was not compulsory for candidates seeking admission to the Orthodox theological seminary, nor for the mere acceptance of priestly ordination. He stepped as an obedient to the Pochayev Lavra. He worked in a monastery printing house.A. Rydzanicz. O przesz≈Ço≈õci trzeba m√≥wiƒá. \\"PrzeglƒÖd Prawos≈Çawny\\". 10 (268), pa≈∫dziernik 2007. Bia≈Çystok. . In this monastery he was noticed by the archbishop Anthony (Khrapovitsky) of Volhynia and Zhytomir, who was one of the coordinators funded by the Russian state for the promotion of Orthodoxy in Galicia. This Hierarchy attaches special importance to mobilizing missionaries from Galicia, who are supposed to obtain theological education in Russia and then return to their native areas as promoters of Orthodoxy. In agreement with the Archbishop, the Galician russophiles directed the young men (or even the boys) to Pochayev and Zhytomyr where they met Archbishop Anthony. And he directed them to university studies or to seminaries, often paying for their studies. Maxim Sandovich was also educated in Russia thanks to the scholarship granted by the Archbishop Anthony of Volhynia. Archbishop Anthony argued that the future missionary was his spiritual disciple Archbishop Anthony directed Sandovich to the theological seminary in Zhitomir. Even prior to the completion of study, during the family visit, the future clergyman was offered to take over the duties of the parish priest of the Orthodox parish in Grab, where the inhabitants of the community converted from the Greek Catholic faith. According to Anna Veronica Wendland, the initiator of this conversion was Sandowicz, who, in consultation with the uniate priest Teodor Durkot from Zdynia, suggested the peasants of Grab to solve their conflict with the local clergyman with organizing an Orthodox pastoral institution. He declared the readiness of the exercise thereof.A. Wendland: Die Russophilen in Galizien. Ukrainische Konservative zwischen √ñsterreich und Russland, 1848-1915. Wiede≈Ñ: Verlag der √ñsterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2001, s. 505. . In 1911 Sandowicz graduated from the seminary for the best results in his year. He married Pelagia Grygoruk, daughter of an Orthodox priest from Nowe Berezowo. Prior to the priest sordination, Archbishop Anthony asked Sandowicz for his pastoral work in Galicia as the hierarch recommended it; in case of disagreement Archbishop Anthony suggested Sandowicz to serve in Kiev. Sandowicz intended to join the missionary campaign among the Greek-catholic Lemkos. Archbishop Antoni agreed and on November 17, 1911 he ordained Sandovich as a priest, directing him to the parish in Grab. Activities in Galicia Fr. Maksym Sandowicz took over the parish in Grab. The first service at the local prayer house was celebrated on December 2, 1911. The 150 faithful participated in it. Along with him from Russia to Galicia came priests Ivan Ileczko, who took over the parish in CielƒÖ≈º and Ignacy Hudyma, who became parish priest in Za≈Çuch. Small religiousness of the Greek Catholic peasants and the ease with which they manipulated the Galician Russophiles, proclaiming the superiority of the Orthodox Church and the necessity of joining Galicia to Russia, raised the anxiety of the Austrian administration in an increasingly tense international situation. As in the case of Hniliczek's affair, the Austrian authorities considered it necessary to take a strong stand against the entire Russophile movement. One of the means of limiting Russophile movement was the recognition as an illegal pastoral activity of Orthodox priests ordained in Russia, who did not have the consent of the Metropolitan of Bukovina to serve in his Galicia jurisdiction. Fr. Sandowicz did not have such permission, but claimed that his direct superior was the Patriarch of Constantinople, and that the legitimacy of the Orthodox Church in Austria meant that any ordained cleric of this confession could operate in Galicia. This translation was not included and Fr. Maxim Sandowicz was arrested for eight days and sentenced to a fine of 400 crowns after the first service in the Grab, defined by the local authorities as one of Orthodox centers and pro-Russian propaganda. On December 22 or 24, 1911, the chapel in Grab was closed, but the clergyman continued to celebrate the service, using the rooms he made available in private homes. Such practices, in the context of the fight against russophiles, were prohibited. In this connection, Fr. Sandowicz was again arrested and fined 300 crowns or month of arrest. Also, this time the priest did not cease his activity, making illegal worship not only in Grab but also in Wyszowadka and D≈Çugie. Consequently, on January 16, 1912, he was sentenced to seven weeks in jail. After serving his sentence he resumed his missionary work in favor of Orthodoxy. The priest was easily accepted by the local community because he maintained good contacts with local Greek-Catholic clerics on Rusophilian beliefs. Similar views were very lively among the Lemko people. According to Bernadetta W√≥jtowicz-Huber: \\"Sandowycz was an extraordinary personality. Despite the ban on further activities, thanks to charisma, deep faith and good repute, it became a symbol of the Lemko community\\". The financial aspect of his activity has also contributed to the Sandowicz's popularity. He gave away the poor people donations, gathered at the sacrifice, expecting them only to swear that they would not convert again to Catholicism. He and other missionaries who came from Russia offered low prices for religious services, raised funds from the Russian sources for the construction of new temples. For the Galician people, who lived in poverty, this was important. The authority of the clergyman also increased as penalties imposed on him. In the rural communities that have gone through Orthodoxy, the subsequent detention of the clergy tightened his ties with the faithful and contributed to his recognition as a martyr, persecuted by the authorities.  First arrest and trial  March 28, 1912, shortly after release from custody, Fr. Sandovich was again detained along with another Orthodox priest, Ignacy Hudyma. Initially, the clergymen were accused of measuring the length of the bridge in Cheremosh. They were then taken to the detention center in Lviv and charged with espionage for Russia. The detention of priests Sandovich and Hudyma was part of wider Austrian antirussophile activities. In Lviv, was arrested , the organizer of the dormitory, promoting the Russophile ideas among young people, and Wasyl Ko≈Çdra, founder of the russophile reading room. In Hungarian Ruthenia, where the movement for Orthodoxy was even stronger than in Galicia, the process of 94 peasants, who 94 advocated conversion, accused of espionage and treason, was conducted between March 1913 and February 1914 in Marmaroschsiget, ended in a recognition of defendants guilty and punishing them with a long prison term. In the opinion of W≈Çodzimierz Osadczy: \\"On the eve of the war, the show trial over the Orthodox agitators was to be a warning to all forces sympathizing to Russia, and not only for the Rusyns but also for the growing power of Polish national democrats\\". The same author considered that the analogous task the Austrian authorities put up before the process of Bendasiuk, Ko≈Çdra, fr. Hudyma and fr. Sandovich, began March 9, 1914 in Lvov and lasted three months. All accused in this trial were charged with espionage and betrayal of state expressed in the desire to detach \\"Ruthenian lands\\" from Austro-Hungary and join them in the Russian Empire. Both clerics were also accused of illegally celebrating the service and preaching and unlawful travel to Russia. Fr. Sandowicz was also accused that he expressed in an offensive manner about the Catholic religion. On the ninth day of the trial, he was questioned about the finding in his memoirs of a brulion in which the clergyman made his or her reflections on the Orthodox Church and the Union of Brest. \\"The process of Bendasiuk and comrades\\", as it was called in the Galician press, was extensively reported in the press: reports from it were published by all Lviv newspapers; a number of foreign journals (French, German, Italian) sent his correspondents to Lviv. The greatest interest in this case was in Russia. The process was observed on the spot by representatives of the four main factions of the Russian State Duma. Contrary to the objectives of the Austrian authorities, who intended to ban the further activities of Russophliles during the war with Russia, the process not only was not a heavy blow to this movement, but contributed to the spread of his ideas. In addition, the Russian state treasury allocated 30,000 rubles for running a propaganda campaign accompanying the process. \\"Orthodox martyrdom in Galicia\\" was also publicized by the Archbishop Anthony (Khrapovitsky) of Volhynia, who in his eparchy issued a special circular on this subject and ordered after each Holy Liturgy to celebrate an additional service for the arrested russophiles. He himself contacted the Lviv court in writing, offering to testify as a witness. In Lviv there was a demonstration in defence of the accused, attended by near 80 Greek Catholic clergymen. Hearings of the accused and witnesses proved the links between the Orthodox movement in Galicia and Russia, but the evidence gathered was not enough to confirm the allegation of treason and espionage contained in the indictment. In connection with this, on June 6, 1914, an acquittal issued by a jury of Poles was passed in relation to all defendants. The court found that the accused did not engage in politics and did not seek to tear Galicia away from Austria-Hungary. This judgment was dissatisfied with the Viennese government circles, which accused Poles of allowing (known as advocates) known Russophiles to the trial.  Second arrest and death  On June 7, 1914, Fr. Maxim Sandowicz left the detention center and went to his parents' house in Zdynia. He resumed his pastoral activity in Grab. The co-accused with him in the trial did differently Stepan Bendasiuk and Vasyl Koldra, who immediately left for Russia and were taken there by Vladimir Bobrinsky, president of the of the Galician-Russian Society.. Sandowicz also intended to go to Russia, but he did not manage to collect the passport from the eldership in Gorlice. After the outbreak of World War I, in which Austria-Hungary and Russia found themselves in opposing blocks of fighting countries and the announcement of mobilization in Galicia, he was arrested on 4 August with his family: himself, his wife Pelagia, brother Miko≈Çaj and father Tymoteusz were imprisoned in Gorlice. After the declaration of war, the Austrian authorities continued their repression of the population showing pro-Russian sympathies. Many Russophiles or persons recognized as such were shot by the officers' independent decisions, without court judgments. In such circumstances, the priest was executed on September 6, 1914 in Gorlice The decision to execute him was made by rittmeister Ditrich, who arrived in Gorlice from Linz on 5 September. Fr Maxim Sandovich was shot in the courtyard of Gorlice prison at around 6 a.m. Witnesses to his execution were other residents of Gorlice and surrounding towns imprisoned on charges of Russophlilia sympathies, including members of the cleric's family. According to their account, the priest at the last minute called out \\"Long Live the Holy Orthodoxy! Long live Holy Russia!\\" or \\"Long Live the Ruthenian people and Holy Orthodoxy\\". Fr Sandowicz's funeral took place without the participation of his family in the cemetery in Gorlice. In 1922, at the request of the executed father and wife, his remains were exhumed and moved to the cemetery in Zdynia. It was co-financed by Lemkos- emigrants residing in the United StatesA.

Despite the grand theme of the series, the images are in fact only about 83 mm √ó 180 mm each, and are called the \\"large\\" Miseries to distinguish them from an even smaller earlier set on the same subject.Becker, 155 The series, published in 1633, is Callot's best-known work and has been called the first \\"anti-war statement\\" in European art.Sutherland Harris, 258 It can also be considered as an early prototypical French comic strip, within the text comics genre, since the illustrations are accompanied by a descriptive text beneath the images. Description Plate 5, Le pillage, the soldiers pillage a house Les Grandes Mis√®res depict the destruction unleashed on civilians during the Thirty Years' War; no specific campaign is depicted, but the set inevitably recalls the actions of the army that Cardinal Richelieu sent in 1633 to occupy Callot's native Lorraine before annexing it to France. Callot was living in the capital, Nancy, at the time, though the prints were published, like most of his work, in Paris, with the necessary royal licence. The plates still exist, in a museum in Nancy, as do seven drawings of whole compositions, and many tiny studies for figures, with a large group in the Hermitage Museum. The series begins with a florid title page, followed by an enrollment parade and a battle scene. Plates 4‚Äì8 show bands of the victorious soldiers successively attacking a farm, convent, and coach, and burning a village. In plates 9‚Äì14 they are rounded up and subjected to various methods of public torture and execution. Plate 15 shows crippled soldiers in a grand neo-classical hospital, Plate 16 unemployed soldiers dying in the street, and Plate 17 the peasants taking revenge on a group they have captured, killing them with flails. Plate 18 shows an enthroned king distributing rewards to the victorious generals. Each print has a six-line verse caption below the image, written by the famous print-collector Michel de Marolles. All show wide panoramic views, with many tiny figures, as is typical of Callot's work. The technique of using multiple bitings of acid on the plate, with different areas \\"stopped-out\\", was perfected by Callot. This method allows gradations in the strength of the line, with distant parts of the scene usually lighter.Becker, 155, & illustrations pp. 185‚Äì188 Legacy The central image of the wheel of fortune in William Hogarth's early engraving Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme is a parody of La Pendaison.

He currently plays for Toulon, having signed with the club in 2014 after having played for Montpellier since 2005. His usual position is flanker or number eight, but he played his early career as a lock. Gorgodze played for the Georgia national rugby union team in 71 matches, including 13 as a captain. He appeared for the Georgia national team in three World Cups in 2007, 2011, and 2015. In May 2017, he announced his retirement from the national team. In 2019 he returned to the national team for the World Cup in Japan. Gorgodze is nicknamed \\"Gorgodzilla\\" by his former Montpellier teammates, and \\"Gulliver\\" by Georgian fans. Both stem from his imposing size and rampaging style of play. Playing career Early career Gorgodze switched to rugby from basketball aged 17. His first club was Lelo in the Georgian Top League, he was soon selected for the Georgia national team and made his debut in 2003 against Spain, at the age of just 18 and not long after he started playing rugby. However he wasn't selected for Georgia's first appearance at the 2003 Rugby World Cup later that year. In 2004 he became a regular fixture for the Georgia side. Montpellier Gorgodze signed for Montpellier in 2005. Gorgodze started his career at Montpellier mainly as a reserve in the side and didn't get much game time. He was still a regular in the Georgia side though and was selected for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Gorgodze started three of Georgia's four matches at the World Cup, and was one of Georgia's star players. After the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Gorgodze started playing for Montpellier a lot more regularly and was their first choice lock. Gorgodze was signed by Brive for the 2009/10 season but Gorgodze changed his mind and decided to stay at Montpellier, who were forced to pay Brive 200,000 euros to keep him. A known weak spot for Gorgodze is his indiscipline, he has received 16 yellow cards for Montpellier since 2007. During 2010 he was banned twice for fighting, once with S√©bastien Pag√®s against Albi and the other time with Alex Tulou against Bourgoin. Gorgodze changed position for Georgia to the back row, and when Fabien Galthi√© and Eric B√©chu became the new Montpellier coaches before the 2010/11 season they also converted him to the back row. Gorgodze became a revelation at flanker during this season, and halfway through the season French newspaper L'√âquipe commented that he improved his technique and became a mobile and unstoppable player. Gorgodze played a big role in Montpellier finishing the 2010/11 Top 14 as runners up, and had a particularly massive match in the Top 14 semi final against Racing-M√©tro. At the end of the season L'√âquipe named him as the best foreigner in the league. Gorgodze was selected for the Georgia squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and played all the Georgia matches and was named man of the match in two matches, against England and Romania. Gorgodze had signed a preliminary contract with Toulon in advance of the 2011‚Äì12 season, but changed his mind and signed an extension to his deal with Montpellier. This led to a tribunal hearing, but an amicable settlement was soon reached. Toulon In November 2013, as his contract with Montpellier was expiring, he signed a three-year deal with Toulon to take effect with the 2014‚Äì15 season. His competitive debut with Toulon was delayed due to a knee injury during a preseason friendly with Racing M√©tro; he is expected to miss the first two to three weeks of the 2014‚Äì15 season.

The soldiers were left to protect the king, but they soon adopted the manners of their new country and became completely alienated from the Roman Republic. After the death of Ptolemy XII in 51 BC, they helped his son Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator in his power struggle against his sister Cleopatra and even involved Julius Caesar, the powerful supporter of Cleopatra, during Caesar's Civil War up to the siege of Alexandria (48-47 BC) in violent battles.  Protecting power of Ptolemy XII in Egypt  In 58 BCE, Pharaoh Ptolemy XII, called \\"Auletes\\", had to leave Egypt and went into political exile in Rome due to a popular revolt, and his daughter Berenice IV seized the throne. Three years later, Aulus Gabinius, the Roman proconsul of Roman Syria, restored the king to the throne after a short campaign. Then he left a part of his army, called after him the Gabiniani, in Egypt for the king's protection. These Roman troops also included Gallic and German horsemen.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 3.4.4; 3.103.5; 3.110.2; Valerius Maximus 4.1.15; Appian, Civil Wars 2.24.90; Cassius Dio, Roman History 42.5.4 Because Egypt was nominally independent, the Gabiniani were not a Roman occupying army but mercenaries of Ptolemy XII. According to Julius Caesar, they soon adopted the dissipated way of life of the Alexandrians, while they neglected Roman discipline. Nevertheless they still possessed a great fighting strength because Caesar described them as very dangerous enemies in the Alexandrinian war. They married Egyptian women and had already fathered children with them before the arrival of Caesar in Egypt (48 BC). Over time, they lost their connection with Rome and became a loyal protecting power of Ptolemy XII, who used them in fights against rebellious subjects.Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 3.110.2 and 3.110.6  Conflict with Cleopatra VII  After the death of Ptolemy XII (51 BC), his two oldest surviving children, Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra VII, were supposed to succeed jointly on the throne as husband and wife, but the young queen soon ousted her brother and husband and ruled alone. She quickly came into a serious conflict with the Gabiniani. In 53 BC the powerful Parthians had inflicted a devastating defeat on the Romans in the Battle of Carrhae, and three years later ‚Äì at the beginning of the year 50 BC ‚Äì the governor of Syria, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, sent two of his sons to Egypt to recruit the Gabiniani for the war against the Parthians. The Gabiniani, however, did not want to give up their comfortable life in the Ptolemaic Empire to fight against the Parthians so they killed Bibulus's sons. Cleopatra continued the pro-Roman policies of her father. She immediately had the murderers arrested and handed over in chains to Bibulus. This action turned the Gabiniani into bitter enemies of the queen as Cleopatra wanted to maintain good relations with Rome. The Roman historian, Valerius Maximus, claimed that the Syrian proconsul sent the murderers back to Egypt because the senate in Rome, not he, was responsible for the punishment of the criminals, who were still Roman citizens. The German historian Christoph Sch√§fer did not believe this version and pointed out that the proconsul probably punished the killers instead, since he had the legal authority and had he believed that the murderers could only be judged by the Senate he would not have returned them to Egypt anyway, but to Rome. Sch√§fer believes that Cleopatra's break with the Gabiniani was the main cause of her subsequent loss of power because her actions led to the mercenaries joining those who supported Ptolemy XIII and his three influential guardians and advisors, Pothinus, Achillas, and Theodotus of Chios.Valerius Maximus 4.1.15; compare Cicero, epistulae ad Atticum 6.5.3; Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 3.110.6; Seneca the Younger, dialogi 6.14.2; compare also Christoph Sch√§fer, 2006, p. 42-43, and Michael Grant, 1998, p. 74-75 In the spring of 49 BC Gnaeus Pompeius, the oldest son of the triumvir, Pompey, came to Egypt to ask for military aid in the civil war against Julius Caesar that had just broken out. At this time Ptolemy XIII had regained equal power with Cleopatra, and both rulers complied with the petition. Among other things, they sent 500 Gabiniani horsemen to Pompey. This time the Gabiniani did not refuse to go to war.Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 3.4.4; Appian, Civil Wars 2.49 At the end of 49 BC Cleopatra was driven out of Alexandria at the instigation of Pothinus. Probably in connection with this action, Caesar accused the Gabiniani of being so much used to the old customs of the Alexandrinian soldiers that they demanded the execution of friends of kings, they tried to raise their pay by besieging the palace, and they deposed kings and brought other men to power.Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 3.110.5; compare Christoph Sch√§fer, 2006, p. 43 After Pompey's decisive defeat in the Battle of Pharsalus, he fled to the coast of Egypt and demanded help and support from the Ptolemaic government. The advisors of Ptolemy XIII were not willing to get involved in the Roman civil war and decided to murder Pompey in an attempt to please the victorious Caesar. Pothinus and his companions allegedly also feared that Pompey would try to incite the former Roman soldiers in the Ptolemaic army ‚Äì who had earlier fought under his command ‚Äì so that he could gain control over Egypt. It is considered unlikely that the Gabiniani could have been convinced to take part in such an action given their close connection to the Egyptian monarchy and community. Indeed two leading members of the Gabiniani, the former tribune Lucius Septimius and the centurion Salvius, participated in the assassination of Pompey (25 July 48 BC according to the Julian calendar).Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 3.104.1 and 3.104.3; compare Christoph Sch√§fer, 2006, p. 50-51  War against Caesar  Caesar arrived in Egypt a few days after the assassination of Pompey. In spite of the elimination of his enemy, he did not leave the country and supported the expelled Cleopatra in the Ptolemaic power struggle. Pothinus organized military opposition against Caesar. In the Alexandrinian war that followed, the Gabiniani played an important role: they were the core divisions of Achillas' army that comprised 20,000 infantrymen and 2000 cavalrymen. The forces of Caesar were one-fifth the size of his opponent's. Caesar relates in his Commentarii de Bello Civili that fugitive criminals and exiles from the neighbouring Roman provinces had joined the Gabiniani because the government recruited them to swell the ranks of their army.Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 3.110.1-4 After the successful conclusion of the Alexandrinian war, Caesar replaced the Gabiniani with three reliable legions, the XXVII, XXVIII and XXIX. These served as the Roman occupying army of Egypt and were tasked with protecting Cleopatra but also to ensure the queen's loyalty to Rome.

Normally, a solid control system contains five stages: the mud tank, shale shaker, vacuum degasser, desander, desilter, and centrifuge. The shale shaker is used to separate big solids with diameter above 75Œºm, the desander addresses solids from 45-74Œºm, and the desilter segregates solids between 15-44Œºm. Sometimes the desander and desilter are combined as one high efficiency mud cleaner. When air enters the drilling fluids, a vacuum degasser is used to separate the air. When there is no air in the mud, the degasser works as a big agitator. All these stages are mounted on the top of the mud tank. After separating the solids, the clean mud can be pumped into the borehole again. The mud system with 4 phases of solids control process can be understood as the 5 phase purification system. From shale shaker, vacuum degasser, to Desander cone, Desilter cone, and the decanting centrifuge: different working principle, different separation point. Every well drilling requires such a system to process drilling mud. However, per different well depth and different drilling conditions we'll get different configurations and different results. Recent advances in solids control include the creation of a closed loop system which allows for increased environmental control and reduction in the potential for spills of drilling fluids. Several US states have either passed or are considering the implementation of closed loop systems, particularly for hydro-fracturing operations.

Worked on for seven years, and largely written between 1836 and 1840, it was published in March 1840. It consists of a fictionalised version of the life of Sordello da Goito, a 13th-century Lombard troubadour depicted in Canto VI of Dante Alighieri's Purgatorio. Convoluted and obscure, its difficulties increased by its unfamiliar setting, Sordello is notorious as one of the hardest poems in English literature. It was harshly received at the time of its publication: Tennyson's opinion was recorded thus by William Sharp in his biography of Browning: > Lord Tennyson manfully tackled it, but he is reported to have admitted in > bitterness of spirit: \\"There were only two lines in it that I understood, > and they were both lies; they were the opening and closing lines, 'Who will > may hear Sordello's story told,' and 'Who would has heard Sordello's story > told!'\\". The poem was, however, championed decades later by Algernon Swinburne and Ezra Pound. Plot summary The setting is northern Italy in the 1220s, dominated by the struggle between the Guelphs (partisans of the Pope) and the Ghibellines (partisans of the Holy Roman Emperor). Sordello is a Ghibelline, like his lord Ecelin II da Romano, and the soldier Taurello. Book I Browning begins by summoning the shades of all dead poets to listen to the story he has to tell. The one who intimidates him most is the \\"pale face[d]\\" Shelley (whom he does not name). The citizens of Verona have just heard that their Guelph prince, Count Richard of St Boniface, has been captured by Taurello Salinguerra. Not long ago, Taurello had been lured away from Ferrara; in his absence, his palaces were burned by Guelphs. On his return, he takes vengeance, and Azzo and Richard flee. They come back and besiege Ferrara, but when Richard is invited to a parley, he is captured. In a castle at Verona, the Council of Twenty-Four discuss the city's predicament; in a distant room, the poet Sordello sits motionless, thinking about his love, Palma. Browning describes Sordello's childhood and youth as an orphaned page at the lonely castle of Goito, near Mantua. He spent nearly all his time wandering about the pine forest and marsh, and had little human company other than the elderly servants; what he knew about the world he knew by hearsay. Sometimes he would stare at a stone font in a vault of the castle, dreaming that the female statues who held it up were under a curse, and that he could plead with God for their pardon and release. At other times he would indulge in daydreams about himself as a great hero, in whom all virtues, skills and powers would combine ‚Äì in other words, as a reinvention of Apollo. Browning comments that an aesthete can fail in life either through attempting nothing, or attempting too much. Sordello once heard that the lady Palma was being wooed by the Guelph, Count Richard, and she became another subject of his daydreams. Book II Sordello is wandering through the wood towards Mantua, daydreaming about Palma, when he comes upon a crowd gathered by the city's wall. They are listening to the aged troubador Eglamor. Impatient with Eglamor's feeble efforts, Sordello interrupts him and continues his song so effectively that, to his own astonishment, he wins the prize, and Palma bestows upon him her scarf. Eglamor responds graciously to his defeat, but walks home alone and troubled, and dies the same night. At his funeral, Sordello praises him highly. Eglamor's jongleur, Naddo, becomes Sordello's jongleur. Sordello, long reluctant to do so, finally enquires about his birth and origins. He is told that he was the son of an archer who saved the lives of Adelaide and Palma when they were nearly killed by a fire set by Ecelin himself. Disappointed, Sordello then gives up the plan of becoming a \\"man of action\\", and devotes himself to minstrelsy, but quickly becomes bored and slapdash; he tries reinventing his language to express his visions more directly, but encounters public incomprehension and personal fatigue. Sordello is deeply divided between his conceptions of poet as profession and poet as destiny. The lady Adelaide dies suddenly; then the news comes that Ecelin II has resolved to retire to a monastery. Taurello confronts his lord on horseback, but is unable to make him change his mind. Taurello is thus forced to abandon his plan to join the Emperor on a new Crusade. He travels to Mantua, where Sordello is appointed to welcome him with song, but the baffled troubadour, lacking inspiration, wanders back to Goito. Book III At Goito, Sordello re-immerses himself in his daydreams for a whole year, but he has lost his self-confidence, and he begins to wonder if he had thrown over all prospect of success as an ordinary human being, let alone as an Apollo. He concludes that he had been a narcissist, whose lack of devotion to anything outside of himself had been his ruin. His bitter musings are interrupted by Naddo, who brings news that he has been summoned to Verona to sing at Palma's wedding with Count Richard. But when Sordello arrives at Verona, Palma meets him and confesses her love for him. (At this point, the narrative returns to where it began at the start of Book I.) The death of Adelaide and the withdrawal of Ecelin has made it possible for her to confess her love to Sordello and ask him to marry her. This would make him the head of the House of Romano; in fact, Taurello approves strongly, as it would make an alliance with the Guelphs unnecessary. (Browning had written this much of the poem when in 1838 he travelled to Italy for the first time. With contemporary Venice as a background, the rest of Book III consists of a discussion of his own hopes for the future, and his reasons for writing Sordello.) Book IV Ferrara has been destroyed; envoys of the Lombard League arrive to negotiate a ransom for Count Richard. Sordello, too, arrives in Ferrara, making the long journey at the risk of his precarious health. He had planned to visit Azzo VII, camped outside the city, but first he goes to the palace of San Pietro to talk to Taurello Salinguerra. He is appalled by Taurello's explanation of the Ghibelline policy. He walks stunned through the city, and, on meeting the delegates from Verona, sings for them at their request; one of them turns out to be Palma in disguise. Back in the palace, Taurello ponders the events of his life (the theft of his first fianc√©e by Azzo VI, his plotting with Ecelin II to win back Ferrara, and the loss of his wife and child while fleeing from Vicenza), and briefly toys with the idea of taking Ecelin II's place. Sordello converses with Palma, and declares himself disgusted with both the Guelphs and the Ghibellines: both sides pursue selfish ends and exploit the common people. He conceives the idea of building a City of God in which Christendom can be reunited. At dawn he leaps up to meet the ordinary folk and to sketch the foundation of his plans in his mind. Book V By sunset, Sordello has already concluded his dream is impracticable. Even if the Utopia could be brought into being overnight by a single genius, the ideal city would crumble instantly when transferred into the hands of ordinary sinners. But he then realises his mistake: failure to accept that lasting progress can only be made one step at a time. He has already decided that the Guelphs represent the common people's interests more closely, because they subordinate, at least in principle, the momentary dominions procured by strength and cunning to the eternal dominion of God and His law. He concludes that his immediate duty is to convince Taurello to take up the Guelph cause and keep the Emperor away from Lombardy. Sordello goes to Taurello and Palma and delivers his pitch, but his curiosity to see what effect his speech is having on the soldier robs his long disused voice of emotion, and Taurello responds with puzzled amusement, and then with sarcasm. Sordello's pride is touched, and, realising that this will be his last chance to express himself in any consequential way, he defends with eloquence the concept of poetry as a calling higher than any other. When he has finished, Taurello shrugs and admits that his own life's work, seemingly more substantial, has been demolished by Ecelin's abdication, and impulsively throws the Imperial baldric on Sordello's neck, declaring him head of the house of Romano. A strange intuition arises in both. It is then that Palma confesses what she has known for more than a year: Sordello is Taurello's son, the child he thought had perished at Vicenza. Sordello desires to be left alone; Taurello and Palma go downstairs, where Taurello, excited out of his wits, starts to unfold a mad project to ignore both Emperor and Pope and build a new centre of power on the house of Romano. Book VI Sordello debates with himself about his best course of action. Should he persist in his determination to throw in his lot with the Guelphs, or does his sudden elevation to the status of a Ghibelline leader imply that his destiny lies with them? Would the common people benefit from the triumph of the Guelphs? Can he expect to fulfil any of his hopes at all, or would it be wiser to see to his own happiness, even at the expense of his new subordinates? He concludes that his previous failures have been a result of the failure to accept the limitations inherent in being human, and his reluctance to devote himself to a single end, or to a single cherished person. He throws the Imperial emblem to the floor. The stress of this moment is too much, and when Taurello and Palma return, they find that he has collapsed and died. Taurello's hopes of rising in the world are dashed. He marries Sophia, a daughter of Ecelin II, and dwindles into an unremarkable old age, eventually being captured and exiled to Venice. The Ghibelline cause triumphs through the ruthlessness of Ecelin III and Alberic. Sordello's career is inflated by chroniclers and he is misremembered as a statesman and hero. Nothing authentic remains of his life, apart from a fragment of the Goito lay, his first and least remarkable song.

Family and early life  His father, Abram Sutton Underhill (1852‚Äì1942) was an attorney, banker and prominent Quaker. His sister Ruth Murray Underhill (1883‚Äì1984) earned her PhD from Columbia University and was a social worker, anthropologist and author. Robert's long name was based on his maternal grandfather's full name plus his father's surname.http://www.ferristree.com/updtaes/john2.htmBombs & Bones: A Ferris Family Tree (retrieved September 17, 2009) He received an A.B. degree from Haverford College in 1909. At that time, Haverford was an elite Quaker college for men. He received a PhD from Harvard in 1916. He was an instructor in mathematics at Harvard in 1918, and a tutor and then instructor in philosophy at Harvard from 1925 to 1931. During that period, he was an active member of the Harvard Mountaineering Club. He began climbing in the Alps about 1910. His academic life's work was a study of logic.\\"In Memoriam\\", Henderson, Kenneth A., American Alpine Journal, 1984, pages 344 - 347 (retrieved September 17, 2009)  Mountaineering accomplishments  He was a longtime member of the Appalachian Mountain Club and editor of its journal Appalachia from 1928 to 1934. page 149 On August 4, 1928, Underhill, accompanied by Miriam O'Brien and guides Armand Charlet and G. Cachat, completed the first ascent of the traverse from the Aiguilles du Diable to Mont Blanc du Tacul in the Alps.Milner, C. Douglas, Mont Blanc & the Aguilles, page 92 (Robert Hale Limited, London, 1955) This route involves \\"climbing five outstanding summits over 4000 meters in superb surroundings.\\"R√©buffat, Gaston, The Mont Blanc Massif: The 100 Finest Routes, Translated from the French by Jane and Colin Taylor, page 140 (Kaye & Ward, London and Oxford University Press, New York, 1974) On this same trip, Underhill completed guided ascents of the Peuterey and Brenva ridges of Mont Blanc. His climbing partner Miriam O'Brien was later to become his wife, and a famous mountaineer in her own right. Underhill and Kenneth Henderson were responsible for introducing technical mountaineering to Grand Teton National Park in 1929, the year the park was formed. They completed the first ascent of the east ridge of the Grand Teton. In 1930, he returned to the Tetons, and was unsuccessful in a solo attempt on the North Ridge of the Grand Teton. His article On the Use and Management of the Rope in Rock Work was published in the Sierra Club Bulletin in February, 1931. This influential 22 page article covered rope use, knots, belaying, \\"roping down\\" (now called rapelling or abseiling), and the use of slings. Writing during a period when many climbers still resisted such safety innovations, Underhill described roped team climbing as \\"one of the finest experiences that mountaineering can afford.\\" He was back in the Grand Tetons for six weeks the summer of 1931, completing on July 15 a first ascent of the southeast ridge of the Grand Teton, a route which now bears his name. On July 19, 1931, Underhill and park ranger Fritiof Fryxell completed the \\"remarkable\\" first ascent of the North Ridge of the Grand Teton, which is rated IV, 5.7 in the Yosemite Decimal System. pages 147 - 152 Departing Wyoming, Underhill went on to California at the invitation of Sierra Club leader Francis P. Farquhar, for the purpose of teaching the most advanced techniques of roped climbing and belaying developed in the Alps. Underhill began by instructing a group of Sierra Club members in those techniques in the Minarets, practicing on the slopes of Mount Ritter and Banner Peak.Farquhar, Francis P., History of the Sierra Nevada (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1965) After this introductory course, an advanced group led by Underhill and including Norman Clyde, Jules Eichorn, Lewis Clark, Bestor Robinson and Glen Dawson traveled south to the Palisades, the most rugged and alpine part of the Sierra Nevada. There, on August 13, 1931, this party completed the first ascent of the last unclimbed 14,000+ foot peak in California, which remained unnamed due to its remote location above the Palisade Glacier. After a challenging ascent to the summit, the climbers were caught in an intense lightning storm, and Eichorn barely escaped electrocution when \\"a thunderbolt whizzed right by my ear\\". The mountain was named Thunderbolt Peak to commemorate that close call. Photo of Jules Eichorn, Norman Clyde, Robert L. M. Underhill and Glen Dawson taken the day after the first ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney. Three days later on August 16, Underhill, Clyde, Eichorn and Dawson completed the first ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the contiguous United States. By California standards at that time, the route was considered extremely exposed, especially the famous Fresh Air Traverse. Steve Roper called this route \\"one of the classic routes of the Sierra, partly because of its spectacular location and partly because it was the first really big wall to be climbed in the range.\\"Roper, Steve, The Climber's Guide to the High Sierra (San Francisco, Sierra Club Books, 1976) Porcella & Burns wrote that \\"the climb heralded a new standard of technical competence in Californian rock climbing.\\" Underhill himself commented that \\"the beauty of the climb lies chiefly in its unexpected possibility, up the apparent precipice, and in the intimate contact it affords with the features that lend Mount Whitney its real impressiveness.\\" page 279 Bestor Robinson described Underhill's influence on California rock climbing in a 1934 Sierra Club Bulletin article: \\"The seed of the lore of pitons, carabiners, rope-downs, belays, rope traverses, and two man stands was sown in California in 1931 by Robert L. M. Underhill, a member of the Appalachian Mountain Club, with considerable experience in the Alps. That seed has sprouted and grown in California climate with exuberant vigor sufficient to satisfy the most vociferous Chamber of Commerce.\\" He married mountaineer Miriam O'Brien on January 28, 1932, and they had two sons, Robert and Brian, born in 1936 and 1939. After World War II, he climbed with his wife in the Wind River Range of Wyoming, the Mission, Swan and Beartooth ranges of Montana, and the Sawtooth range of Idaho.  Legacy  The Underhill Couloir above the Palisade Glacier is a key part of his 1931 first ascent route on Thunderbolt Peak, and is named in his honor.

As one of the pioneers in the field of fluorescein angiography, he is generally acknowledge to be a leading authority in vascular diseases of the eye and the optic nerve. For over 60 years, Hayreh has been actively involved in basic, experimental, and clinical research in ophthalmology, publishing over 400 original peer- reviewed articles in various international ophthalmic journals, 6 classical monographs and books in his field of research, and more than 50 chapters in ophthalmic books.Living legends in ophthalmology - Prof Sohan Singh Hayreh. Indian J Ophthalmol 2018;66:1673. He has made many seminal observations dealing with the ocular circulation in health and disease, the optic disc and the optic nerve, retinal and choroidal vascular disorders, glaucomatous optic neuropathy, fundus changes in malignant arterial hypertension, ocular neovascularization, rheumatologic disorders of the eye, and nocturnal arterial hypotension. He is an elected fellow of the National Academy of Medical Sciences. Biography Early Life in India Sohan Singh Hayreh at the ceremony (12 June 2009) where he received an honorary fellowship from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists in London. Hayreh was born in the small village of Littran in the Indian state of Punjab. As the eldest son in a farming family, his mother decided he should go to medical school because there were no physicians in the area and no medical help was available when anyone in the family was ill. In 1946, he started his medical education at King Edward Medical College at Lahore, which is in current-day Pakistan. However, due to the partition of India in 1947, Hayreh, along with the college's other non-Muslim students had to leave Lahore. He was able to finish his medical degree in Amritsar, which held the only other available medical college in his home state of Punjab. After graduating from medical school and initial training in general surgery, he decided to join the Indian Army Medical Corps on a short service commission; where part of the time he worked as a general surgeon. He served most of his three years with the army in rough field conditions near the India‚ÄìPakistan border. After his commitment to the army had ended, he was anxious to pursue an academic and research career. In 1955, he accepted the only available academic position available, which was in the anatomy department in the newly opened Government Medical College, Patiala. Research career in Britain and Beyond In his research, Hayreh has ‚Äúchallenged and changed conventional wisdom‚Äù in the field of his research in ophthalmology.Lotery, Andrew. ‚ÄúCitation for the Award of Honorary FRCOphth.‚Äù Honorary Fellowship Ceremony. Royal College of Ophthalmologists, London, England. 2009. His first research project while at the Government Medical College was to confirm the findings by Jules Francois and A. Neetens of the existence of the central artery of the optic nerve; Hayreh found instead that the artery did not exist. In 1961, Hayreh was the first Indian awarded the highly prestigious Beit Memorial Research Fellowship in Medical Sciences at the University of London to investigate the pathogenesis of optic disc edema when the intracranial pressure is elevated. During his fellowship, he was mentored by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder, the prominent British ophthalmologist. At the end of his three years as Beit Memorial Research Fellow, Hayreh had to decide whether to \\"go back to India and say good-bye to any serious ophthalmic research for lack of facilities and funds, or stay and try to make a career in British ophthalmology\\". He decided to stay in England and pursued a career in research, clinical ophthalmology and teaching. After spending one year as a senior house officer at Birmingham & Midland Eye Hospital, Hayreh returned to the Institute of Ophthalmology, University of London, in 1965, this time as lecturer in clinical ophthalmology. His research at this time dealt mostly with the in vivo blood supply of the optic nerve head and glaucoma. Presentation of Watumull Prize for outstanding contribution to Medical Research by the Watumull Trust, Honolulu. India House (Indian Embassy), London, 1964. In 1969, Hayreh took the position as senior lecturer (later reader) in ophthalmology at the University of Edinburgh and also worked as consultant ophthalmologist to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. While in Edinburgh, Hayreh met his future wife, Shelagh Henderson, the administrator of the Eye Pavilion of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Hayreh credits his wife as instrumental in the editing and preparation of his publications. In 1973, Hayreh was invited to join the University of Iowa's Department of Ophthalmology, where he has remained ever since as both professor of ophthalmology and director of the Ocular Vascular Division at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. In 1987, the University of London awarded him the degree of Doctor of Science in Medicine for his seminal published work in the field of ocular circulation in health and disease and optic nerve disorders.

The architectural form of the Polish manor house evolved around the late Polish Renaissance period and continued until the Second World War, which, together with the communist takeover of Poland, spelled the end of the nobility in Poland. A 1944 decree nationalized most mansions as property of the nobility; few were adapted to other purposes and many slowly fell into ruin. A vast majority of such mansions remain unused and are slowly deteriorating. Architectural history During the times of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Polish nobility built manor houses in the countryside. This was a preferred location for one's residence, as the nobility, following the sarmatism ideology, felt contempt for the cities, even though members of this elite also had residences in a major city or town (but, these were large lateral apartments rather than town houses). The vast majority of such countryside manors were made of wood. Dw√≥r, Interia EncyklopediaNorman Davies, God's Playground, a History of Poland: The origins to 1795, Columbia University Press, 1982, , Google Print, p.246-247 They tended to fall into two types: rare palaces of the magnates, and smaller, one-story houses, in which wood was the most common building material. Starting with the Renaissance period, mansions built with mason work appeared, often designed to enhance their defensive characteristics. Dw√≥r, WIEM Encyklopedia Although early on, such mansions were often designed as defensive mini-fortresses, over time - around the baroque period - the defensive function began to disappear. The smallest ones had 2-4 rooms. Larger ones would have many more, including guest rooms and a chapel. Magnates' palaces would even boast their own opera house. Common furniture included benches, cupboards, tables, beds and small chairs, commonly made from tilia wood. Rarer furniture would include chests and wardrobes. Furniture was often painted (green being the most common color), sometimes engraved and inlaid. Walls were often painted with floral or moral and historical motifs, and decorated with Eastern (Persian, Turkish) tapestries and rugs, coats of arms, portraits, mirrors, weapons and trophies. Floors were wooden. Ceilings were carved and decorated with various hanging decorations (including candelabras). Windows in the richest mansions would be fitted with Venetian glass, and the rest would use green glass or waxed canvas. Stoves were common. Depending on a family's wealth, they would be made of materials from rough earthenware to porcelain and alabaster. Early renaissance mansions were based on a rectangular design, with corner chambers (alkierze) and a porch. Dw√≥r, PWN Encyklopedia The roof was a Polish variant of the hip roof (:pl:≈Åamany dach polski) covered with shakes. In the baroque period, alkierze were replaced by risalits, and mansard roofs appeared. The Classicism period saw porches replaced by porticos with tympanums. The dw√≥r style design was also popular in the Second Polish Republic (Polish: styl narodowy or styl dworkowy), and is still inspiring some modern Polish manors.

It was on the Anadyr River, near the head of small-boat navigation, about 300 miles upstream, 12 miles northeast of the present Markovo. In 1649 Semyon Dezhnyov built a zimov'ye (winter quarters) here after being wrecked on the Pacific coast the previous year. In 1650 Mikhail Stadukhin and Semyon Motora arrived overland from the Kolyma River. In 1659 Kurbat Ivanov took over, build a proper stockade and made major improvements in administration. About 1697, Anadyrsk was the launching place for Vladimir Atlasov's conquest of Kamchatka. The local Chukchis and Koryaks were warlike, and the post was attacked a number of times. Kennan reports its garrison through much of its service was 600 men and a battery of artillery. Its importance declined with the opening of the sea route through Okhotsk to Kamchatka in 1718. Subsequently, its importance was limited to interactions with the Chukchis. Concluding that attempts to collect tribute from the Chukchis were not a paying proposition, the Russian government of Catherine II ordered Anadyrsk abandoned in 1764. In 1866, when it was visited by George Kennan (at that time only the second non-Russian or non-native in living memory to do so), Anadyrsk consisted of four villages: Markovo (the central one), Pokorukov, Psolkin and Krepost. There were about 200 inhabitants and a priest. Krepost ('fort') was the site of the Anadyrsk fort, on a bank about 30 feet above the level of the river, and at that time consisted of a dozen log cabins, with no trace of the old fortifications visible. Markovo was about 15 versts (16 km) upriver, and Pokorukov a further 20 versts. Kennan described it as the Ultima Thule of Russian civilization. See also *Chukchi people References * Bush, Richard J.

Washington, D.C. Nina Katchadourian (born 1968) is an American interdisciplinary artist and educator. She works with photography, sculpture, video, and sound‚Äîoften in playful ways. She is best known for her \\"Lavatory Self-Portraits in the Flemish Style,\\" a series of self-portraits taken in airplane bathrooms. Her projects have been exhibited widely, including a solo show at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego in July 2008, the Turku Art Museum in Finland in January 2006, the ArtPace Foundation for Contemporary Art. A major mid-career survey exhibition of her art accompanied by an exhibition catalog was organized by the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin in 2017 and traveled to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University, 2017‚Äì2018. Biography Nina Katchadourian was born in Stanford, California in 1968. Her father, Herant Katchadourian, a Turkish-born and Beirut-raised Armenian, was a psychiatrist, a former Dean at Stanford University, and a Professor Emeritus of Human Biology. Her mother, Stina Katchadourian, is Finnish, and was a literary translator, writer and Esperanto expert. She grew up spending summers on a small island in the Finnish archipelago, where she still spends part of each year. Katchadourian attended Gunn High School in Palo Alto, California. She received a B.A. degree from Brown University in 1989, and an M.F.A. degree from University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1993. She attended the Independent Study Program of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City in 1996. She lives and works in Brooklyn, New York, and is on the faculty at New York University, Gallatin School of Individualized Study. Work Nina Katchadourian has worked in many media, including sculpture, photography, video, and sound. The underlying concept is often marked by an intrinsic sense of humor, characterized by an intelligent, ironic and systemic reordering of natural processes. Her work is simple yet effective. Orderings Many of Katchadourian's pieces involve bringing an incisive and playful order to the world. The \\"Sorted Books\\" series, for instance, ranges from ephemeral and impromptu arrangements of volumes on the shelves of friends, to commissioned photographed orderings of books in museum and library collections. The body of work is available as a book published by Chronicle Books.  Mended Spider Webs  Her \\"mended spider webs\\" series involves making careful but obvious \\"repairs\\" to the rips that occur in natural spiderwebs.Nina Katchadourian Using tweezers and glue she continued the pattern of the spider webs with starched bright red twine. The tools used to repair these spider webs can also be found in her \\"Do-it Yourself Spiderweb Repair Kit\\" piece, also part of the \\"Mended Spider Webs\\" series. While working on the series, Katchadourian became interested in how nature feels about humans attempt to 'help'. The next morning she found that the spiders did not appreciate her help. When she went out to the first spiderweb repair the following morning she found the red twine unraveled and lying on the ground below. The spiders had rejected her help and undone all of her work throughout the night. Katchadourian was able to capture the rejection process on tape in a 10 min video titles \\"GIFT/GIFT\\". Maps and charts In some cases, Katchadourian makes this obsession with order explicit, by working with maps and charts. Her \\"Family Tree\\" series creates faux genealogies for such objects as rocks and airplanes. Other pieces are literally made of the fragments of maps. Her \\"Coastal Merger\\" shows a map of the United States made of only the Eastern and Western seaboards; \\"Map Dissection I\\" cuts out only the streets from a standard-issue road atlas, and mounts them as a kind of arterial web on glass. Performances Katchadourian has brought her fascination with systems to public spaces as well. In CARPARK, a 1994 work at Southwestern College, she sorted by color vast numbers of cars in more than a dozen parking lots.Found In Translation ArtReview, April 2008, p. 68. In 2006, in a project sponsored by the Public Art Fund, Katchadourian installed a telescope on a Manhattan street corner, focused on a 17th-floor office of a nearby building. During the course of the project, the lawyer who inhabited the office would arrange objects on his window sill to send coded messages to the observer.Watch That Space: The Oracle of the 17th Floor The New York Times, Randy Kennedy, November 21, 2006.  Seat Assignment  Through the use of humor, Katchadourian is able to create art using materials that are on hand at any given time. This series which she calls \\"seat assignments\\" includes work such as, \\"birdsong substituted for car alarms... a popcorn machine's clatter interpreted as Morse code... the piling of pretzel crumbs atop a magazine photograph of a bridge to suggest a landslide, for example, or the configuring of the folds of a black sweater to resemble the face of a gorilla\\". These works while as a concept are about connecting two things ranging from, \\"seamless to awkwardly disjunctive\\" are not simple ideas that fall flat, in that they exploit the brains desires to form meaning.  Museum interventions  A promotional dust wipe produced during Dust Gathering's planning, as displayed in the 2015 exhibition Messing with MoMA In 2015, the Museum of Modern Art invited Katchadourian to produce a work under its Artists Experiment program, in which contemporary artists create or perform pieces reflecting upon or utilizing museum resources. Having noticed the immense quantity of dust which collected in various locations around the museum's architecture and on artworks within its collection, Katchadourian produced a series of audio segments for the museum's existing audio guide program which toured visitors through a series of stops where dust commonly collected, and featured interviews with various MoMA staff on their methodologies and experiences dealing with dust in the museum. The audio tour became available in October 2016, and was scheduled to run through April 2017.

First exhibition, a survey of 146 contemporary figurative artists was selected and organized by the artists of the Green Mountain, Bowery, Prince Street and First Street Galleries - although it was a broad survey and did not exhibit just artists from those galleries. After the first show older artists were brought into its structure. Other group shows followed in clusters of galleries on 57th street and in museums: ‚ÄúBenefit Exhibit‚Äù in 1979 (40 artists), ‚ÄúYounger Artists: Benefit Exhibit‚Äù in 1980 (61 artists),‚ÄúIntimate Visions‚Äù in 1982 (14 artists), ‚ÄúNarrative Sculpture‚Äù in 1982 (12 Artists), ‚ÄúPainted Light‚Äù in 1983 (90 artists) and ‚ÄúBodies and Souls‚Äù in 1983 (156 artists) to name some. By 1980 The Museum was publishing a bimonthly newsletter and by 1982 a magazine. By 1984 the Museum finally had a home; a building on West Broadway. This space only lasted until 1986 when the organization ceased to exist.

Museum Director: Robert Godfrey The whole idea was Paul Georges' but, as you know and has been stated, it was given the necessary spark by the 1976 exhibit organized by the co-op galleries. The boards were established in 1979, and in that year an inaugural exhibit featuring leading figurative artists was staged in six major New York Galleries. By then, the CCF ( Cultural Council Foundation of New York) had become the museum's fiscal manager and through the CCF the ACM began functioning as a tax-exempt, not- for-profit organization. In 1980 the Board of Regents of the State of New York granted Museum Status to the organization.  The Manifesto  In the Spring of 1979 director Robert Godfrey and the Board of Artists drafted the first mission statement of the newly structured museum.

In 1851, Julie attended school at Saint-Laurent near Montreal. It was a local boarding school newly opened by the Sisters Marianites of Holy Cross. In 1859, she became a postulant in the order and was given the name Sister Marie de Saint-Basile. This name honoured Basile Moreau, the congregation's founder. As she took greater responsibilities in the Canadian houses the growth of the Congregation of Holy Cross found itself in an expansion crisis. L√©ocadie Gascoin, named Marie des Sept-Douleurs, dealt with this matter for a time. However, as founder of the Marianite Sisters of Holy Cross in Le Mans, France, she returned there in 1863. By 1879, there was direct conflict between Marie des Sept-Douleurs and the Canadian sisters. Bishop √âdouard-Charles Fabre of Montreal, now took a direct role in negotiation, petitions to Rome and the like, attempting to protect the interests of the community. In 1882, with some autonomy carved out for the Canadian houses, Marie de Saint-Basile was appointed vicar superior of the renamed Sisters of the Holy Cross and the Seven Dolours. Further actions took place and, in 1890, Mother Marie de Saint- Basile was elected the first superior general. In 1896, she was re-elected. Under Mother Marie de Saint-Basile, the congregation underwent a large and positive expansion. She moved to less onerous duties in 1902. She is most remembered for her determination and skill during the times of conflict and expansion. She was also a leader in the field of education of young females.

He played as a lock. He was known by several nicknames, including \\"La Merluche\\" and \\"Le Massif Central\\". He was known for his violent play and after headbutting Ricky Evans the Welsh prop in Paris causing a ruck to collapse on him breaking his ankle, resulted in his being sued successfully in the courts for damages. This was the first case of its kind and BBC video evidence was used in court. After that he never played for France again. Merle started his career at ASM Clermont Auvergne, moving then to RC Vichy. He also would play for FC Grenoble, returning for ASM Clermont Auvergne at the season of 1995/96, where he would stay until 1999/2000. He then moved to RC Narbonne for two seasons, from 2000/01 to 2001/02. His final season was spent at Stade Aurillacois, in 2002/03. The French lock had 45 caps for France, scoring 6 tries, 30 points in aggregate, from 1993 to 1997. He was selected for the 1995 Rugby World Cup, playing all the five matches. He played four times at the Five Nations, in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, winning it the last time, with a Grand Slam.

The game was inspired by Jet Set Willy.Kokotoni Wilf Review, Crash, Issue 9 (October 1984)  Gameplay  In Kokotoni Wilf, Ulrich the Magician must renew the sleep spell on the lair of dangerous dragons, lest the creatures again awake. To do this he needs the Dragon Amulet, which has been broken into many pieces and scattered across time and space. These pieces must be retrieved and reassembled. Ulrich is too old to undertake the task himself and so has sent his assistant, Kokotoni Wilf, on the mission instead. He has given Wilf magical wings to assist him on his quest.http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi- bin/displaypage.pl?issue=51&page;=28 The game is a 2D flip-screen platformer. The player must guide Kokotoni Wilf through a series of six levels, all set in different historical eras, in search of the pieces of the amulet (which resemble Stars of David). When all the pieces in a level have been collected a timegate will open (a flashing amulet piece) to allow Wilf to travel to the next era. Wilf's journey begins amid dinosaurs in ancient prehistory and ends amid spaceships and robots in the year 2001. Wilf cannot jump but can fly using his wings. He cannot kill enemies and must evade them instead. The game was released in conjunction with a competition by Elite Systems. The Magician's purpose in sending Wilf on his mission is only revealed on completion of the game, and the first hundred people to send this information to Elite won a copy of their next game, The Fall Guy. Reception Crash magazine enjoyed the Spectrum version of the game which was described as \\"a novel looking game which employs well tested routines to make it addictive in play.\\" It was awarded an overall rating of 84%.http://www.crashonline.org.uk/09/kokoton.htm Zzap!64 reviewed the budget rerelease of the Commodore 64 version. They thought the game was overly difficult yet was worth a look due to the novelty of the flying and good presentation. It was given a 77% rating.

The paper has won many awards, including a Walkley Award by journalist Anthony Radford for Suburban and Regional Affairs. Radford also was the recipient of a Quill Award for Best Regional or Rural Affairs Report in 2007. Victorian Country Press Awards for a paper with circulation greater than 10,000 include: Journalism 2006, 2007 and 2008; Local Reporting 2006, 2007 and 2008; Best Use of Colour 2007; Best Photographic Study 2008; Best News Photograph 2008; and Overall Newspaper Excellence 2008. The awards won in 2006 relate specifically to the paper's coverage of the water crisis confronting Bendigo. At the time, a decade of drought had depleted the city's reservoirs to the point where supplies were likely to run out by year's end. In 2009 the paper commenced a campaign to promote the building of a new Bendigo hospital. In September 2019, it was announced the paper would cease publication as a separate entity and absorbed by the Bendigo Advertiser which aims to boost poor circulation figures of the latter masthead.

Between 1976 and 1977, he served as Foreign Minister under Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda. He was the son and father of two former Prime Ministers, Ichir≈ç \\"Iichiro Hatoyama; Ex-Foreign Minister, 75\\" (obituary), New York Times. December 20, 1993. and Yukio respectively.  Early years  Hatoyama was born in Tokyo to a high-profile family. He studied at the University of Tsukuba. Iichir≈ç was a 1941 graduate of Tokyo Imperial University's School of Law; but despite family pressure, he resisted going into law or politics. Instead, he decided to become a public servant; but his plans were interrupted by the Pacific War. He enlisted in the Navy, and was presumed dead when the war ended.Itoh, Mayumi. (2003). The Hatoyama Dynasty: Japanese Political Leadership through the Generations, pp. 143-144. At end of the war, Iichir≈ç was one of 6.6 million Japanese military personnel and civilians who were stranded overseas. At the time, this was about 8 percent of Japan's entire population.Tatsuki, Mariko et al. (1985). The First Century of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, pp.118-119. These statistics provide a context for understanding what it meant that Iichir≈ç was unable to return home until December 31, 1945.  Family  Iichir≈ç was the eldest son of Ichir≈ç Hatoyama, who was the Prime Minister of Japan in 1955-1956. His grandfather Kazuo Hatoyama was Speaker of the House of Representative in the first Imperial Diet. Despite family pressure, he was interested in building a life outside the arena of Japanese politics; and his sons also grew to become independent- minded men. Iichir≈ç is the father of Yukio Hatoyama, who was the former Prime Minister, following a win by the opposition coalition in the 2009 elections. His wife, Yasuko Hatoyama, is a daughter of Shojiro Ishibashi, the founder of Bridgestone Corporation.Hayashi, Yuka. Japan's Hatoyama Sustains Family Political Tradition, Wall Street Journal. August 1, 2009. The couple have two sons. Kunio Hatoyama, like his brother Yukio, may be described as a fourth generation politician and most recently the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications. The Hatoyamas have been described in the media as the \\"Kennedys of Japan\\".  Career  In 1941, Iichir≈ç joined the Finance Ministry, but this work was interrupted by the Pacific War. In 1946, he began making a place for himself in the meritocracy of the Budget Bureau. In this work, he caught the attention of men like Takeo Fukuda, who would figure prominently in later life. In due course, Iichir≈ç was promoted to the position of Deputy Director General in 1963; and he became Director General in 1965.Itoh, pp. 144. He served as administrative Vice Minister in the Finance Ministry from 1971 to 1972. The position of vice minister is the highest rank in the civil service, comparable to that of \\"permanent secretary\\" in the British civil service or \\"undersecretary\\" in the civil service of the United States government. The minister is always a politician. After Iichir≈ç's retirement in 1974, he gave in to long-standing family pressure; and his career in politics began with his election to the House of Councilors (HC) in the Diet.Itoh, pp. 145‚Äì147. The capstone of his political career was the period in which he served as Foreign Minister in 1976‚Äì1977.

Otero made her debut under her own label Divine Spell Music Group in 2008. Otero has released one album and one EP to date. Her single \\"My First Everything\\" was released in 2006 and had national airplay on indie radio stations marking the beginning of her professional career as an artist. It reached #1 for two consecutive weeks on the Hot97.net Online Radio. Her debut album My SpiritArticle in La Voz Hispana was released on Christmas Day of 2008 and has sold over 500 digital copies most of which were from fans in Colombia and New York City. Otero recently wrapped up her Free Spirit TourMelissa Otero Embarks on First US Tour which included performances in New York, Puerto Rico and throughout the Fox Valley of the State of Wisconsin during the summer of 2009. As of 2011, in addition to her touring, Otero began working on her second album with Secret Sounds, CEO/producer Stefan Moessle titled \\"Angels and Demons\\".  Early life  Melissa Otero Cintr√≥n was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey and grew up in the countryside of Yauco, Puerto Rico. She is the fourth child of Luis Otero, a retired mechanic, and Nellie Cintr√≥n. When Otero was five years old, her family settled in Yauco where her parents bought a piece of land and decided to build their dream home. After the house was complete, her father joined the National Guard and was sent to the mainland to begin boot camp while her mother struggled between work, school, and four kids. At the age of 9, Otero saw the Gloria Estefan Let It Loose Homecoming Concert. She remarked to her mother: ‚ÄúWhen I grow up, I want to do that!‚Äù and soon after, Otero's dream of professionally pursuing music began. As a child, Otero would create her own ‚Äúhome concerts‚Äù imitating Gloria Estefan and others. She struggled finding venues at which to perform live due to her choice to perform in English while she was, at the time, living in a Spanish-speaking country. She performed at many local talent shows. On several occasions she won second place to later be told by the judges that she had not been awarded first place because of her choice to perform in English. By the time Otero was close to 14, her mother decided to help her create a professional demo. A local recording studio called The Time Machine, run by Ivan Nazario, a well-respected producer in Puerto Rico, was opening in town and her mother immediately contacted them to inquire about pricing. She became their first customer but was unable to record there because the studio was not finished. They set out to San Juan, Puerto Rico and recorded at the Horizon Studios to record the covers ‚ÄúThe Rose‚Äù by Bette Midler and ‚ÄúYou Mean The World To Me‚Äù by Toni Braxton.  Once In A Lifetime Concert 1998  During her final months in high school, Otero and her mother began working on her first concert ever in which she titled Once In A Lifetime.Beginnings: Once In A Lifetime Concert By 1995, American music became very popular and performing in English was not that much of a struggle anymore. The concert had many local businesses, schools and friends involved allowing Melissa to perform at the Starz Theater in Yauco, Puerto Rico. They sold over 300 tickets and was deemed a ‚Äúhuge success‚Äù for no other independent artist had been able to accomplish such an event while performing in another language.  Depression  During the summer of 2006, Melissa had released her single ‚ÄúMy First Everything‚Äù but was struggling with depression. She did however continue writing and began her journey in writing 'My Spirit\\" Astorian Sings of Faith, Depression on New CD  Angels and Demons  During the months of July 2011 and August 2011, Melissa's new promotional track \\"Angels and Demons\\" was featured on US Airways as part of the Sonicbids Indie Showcase.

Less common recessive mutations causing this condition include those in the TTN, MEGF10 and CACNA1S genes. Automsomal dominant mutations associated with this disease include those in MYH7 and CACNA1S. The pathogenesis is not well understood at present. Epidemiology The epidemiology of this condition is not known. Studies have suggested that the prevalence of all congenital myopathies lies between 35-50 per million children.Hughes MI, Hicks EM, Nevin NC, Patterson VH (1996) The prevalence of inherited neuromuscular disease in Northern Ireland. Neuromuscul Disord 6:69‚Äì73Darin N, Tulinius M (2000) Neuromuscular disorders in childhood: a descriptive epidemiological study from Western Sweden. Neuromuscul Disord 10:1‚Äì9 Clinical features There are four types of minicore myopathy Classical type (75% cases) The usual presentation is in infancy or childhood with hypotonia or proximal weakness. This weakness tends to affect the shoulder girdle and the inner thigh. The other main features are *Failure to thrive due to feeding difficulties * Axial muscle weakness, particularly affecting neck and trunk flexors * High pitched voice * Myopathic facial features A high arched or cleft palate may be present. Later developing features include a progressive scoliosis and respiratory impairment. Ophthalmoplegic form (5-10% cases) This typically presents with weakness of abduction and upward gaze. Ptosis may occur. There is also weakness of the proximal limb muscles. Progressive form with hand involvement (10% cases) The type presents with progressive hand weakness and hypermobility. Hip girdle weakness may be present and exercise induced myalgia is common. Scoliosis and respiratory problems are mild or absent. Antenatal form with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (10% cases) This diagnosis may be suspected prenatally with reduced fetal movements and polyhydramnios. This typically presents with contractures at birth due to poor foetal movement. Other features include a long head, low set ears and a short neck. The respiratory muscles can be moderately to severely affected and problems with breathing are common. Diagnosis The diagnosis may be suspected on clinical grounds. On blood testing the creatinine kinase may be raised. Imaging with ultrasound or MRI will show abnormalities in the affected muscles but these changes are not diagnostic. The diagnostic test is a muscle biopsy. On biopsy type 1 fibres predominate. The sarcomeres are disorganised and the mitochondria depleted. Necrosis and fibrosis are absent. Within the fibres multiple cores are visible. Differential diagnosis * Central core disease * Centronuclear myopathy * Congenital muscular dystrophy with rigidity of the spine Management There is presently no curative treatment. Management is supportive. There is an association with malignant hyperthermia and this should be borne in mind if anesthesia is required.

In 1839 he moved to Iowa to continue his law practice. During the 1840s he purchased large tracts of land becoming the most extensive land owner in Iowa at the time.Find-a-Grave He also became the president of the Des Moines Valley Railroad. Civil War On February 22, 1862 Reid was appointed colonel of the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment for service in the Union Army during the Civil War. Colonel Reid and the 15th Iowa first saw combat at the Battle of Shiloh. Because his regiment arrived on the field of battle once the fighting had already begun it was rushed to the thickest of the fightHistory of Iowa and was attached to Benjamin M. Prentiss' division fighting around the Hornet's Nest. During the fighting Reid was severely wounded in the neck and was presumed dead. His body was recovered and brought to the rear where he soon regained enough consciousness to rejoin the fighting. Reid was out of action for a time following the battle but fully recovered despite the Chicago Tribune running an article stating he had been paralyzed. Reid returned to command a brigade in the Army of the Tennessee stationed around Corinth, Mississippi. General Ulysses S. Grant noticed Reid's gallantry at Shiloh and recommended him for promotion. Reid was promoted to brigadier general of U.S. volunteers on March 13, 1863. General Reid was now assigned to command the 1st Brigade, 6th Division, XVII Corps headquartered near Lake Providence, Louisiana. This brigade was a mix of white regiments and African American regiments. Reid was quoted saying \\"every colored soldier who stops a rebel bullet saves a white man‚Äôs life\\". During the siege of Vicksburg, Reid's brigade operated on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River, fighting skirmishes at Lake Providence and Goodrich's Landing during the month of June. After Vicksburg fell to the Union army, Reid was transferred to command the District of Cairo in southern Illinois. Later life On April 14, 1864 Reid resigned from the army and returned to Iowa.

Medlicott (died 1866) was a geologist and General Assistant with the Geological Survey of Ireland. He studied the geology of India. Background J. G. Medlicott had graduated from Trinity College, Dublin. In the year 1851, he relinquished his post and joined the Geological Survey of India which was established by the East India Company and the Government of Bengal. While in the GSI, he got engaged in a mapping program to find coal deposits started by Thomas Oldham, who was the first Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India. Soon after, Joseph's younger brother, Henry Benedict Medlicott also left for India and after serving as Professor of Geology at Roorkee, joined the Geological Survey of India. It was H. B. Medlicott who first coined the term Gondwana in 1872 for the coal bearing formations of India. Narmada-Son line That the Narmada and Son Rivers flow in a straight line of disturbance from the Gulf of Cambay in the west to the Ganges valley in the east and that this line marks not only the southern boundary of the late Proterozoic Vindhyan Supergroup rocks but also the northern limit of deposition of the coal-bearing Gondwana rocks was first shown by Joseph G. Medlicott, a member of the founding team of the Geological Survey of India, as early as in 1860. It will not be an exaggeration at all to say that this entire memoir is nothing but an account of the Narmada-Son line, and its principal thesis is the focus on the aspects of the line of Narmada and Son valleys, albeit with a rather primitive geological or scientific knowledge base as could be expected of a mid-nineteenth century publication. Geologists in India do not know this too well since the memoir in question is out-of-print but those working on the aspects of Narmada Son line must not fail to acknowledge this epoch making great work by an unmatched genius and the concerned scientist engaged in research on Narmada-Son line must cite it in the list of references at the end of the paper. In central India, there occurs an important tectonic lineament, viz. the Narmada-Son line stretching from Broach near the Gulf of Cambay, where Narmada River meets the Arabian Sea, to as far east as the place called Dehri-on-Son where Son River drains into the Ganges. The characteristic feature of this lineament, along which two major rivers flow is that it marks the southern limit of deposition of the sediments (and sporadically occurring volcanics) of the rocks of the Vindhyan Supergroup; besides, it also forms the northern limit of the coal-bearing Gondwana Supergroup rocks. The existence of this peculiar and tectonically significant feature was first very elaborately described a good one hundred and fifty years ago by Medlicott in a memoir titled The Geological Structure of the Central Portion of the Nerbudda District. In fact the entire memoir is devoted only to this aspect of this important tectonic feature. In 1962, a hundred years after Medlicott's work was published, this work was plagiarised by William Dixon West, then a Professor of Geology in the Department of Applied Geology, Dr H S Gour University, Sagar, India. Medlicott mentioned two important points about this unique feature of tectonic significance in Central India and he focuses repeatedly on these two aspects throughout the course of discussion in this memoir. These two aspects are: (i) This feature of Vindhyan escarpment and the valleys of the Narmada and the Son rivers being extremely straight or rectilinear for an appreciable distance; and (ii) That the rocks of the Vindhyan Series occur only to the north of the two valleys and are not found anywhere to the south of these valleys and the rocks containing coal were to be found only to the south of this linear feature and not to the north of it in the vast stretch of area that was covered. Regarding the first of these points of great significance, Medlicott remarked (1860, p. 228): ‚ÄúThis line of escarpment joins the north side of the valleys of the Nerbudda and of the Sone; it deviates little from a straight line, when considered as a whole, and even within shorter limits, its rectilinear direction is very remarkable.‚Äù On the second point of significance, Medlicott has had a lot to say. He has emphasised this second point at numerous places in the text of this 340 page memoir, of which nearly 200 pages are occupied by the paper by Medlicott. Also, the name Vindhyan was coined by the Geological Survey of India during this period only. Medlicott remarks (1860, p. 115): \\"The entire group of Sandstones, Shales, &c.;, of Bundelcund and Rewah which lie north of the River Nerbudda, (or more correctly of that part of the river Nerbudda included in our map,) the great scarp of which rocks is well seen along that valley as that of the Sone, was separated totally from the Sandstone rocks associated with coal, &c.;, which occur to the south of those rivers, and with which it had previously been confounded: to this great group the name of the Vindhyan was applied, as being best seen in the Vindhyan range‚Äù. He then points out to say that the rocks of the Vindhyan Series are different and were therefore separated from those such as Talchir Series, Mahadeva Series etc. For example, (Medlicott, 1860, p. 119):‚Äù Thus the Table land of Malwah and Bundelcund is formed of the sandstones seen in the Vindhyan escarpment, and described in the following pages under the name of ‚ÄúVindhyan Sandstones‚Äù, a group of rocks not known to occur anywhere south of this line of the north escarpment of the Nerbudda valley, at least not within the area mapped. In a similar manner the line of escarpment bounding the valley on the south, marks the northern limit of a series of rocks, which will be found described below, as including those formations called in our lists ‚ÄúTalcheer‚Äù, ‚ÄúDamuda‚Äù, ‚ÄúMahadeva‚Äù &c.;, and no rocks belonging to any of these groups are known, within our area, to occur north of this line of escarpment‚Äù. About the general extent of Narmada Son line and the disposition of rocks of two different types occurring to the north and the south, Medlicott said (1860, p. 228), ‚ÄúThe remarkable physical features now to be fully described, characterize with more or less distinctness, the band of country stretching from the Gulf of Cambay on the west, to the Ganges valley on the east, and including the Sone as well as the Nerbudda River. Most maps of British India show a marked range, called the Vindhyan Range, running along this line; Mandu stands near the western extremity of it, as generally shewn on the published maps and Rotasgur at the eastern end. Running parallel to this line, is a much less regular range, very different in general aspect, formed as has been stated, of other rocks, and lying on the south side of the Nerbudda valley, within our area. Beyond the district surveyed, a very similar arrangement is known to form a continuation of the range along the banks of the Sone, the south side of whose valley has been found, (in part of its course at least) to be formed, like that of the Nerbudda, of rocks different from those of the Vindhyan escarpment\\". Again on p. 146 of the memoir he emphasises the distribution of the Vindhyans and the Gondwanas as being on two sides of this major conspicuous lineament. Quoting him (1860, p. 146),\\" If we take together the sub-divisions ¬ß5, ¬ß6 and ¬ß7 (Talchir, Damuda and Mahadeva) of our list, it will be seen from the map that rocks belonging to these groups, form the ranges which bound the Nerbudda valley on the south, as the Vindhyans do that which bounds it on the north\\". And he further goes on to say :\\"Nowhere have the Vindhyans been seen in contact with these rocks (Gondwanas) and between the boundaries which respectively limit the two groups, a long country lies, which may be considered as occupied by the crystalline rocks, these being however, for the most part, covered by the more recent ossiferous sands, and gravels, and surface clay\\". Medlicott also noted that the entire range and the valleys had a singularly uniform trend of ENE-WSW, or more precisely a trend N75¬∫E-S75¬∫W. Quoting him (Medlicott, 1860, p. 141), \\"The rocks of the Vindhyan series cover an immense area in Central India (see map Pl. III). The great Table land of Bundelcund and Malwah is mainly formed of them, and their southern boundary, continuous as it is with that of the table land itself, is marked, as has been stated, by one of the finest physical features imaginable: the vast plateau terminates on the south in a line of escarpment which, stretching from east to west(or more correctly E 15¬∫N), (that is N 75¬∫E)forms the north side of the Nerbudda valley, and farther on towards the east holds a similar position in that of the Sone river‚Äù. The Vindhyans are known to have a monotonous composition over extremely large areas and lateral sedimentological variations are but few. This fact was also noted by Medlicott and that despite this there are variations at some places. Quoting him (1860, p. 142):‚Äù ‚Ä¶.its most marked characteristic certainly is the persistency of this lithological aspect over great areas. This sameness of texture is strongly in contrast with the prevailing character of all those more recent sandstone formations to the south‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù And further, ‚ÄúThis general constancy in lithological character does not, of course, imply the entire absence of varieties among the beds of the series : instead of clear quartz grits slightly earthy sandstones are found, and in many places ferruginous clay has been so strongly accumulated as to form a considerable ingredient in the mass.‚Äù Regarding the subhorizontality of the Vindhyans, Medlicott remarked (1860, p. 141),‚Äù ‚Ä¶that a slight undulating dip is the rule, so slight as to leave most commonly an impression of general horizontality, in spite of great disturbances which have locally affected the rocks along their southern boundary.‚Äù Soon after the publication of the memoir in question, Medlicott appears to have retired from the Survey or relinquished his position, because the literature shows that he was assigned a job to compile a report on the cotton plantation (Medlicott, 1862) in Bengal Province assigned to him by Lord Canning. For this he was rewarded in money and by being made a member of the Senate of the Calcutta University. He was a frequent writer in the Calcutta Review. Darwin wrote out to India to discover the author of an essay on his \\"Origin of Species\\" and finding it was Mr. Medlicott he wrote a most flattering letter to him saying that his was the best essay on the book. In 1862 he joined the Education Department of Bengal. The duties of post he occupied were reportedly ably discharged up to the time of his death. Death and legacy He was struck with Paralysis in 1863, went home to Dublin but could not stand inactivity and returned to India, where after a short resumption of his duties his health entirely gave way and he finally sank. He died on 10 May 1866. In an article from a newspaper it was mentioned: By the death of Mr. J.G. Medlicott the Government loses one of its few enthusiastic servants, and India one of its few scientific men. Another newspaper article in the Pioneer says: The deceased gentleman was an accomplished scholar and an able writer and his death is a public loss to the literary world of India. He was survived by his wife Agnes and son Samuel. The latter is reported to have later died in 1900 in British Columbia, Canada. An account of Medlicott after his death was given in the annual report of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1867 which mentioned that \\"Mr. J.G.

They were directly linked via a skyway. 10 Murray Street was demolished in 2018 as part of the Parliament Square redevelopment. History Construction commenced of the State Offices building in July 1966 and was completed in 1969 The building has three ground floor levels, a reception level raised on broad steps above Murray Street, 10 floors of offices and a penthouse for the plant room and a caretaker‚Äôs office. To avoid the expense of importing steel it was built of reinforced concrete with an externally expressed frame. The windows were recessed to avoid a glass curtain wall effect. The building was designed by the firm of Hartley Wilson and Partners, with the original design by Dirk Bolt and with later revisions by David Hartley Wilson. Demolition Site after demolition In 2009 the State Government announced Citta Property Group as the successful applicant for its plans to sell 10 Murray Street for the redevelopment of the \\"Parliament Square\\" precinct. Citta plans to give the square a Federation Square feel with the demolition of 10 Murray Street and the opening up of the Murray Street side. As well as this Citta plans to upgrade and maintain most of the older Davey Street Facing buildings as well as building a new seven-storey building facing Salamanca Place. The 19th century building known as the Red Brick Building will be demolished. There will also be shops, cafes and an amphitheatre with a large screen for public events. The redevelopment was originally to have been completed in 2012, with works beginning in March 2010, but the project has been delayed due to an appeal by the \\"Save 10 Murray\\" group, led by Briony Kidd. Three proposals were shortlisted for the redevelopment during the tender process, of which one design would retain and retrofit 10 Murray Street, while the two other plans would demolish the building. Demolition works began in September 2017, and by August 2018, the building was fully demolished.

He was born probably in Turieno and spent most of his life in the region of Li√©bana. He received a letter full of praise from Bishop Montanus of Toledo in 527.Jorge Loring, \\"El ‚ÄúLignum Crucis‚Äù de Santo Toribio de Li√©bana\\", who cites Pedro √Ålvarez, El Monasterio de Santo Toribio de Li√©bana y el Lignum Crucis (1995, ). In his preaching he condemned as heresy the Priscillianism still rampant in Spain. Around the middle of the century he and five companions took up the Benedictine habit and founded the monastery of Li√©bana, either the second or third oldest Benedictine establishment in Spain, dedicating it to Martin of Tours. Turibius of Li√©bana has been conflated with Turibius of Astorga (died 460), also a saint, whose bones came to rest in the monastery the former Turibius had founded and where he also was buried. According to the Chronicon attributed to Hauberto, a Benedictine Mozarab of the reign of Alfonso III of Asturias, but actually a forgery by Antonio Lupian Zapata,T. D. Kendrick, Saint James in Spain (University of Glasgow Press, 1960), 143. Turibius became Bishop of Palencia in 533. He was also said to have translated the body of Antoninus of Pamiers to the Cathedral of Palencia, thereafter named in his honour.Gregorio de Argaiz, Poblaci√≥n eclesi√°stica de Espa√±a y noticia de sus primeras honras: hallada en los escritos de S.

The building opened November 4, 1929, and has an Art Deco interior. It contains a 3,563-seat opera house, the Civic Opera House, which is the second- largest opera auditorium in North America. Today, the opera house is the permanent home of the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Samuel Insull envisioned and hired the design team for building a new opera house to serve as the home for the Chicago Civic Opera, as the company was called. The building is shaped like a huge chair, sometimes referred to as \\"Insull's Throne.\\" Insull directed the chair should face west to signify turning his back on New York. Insull had left a vice presidency at General Electric in New York in 1892, after he was not named its president. Subsequently he moved to Chicago and became president of Chicago Edison (Commonwealth Edison). Insull selected the architecture firm Graham, Anderson, Probst & White who were responsible for several other buildings in the downtown Chicago Loop. As they did on other occasions, the architects commissioned Henry Hering to produce architectural sculpture for the building. Mary Garden of the Chicago Civic Opera announced on July 15, 1929 that the opera's inaugural season would include the commissioned work of Hamilton Forrest entitled Camille. During the 1950s and 1960s the building was identified by a large \\"Kemper Insurance\\" sign, although it was not that company's headquarters. In 1993, the Lyric Opera of Chicago purchased the opera house facilities in the building it had rented for 64 years. In 2012, Tishman Speyer Properties L.P. sold the office tower portion of the building for $125.8 million to an affiliate of Nanuet, N.Y.-based Berkley Properties LLC.

There are some similarities to Ghosts 'n Goblins, such as the ability to pick up different weapons. The player also has two Spirits of the Forest (circular faces) which may be summoned to attack enemies in difficult battles. More spirits may be collected along the way.

In desperation, the ancient and wise spirits of the woods shoot a sacred arrow into the air. Whoever finds it will be able to defeat the powers of darkness and destroy the witch.  Reception  Sinclair User described Beyond the Ice Palace as \\"not a classic in any sense, but certainly good enough to occupy you until the NBT (Next Big Thing) comes along.\\" According to Your Sinclair, it was \\"all in all a rather super little game.\\" Crash gave this \\"slick, playable and extremely compelling arcade adventure\\" a review score of 83%.

Originally home to one of the area's oldest families, it was built in the middle of the nineteenth century in a mix of architectural styles. Named a historic site in the 1980s, it has been converted into a health care facility. A native of Delaware, Robert Kirkwood emigrated to present-day Belmont County in 1789 after fighting in the American Revolution; he and his family were among the region's first settlers. Joseph his son erected the present house in 1846 and arranged for its expansion seven years later by the construction of a large ell to the rear.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 63. Set on a foundation of sandstone, the wood-and-brick house is covered with a metal roof., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-02-17. The house combines academic and popular architectural styles: the basic plan is that of an I-house, a vernacular construction mode, although Greek Revival styling is present, especially in the careful symmetry of the five-bay facade. Nine windows fill all bays in both stories, except for the post and lintel- surrounded main entrance in the center of the first story. The fenestration on the side of the original house and on the addition is more irregular: on the second story, a single window sits under the gable, separated by large amounts of brick from a trio of windows at the rear of the ell. Chimneys are placed at both ends of the roofline on the original house, with another such structure in the ell; the roof itself is metal. In early 1986, the Kirkwood House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; its connection to Joseph Kirkwood qualified it for designation, as did its historically significant architecture. It is one of two National Register-listed locations in Bridgeport: although located largely in Wheeling, West Virginia across the Ohio River, the Wheeling Island Historic District includes the Aetnaville Bridge, which extends into Bridgeport.Sands, Patricia A.

A film based on the series was announced in 2020.https://www.instagram.com/p/CC8z2JwpZPb/ Overview The show is set in a whimsical prehistoric world of jungles, swamps, active volcanoes and oceans, all teeming with dinosaur and other animal life, and connected by a train line known as the Dinosaur Train. This steam-engine train can be customized for dinosaurs of all kinds: windows accommodate the long- necked sauropods, there's plenty of headroom in the Observation Car for the larger theropods, and the Aquacar is an aquarium for sea-going passengers. The train itself is run by Troodons, as the smartest dinosaurs in this fictional universe. The Dinosaur Train circles the whole world‚Äîit even crosses the oceans and inland seas, with stops to visit undersea prehistoric animals. It can travel through the entire Mesozoic Era, the \\"Age of Dinosaurs\\", passing through magical Time Tunnels to the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous time periods. The world of Dinosaur Train is seen through the eyes of Buddy the Tyrannosaurus. In the show's main title song, we learn that Buddy was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Pteranodon. He hatched at the same time as his Pteranodon siblings Tiny, Shiny, and Don. By traveling in the Dinosaur Train around the Mesozoic, supplied with all dinosaur facts by the train's Troodon Conductor, Buddy learns that he is a Tyrannosaurus. As an adopted kid in a mixed-species family, Buddy is curious about the differences between species and vows to learn about all the dinosaurs he can by riding the Dinosaur Train. The dinosaur species featured in the show are actual dinosaurs discovered by paleontologists. Dinosaur Train is co-produced and animated by Sparky Animation Studios in Singapore, with casting by Vidaspark and voice-overs recorded at Kozmic Sound in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It premiered on Labor Day 2009 and airs daily on PBS Kids, and in various countries around the world. 40 half-hour episodes were ordered by PBS Kids for the 1st season. After that 49 additional episodes were made. Each episode is followed by a live-action segment featuring Dinosaur Train educational consultant and paleontologist Dr. Scott D. Sampson, who appears onscreen to explain the show's dinosaur curriculum in greater detail.

Bartlett conceived the idea for the show, drew the main characters, and wrote a pilot script. Bartlett said he got the idea of the show after he saw one of his kids put a toy dinosaur in a toy train.

Throughout the era, different ethnic groups, clans and communities made short-term alliances to acquire economic advantage and political power. As early as 1890, under the reign of Menelik II, the homeland of the Yejju was organised into an Ethiopian province named for them. It was bordered by the Alewuha River to the north, separating it from Rayya Qobbo district, the Mille River to the south, separating it from Wollo Province, the Afar Depression to the east, and the highlands of Amba Sel to the west.

Founded in 1847, it produced parts for horse-drawn carriages, such as wheel hubs, spokes, and entire wheels. Brown arranged in 1875 for the construction of the house, which was sold to a local hospital in 1920 and operated it until their bankruptcy in 1923.

History Roosevelt High School opened in the St. Johns neighborhood of Portland in 1922 as a replacement for James John High School. James John High School ‚Äì named after James John, the founder of the St. Johns settlement ‚Äì was constructed in 1911 when St. Johns was still a separate city from Portland. The school became a part of Portland Public Schools after St. Johns was annexed to Portland in 1915. James John High School was temporarily closed in 1920 due to safety concerns, and the Portland school board decided to rebuild the school at a new location. The new school was initially intended to be named after its predecessor,See, for example, this 1921 Oregonian article that refers to the present day Roosevelt High School as \\"the new James John high school\\". but received its current name in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt, who had died in 1919. Roosevelt High School was dedicated in June 1922, with efforts being made to complete its construction in time for the school's opening in September. The building, which was modelled after the design of Franklin High School, had 24 rooms and a capacity of 1,200 students. While James John only had an enrollment of 400 students in its final year, enrollment at Roosevelt was expected to be much higher as it would be taking surplus students from Jefferson and Lincoln high schools. A 1922 St. Johns Review article called for the streets surrounding Roosevelt High School to be paved so that fire trucks and other vehicles would be able to access the school more easily. During the late 1940s, a wave of new students began to enter the Portland school system as a result of the post-war baby boom. In response, voters approved a $25 million building levy in 1947 with the goal of constructing, renovating, and expanding schools across Portland. Roosevelt, in particular, was described as Portland's \\"worst crowded high school\\" in 1950, with needs including the completion of a wing already under construction and the addition of a new gymnasium. In 1992, Roosevelt became one of six Oregon high schools to pilot a school-to-work training program described by The New York Times as \\"one of the most aggressive efforts in the country to address shortcomings in job training.\\" The program required sophomores to choose one of six career tracks and emphasized career-related applications in academic course work. The program was praised by some, who cited Roosevelt's lower dropout rate once the program was implemented, but criticized by others, who argued that it forced students to make career decisions at too young of an age. In 2004, Roosevelt was split into 3 small schools: the Pursuit Of Wellness Education at Roosevelt (POWER), the Spanish-English International School (SEIS), and the Arts, Communication, and Technology School (ACT). Each small school focused on certain academics and career related pathways. POWER focused on math and science, SEIS focused on language immersion, and ACT offered courses in fine, visual, and performing arts. The rationale behind the split was to improve academic achievement by allowing teachers and students to interact in a more intimate and specialized environment. Roosevelt received a $7.7 million federal grant in the summer of 2010 to improve school conditions and to return the school to a comprehensive campus by 2012. This was done to promote diversity in the classrooms and unite the school budget. Exterior of the added wing, 2019 Roosevelt began a modernization process in 2015 as part of a $482 million bond measure aimed at improving schools across Portland. The project included a new wing for the school ‚Äì with a community center, gymnasium, and commons area, among other additions ‚Äì and renovations to the original 1921 structure. The modernization project was praised by the Business Tribune, which cited its \\"intertwining benefits of seismic stabilization, historic preservation and improved learning environments\\". Renovations to the historic 1921 building were completed in 2017. School profile In the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, Roosevelt's student population was 37.4% Hispanic, 28.6% White, 18.3% African American, 4.2% Asian, 2.9% Pacific Islander, 1.3% Native American, and 7.3% mixed race. In 2017, 73% of Roosevelt's seniors graduated on time out of a class size of 274. Roosevelt is one of the smallest high schools in Portland Public Schools.In the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, only Jefferson High School had lower enrollment.

Specifically, dyothelitism correlates the distinctiveness of two wills with the existence of two specific natures (divine and human) in the person of Jesus Christ (dyophysitism). The Catechism of the Catholic Church, no. 475, states: \\"Similarly, at the Sixth ecumenical council, Constantinople III in 681, the Church confessed that Christ possesses two wills and two natural operations, divine and human. They are not opposed to each other, but co-operate in such a way that the Word made flesh willed humanly in obedience to his Father all that he had decided divinely with the Father and the Holy Spirit for our salvation. Christ's human will 'does not resist or oppose but rather submits to his divine and almighty will.'\\" This position is in opposition to the Monothelitism position in the Christological debates. The debate concerning the Monothelite churches and the Catholic Church came to a conclusion at the Third Council of Constantinople in 681. The Council declared that in line with the declarations of the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which declared two natures in the one person of Jesus Christ, there are equally two \\"wills\\" or \\"modes of operation\\" in the one person of Jesus Christ as well. Dyothelitism was championed by Maximus the Confessor against monothelitism, the doctrine of one will.

It is one of a family of tools from Morfik Technologies, a company based in Australia. Morfik FX is an update to a product previously called Morfik WebOS AppsBuilder and uses the Object Pascal programming language for writing all the application's code, for both the Web browser and Server portions. Morfik FX provides a Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment for the creation of Web applications. This environment included a Visual Designer with WYSIWYG capabilities that supports a range of visual effects. Product History The first Professional License for Morfik WebOS AppsBuilder (the precursor to Morfik FX), was by acquired by Greenpeace International in October, 2006, and two months later, Altium deployed the first commercial application built with WebOS AppsBuilder. It was a mashup with Salesforce.com applications which permitted a hierarchical view of all projects managed through Salesforce.com. In March 2007, v1.0 was officially released and its name was changed to \\"Morfik 07\\"). See also here In November 2008, v2.0 of the AppsBuilder product was officially released with an entirely redesigned interface. This release broke down the programming language support into separate versions called FX (Object Pascal) and BX (Basic). It was at this point that the Morfik FX product moniker was introduced. In August 2009, Morfik released AppsBuilder 2.1 which, though numbered as a simple point update, contained a significant number of new features such as the ability to visually create Widgets (user created controls). With this release support for the C# programming language which was dropped with the release of 2.0, was reintroduced with a Morfik CX moniker. In October 2010 Morfik released AppsBuilder 3.0 with improved support for Widgets and Packages. Version 3.0 of Morfik FX adds a new set of visual design objects which represent individual pages within an application. These objects make it much easier for developers to create the navigational structure of their applications in a manner that is search engine friendly. In November 2010 Morfik Technologies, the maker of Morfik FX, was acquired by Altium Limited. Distinguishing Product Features Morfik FX is a Web development tool that runs on the Windows operating system. The following are the most distinguishing features of Morfik FX: * All coding for both the browser and server portions of the application is written in Object Pascal. * Applications created with Morfik FX are 100% based on Ajax. * All interface design is done visually, within the Morfik development environment. * The server side portion of applications created with Morfik FX is compiled into native code for Windows or Linux. * The browser side portion of applications created with Morfik FX is compiled into JavaScript, HTML, CSS and image files. * The Morfik development environment can be extended, incorporating new controls and capabilities through the addition of packages which are created with Morfik FX itself. Visual Development Morfik uses a WYSIWYG interface designer to allow the developer to visually create the interface for web-based applications. The visual designers built into the Morfik development environment closely parallel visual design tools for desktop application development, providing the same sort of capabilities for the creation Web applications. While visually designing the interface of a Web application with Morfik FX the developer will create Forms which define the positioning of controls and their appearance and then combine these Forms in a higher level visual object called a Page. Web Services Morfik provides two different ways for developers to create Web Service entry points in Web applications. In Morfik terminology these entry point are called Web Methods. There is a visual editor for defining the input and output parameters of Web Methods which also creates the boilerplate code for handling both the server and browser side to guide the developer. An experienced developer can, however, totally bypass the visual designer and just hand code the entry points which are implemented as specialized classes with special metadata attributes applied to them.

His hometown is Medford, Wisconsin. While still a Senior Airman, he received the Air Force Cross for his actions in the Battle of Shok Valley on 6 April 2008 in Nuristan Province, Afghanistan. He was the first living, and second ever, Combat Controller to receive the Air Force Cross after TSgt John A. Chapman was posthumously awarded the medal in 2002 for his actions during the Battle of Takur Ghar. In addition to his Air Force Cross Rhyner is the recipient of two Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star Medal and the Air Force Combat Action Medal among others. His first Purple Heart he received for the Battle of Shok Valley, while the second Purple Heart was from a deployment to northern Afghanistan in March 2013 where a gunshot wound shattered his right femur and hip. He has deployed six times, including Iraq and Afghanistan. He has also participated in humanitarian assistance operations as well and was a part of Operation Unified Response in Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Rhyner medically retired in 2015 as a result of wounds sustained in combat that prevented mobility below the knee.http://www.afsoc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/614462/air- force-cross-recipient-retires-due-to-combat-wounds/ Early military career Rhyner enlisted in the U.S. Air Force on 31 May 2004. He completed Basic Military Training as an Honor Graduate at Lackland AFB, Texas, in August 2004. A1C Rhyner then went through the Combat Control training \\"pipeline\\" which lasted from August 2004 until 2007. The Combat Control training pipeline consisted of the Combat Control Orientation Course at Lackland AFB, the Combat Control Operator course at Keesler AFB, Mississippi, then U.S. Army Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. Afterwards he travelled to Fairchild AFB, Washington, for the U.S. Air Force Basic Survival School. Next he went to the Combat Control School at Pope AFB, North Carolina, where he would be later stationed. He next attended Special Tactics Advanced Skills Training at Hurlburt Field, Florida, for upwards of a year. While in AST Rhyner also attended the Army Military Freefall Parachutist School at Yuma Proving Grounds, Arizona, and lastly the U.S. Air Force Combat Diver school in Panama City, Florida. After completing the Combat Control training pipeline he was assigned to the 21st Special Tactics Squadron at Pope AFB (later Pope Field). Battle of Shok Valley Zachary Rhyner and Army Special Forces soldiers of ODA 3336 in the Shok Valley prior to the battle On 6 April 2008, a 130-man combined assault force, dubbed Commando Wrath, performed a day-time rotary- wing insertion down into a remote valley of the Nuristan Province, Afghanistan. Commando Wrath was composed of three Special Forces teams with each team having a Combat Controller attached, and a company from the 201st Afghan Commando Battalion. Rhyner, just six months out of training and on his first deployment, was attached to the C2-element (command and control) of Army Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha 3336, from the 3rd Special Forces Group. Their mission was to capture Haji Ghafour, a high-ranking commander of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin (HIG) militant group. Shortly after landing the assault force was ambushed and pinned down and the assault force was split in two on either side of a river. Rhyner and several Special Forces members were wounded throughout the course of the battle. Rhyner was shot twice in the chest and once in the leg, although his protective vest stopped the two bullets to his chest from causing a mortal injury. Despite being wounded within the first fifteen minutes of the battle, Rhyner continued to direct close air support and airstrikes until the assault force was evacuated seven hours later. 50 of the airstrikes he called in were within 200m of friendly positions; the term \\"danger close\\" is applied when referring to airstrikes within 600m. He was credited with saving the entire 100-man team from being overrun twice. According to the Air Force Cross citation, during the battle Rhyner directed close air support and airstrikes totalling 4,570 cannon rounds, nine Hellfire missiles, 162 rockets, a dozen 500-pound bombs, and one 2,000-pound bomb. As a result of the same battle, ten U.S. Army soldiers, nine Special Forces and one Combat Cameraman received the Silver Star, the greatest number of Silver Stars awarded for a single battle since the Vietnam War. Capt. Stewart Parker, the Command and Control Special Forces commander at Bagram Air Base during the battle, said of Rhyner: \\"Rhyner is out of training less than a year and is in one of the most difficult situations ... it is an absolute testament to his character and the training these guys take. It tells me we are doing something right.\\" During a Fox News interview with Glen Beck, Beck asked Rhyner, \\"there are only‚Äîwhat is it?‚Äî192 people who have ever received the Air Force Cross. ... How do you put that together in your head? I mean, you are in a very elite group.\\" Rhyner simply replied with \\"Any other combat controller put in the same situation would have performed in the same, exact way. ... Credit that to the training we receive and the process that we go through to become a combat controller.\\" Future Air Force Cross recipient, and fellow Combat Controller, Robert Gutierrez was also present at the Battle of Shok Valley with Rhyner, albeit with a different Special Forces team, and regarding Rhyner's actions he said reportedly, \\"If it wasn't for Zach, I wouldn't be here.\\" Awards and honors Air Force Cross SSgt Zachary Rhyner receiving his Air Force Cross citation The Air Force Cross was presented to him by Secretary of the Air Force Michael B. Donley. Prior to presenting the award Donley stated to Rhyner \\"Your actions are now and forever woven into the rich fabric of service, integrity and excellence that has connected generations of America's Airmen since the very inception of airpower, Rarely do we present an Airman with the Air Force Cross, let alone a Purple Heart, and with good reason. The Air Force Cross is reserved for those who demonstrate unparalleled valor in the face of insurmountable odds.\\" Afterwards, Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force General Norton Schwartz presented Rhyner with his Purple Heart. The last time an Air Force Cross was bestowed upon a living recipient was when Timothy Wilkinson was awarded it for his heroic actions during the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu. His award citation reads: Other honors In 2008 he was presented the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs' Grateful Nation Award by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, for his actions during the Battle of Shok Valley. In 2009 Rhyner won a United Service Organizations of Metropolitan Washington Special Salute award as the 2008 USO Airman of the Year for his heroic efforts in Afghanistan the year prior. The award was presented to him by Air Force General Norton Schwartz.

Army Minister 1924-1925\\\\. Wu Guangxin was born in 1881 in Hefei, Anhui, China. He graduated from the Japanese Army Military Academy in 1904 and the War College in 1910. A career officer in the Beiyang Army, he had close professional ties to his brother-in- law Duan Qirui. After the Republic of China was established, he held command of the 20th Division. In 1916 he was given the task of re-establishing northern military control over Yuezhou in northern Hunan. In August 1917 Duan obtained Feng Guozhang's appointment of Wu as Commander-in-Chief of the Upper Yangtze River and concurrently Inspector of Sichuan, with orders to advance into Sichuan to resolve its internal conflicts. In January 1918, during the 1st Constitutional Protection War, Wu--who had retreated from Sichuan to the Sichuan-Hubei border--attacked Shi Xingchuan and Li Tiancai's army from the west along the Yangtze. Caught between Wu and Wang Zhanyuan in the Wuhan area, Shi and Li were defeated. Hubei independent forces ceased to be a serious threat to Beiyang power in Hubei. In 1920 Wu became Military and Civil governor of Hunan. During the Zhili‚ÄìAnhui War he was captured and detained as one of the Anhui clique's leaders by Wang Zhanyuan, but in 1921 he was released. Due to the victory of Zhang Zuolin and Feng Yuxiang in the Second Zhili‚ÄìFengtian War, Zhang Zuolin named Duan Qirui as the new Chief Executive of the nation on November 24, 1924. Wu was appointed as Army Minister and in December 1924 inspector general. In February 1925 he was appointed Reconstruction Conference Association president. Due to the March 18 Massacre, Feng Yuxiang again revolted against the Fengtian clique and deposed Duan, who was forced to flee to Zhang's protection, and Wu--now deposed--went into seclusion in Shanghai.

He was quickly named \\"Flammen\\" (meaning \\"The Flame\\"), for his red hair. In 1951, he and his Resistance partner J√∏rgen Haagen Schmith (Citron, or Citronen in Danish), were posthumously awarded the United States Medal of Freedom by President Harry Truman. According to several colleagues from the Holger Danske, no other resistance member was as hated or sought by the Germans as was Faurschou Hviid. Gunnar Dyrberg, leader of the Holger Danske from 1943 through 1945, said in the 2003 Danish documentary film, With a Right to Kill (Med ret til at dr√¶be), that no one knows exactly how many executions The Flame performed, but he was rumoured to have killed 22 persons. The film explored the issues of the estimated 400 executions performed by the Resistance agents. Early life Bent Faurschou Hviid was born in 1921 in Asserbo, Denmark, on the island of Zealand to Marie Louise Larsen and Wilhelm Faurschou Hviid. His father was the owner of Asserbo's Birkeg√•rden Hotel. He also had a sister, Marie-Louise Swanstr√∏m and a brother Jan Faurschou Hviid. World War II Faurschou Hviid came of age during the war, and was 20 when the Germans occupied Denmark. He entered the Holger Danske resistance group in Copenhagen. He was assigned to kill Danish Nazi officials and collaborators. \\"Flammen\\" regularly partnered with \\"Citronen\\" whose real name was J√∏rgen Haagen Schmith. \\"Citronen\\" means \\"the lemon\\". Schmith got this nickname because he sabotaged a Citro√´n garage, destroying six German cars and a tank. He generally drove for Flammen, who executed their given targets. Together, Flammen and Citronen formed the most famous resistance duo in Denmark during World War II. The Germans put the highest bounty on Flammen's head that they offered for any Resistance fighter. According to Gunnar Dyrberg, leader of the Holger Danske from 1943‚Äì1945, who spoke in the Danish documentary film With a Right to Kill (Med ret til at dr√¶be, 2003), Flammen was believed to have executed 22 persons. The film was based on the book Efter drabet (Following the Death, 2001) by journalist Peter √òvig Knudsen, who also co-wrote the screenplay. Death The memorial of Faurschou Hviid. The inscription translated reads \\"IN MEMORY OF THE FREEDOM FIGHTER 'FLAMMEN' BENDT FAURSCHOU-HVIID BORN 7-1 1921 DIED 18-10 1944 THE BEST MUST DIE\\". On 18 October 1944, Faurschou Hviid was having dinner with his landlady and some guests when someone knocked at the door and a German officer demanded entry. Faurschou Hviid, who was unarmed that evening, quickly went upstairs seeking to escape across the roof. He soon realised that the house was completely surrounded. With no escape possible, he chewed a cyanide capsule and was dead a few seconds later. The witnesses later told of how they could hear the German soldiers upstairs cheering at the sight of the corpse. The soldiers dragged Faurschou Hviid downstairs feet first, repeatedly causing his head to bang against the stairs. Legacy *In 1951, Faurschou Hviid and his colleague J√∏rgen Haagen Schmith were presented, posthumously, with the US Medal of Freedom by President Harry Truman. *The Danish documentary film, With a Right to Kill (Med ret til at dr√¶be, 2003), explored some of the ambiguity related to decisions about liquidating targets, and suggested that Flammen may have been directed by a double agent in some of his executions.Clement Maier, Making Memories: The Politics of in Postwar Norway and Denmark, pp. 269-272, 2007 thesis at European University Institute, accessed 2 June 2014 (This moral complexity was reflected in the 2008 drama discussed below.) *In 2008, Faurschou Hviid and Schmith were memorialized by one of the most expensive Danish films premiered to date ().

Publication *A Princess of Landover was published in hardcover in the United States on August 18, 2009 *It was published in hardcover in the United Kingdom on September 3, 2009. Synopsis The book began a prologue on the witch Nightshade still trapped in the form of a crow in a cage in Woodland Park Zoo, having been exiled from Landover for more than five years. Apart from having mysteriously appeared in the cage, her red eyes marked her different from other birds and elicited brief interest from animal experts. They gave up trying to study her after failing repeatedly to capture her, despite her being in a cage. The story proper began in the principal's office of the exclusive private school Carringon Women's Preparatory in New England where Mistaya \\"Misty\\" Holiday had been sent by Ben to \\"learn about places other than\\" Landover. The school was informed that her parents were away most of the time and all correspondence to be made via Miles Bennett, Ben's former law partner. The headmistress Harriet Appleton was with Misty, recounting the girl's previous visits to the same office. The first was when Misty organized a school protest and shut down classes for three days when the school tried to remove a two-hundred-year-old tree from the school grounds. The second was when Misty formed an unapproved club for students to \\"engage in a bonding-with-nature program\\", the sticking point for the school authorities being ritualistic scarring for the members, which Misty thought would \\"convey the depth of commitment\\" and \\"reminder of the pain and suffering human ignorance fostered\\". Besides, Misty thought it should not be a problem as the \\"scarring was done in places that weren't normally exposed to the light of day\\". The third and current visit came about because Misty had done something to terrify fellow student Rhonda Masterson to the point of hysterics and had to be sedated by a nurse. Rhonda and other blue-blooded East Coast snots had been bullying Misty until the latter was pushed too far by being called a name Misty refused to repeat. In retaliation, Misty conjured up an image of Strabo, the last dragon of Landover. Though the headmistress could not be sure what Misty had done, she suspended Misty from school and indicated she would consider accepting Misty back if Misty agrees to be the type of student expected in Carringon. Misty was only too glad to leave and decided to do so immediately instead of waiting for the Christmas break. Taking a flight to Dulles, the Waynesboro, she returned to Landover through a portal located in George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, passable only by certain magic. As Misty arrived in Landover, thinking about resuming her study of magic with Questor, she was met unexpectedly by Strabo, who somehow knew and made it clear he did not appreciate his image being used by Misty. Her next encounter was much more pleasant, with the mud puppy Haltwhistle coming to greet her. The third encounter before she reached home was a tied-up G'home Gnome Poggwydd, whom she rescued. Once at home in Sterling Silver, Ben was informed to his dismay the reason of Misty's return. After a heated argument with Misty, Ben discussed with his advisors. Questor Thews and Abernathy Questor suggested for Misty to be sent to organize the Libiris, a royal library which was started by the last wise and dedicated king of Landover, to foster greater interest in reading for all subjects of Landover. The project stalled and the library fell into neglect. Questor proposed fixing the library and reopening it would be a worthwhile project for Misty. It was revealed that Questor and Abernathy also withheld something from Ben about the libiris. Before Ben could approach Mistaya about the project, he was presented with a proposal of marriage to his daughter from Laphroig, lord of Rhyndweir, the largest of the Greensward baronies. Personally repulsed, Ben diplomatically avoided giving a direct answer. However, Laphroig chose to interpret it as tacit approval to woo the girl, and sprung himself upon Misty who had not been informed. Aghast, Misty rebelled and refused to accept Ben's explanation, nor his idea of her going to the Libiris. She chose to run away from home to her grandfather and enlisted the aid of Poggwydd to hide some of the packings she would need. Unfortunately, it also resulted in her becoming stuck with the Gnome as a travelling companion. In addition, she was joined by the mysterious cat Edgewood Dirk who seemed to be able to come and go as it pleases, and refused to talk or appear other than an ordinary cat except when alone with her. When Misty arrived at her grandfather's domain of the lake country, he allowed her to stay but refused to take her side against her father. Realising her grandfather was going to send her back, Misty took a chance when Edgewood Dirk offered her to escape. At Dirk's subtle proddings, Misty realised the only place she can go to escape from being found by her father or grandfather was the Libiris, the very place she was supposed to go in the first place. Convincing herself that she was going on her own accord, Misty presented herself as a peasant girl to the Libiris. Misty was almost turned away by the Libiris staff Rufus Pinch, had not his assistant Thom who intervened and pretended Misty was his sister Ellice. Together, they seemed to persuade Craswell Crabbit, the person in charge of Libiris, to allow Misty to stay and help with the work in organising the books. While Ben and the River King had been trying unsuccessfully to locate Misty, Laphroig deployed his spies to watch the royal castle, convinced he could take advantage of the situation. Questor and Abernathy discussed between themselves what would be the \\"last place\\" anyone would think of looking for Misty and came to a startling conclusion that the Libiris might be the place. Questor made a secret visit to the Libiris and contacted Misty. By then, Misty realised something strange was going on in the Libiris and was convinced Crabbit was up to something bad. She was determined to stay on to investigate while Questor was to return to Sterling Silver, ready to act as backup if necessary. Misty discovered some similarities between the Libiris and the sentient castle Sterling Silver. With Thom's help, she learned that books of magic were being passed to demons of Abaddon. And with some help from Edgewood Dirk, she was able to implement a temporary fix. Unfortunately, Misty's efforts were discovered by Craswell who had her and Thom captured. Apparently, Craswell had known all along her identity as Princess of Landover. Meanwhile, through his spies watching Sterling Silver, Laphroig learned the location of Mistaya and set forth there with a large group of armed men to demand Misty from Crabbit. Deciding to play off Laphroig and Ben against each other, Crabbit offered to help by inducing Misty to agree to marry Laphroig, using the threat of Thom's life in the process. Misty came up with a plan quickly and agreed to the ceremony, demanding it to be held outdoors, and promising not to escape. Once in place, she cast a spell to bring forth the image of Strabo again. Though the illusion was done correctly, the uproar it caused was short lived and she and Thom remained prisoners. However, that was only part of her plan - her goal was to incite the appearance of the real Strabo who promised to visit her if she ever invoke his image again. The arrival of the real Strabo was much more effective at disrupting the wedding, but Strabo soon got distracting chasing after the armoured men-at-arms which he considered delicacies. Misty was still faced with the armed Laphroig, Pinch who had a crossbow and Crabbit the magician. A stunning explosion occurred when Laphroig's thrown dagger, Pinch's crossbow bolt, and magic from Crabbit and Misty came together. When the explosion cleared and Misty recovered from being stunned, Laphroig had been turned to stone and there was no sign of Crabbit nor Pinch. Misty had no time to congratulate herself for the demons of Abaddon were breaking through within the Libiris. With Thom's help, Misty managed to seal the breach from Abaddon. The Libiris began to heal itself, being a creation from the materials taken from Sterling Silver. It was all over by the time Ben and the others from Sterling Silver arrived. Thom turned out to be the missing brother of Laphroig. Succeeding to the barony, he chose to give the land to the subjects of Rhyndweir in return for reasonable tax to the crown. Back in the Woodland Park Zoo, the strange crow with red eyes disappeared as mysteriously as it had appeared before. And as mysteriously, two men in strange attire appeared in the same cage, ranting in an unknown language. After being taken away by security, the two ended up in custody of Homeland Security, which also could not understand them nor figure out where they came from.

In a press release dated June 1, 2009, the company that owns the brand (Top 10 Produce LLC) announced it was the first \\"100% traceable produce brand\\" The brand was created to encourage smaller growers in areas such as Salinas Valley, California, to work together to market item- level traceable produce directly to consumers. Most of the smaller farms selling under the brand sell a significant portion of their produce locally, as \\"locally grown\\" produce. The ability of the consumer to verify the actual location of the grower is a brand feature highlighted by the claim of 100% item level traceability. The trademark name ‚ÄúTop 10\\" references the fact that most growers have a highest quality grade, which they call their ‚ÄúTop‚Äù label. The \\"10\\" comes from the fact that the brand encourages all growers to contribute at least 10% of their crop to sell to their local market under the Top 10 brand, while using other brands for produce sold out of their local area. The brand went national in June 2009 and declared itself as \\"the small farm brand\\" dedicated to serving as an advocate for smaller local growers \\"from coast to coast\\". Top 10 was designated as a ‚Äúbrand of brands‚Äù and as such it will only license independent growers who own or lease the land on which the produce is grown and each grower selling under the brand is encouraged to retain and promote what makes them unique. By labeling each item contributed with a Databar and by using ‚Äúextended packaging‚Äù the brand was designed so that consumers could use computers or mobile devices (such as iPhones) to learn about the grower, the sustainability of the growing practices, and where the produce was grown. Top 10 is 100 percent traceable to the item level and exceeds the Case level traceability recommended by the Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI). The brand makes items sold under the label traceable by assigning each produce item with a unique 14-digit number issued by GS1. When that produce item goes in a case, that case is also assigned a 14-digit number. The brand shares those 14-digit numbers with all of the grower's trading partners. Both the items and the cases have barcodes with the 14-digit numbers and other more specific information encoded into them. These barcodes can be scanned and tracked using the same system that is endorsed by the Produce Traceability Initiative, using software available from numerous specialized software vendors. Some competing supermarkets, including Wal-Mart in the United States and Tesco in the UK, already use the Databar technology in their business models.

(2000). Throughout his life Takashima Sh≈´han was one of the early Japanese reformists who argued for the modernization of Japan in order to better resist the West. His experience was close to that of Sakuma Sh≈çzan, who was also attacked for adopting Western ideas. Study of Western firearms Demonstration of Western firearms by Takashima Sh≈´han in 1841. As a child of 10, Takashima Sh≈´han, the son of Nagasaki officials, was shocked by the violent demands made by the British frigate Phaeton in 1808. Takashima started to study Western guns and, after the 1825 Edict to expel foreigners at all cost (\\"Don't think twice\\" policy, Áï∞ÂõΩËàπÁÑ°‰∫åÂøµÊâìÊâï‰ª§), managed to obtain some weapons through the Dutch at Dejima, such as field guns, mortars and firearms. The guns were known in Japan as Geweer (gun in Dutch) from the 1840s. Various domains sent students to learn from Takashima in Nagasaki. They came from Satsuma Domain, after the intrusion of an American warship in 1837 in Kagoshima Bay, and from Saga Domain and Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, both southern domains exposed to Western intrusions.Kornicki, Peter. (1998). These domains also studied the manufacture of Western weapons, and by 1852 Satsuma and Saga had reverbatory furnaces to produce the iron necessary for firearms. Contacts with the Shogunate In 1840, Takashima was made a toshiyori, or Senior Administrator, for the city of Nagasaki.Cullen, Louis M. (2003). From 1840, following the outbreak of the Opium War in China, Takashima appealed to the Shogunate to reinforce Japan's military capabilities.Enb utsu, Sumiko. \\"Bloomin' good fortune in winter,\\" The Japan Times, February 7, 2002; retrieved 2011-07-05 The war in China had made clear that traditional ways were not sufficient to keep the Westerners at bay, and that radical modernization was needed to be able to resist.Burt, Peter. (2001). Takashima Sh≈´han established two companies of infantry equipped with guns, as well as one artillery battery, making him Japan's first modern student of Western arms. In 1841, Takashima Sh≈´han caught the attention of Bakufu official Egawa Tar≈çzaemon. Takashima made a demonstration with 125 men, using Dutch Rangaku textbooks and Dutch commands for drilling. He demonstrated the use of four cannons and 50 Western guns. In 1843, Takashima was vindicated, as the Bakufu authorized the usage of Western guns for defenses.

Takashima Sh≈´han established a school, but was heavily criticized by many, and ended up under house arrest from 1846 to 1853 under charges of subversion and treason.Jansen, He returned to favour with the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1853, after which he became a military instructor for Bakufu forces in 1856. In 1862, Takashima Sh≈´han recommended that Japan equip itself with 200 warships in order to repel the foreign naval threat. This led the Shogunate to authorize each domain to manufacture or purchase their own ships in order to reinforce Japan's naval capabilities.The collapse of the Tokugawa bakufu, 1862-1868 Conrad D.

During a 50-year career, he appeared in many Western films, often as a member of the Sons of the Pioneers in Roy Rogers serials. Fisher also had supporting roles on many TV shows, most frequently on Gunsmoke and The Beverly Hillbillies. His comic trademarks included his ability to stutter at will and his bemused facial expressions. Biography Childhood and early years Fisher was born in Grady County, Oklahoma, in Tabler (near Chickasha) into a farming family, the son of a Scots-Irish father and part-Choctaw mother and the youngest of four children. He gained the nickname \\"Shug\\" (short for sugar) at a young age, which he explained as, \\"My mama gave it to me 'cause I was such a sweet baby.\\" In 1917, the family moved by covered wagon to Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, near Indianola. Soon thereafter, Fisher was drawn to the mandolin and the fiddle. His father refreshed his own fiddling ability and Fisher learned guitar to back him, and at age 16, he was playing with his father at local square dances. He could not afford a fiddle case and instead protected his instrument with a pillow case tied to the saddle horn. After watching a comedian with a traveling medicine show in 1924, he decided to pursue a career in entertainment. The following year, Fisher, his father, and a friend drove a Ford Model T to California's San Joaquin Valley, where he worked as a fruit-picker and a cable and tool dresser in oil fields. He continued to perform, playing fiddle at social events and square dances. In 1927, he was asked to appear on The Fresno Bee's radio station, KMJ, but only for the publicity. He later said, \\"publicity was fine, but you can‚Äôt eat it...My motto was, pay me something, or I don‚Äôt play.\\" Los Angeles calls In 1931, Tom Murray, who had recently left the Beverly Hill Billies, offered Fisher a spot with his new group, the Hollywood Hillbillies, based in Los Angeles. Fisher learned to play the bass fiddle with the group and claimed he was one of the first to play the instrument in a country band. The Hillbillies appeared on the Hollywood Breakfast Club radio show and were fairly popular around Los Angeles but had little income to show for it. In late 1933, Fisher and Ken Carson left the group to join several members of the Beverly Hill Billies who had moved to San Francisco. The original group was the brainchild of the general manager of KPMC-AM, who promoted the members as authentic \\"hillbilly\\" musicians who he'd \\"discovered.\\"Harkins, Anthony Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon Oxford University Press, 2004. As part of the ruse, the members always adopted hillbilly names, so Fisher became Aaron Judd and Carson was Kaleb Winbush. After a short time, Fisher returned to Los Angeles, appearing on Stuart Hamblen's Covered Wagon Jubilee program. Ohio Valley radio career In 1935, Fisher took an extended road tour with Roy Faulkner, The Lonesome Cowboy, from XERA-AM in Del Rio, Texas. During an appearance in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Fisher was approached by Hugh Cross to join him, under sponsorship of the Georgie Porgie Breakfast Food Company, as an act for WWVA Jamboree. Fisher agreed and the two went to Wheeling, West Virginia. Under the moniker of Hugh and Shug‚Äôs Radio Pals, a reflection of their frequent radio appearances, they performed with Mary Ann Vestes and recorded for Decca for four years, enjoying a faithful radio audience. In 1939, the two moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where they appeared on WLW-AM's Boone County Jamboree and where Fisher met and married Peggy Summers of Bolivar, Missouri. At the station, he also became friends with a young Merle Travis. Sons of the Pioneers When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, Fisher returned to Los Angeles to work in defense jobs, primarily at Lockheed Aircraft in Burbank. Art Rush, head of the Hollywood Victory Committee, requested his help arranging entertainment for defense workers during the war. In 1943, Fisher and Ken Carson were invited to join the Sons of the Pioneers after the group‚Äôs Pat Brady and Lloyd Perryman were drafted into the service. Replacing Brady as bassist and comedian, Fisher eagerly joined Carson, Tim Spencer, Bob Nolan, and Hugh and Karl Farr late that year, having appreciated the band's music and personally known its members prior to the group's inception. During this tenure, the group appeared in a string of Roy Rogers movies, recorded songs for the John Ford movies Wagon Master in 1949 and Rio Grande in 1950, and performed the theme song for The Searchers in 1956. Fisher wrote a number of songs for the Pioneers, including \\"Out On The Open Range\\", \\"Ridin' Down To Santa Fe\\", later recorded by Merle Travis, and \\"Forgive And Forget\\". In 1946, Fisher and Travis co-wrote \\"Cincinnati Lou\\". Fisher also wrote \\"That's My Paradise\\", \\"I'm Not Foolin' Now\\", \\"A Million Memories\\", \\"Pooey On You, Little Darlin'\\", a novelty song later recorded by Ken Curtis; \\"Lonesome Train Blues\\"; and recorded \\"Gooseberry Pie\\" using his fake stuttering as a comedy device. Fisher left the group in early 1946 when Brady returned from the war. In 1948, Capitol Transcriptions issued the album, Cowboy Jubilee, by Shug Fisher & his Ranchmen Trio. Fisher rejoined the Pioneers in 1949 when Brady left. The highlight of this era came in 1951 when they appeared at Carnegie Hall, making them the first western band to perform there. They would also be the first to play at lavish nightclubs in Las VegasForsythe, Wayne. \\"The Sons of the Pioneers.\\" Country Music (April 1975). Retrieved on 8-02-09. and starred on Mutual Radio's Lucky U Ranch program. In 1953, Fisher left to join friend Ken Curtis in television and motion pictures but again returned to the Pioneers in 1955, replacing Deuce Spriggens. He left the Pioneers for the last time in 1959, and welcomed the break to \\"kinda take it easy, and do a lot of hunting and fishing.\\" Film and television career A member of the John Ford Stock Company, Fisher had an extensive career as a character actor in Western B-movies and feature films starting in 1943. Many of his early roles were as a performer with the Sons of the Pioneers in Roy Rogers' singing cowboy movies. He was also the voice of Uncle Pecos, an animated mouse, in the 1955 Tom and Jerry short, Pecos Pest, and is uncredited with the guitar improvisation on the cartoon‚Äôs version of \\"Froggie Went A-Courtin\\". Fisher also had many supporting roles during a 27-year television career. From 1955-60, he made regular appearances on ABC-TV‚Äôs country music variety show, Ozark Jubilee, as a comedian and singer. Then he joined Curtis‚Äô first-run syndicated TV adventure series, Ripcord between 1962 and 1963 portraying airplane pilot Charlie Kern. He made 22 appearances on Gunsmoke from 1962-74 in various minor roles, and played Shorty Kellums in 19 episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies from 1969-70\\\\. Fisher also appeared repeatedly on Bonanza, The Virginian, Daniel Boone and The Dukes of Hazzard. Death Shug Fisher spent his final years living in Studio City, California. He died on March 16, 1984 after a lingering illness, with old friend Ken Curtis by his side in Woodland Hills in Los Angeles. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

Image shows Arc protein levels at one hour following inhibitory avoidance training and immediate, systemic injection of 3 mg/kg corticosterone. Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein is a plasticity protein that in humans is encoded by the ARC gene. It was first characterized in 1995. ARC is a member of the immediate-early gene (IEG) family, a rapidly activated class of genes functionally defined by their ability to be transcribed in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. ARC mRNA is localized to activated synaptic sites in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner, where the newly translated protein is believed to play a critical role in learning and memory- related molecular processes. Arc protein is widely considered to be important in neurobiology because of its activity regulation, localization, and utility as a marker for plastic changes in the brain. Dysfunction in the production of Arc protein has been implicated as an important factor in understanding various neurological conditions, including amnesia, Alzheimer's disease, Autism spectrum disorders, and Fragile X syndrome. Along with other IEGs such as ZNF268 and HOMER1, ARC is also a significant tool for systems neuroscience as illustrated by the development of the cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence in situ hybridization, or catFISH technique (see fluorescent in situ hybridization).  Gene  The ARC gene, located on chromosome 15 in the mouse, chromosome 7 in the rat, and chromosome 8 in the human, genome is conserved across vertebrate species and has low sequence homology to spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein involved in forming the actin cellular cortex. A number of promoter and enhancer regions have been identified that mediate activity-dependent Arc transcription: a serum response element (SRE; see serum response factor) at ~1.5 kb upstream of the initiation site. a second SRE at ~6.5 kb; and a synaptic activity response element (SARE) sequence at ~7 kb upstream that contains binding sites for cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), and SRF. The 3' UTR of the mRNA contains a cis-acting element required for the localization of Arc to neuronal dendrites, as well as sites for two exon junction complexes (EJCs) that make Arc a natural target for nonsense mediated decay (NMD). Also important for translocation of cytoplasmic Arc mRNA to activated synapses is an 11 nucleotide binding site for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2). It is suspected that Arc gene originated from Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons and was repurposed for mediating neuron-neuron communication.  Protein  Once transported, the translated protein is 396 residues in length, with an N-terminus located at amino acids 1-25, a C-terminus at 155-396 (note that the spectrin homology located at 228-380 within the C-terminal), and a putative coiled coil domain at amino acids 26-154. Additionally, the protein has binding sites for endophilin 3 and dynamin 2 at amino acids 89-100 and 195-214, respectively. While Arc mRNA is subject to degradation by NMD, the translated protein contains a PEST sequence at amino acids 351-392, indicating proteasome-dependent degradation. The translated protein can be visualized with an immunoblot as a band at 55 kDa. The ARC protein can form virus-like capsids that package mRNA and can traffic between cells. Trafficking Following transcription, Arc mRNA is transported out of the nucleus and localized to neuronal dendrites and activated synapses, a process dependent on the 3' UTR, polymerization of actin, and ERK phosphorylation. The mRNA (and aggregate protein) is carried along microtubules radiating out from the nucleus by kinesin (specifically KIF5) and likely translocated into dendritic spines by the actin-based motor protein myosin-Va. Arc has been shown to be associated with polyribosomes at synaptic sites, and is translated in isolated synaptoneurosomal fractions in vitro indicating that the protein is likely locally translated in vivo. Synaptically localized Arc protein interacts with dynamin and endophilin, proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and facilitates the removal of AMPA receptors from the plasma membrane. Consistent with this, increased Arc levels reduce AMPA currents, while Arc KOs display increases in surface AMPA expression.  Knockouts  Arc is critical as a ubiquitous signaling factor in early embryonic development and is required for growth and patterning during gastrulation. The first knockouts (KOs) for Arc were therefore incompatible with life. Subsequent efforts produced homozygous knockout mice by targeting the entire Arc gene rather than portions of the coding region, eliminating dominant negative effects. These animals proved viable and exhibit no gross malformations in neuronal architecture, but express higher levels of the GluR1 subunit and increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in addition to displaying deficiencies in long-term memory.  Signaling  The Arc transcript is dependent upon activation of the mitogen- activated protein kinase or MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade, a pathway important for regulation of cell growth and survival. Extracellular signaling to neuronal dendrites activates postsynaptic sites to increase Arc levels through a wide variety of signaling molecules, including mitogens such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glutamate acting at NMDA receptors, dopamine through activation of the D1 receptor subtype, and dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). The common factor for these signaling molecules involves activation of cyclic-AMP and its downstream target protein kinase A (PKA). As such, direct pharmacological activation of cAMP by forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP robustly increases Arc levels while H89, a PKA antagonist, blocks these effects as does further downstream blockade of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase [sic] (MEK). Note that the MAPK cascade is a signaling pathway involving multiple kinases acting sequentially [MAPKKK--> MAPKK--> MAPK]. MAPK is able to enter the nucleus and perform its phosphotransferase activity on a number of gene regulatory components that have implications for the regulation of immediate-early genes. Several transcription factors are known to be involved in regulating the Arc gene (see above), including serum response factor (SRF), CREB, MEF2, and zif268.  Behavioral effects  Changes in Arc mRNA and/or protein are correlated with a number of behavioral changes including cued fear conditioning, contextual fear conditioning, spatial memory, operant conditioning, and inhibitory avoidance. The mRNA is notably upregulated following electrical stimulation in LTP- induction procedures such as high frequency stimulation (HFS), and is massively and globally induced by maximal electroconvulsive shock (MECS).  Arc in insects  Meanwhile it has been found that Arc may have been acquired by animals more than once. While Arc seems to be closely related among all tetrapods, the one which has been found in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), silkworms (Bombyx mori), and Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) may have been transferred to a common ancestor of these insects by another event.

She is mentioned in several Persian epics including the Banu Goshasp Nama. Banu Goshasp Nama There is an epic called Banu Goshasp-Nama composed of 900 verses by an unknown poet from the 11th or 12th century. It is one of the oldest epics about a Woman warrior in Persian literature. There is a manuscript of the poem at the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris (Cat. Biblioth√®que Nationale, p. 18, no. 1194). The epic describes the exploits of Banu Goshasp along with her brother Faramarz in Turan and India. In one of her heroic episodes, she battles with her father, Rustam due to not recognizing each other. Disaster is avoided in time when they realize each other's identity. In another episode, she battles with her suitors, most of whom are taken captives or killed by her. It is only Giv, who passes the tests and ordeals imposed by Rustam on his daughter's suitors.

Most countries distinguish between mopeds up to 49 cc (scooters do not count as a separate category) and the more powerful, larger, vehicles known as motorcycles. Many jurisdictions include some forms of three-wheelers as motorcycles. Australia and New Zealand A scooter and a motorcycle In New Zealand, a motorcycle is any two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle weighing less than 1000 kg, that can travel faster than 50 km/h or that has an engine capacity exceeding 50 cc. A moped is a motorcycle-like vehicle with an engine capacity under 50 cc and that cannot exceed 50 km/h. Motorcycles may only be driven on a motorcycle (class 6) licence; a moped can be driven on a car (class 1) licence. Riders on their learners or restricted motorcycle licence can only ride approved motorcycles on the Learner Approved Motorcycle Scheme (LAMS) list. These motorcycles must have an engine capacity of 660 cc or less and a power-to-weight ratio of 150 kW/tonne or less (when including a 90 kg rider). Motorcycles with an engine capacity of 250 cc or less are automatically approved, except for a small number of high-performance machines. Pre-1960 motorcycles are exempt from the power-to-weight ratio restriction. The legal age to be eligible to apply for a New Zealand motorcycle licence is 16 years and over. New Zealand employs a three stage system for motor vehicle licensing. At age 16, an individual can gain their first licence known as their \\"learner licence\\". They must hold this for at least 6 months before they are able to move on to their \\"restricted licence\\". They must then hold this restricted licence for one and half years. After a period of 6-18 months, depending on age and additional training, a holder of a restricted licence may sit the third and final stage known as the \\"full licence\\". A similar system is used in most states of Australia, with some variations. \\"Learners Permit\\" and \\"Provisional\\" licence holders must not have bikes that exceed a power-to-weight ratio of 150 kW/tonne or 660 cc, whichever comes first. All 250 cc bikes (with a few listed exceptions) are automatically included in this LAMS (Learner Approved Motorcycle Scheme) list. Before getting a learners permit a pre-learner course is required, which issues a certificate of completion, valid for 3 months. Upon passing a computer test, the rider is granted a learners permit, which is valid for 12 months. Whilst on a learners permit, the rider may not carry a pillion or side car and may not exceed or the posted speed limit, whichever is lower, in certain jurisdictions. To progress to a provisional licence, the rider must successfully complete a pre-provisional riders course, followed by a riding skills test called MOST (Motorcycle Operator Skill Test). The rider is then able to obtain a P1 provisional licence enabling a new upper speed limit of and giving the rider a maximum of four demerit points. These licences can be renewed and must be held without suspension for 12 months, after which time it can be upgraded to a P2 provisional licence, which is then to be held for 2 more years before the rider obtains their full licence, providing they have not breached any laws causing them to be suspended or disqualified in that period. P2 provisional riders have an upper speed limit of and a maximum of seven demerit points. P2 provisional riders are permitted to carry a pillion, P1 riders are not. There are exceptions to this rule for mature age licence holders who also hold an unrestricted drivers license, who may be eligible to bypass the P2 provisional period. Canada and the US trikes In Canada and the United StatesNHTSA defines the term ‚Äúmotorcycle,‚Äù for the purpose of the statute and regulations it administers, as ‚Äúa motor vehicle with motive power having a seat or saddle for the use of the rider and designed to travel on not more than three wheels in contact with ground‚Äù (49 CFR 571.3) three-wheeled motor vehicles fall under the auspices of motorcycle regulations. The laws and regulations for legal moped usage in the U.S. vary by state. In the United States, licensing requirements vary widely among the states and territories, but generally riders are required to pass written and practical (on-cycle) competency tests. In about half the states, successful completion of a rider education course (such as those offered by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation) is accepted by state licensing agencies in lieu of examination. The specifics of the motorcycle and moped laws in the U.S. can be obtained from each individual state's Department of Motor Vehicles website. United Kingdom These rules have recently changed. Motorcycle riders in the UK must normally take a one-day Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) course, regardless of which class of motorcycle they intend to ride. In addition a theory test must be taken prior to taking a practical test for any type of motorcycle licence. Entry level to motorcycling at age 16 is the moped, a motorcycle of engine capacity no greater than 50 cc restricted to a maximum design speed of . At age 17 the rider may have a \\"light motorcycle\\" with an engine up to 125 cc and a power output not exceeding . Only a CBT certificate, obtained within the past two years, and a provisional licence is needed to ride a learner motorcycle with an L-plate. After passing a test on a 125 cc machine, riders will be restricted to ride a \\"large restricted motorcycle\\", which has a maximum power output of . After two years this restriction is lifted and any size or power of motorcycle may be ridden. For riders over age 21 there is a direct access route to gaining a licence to ride a \\"large motorcycle\\" of any engine capacity or power, which allows somebody with no motorcycle experience to train and pass a test in around five days. Three-wheeled vehicles weighing less than 8 cwt (896 lb / 406 kg) were long classified as motorcycles in the UK and could be driven with a full motorcycle licence. A requirement there be no reverse gear fitted was dropped in the 1960s. This exemption was linked to the enduring popularity of three-wheeled vehicles in the UK (such as the Reliant Regal van) but was abolished for new licence holders in October 2000.Trike Law The Trike Shop UK. Mass-production of three-wheelers ceased in 1998 but the licensing exemption still benefits trikes and their riders.

Greek Catholic Ukrainians made up approximately 65% of the population of Eastern Galicia while Poles made up 22% of the population.Timothy Snyder. (2003). The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 123 It was the last large Eastern Slavic territory and the last historic part of the medieval state of Kievan Rus to fall under Romanov rule. The Russian Empire controlled and administered this territory from September 1914 until June 1915. Throughout the occupation, the Tsarist officials pursued a policy of integrating Galicia with the Russian Empire, forcibly Russifying local Ukrainians, and persecuting both Jews and Byzantine Catholics. Background The territory of eastern Galicia had once been an integral part of the medieval state of Kievan Rus before existing as an independent kingdom and principality until 1349. From the mid 14th century until 1772 it had been ruled by Poland. Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772 it became a part of the Austrian Empire (see Austrian partition). The Austrian government emancipated the Ukrainian peasants from serfdom, introduced a rudimantary educational system, and raised the status of Ukrainian Catholic priests in a way that made them equal to Roman Catholic priests. These reforms insured the loyalty of most of the Ukrainian population to the Austrian state. When the Austrian Empire was reorganized as Austria‚ÄìHungary eastern Galicia continued to be under Austria's jurisdiction and remained this way until the Empire's collapse following World War I. According to the 1900 Austrian census Eastern Galicia had a population of 4.8 million people, of whom approximately 65% were Ukrainian, 22% Polish and 13% Jewish.Arthur Ruppin, Margaret Bentwich. (1913). The Jews of Today. New York: H. Holt and Company, p. 96 Rivalries between the ethnic groups and between political factions within those ethnic groups would shape the occupation policies of the Russian administration.Von Hagen 2007, pp. 10‚Äì18 Although a minority, prior to World War I the Poles wielded considerable political power due to their domination of the province prior to Austrian rule and the near monopoly of power within the local government. Much of the land was owned by Polish aristocrats and Poles were a majority of the population in the territory's largest city and cultural capital, Lviv. Eastern Galicia's Ukrainians predominated in rural areas and were primarily peasants or priests. Historically, the Ukrainians of eastern Galicia had had an ideological rivalry between Ukrainophiles ‚Äì people who considered themselves to be part of the Ukrainian nation ‚Äì and Russophiles ‚Äì those who believed that Ukraine was an artificial creation and that Ukrainians were part of the Russian nation. Russophiles dominated western Ukrainian society in the mid 19th century but by the beginning of the First World War had been eclipsed by the Ukrainophiles. No longer widely popular within their own community, the Russophiles depended on support from Russia (such as from the Galician-Russian Benevolent Society based in St. Petersburg) and from Polish aristocrats who used their movement to split Ukrainian society. This support notwithstanding, both Russophiles and Ukrainophiles were opposed to the Poles whom they considered to be historical oppressors. However, the Russophiles were loyal to Russia and hoped that the war would bring about the integration of eastern Galicia with Russia while the Ukrainophiles, in contrast, were loyal to Austria and hoped that the war would bring about a dismemberment of the Russian Empire and the emergence of an independent Ukraine in its territory. Both factions within the Ukrainian community were bitterly opposed to each other. Galicia's Jews, seeing the Habsburg dynasty as their protectors and considering the Russian state to be antisemitic, were generally quite loyal to Austria during the war.Marsha Rozenblit. (2004) Reconstructing a National Identity: The Jews of Habsburg Austria during World War I. New York: Oxford University Press On the eve of World War I, with war against Russia looming, the Austrian authorities began a wave of persecution against the Russophiles. Hundreds were arrested, and Russophile organizations and newspapers were shut. Former Russian Interior Minister Pyotr Durnovo was an outspoken opponent of the annexation of eastern Galicia. Writing in February 1914, he claimed that the people had for the most part lost all connection to the Russian fatherland, and that in addition to a \\"negligible handful\\" of Russophile Ukrainian Galicians, Russia would take in large numbers of Poles, Jews, and Ukrainophile Ukrainians. Durnovo wrote that currently Ukrainian separatism was not a threat to Russia but that annexing a territory with many Ukrainian nationalists could plant seeds within Russia for a dangerous movement and that this might have unexpected consequences. Despite this warning, most Russian political figures across the political spectrum supported annexing eastern Galicia. Mikhail Rodzianko, chairman of the State Duma, declared that war against a common enemy would unite all nationalities within Russia, a sentiment echoed by the liberal politician Alexander Kerensky. Russian rule Aleksei Brusilov, Commander of Russian forces occupying Galicia In his first orders to the Russian troops crossing into eastern Galicia, General Aleksei Brusilov, commander of the Russian forces, proclaimed \\"We are entering Galicia, which despite its being a constituent part of Austria-Hungary, is a Russian land from time immemorial, populated, after all, by Russian people (russkim zhe narodom).Von Hagen 2007, p. 19 The Russian commander-in-chief, Grand Duke Nicholas issued a manifesto portraying the people of Galicia as brothers who had \\"languished for centuries under a foreign yoke\\" and urging them to \\"raise the banner of United Russia.\\"Ukraine on the Road to Freedom, published by the Ukrainian National Committee of the United States, 1919. pp.41‚Äì42 Initially, General Aleksei Brusilov and Army Chief of Staff Nikolai Ianushkevich played a large role in formulating Russian policies in eastern Galicia. The first governor General was Sergei Sheremetev. He cooperated closely with Poles loyal to Russia and pursued a pro-Polish policy that included the opening of Polish schools. This aroused the outrage of local Russophiles, who successfully pushed for his removal. Sheremetev's replacement, Count Georgiy Bobrinsky, would govern eastern Galicia for approximately nine months until the Russian retreat in June 1915. The Russian administration in Galicia was marked by tension between General Brusilov and Bobrinsky on the one hand, and local Galician Russophiles, the Russian Orthodox Church, and Russian extremists both within the local administration and from Russia itself on the other hand. While all of these groups saw the Russification and integration of Galicia with Russia as their ultimate goal, Brusilov and Bobrinsky wanted to avoid any disturbances immediately behind the Russian front, and thus sought to moderate Russian policies in order to prevent the possibility of insurrection. The latter groups, on the other hand, wanted to pursue Russification as quickly as possible. This conflict was reflected in the fact that Galician Russophile newspapers closed by the Austrians were only allowed to resume working after considerable delay: Bobrinsky's administration often censored them due to their perceived extremist or inflammatory writings. Political organization Commander of the Russian army Grand Duke Nicholas in Lviv in front of Russian medical workers General Brusilov's initial orders were for Austrian laws to remain in effect and for Austrian officials to continue their duties ‚Äì in the name of the Russian tsar instead of the Austrian emperor ‚Äì as long as they would not be suspected of possible treason to the new Russian authorities. This policy proved difficult, because many Austrian officials had fled, and because the loyalty to Russia of those who remained was in doubt. Initially local Galician Russophiles were used to staff positions. However, in time the bureaucracy came to be staffed overwhelmingly by officials transferred in from neighboring regions of the Russian Empire. As often happens in such reassignments, the bureaucrats of the neighboring regions took advantage of the opportunity to transfer out those with the least amount of ability, experience, education as well as those who caused trouble. As a result, in addition to understaffing the Russian administration in Galicia suffered from poor quality in personnel. Many of the transferees belonged to right-wing Russian nationalist parties who espoused anti-Semitism as well as hostility towards Ukrainians and Poles. In late 1914, Lviv, Ternopil and Chernivtsi regions were designated as separate guberniyi. Educational policy In mid September 1914 all schools in eastern Galicia were temporarily shut down pending the introduction of Russian-language instruction. The Russian government then subsidized special Russian-language courses for Galician teachers. Maria Lokjhvitskaya-Skalon, the founder of several educational institutions in St. Petersburg, arrived in Galicia to help in this effort by organizing courses in the Russian language, Russian literature and Russian history. Much of the work involved in Russifying the schools was coordinated by the Galician-Russian Benevolent Society. Many scholarships were set up for Galician \\"Russophile comrades\\" who wanted to attend Russian-language universities. Anti-Catholicism Easter in Galicia. Painting by S. Kolesnikov. 1915 Soon after Russian soldiers crossed into eastern Galicia, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church met in a special session to discuss how to organize the religious life of the \\"Russian population\\" of Galicia. Evlogii, the archbishop of Volynia and Zhytomir, was appointed to lead Orthodox missionary work in Galicia.Von Hagen 2007, pp.37‚Äì42 The ultimate Russian goal with respect to the Ukrainian Catholic Church that dominated Ukrainian religious life in Galicia was its complete destruction.Magosci, p. 465 The popular head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, perceived as a \\"father figure\\" by most Galician Ukrainians,Bohdan Bociurkiw.

Edmonton Canada: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta was arrested and imprisoned in an Orthodox monastery for delinquent priests in Suzdal. The Metropolitan's imprisonment caused angry questions to be raised in the Duma and diplomatic protests from the Vatican and the United States. While Tsar Nicholas II issued a decree forbidding forcible conversion from Catholicism to Orthodoxy, except in cases where 75% of the parishioners approved,Lviv Eparchy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. History: \\"Pod Russkoy vlastyu (1914‚Äì1915 gg.)\\" (\\"Under Russian Rule (1914‚Äì1915)\\") , retrieved on April 22, 2007. hundreds of Ukrainian Catholic priests were exiled to Siberia and replaced by Orthodox priests, who then demanded that the parishioners to convert to Orthodoxy and speak only Russian. Tsarist authorities were so obsessed with converting Byzantine Catholics to Orthodoxy that army chief Russian Grand Duke Nicholas complained that ammunition trains desperately needed by the Russian army were being commandeered for the purpose of transporting Russian priests into Galicia.Mark Von Hagen. \\"War, loyalties and identities in the Russian Empire\\".

(2001).Ethnic nationalism and the fall of empires Routledge Press. p. 91 Policies toward local nationalities The Russian authorities referred to the local majority as Galician Russians and actively opposed those who maintained a Ukrainian orientation. Thousand of Ukrainian political and cultural figures were arrested and deported. All Ukrainian bookstores were closed and a ban was instituted on Ukrainian-language works printed abroad. Local Russophiles played a significant role in identifying those in the Ukrainian population who could be considered traitors to the Russian authorities. East Galicia's Jewish population were assumed by the Russian authorities to be loyal to Austria and were therefore treated as potential spies and traitors. The Jewish community's publications were censored, and Jews faced arrest and deportation. Jews were taken as hostages in order to prevent alleged spying for Austria by the Jewish community. In February 1915 the Russian authorities banned Jews from moving into eastern Galicia and banned all publication and correspondence in the Yiddish language. Reaction The behavior of the Russian authorities was so heavy-handed that it was denounced as a \\"European scandal\\" in the Russian Duma by the Russian statesman Pavel Milyukov.Subtelny 1986. Between 1914 and 1915, Jewish newspapers throughout Austria vividly described Russian policy as barbaric and described gruesome details of alleged Russian atrocities against Jews. Zionists in particular identified Jewish and Austrian aims against the common Russian enemy. Aftermath When Austria regained Galicia in June 1915, most of the remaining Russophiles and their families retreated alongside the Russian army in fear of reprisals. \\"Galician Russians\\" were granted exemptions by the Russian government to the traditional 5-year residency requirement for Russian citizenship, and approximately 25,000 of them were resettled near Rostov-on-Don. In addition, many Jews and ethnic Germans were accused of being spies and deported east. The flood of refugees was so great that they blocked the roads, interfering with Russian military movements. Among the Russophiles who stayed in Galicia, the Austrians arrested and sentenced to death approximately thirty noted Russophiles, including two members of the Austrian parliament, Dmytro Markov and Volodymyr Kurylovich (their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment and they were released in 1917),Magosci, p. 466. as well as Metodyj Trochanovskij. Kost Levitsky, a prominent Ukrainophile leader and the future president of the West Ukrainian National Republic, appeared as a prosecutor during the trials against the Russophiles. After the Austro-Hungarian Army recaptured Galicia, the Crown Prince, Karl I of Austria praised Galicia's Jews for their loyalty to the House of Habsburg during the occupation. Following the evacuation of the Russian administration from Galicia to Kiev, Governor General's Bobrinsky's staff conducted a review of their policies in order to identify mistakes that they had made. The review concluded that the main source of difficulties was the \\"low educational and moral levels\\" of Russian officials sent to Galicia and that the pace of educational and cultural reforms was too quick and too brutal. Russian newspapers in Kiev concurred, and appealed for greater tolerance of the Ukrainian language, religion and culture.Von Hagen 2007, pp.72‚Äì86 Plans for future annexation The Russian government sought recommendations in order to better solidify Russian rule should Galicia be retaken by Russian forces and annexed to Russia once again. Experts' conclusions varied. Aleksi Gerovsky suggested using positive methods of encouraging the Russian language and culture rather than repressive ones against Ukrainian-language institutions, and land and economic reform that would benefit Ukrainian peasants at the expense of Polish landlords and Jewish businessmen whose loyalty the tsarist authorities doubted anyway. It was felt that such reforms would undercut Ukrainophiles' appeals among the peasantry and would engender among Ukrainians a feeling that the Russians were their economic liberators. V. Svatkovskii, a spy based in Switzerland, felt that symbolically uniting Galicia with Ukrainians in the Russian Empire and playing upon anti-Polish sentiments rather than land reform would best gain Galicians' loyalty. Mikhail Tyshkevich, a prominent landowner in Kiev region, felt that making concessions on national rather than land reform issues would be helpful. He suggested that the tsar's son Aleksei be declared \\"Hetman of Little Russia,\\" that portraits of him wearing a traditional Ukrainian costume be distributed in Ukraine, and that the Russian government ought to publish an official newspaper in the Ukrainian language. While all manifestations of political separatism ought to be stamped out, Ukrainian national aspirations should be supported. In Tyshkevich's words, \\"punish Mazepa but don't persecute Khmelnytsky.\\" Such concessions on cultural matters, Tyshkevich felt, would create enough loyalty among the people to make economic reforms unnecessary. After having sent a telegram to the tsar declaring his loyalty to him, Nicholas II responded with a message thanking him, \\"and also the group of Ukrainian gathered in Switzerland, for the feelings expressed.\\" This had been the first time that the tsar had used the word \\"Ukrainians\\" rather than Little Russians.Von Hagen 2007, pp.72‚Äì86 Drawing on these recommendations, the Russian government determined that in the future while the Russian language would remain the official Ukrainian would be permitted on a regional basis. The new administration was to be composed of strictly military personnel who would not be concerned with religious matters, and nor would it have a Russian nationalistic orientation. When the easternmost part of Galicia was briefly recaptured by the Russians in 1916, however, the Russians found that the region was economically devastated by the Russian scorched-earth policy during the previous retreat, as well as by the war, and that the population had become quite hostile towards the Russians and loyal towards the Austrians. Ukrainian and Polish schools were allowed to remain open and calls from Russian nationalistic circles within Russia to shut them down were ignored by the occupation authorities.Von Hagen 2007, pp.72‚Äì86 See also * Soviet annexation of Western Ukraine, 1939‚Äì1940 Notes Sources * Mark Von Hagen.

History Kr≈°ko (together with Brestanica) was first mentioned in 895, when the Emperor Arnulf of Carinthia gave it to a loyal retainer, Valtun. It is not known whether the castle existed at that time, but it is assumed that it was erected shortly after 1100 by the noble house of Bogen, whose ministeriales were recorded as holding it as of 1154. The Counts Bogen may have obtained the lordship by marriage of Bertold II of Bogen to Seuhard, sister of Count Popo of Carniola. In 1189, the castle was mentioned as Castrum Gurkeuelt, under the Bogen ministeriale Ortolf. In that year Adalbert of Bogen pawned it to Archbishop of Salzburg Adalbert III, a relative of his wife, for 800 Freising marks. A term of two years was set for the Bogens to redeem it; the money may have gone toward their participation in the Third Crusade.

A provisional government was established in the village of Rovereta, in opposition to the outgoing Captains-Regent whose term had expired. Background Following the end of the fascist government and World War II, the 1945 general elections produced a Communist-Socialist coalition government. In the 1955 general elections, the ruling coalition won 35 of the 60 seats in the Grand and General Council. Five moderate Socialist members of the council wanted to break the alliance with the Communists who were close to the Soviet Union and did not condemn Soviet actions during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. They left in April 1957 to form a new party, the Sammarinese Independent Democratic Socialist Party (PSDIS). This left a perfect 30‚Äì30 split in the council that paralyzed the government. Given the deadlock, the Captains-Regent avoided convening the council until the mandatory 19 September regency election to choose their replacements. Crisis A day before the election, one Communist councilor became an independent and joined the opposition, giving them the majority. However it was the practice of the Socialist and Communist parties to enforce party discipline by making their councilors sign letters of resignation after each election, with the date left blank. The party chiefs submitted to the regency all 35 letters, including the six who left their parties, with the date of 19 September. With the majority of seats vacant in the council there was no quorum, so the regency dissolved the council until new general elections could be held on 3 November. But because the council did not elect a new regency, the status of the sitting regency would be uncertain once their terms expired on 1 October, causing a constitutional crisis. The regency ordered the Gendarmerie to seal off the Palazzo Pubblico, preventing any councilors from entering. The opposition was in an uproar as the six defectors claimed their resignations were invalid and what transpired was a coup. On 30 September, opposition councilors occupied an abandoned factory in the town of Rovereta, Serravalle on the Italian border. At the stroke of midnight when the regency should have expired, the councilors declared a provisional government. Resolution Italy recognized the provisional government and Italian Carabinieri protected the three sides of the factory that sat in their territory. The regency organized a militia of supporters and weapons flowed in from Italy to both sides. On 11 October, the regency caved in and recognized the provisional government, ending the crisis. The new government elected a new regency. One of its acts was to provide for women's suffrage. General elections were held in 1959, confirming the victory of the PSDIS-Christian Democrat coalition.

The novel established Anand as one of India's leading English authors. The book was inspired by his aunt's experience when she had a meal with a Muslim woman and was treated as an outcast by her family. The plot of this book, Anand's first, revolves around the argument for eradicating the caste system. It depicts a day in the life of Bakha, a young \\"sweeper\\", who is \\"untouchable\\" due to his work of cleaning latrines. Plot summary Set in the north Indian cantonment town Bulandshahr, Untouchable is a day in the life of a young Indian sweeper named Bakha. The son of Lakha, head of all of Bulashah's sweepers, Bakha is intelligent but na√Øve, humble yet vain. Over Bakha's day, various major and minor tragedies occur, causing him to mature and turn his gaze inward. By the end of the novel Mulk Raj Anand, the author, has made a compelling case for the end of untouchability because it is an inhumane, unjust system of oppression. He uses Bakha and the people populating the young man's world to craft his argument. Bakha's day starts with his father yelling at him to get out of bed and clean the latrines. The relationship between the father and son is strained, in part due to Bakha's obsession with the British, in part because of Bakha's laziness. Bakha ignores his father but eventually gets up to answer the demands of a high-caste man that wants to use the bathroom. This man is Charat Singh, a famous hockey player. At first, Singh also yells at Bakha for neglecting his cleaning duties. The man has a changeable personality, however. It isn‚Äôt long before he instructs Bakha to come to see him later in the day so he can gift the young sweeper with a prized hockey stick. An overjoyed Bakha agrees. High on his good fortune he quickly finishes his morning shift and hurries home, dying of thirst. Unfortunately, there is no water in the house. His sister Sohini offers to go fill the water bucket. At the well, Sohini must wait behind several other outcasts also queued up. Also waiting for water is Gulabo, mother of one of Bakha's friends and a jealous woman. She hates Sohini and is just barely stopped from striking the young woman. A priest from the town temple named Pundit Kali Nath comes along and helps Sohini get water. He instructs her to come to clean the temple later in the day. Sohini agrees and hurries home with the water. Back at home Lakha fakes an illness and instructs Bakha to clean the town square and the temple courtyard in his stead. Bakha is wise to the wily ways of his father but cannot protest. He takes up his cleaning supplies and goes into town. His sweeping duties usually keep him too busy to go into town, and so he takes advantage of the situation by buying cigarettes and candies. As Bakha eats his candies, a high-caste man brushes up against him. The touched man did not see Bakha because the sweeper forgot to give the untouchable's call. The man is furious. His yelling attracts a large crowd that joins in on Bakha's public shaming. A traveling Muslim vendor in a horse and buggy comes along and disperses the crowd. Before the touched man leaves he slaps Bakha across the face for his impudence and scurries away. A shocked Bakha cries in the streets before gathering his things and hurrying off to the temple. This time, he does not forget the untouchable's call. At the temple, a service is in full swing. It intrigues Bakha, who eventually musters up the courage to climb up the stairs to the temple door and peer inside. He's only standing there for a few moments before a loud commotion comes from behind him. It's Sohini and Pundit Kali Nath, who is accusing Sohini of polluting him. As a crowd gathers around, Bakha pulls his sister away. Crying, she tells him that the priest sexually assaulted her. A furious Bakha tries to go back to confront the priest, but an embarrassed and ashamed Sohini forces him to leave. Bakha sends his sister home, saying he will take over her duties in town for the rest of the day. Distraught over the day's events, Bakha wanders listlessly before going to a set of homes to beg for his family's daily bread. No one is home, so he curls up in front of a house and falls asleep. A sadhu also begging for food comes and wakes him. The owner of the house Bakha slept in front of comes out with food for the sadhu. Seeing Bakha, she screams at him and first refuses to give him food. She finally agrees to give him some bread in exchange for him sweeping the area in front of her house. As Bakha sweeps, the woman tells her young son to relieve himself in the gutter where Bakha is cleaning so he can sweep that up too. A disgusted Bakha throws down the broom and leaves for his house in the outcasts' colony. Back at home, it's only Lakha and Sohini. Rakha, Bakha's younger brother, is still out collecting food. Bakha tells his father that a high-caste man slapped him in the streets. Sensing his son's anger, Lakha tells him a story about the kindness of a high-caste doctor that once saved Bakha's life. Bakha is deeply moved by the story but remains upset. Soon after storytime, Rakha comes back with food. A ravenous Bakha starts to eat but then is disgusted by the idea of eating the leftovers of the high- caste people. He jumps up and says he's going to the wedding of his friend Ram Charan's sister. At Ram Charan's house, Bakha sees his other friend, Chota. The two boys wait for Ram Charan to see them through the thicket of wedding revelers. Ram Charan eventually sees his friends and runs off with them despite his mother's protestations. Alone, Chota and Ram Charan sense something is wrong with their friend. They coax Bakha to tell them what's wrong. Bakha breaks down and tells them about the slap and Sohini's assault. Ram Charan is quiet and embarrassed by Bakha's tale, but Chota is indignant. He asks Bakha if he wants to get revenge. Bakha does but realizes revenge would be a dangerous and futile endeavor. A melancholic atmosphere falls over the group. Chota attempts to cheer Bakha up by reminding him of the hockey game they will play later in the day. This reminds Bakha that he must go and get his gift from Charat Singh. Bakha goes to Charat Singh's house in the barracks, but cannot tell if the man is home. Reluctant to disturb him or the other inhabitants, Bakha settles under a tree to wait. Before long, Singh comes outside. He invites Bakha to drink tea with him and allows the untouchable to handle his items. Singh's disregard for Bakha's supposed polluting presence thrills Bakha's heart. Thus he is overjoyed when Singh gives him a brand-new hockey stick. Ecstatic about this upswing to his terrible day, Bakha goes into the hockey game on fire. He scores the first goal. The goalie of the opposite team is angry over Bakha's success and hits him. This starts an all-out brawl between the two teams that ends when a player's younger brother gets hurt. Bakha picks up the young boy and rushes him home, only to have the boy's mother accuse him of killing her son. The good mood destroyed, Bakha trudges home, where his father screams at him for being gone all afternoon. He banishes Bakha from home, saying his son must never return. Bakha runs away and takes shelter under a tree far from home. The chief of the local Salvation Army, a British man named Colonel Hutchinson, comes up to him. He sees Bakha's distress and convinces the sweeper to follow him to the church. Flattered by the white man's attention, Bakha agrees, but the Colonel's constant hymn singing quickly bores him. Before the two can enter the church the Colonel's wife comes to find him. Disgusted at the sight of her husband with another ‚ÄúBlackie,‚Äù she begins to scream and shout. Bakha feels her anger acutely and runs off again. This time Bakha runs towards town and ends up at the train station. He overhears some people discussing the appearance of Mahatma Gandhi in Bulashah. He joins the tide of people rushing to hear the Mahatma speak. Just as Bakha settles in to listen, Gandhi arrives and begins his speech. He talks about the plight of the untouchable and how it is his life's mission to see them emancipated. He ends his speech by beseeching those present to spread his message of ending untouchability. After the Mahatma departs a pair of educated Indian men have a lively discussion about the content of the speech. One man, a lawyer named Bashir, soundly critiques most of Gandhi's opinions and ideas. The other, a poet named Sarshar, defends the Mahatma passionately and convincingly. Much of what they say goes above Bakha's head, so elevated are their vocabulary and ideas. However, he does understand when Sarshar mentions the imminent arrival of the flushing toilet in India, a machine that eradicates the need for humans to handle refuse. This machine could mean the end of untouchability. With this piece of hope, Bakha hurries home to share news of the Mahatma's speech with his father.

East India Company It is not clear for which Earl of Mornington she was named, but it was probably Richard Wellesley. One contemporary source states that Earl of Mornington made only one voyage for the EIC. Her captain was George Simpson, who received a letter of marque on 7 October 1799. At the time her armament was recorded as eight 12-pounder guns.Letter of Marque, p.60, - accessed 14 May 2011.

By 12 May 1801 she had reached Simon's Bay, but then on 8 August she was back at Calcutta. On 11 March 1802 she left Culpee, an anchorage towards Calcutta and closer than Saugor. From there she reached St Helena on 28 June and arrived at the Downs on 19 August. Apparently Earl Mornington sailed again in 1802. She was reported to be at St Helena on 10 June 1803, returning from the South Seas.British Southern Whale Fishery - Voyages: Earl Mornington.

The squadron consisted of Hood's flagship , Pandour, , , , , and transports carrying 2000 troops under Brigadier-General Sir Charles Green. British and Dutch casualties were light.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.288-90. Drake sailed to Jamaica on 12 April 1805. On 1 November 1805 William Furlong Wise was promoted to Commander into Drake.

Superbes captain then drove her ashore at Ocoa Bay, enabling he and his surviving crew members to escape. Nicholas's replacement in November 1806 was Commander John Parish. In October 1807 Commander George Bell replaced Parish; by 1808 she was under the command of Lieutenant John Fleming (acting) Fate She was broken up at Sheerness in 1808.

Collapse of the Harriman bank During the first years of the Great Depression, the Harriman Bank was part of a clearing house committee of nine New York banks that vowed to provide each other with financial support.Albert Gailord Hart & Perry Mehrling, \\"Debt, Crisis, and Recovery: the 1930s and the 1990s\\", pp. 52-3 n. 18 (1995). In July 1932, as the condition of the Harriman bank deteriorated, Joseph Harriman was eased out of his position as the bank's president, but remained chairman of the board. While most other banks were given licenses from the Federal Reserve Bank to re-open after the \\"bank holiday\\" of 1933, Harriman's bank was not so fortunate. In October 1933, the U.S. Department of Treasury placed the Harriman Bank in a receivership. The bank's liabilities, including to depositors, exceeded its assets by $3.3 million to $5 million. The federal government would sue banks that were members of the clearing house committee, in an attempt to recover on behalf of depositors of the Harriman Bank's losses.\\"Federal Government Sues 20 Gotham Banks\\", Oshkosh (WI) Daily Northwestern, 1933-11-28 at p. 4.

Football career Jones was born in Newstead, Nottinghamshire on Christmas Day 1888 and, after playing club football in the nearby villages of Annesley and Sutton-in-Ashfield, he joined Notts County in 1907. He soon became a regular member of Notts County's First Division side, generally playing at inside-left and in the 1909‚Äì10 season he only missed two League matches as County finished ninth in the table, their best finish for nine years. In the following season, he lost his place to Sam Richards, and only made three further appearances. Jones spent the 1911‚Äì12 season playing for Southern League Coventry City, before returning to Meadow Lane for a further year in the First Division, at the end of which Notts County were relegated to the Second Division. He then went back to Coventry City for a further season, before moving to the south coast in April 1914 to join Southampton, also in the Southern League. Described as \\"a burly, bustling inside-left\\", Jones made his debut in the opening match of the 1914‚Äì15 season, scoring in a 3‚Äì3 draw against Luton Town. Jones soon formed a \\"potent partnership\\" with fellow forwards Sid Kimpton and Arthur Dominy, who was the leading scorer in the Southern League with 30 goals. In his one season with the \\"Saints\\", Jones made a total of 35 League and FA Cup appearances, scoring 14 goals.

The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 11679. (Click on \\"Technische gegevens\\" to view.) History In 1880 a windmill was built on this site by millwright Oege Plantinga of W√¢nswert. This mill was burnt down in 1887. The Grutte M√ªne was built to replace it by millwright Gerben van Wieren of Jannum. It was originally built with two Archimedes' screws. The mill was at one time equipped with Patent sails. In 1934, one of the Archimedes' screws was transferred to the Lytse M√ªne. The spurwheel needed to drive the second screw was removed around 1986 and later reused in gristmill De Vlijt. A centrifugal pump was installed in 1943 and the mill ceased to work. The mill was restored in 1959 and again in 1975, at which time the patent system sails were replaced by commons sails. In 1977 it was sold to Stichting De Fryske Mole (English: Frisian Mills Foundation). A further restoration was undertaken in 1994. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) In 2010 and 2011 major restoration work was done. Amongst others it was decided to repair the riveted stocks dating from 1902 instead of replacing them with new welded steel stocks and to refit the patent system which had been removed in 1975. Description The Grutte M√ªne is what the Dutch describe as an \\"achtkante grondzeiler\\". It is a smock mill winded by a winch. There is no stage, the sails reaching almost to the ground. The mill has a single-storey brick base and a two-storey smock. The smock and cap are thatched. The four Patent sails have a span of and are carried in a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by Prins van Oranje, Den Haag in 1879. The windshaft also carries the clasp arm brake wheel, which has 66 cogs. This drives the wallower (35 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the crown wheel (48 cogs) drives the wooden Archimedes' screw via a gear wheel with 42 cogs. The Archimedes' screw has an axle diameter of and is diameter overall. It is inclined at an angle of 15¬∞. Each revolution of the screw lifts of water.

In 1890 Vajfert was appointed Governor of the National Bank of Serbia. He served in this capacity from 1890 to 1902, and again from 1912 to 1914/1918. During this period he acquired a good reputation maintaining the value of the Serbian dinar and in credit. After 1918, because of his good offices, Vajfert was appointed Governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. His best-known arrangement as Governor was the conversion of the Austro-Hungarian krone into the new Yugoslav dinar. This also led to great criticism, as the former Serbian dinar was exchanged 1:1 in the new dinar, the Austrian money into a 4:1 ratio - this led to substantial losses of property of those Yugoslavs who formerly lived in Austria-Hungary.

It was the first major dam in the United States constructed of roller-compacted concrete. The dam's drainage basin is of arid rolling hills in the lower basin but with headwaters in the northern Umatilla National Forest. The dam's original purpose was primarily to store water for flood control, but also to serve recreation, fish and wildlife, and irrigation uses. The dam impounds Willow Creek to create Willow Creek Lake. The lake level can be a maximum of elevation and a minimum of for a total usable storage capacity of .  History  A major flood killed approximately one quarter of Heppner's population in June 1903‚Äîabout 250 people. The flooding creek flow was as a result of a flash flood caused by thunderstorms, known as the Heppner Flood of 1903. A flood control study was completed in 1962 at a total cost of $219.http://www.nww.usace.army.mil/dpn/dpn_project.asp?project_id=305 In 1965, a flood control project was authorized by U.S. Congress.89-298 Flood Control Act of 1965, Section 204, Columbia River Basin http://www.nww.usace.army.mil/dpn/publaw.htm In 1979, the purpose of a dam project was changed to defer irrigation development for the future and eliminate water supply and water quality control. Construction feasibility tests in 1972 placed a few layers of roller-compacted concrete. A 1:36 model (one inch equals three feet) was built and studied to determine downstream flooding and pool siltation characteristics as affected by the dam's spillway. Heppner, in the foreground, is protected by Willow Creek Dam from arid basin drainage subject to thunderstorms The dam was constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers between November 1981 and February 1983. (start date conflicts with USACE source) (secure connection certificate invalid) Construction completed nearly on schedule, despite the workers initially being unfamiliar with the materials, processing, and techniques. It came in less than its budget of $50 million at $35 million. The dam's construction validated economic and construction speed benefits where of concrete were finished in less than five months at about $17 per cubic meter ($13/yd3), which includes additional efforts to correct defects. However, as soon as the lake began filling, significant leakage was evident through the seams of the layers of concrete. The lake was drained and a $2 million remedial effort included injecting grout through bores drilled from top to bottom. The initial rate of leakage was . After remediation, the leakage was less than . Concern over the dam's safety has continued, especially with the memory of the 1903 flash flood. Within a few years of construction, problems were noted with stratification of the water and anoxic decomposition producing hydrogen sulfide. Concerns were expressed that this could in turn give rise to sulfuric acid leading to concrete damage. Controversy continued for some years and the handling of the problem itself was criticized. In 2004, an aeration plant was installed to address the root cause, as had been called for 18 years earlier. Subsequent controversy surrounded the politics of a small town being used as an experiment for new construction technology. SolarBee devices to circulate the water were installed in 2009.http://www.solarbee.com/news/Prairie_Business_Magazine_20080908.pdf The dam won an American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) award in 1985.http://content.asce.org/handa/PastOCEAWinners.html See also *List of lakes in Oregon  References   External links  * Photo gallery of Heppner flood US Army Corps of Engineers, 1903 and 1971 Category:Buildings and structures in Morrow County, Oregon Category:Dams in Oregon Category:Heppner, Oregon Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers dams Category:Dams completed in 1983 Category:1983 establishments in Oregon Category:Roller- compacted concrete dams Category:Gravity dams ","title":"Willow Creek Dam (Oregon)"},{"id":"24173169","text":"The Canadian Volunteer Service Medal for Korea () was a campaign medal created in 1991 by the Canadian monarch-in-Council to recognize former members of the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Canadian Air Force who had volunteered to participate in the Korean War, either on the Korean Peninsula itself or in surrounding areas.

It is one of the oldest buildings in the village, dating to the early 19th century. Since then it has been home to a number of prominent local residents, and passed down through two different families. It has been altered slightly, with the original front now the house's rear, but it remains mostly intact. In 1983 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The house sits on a lot on the east side of Hudson Avenue near the junction with Tor Avenue. The ground slopes steadily down toward the Hudson River to the east, exposing the house's basement on that elevation. The neighborhood is residential, with a few multiple-unit dwellings. It is a two-story, five-by-two-bay frame structure sided in clapboard. It is topped by a gabled roof shingled in asphalt with a plain cornice. A small kitchen wing extends from the east. All the windows are flanked by louvered shutters. The main entrance is located within a small enclosed porch. Its double inner doors have rose-tinted glass. On the east is a two-story, three-bay open porch with square posts, brackets and a central gable on the roof top. At basement level is a door with sidelights and transom; the first floor's double door has colonnettes and an architrave. Inside, the floor plan remains unchanged. Finishings are plain and simple with the exception of the main hall and large first floor rooms, which have classically-inspired decoration. History At the time of the Revolution, most of today's Haverstraw was the property of two farmers. One of them, John Denoyelles, had left his lands to his son Peter just before the war. Peter Denoyelles, later to serve in the New York State Assembly and Congress, built the house around the beginning of the 19th century; the exact year is not certain. The area's first Methodists also met with itinerant preachers at the Homestead, due to Denoyelles' interest in that denomination. Peter left the property to his brother Asbury, then the county sheriff, in his will. Asbury sold the property to his brother George in 1853, the year before the village of Haverstraw incorporated. Shortly after that, George sold it to Edward Pye, first president of the Village Board. Pye would later be elected to local judgeships and serve in the state militia. In 1861, as the Civil War was beginning, Pye (who would later die in action at the Battle of Cold Harbor) sold it to his brother Isaac. Isaac's tenure as owner would be as short as several of the others. He sold it in 1863 to a lawyer, Abraham Conger. Seven years later, George Snedeker bought it. He died in 1873 and willed the house to his wife, who remained until her death in 1901. Their son Samuel inherited the house, passing it to his sister Lucretia Fowler in 1914. She sold it a year later to a man named Abbie Kennedy. Kennedy lived in the house until selling it to Aloysius Lynch, a longtime Haverstraw schools superintendent, in 1937. He made many overdue repairs and renovations to the house, and shortened the windows on the east and west sides. As the area grew more suburban in the 20th century, streets were laid out in what had been farmland. Hudson Avenue was located such that the house's rear elevation had to be converted into its front.

She stepped down on 29 September 2009 after her previous credit fraud case was revealed.\\"Miss Singapore quits after criminal record revealed\\" by Teo Xuanwei/Claire Huang. Channel News Asia, 29 September 2009.\\"Ris Low gives up crown\\". The Straits Times, 29 September 2009. She is currently taking up a diploma in Health Science, Hospitality and a diploma in Nursing at the Management Development Institute of Singapore. Low was ranked as one of the 25 most influential people or groups in Asia in 2009 by a division of the United States news network CNN. She was appointed as a spokesperson by a condom company, to raise awareness about safe sex.\\"Ris Low turns condom ambassador\\" by Mediacorptv.sg. Video Miss Singapore World Crowning Low participated in Miss Singapore World 2009 and was crowned Miss Singapore World on 31 July 2009. In addition to winning the crown, she was also named the following: Miss Community Ambassadress 2009, Miss Lumiere Ambassadress 2009, Miss Best Dressed 2009, Miss Dazzling Eyes 2009, Miss Photogenic 2009, Miss Crowning Glory 2009, and Miss Best in Catwalk 2009. Low has been criticised for her English-language skills. The organiser of the Singapore franchise of the Miss World beauty pageant, ERM World Marketing, defended Low's winning of the crown. A representative said that Low had performed excellently throughout the competition and won eight special awards. The representative also claimed that a one-off fashion interview had misled the public into believing she spoke English poorly. During the final competition, \\"[Low] spoke perfectly good English, had a good answer, and performed very well to impress the eleven judges that she was good enough to win.\\" Credit fraud On 25 September 2009, it was revealed that she had been convicted of credit card fraud in May 2009, and was sentenced to two years' probation. She faced five charges of misappropriation, cheating using illegally obtained credit cards, and impersonating their users' identities prior to winning the title of Miss Singapore World 2009. Low claimed she was unaware of the fact that she needed to declare the offence, and only declared it two months after the pageant when she was required to sign a contract. Legal issues may be involved if Low needs to travel, and she may have her title revoked. ERM World Marketing declined to comment on the issue, although an employee was quoted to have said \\"Singaporeans did not pay for (Ris Low)\\" when asked if Ris would keep her crown.  Stepping down  After initially resisting calls to give up her crown, Low voluntarily stepped down on 29 September 2009. She felt that it would be better for everyone and that giving up the crown was the best choice she could make. ERM said it would interview a new representative to represent Singapore at Miss World 2009, and appointed the runner-up Pilar Arlando. Career outside of pageant  Business Venture  In December 2009, the 19-year-old began looking for sponsors for brand new three-in-one beauty pageant for Singapore. She had started to send out email messages to potential sponsors, such as malls and event organisers, spelling out details for the proposed event in the middle of 2010. The selling point, she wrote, is that three winners will be crowned at the same event ‚Äì Miss Singapore, Mr Singapore and Mrs Singapore. Radio DJ From the 29 to 31 March 2010, local radio station 987FM announced that they would put Low as a DJ on the Shan and Rozz show. There was a big outcry, both towards the radio station's decision as well as Low's poor English during the show. In the end, the station announced that it was an April Fools' Day joke publicising Burger King's new burger, the Angry Whopper. Personal life Bipolar disorder On 26 September 2009, Ris Low revealed to The Straits Times in a phone interview that she has bipolar disorder.\\"I'm keeping crown\\" , by Carolyn Quek & Lim Wei Chean. The Straits Times, 26 September 2009. Full article In a subsequent interview published by The Sunday Times, she revealed that she got her bipolar disorder officially diagnosed after heeding a suggestion by her lawyer to get a medical check up in the hopes of distancing herself from her wrongdoings. She said it requires medication and psychiatric visits. She revealed that she has had the urge to steal since young and stole Pok√©mon cards once in Primary One. The act provided her with a sense of achievement: \\"that you've done something and you got away with it.\\" Her mother detected the problem when she noticed the growing collection of toys and taught her to count to ten and walk away when faced with the urge.\\"The 2 sides of me\\" (abridged), by Tan Dawn Wei.

Although she has since filed a police report, the incident was met with scepticism by netizens, and many believed it was a publicity stunt.

He was a member of Parliament, a member of the Privy Council, a regent and Lieutenant of the kingdom. Biography He was the son of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly and his second wife, Princess Annabella of Scotland, the youngest daughter of King James I of Scotland.There has been some uncertainty regarding Alexander's mother, whether she was Annabella Stewart (m. to Geo. Gordon ‚Äì1471) or Elizabeth Hay (m. 1471‚Äì1501). The fact that his father married Elizabeth Hay after 18 Aug 1471 [CP, vi, 677 & n. b.] and that Alexander himself was a member of parliament as well as being one of the Lords of the Articles in 1485 makes it chronologically implausible he could have been Elizabeth's son. Logic dictates he could not have held these positions of authority at age 13 or less.

He witnessed the marriage contract of James IV in 1503 and was engaged in quelling disturbances in the Isles in 1505. In 1509, he was awarded the comital Lordship of Lochaber. Alexander fought in the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, where he commanded the Scots left wing and was one of the fortunate few Scottish noblemen who escaped with their lives. He was a member of the council of Regency in 1517 during the minority of King James V of Scotland and was appointed King's Lieutenant over all of Scotland excepting Argyle in 1517‚Äì18. He was a supporter of the Duke of Albany in his dispute with the Earl of Angus. Alexander died on 21 Jan 1524 at Perth.

He played in the opening match of the 1919‚Äì20 season, a 1‚Äì1 draw with Exeter City before Rawlings took over. After one appearance at inside-right in November 1919, his only run in the side came at the end of March when he replaced Rawlings for five matches at centre-forward. He scored in four of those matches, including two in an 8‚Äì1 victory over Merthyr Town on 10 April to bring his tally to a respectable five goals from seven appearances. During his one season with the \\"Saints\\", Jones won representative honours when he scored twice for the South Eastern League XI against the London Combination. In the 1920 close season, Jones joined Goole Town for their first season in the newly founded Yorkshire Football League.

When cooled below their transition temperatures, they have zero electrical resistance. Most commonly, conventional superconductors such as niobium-titanium are used, but high- temperature superconductors such as YBCO are entering the market. Superconducting wire's advantages over copper or aluminum include higher maximum current densities and zero power dissipation. Its disadvantages include the cost of refrigeration of the wires to superconducting temperatures (often requiring cryogens such liquid nitrogen or liquid helium), the danger of the wire quenching (a sudden loss of superconductivity), the inferior mechanical properties of some superconductors, and the cost of wire materials and construction. Its main application is in superconducting magnets, which are used in scientific and medical equipment where high magnetic fields are necessary. Important parameters The construction and operating temperature will typically be chosen to maximise: *Critical temperature Tc, the temperature below which the wire becomes a superconductor *Critical current density Jc, the maximum current a superconducting wire can carry per unit cross-sectional area (see images below for examples with 20 kA/cm2). Superconducting wires/tapes/cables usually consist of two key features: *The superconducting compound (usually in the form of filaments/coating) *A conduction stabilizer, which carries the current in case of the loss of superconductivity (known as quenching) in the superconductoring material.Wilson, Martin N. \\"Superconducting magnets.\\" (1983).https://indico.cern.ch/event/440690/contributions/1089752/attachments/1143848/1639300/U4_final.pdf The current sharing temperature Tcs is the temperature at which the current transported through the superconductor also starts to flow through the stabilizer.Bottura, L. \\"Magnet quench 101.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1401.3927 (2014).https://repositorio.unican.es/xmlui/handle/10902/12040 However, Tcs is not the same as the quench temperature (or critical temperature) Tc; in the former case, there is partial loss of superconductivity, while in the latter case, the superconductivity is entirely lost.Ekin, Jack. Experimental techniques for low-temperature measurements: cryostat design, material properties and superconductor critical-current testing. Oxford university press, 2006. LTS wire Low-temperature superconductor (LTS) wires are made from superconductors with low critical temperature, such as Nb3Sn (niobium- tin) and NbTi (niobium-titanium). Often the superconductor is in filament form in a copper or aluminium matrix which carries the current should the superconductor quench for any reason. The superconductor filaments can form a third of the total volume of the wire. Preparation Wire drawing The normal wire drawing process can be used for malleable alloys such as niobium- titanium. Surface diffusion Vanadium‚Äìgallium (V3Ga) can be prepared by surface diffusion where the high temperature component as a solid is bathed in the other element as liquid or gas. When all components remain in the solid state during high temperature diffusion this is known as the bronze process.

Critical current 1700 A (16 tesla, 4.2 K), critical current density 20 kA/cm2 HTS wire High-temperature superconductor (HTS) wires are made from superconductors with high critical temperature(high-temperature superconductivity), such as YBCO and BSCCO. Powder-in-tube Simplified diagram of the PIT process The powder-in-tube (PIT, or oxide powder in tube, OPIT) process is an extrusion process often used for making electrical conductors from brittle superconducting materials such as niobium-tin or magnesium diboride, and ceramic cuprate superconductors such as BSCCO.Larbalestier, David et al. (1997) Ch. 5 \\"Sheathed or Powder-in-Tube Conductors\\" in WTEC Panel Report on Power Applications of Superconductivity in Japan and Germany It has been used to form wires of the iron pnictides. (PIT is not used for yttrium barium copper oxide as it does not have the weak layers required to generate adequate 'texture' (alignment) in the PIT process.) This process is used because the high-temperature superconductors are too brittle for normal wire forming processes. The tubes are metal, often silver. Often the tubes are heated to react the mix of powders. Once reacted the tubes are sometimes flattened to form a tape-like conductor. The resulting wire is not as flexible as conventional metal wire, but is sufficient for many applications. There are in situ and ex situ variants of the process, as well a 'double core' method that combines both. Coated superconductor tape or wire The coated superconductor tapes are known as second generation superconductor wires. These wires are in a form of a metal tape of about 10 mm width and about 100 micrometer thickness, coated with superconductor materials such as YBCO. A few years after the discovery of High-temperature superconductivity materials such as the YBCO, it was demonstrated that epitaxial YBCO thin films grown on lattice matched single crystals such as magnesium oxide MgO, strontium titanate (SrTiO3) and sapphire had high supercritical current densities of 10‚Äì40 kA/mm2. However, a lattice-matched flexible material was needed for producing a long tape. YBCO films deposited directly on metal substrate materials exhibit poor superconducting properties. It was demonstrated that a c-axis oriented yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) intermediate layer on a metal substrate can yield YBCO films of higher quality, which had still one to two orders less critical current density than that produced on the single crystal substrates. The breakthrough came with the invention of ion beam-assisted deposition (IBAD) technique to produce of biaxially aligned yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin films on metal tapes. The biaxial YSZ film acted as a lattice matched buffer layer for the epitaxial growth of the YBCO films on it. These YBCO films achieved critical current density of more than 1 MA/cm2. Other buffer layers such as cerium oxide (CeO2 and magnesium oxide (MgO) were produced using the IBAD technique for the superconductor films. Smooth substrates with roughness in the order of 1 nm are essential for the high quality superconductor films. Initially hastelloy substrates were electro polished to create a smoothed surface. Hastelloy is a nickel based alloy capable of withstanding temperatures up to 800C without melting or heavily oxidizing. Currently a coating technique known as \\"spin on glass\\" or \\"solution deposition planarization\\" is used to smooth the substrate surface. Recently YBCO coated superconductor tapes capable of carrying more than 500 A/cm-width at 77 K and 1000 A/cm-width at 30 K under high magnetic field have been demonstrated. Chemical vapor deposition CVD is used for YBCO coated tapes. Hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition HPCVD can be used for thin-film magnesium diboride. (Bulk MgB2 can be made by PIT or reactive Mg liquid infiltration.) Reactive co-evaporation Superconducting layer in the 2nd generation superconducting wires can be grown by reactive co-evaporation of constituent metals, rare-earth element, barium, and copper. Standards There are several IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) standards related to superconducting wires under TC90.

It is composed of groups of cities, urban districts and other organizations from countries around the world in exchanging information to achieve the goal through a health promotion approach called Healthy Cities. The chair city for the alliance is Ichikawa, Japan. The alliance and its members work in favour of the healthy city, defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \\"one that is continually creating and improving those physical and social environments and expanding those community resources which enable people to mutually support each other in performing all the functions of life and in developing to their maximum potential\\".World Health Organization. Health Promotion Glossary. Geneva, 1998.  History  AFHC third conference nobori in Ichikawa, Chiba in October 2008 The first international declaration that promoted the concepts underlying healthy cities, the Alma Ata Declaration, was adopted at the International Conference for Primary Health Care, jointly convened by the WHO and UNICEF in Almaty (formerly Alma-Ata), presently in Kazakhstan, 6‚Äì12 September 1978. The primary health care strategy endorsed and targeted health for all the people of the world by the year 2000. Various discussions have taken place since then. Trevor Hancock and Leonard Duhl promoted the term \\"Healthy Cities\\" in consultation with the WHO: > \\"Economic development has brought comfort and convenience to many people in > the industrialized world, but in its wake are pollution, new health > problems, blighted urban landscapes and social isolation. Growing numbers of > the dispossessed are also being left on the sidelines as the disparity > between rich and poor grows.

Following a second international conference on health promotion at Adelaide in 1988 and a third at Sundsvall in 1991, and twenty years after the Alma Ata Declaration, the Fourth International Conference on Health Promotion held in July 1997 in Jakarta adopted the new Jakarta Declaration: \\"New Players for a New Era - Leading Health Promotion into the 21st Century\\".

The tribe inhabits a vast geographical area located in the region between Iraq and Iran's borders. The Battle of DimDimDIMDIM in 1609 was fought between the Bradost Prince Amir Khan Lepzerin and Shah Abbas. Geo- History of Bradost According to Bedlisi,Amir ≈†araf Khan Bedlƒ´sƒ´, ≈†araf-nƒÅma, ed. M.  øAbbƒÅsƒ´, Tehran, 1343 ≈†./1964[(Sharafnameh ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÅŸÜÿßŸÖŸá-‚Äåÿ®ÿØŸÑŸäÿ≥Ÿä, pp. 382-88)] the tribe must have been much larger, occupying the entire region to the west of Lake Urmia. The region comprised, in the early 11th/late 16th century, several sub-districts (nahias) including Targavar, Margavar, Dol, Sumay, and Urmia.[Bedlƒ´sƒ´ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÅŸÜÿßŸÖŸá-‚Äåÿ®ÿØŸÑŸäÿ≥Ÿä ‚Äå, pp. 382-88] The Ottoman- Persian frontier of 1639, which survived until World War I and forms the present boundary of Iran with Turkey and Iraq, divided Bradost territory into two parts. In the late 13th/19th-century administrative division of the Ottoman empire, Bradost was a nahia of Rawanduz qaza, shahrazur sanjaq, Mosul weleyat (.Cuinet, La Turquie d‚ÄôAsie II, Paris, 1892, p. 846 Following the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, this nahia was officially incorporated into Iraq in 1925, where it had 108 villages with a population of 5,185 in 1957.Iraq Republic, WezƒÅrat al-DƒÅ·∏µelƒ´ya, Modƒ´rƒ´yat al-Nof≈´s al- øƒÄmma, al- Majm≈´ øa al-e·∏•·π£ƒÅ æƒ´ya le-tasjƒ´l  øamm 1957; SokkƒÅn al-qorƒÅ le-alwƒ´at al-M≈´·π£el wa‚Äôl- SolaymƒÅnƒ´ya wa Arbƒ´l wa Kark≈´k wa Dƒ´ƒÅlƒÅ, Baghdad, 1961, pp. 234-42 Under the Qajar dynasty, the western limits of Margavar, Dasht, Targavar, Baradost, and Sumay formed part of the often disputed Ottoman-Persian frontier.(Ja øfar Khan MohandesbƒÅ≈°ƒ´ Mo≈°ƒ´r-al-Dawla, ResƒÅla-ye ta·∏•qƒ´qƒÅt-e sar·∏•addƒ´ya, Tehran, 1348 ≈†./1969, p. 150) In the administrative redivision of Iran under the Pahlavis, the boundaries of the traditional nahias or mahal of Bradost, Targavar, Margavar, Dol, and Somay were left more or less intact forming dehestans ÿØŸáÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ of Urmia (.KetƒÅb-e asƒÅmƒ´-e dehƒÅt-e ke≈°var, WezƒÅrat-e Ke≈°var, EdƒÅra-ye Koll-e ƒÄmƒÅr wa ·πÆabt-e A·∏•wƒÅl, vol. 1, 1329 ≈†./1950, pp. 460-73) The decennial census of 2006 counted 63 villages with a population of 40189 in Bradost dehestan.http://www.amar.org.ir/portal/faces/public/census85/census85.natayej/census85.abadipage Ÿæÿß€å⁄ØÿßŸá ÿß€åŸÜÿ™ÿ±ŸÜÿ™€å ŸÖÿ±⁄©ÿ≤ ÿ¢ŸÖÿßÿ± ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ The snow-fed Bradost river rises in the peaks of the mountain range along the Iran-Turkey border, flows through Baradost territory, and, joined by other headwaters, forms Nazluchay, which discharges into Lake Urmia to the northeast of the city of Urmia (Times Atlas, pl. 37; Gazetteer of Iran I, map I-11-B). Bradost amirate The formation of Bradost amirate was part of the process of the rise of Kurdish political power in the form of small dynasties and numerous (semi-)independent amirates that appeared all over Kurdistan in the 10th-11th/15th-16th centuries, Bedlisi related the founders of the principalities to the Hasanwayhid dynasty (348-406/959-1015, q.v.) and divided them into two lines‚Äîthe amirs of Somay and those of Targavar and Qala Dawud (Dimdim) (Amir ≈†araf Khan Bedlƒ´sƒ´, ≈†araf-nƒÅma, ed. M.  øAbbƒÅsƒ´, Tehran, 1343 ≈†./1964pp. 384-88). At the climax of its power, the amirate‚Äôs domain extended from the western shores of Lake Urmia to parts of the welayats of Arbil, Baghdad, and Diyarbakƒ±r. The hereditary rule of Bradost, like that of other amirates, was, however, soon threatened by the centralizing and expansionist policies of the Ottoman and Safavid empires, which turned Kurdistan into a battlefield for more than three centuries. To protect their sovereignty, Bradost princes put up continued resistance to both empires though they often relied on one against the other. Thus, after initial opposition to Shah Esmail‚Äôs efforts to establish his authority over the area, the powerful Bradost amir Ghazi Qeren (ÿßŸÖŸäÿ± ÿ∫ÿßÿ≤Ÿâ ŸÇÿ±ÿßŸÜ) rallied to the Safavids (Amir ≈†araf Khan Bedlƒ´sƒ´, ≈†araf-nƒÅma, ed. M.  øAbbƒÅsƒ´, Tehran, 1343 ≈†./1964, pp. 382-83). The Gold-Hand Khan Shah Abbas I (996-1038/1588-1629, q.v.) initially recognized the hereditary rule of Bradost princes though relations deteriorated and Amir Khan Bradost ( Khani Lepzerin, ‚ÄúThe Gold-Hand Khan‚ÄùÿÆÿßŸÜŸâ ŸÑŸá‚ÄåŸæÿ≤€éÿ±ŸäŸÜ) revolted against the shah in the fortress of Dimdim (Kurd. ÿØŸÖÿØŸÖ) in 1017/1609. The neighboring Mokri principality joined forces with the Bradost throughout the revolt, which has become a major theme of Kurdish folklore and literature(D. Dzh. Dzhalilov, Kurdskiƒ≠ geroicheskiƒ≠ √®pos ‚ÄúZlatorukiƒ≠ Khan,‚Äù Moscow, 1967) and is also described in an eyewitness report by the shah‚Äôs chronicler Eskandar Beg (Eskandar Mon≈°ƒ´ TorkmƒÅn, TƒÅrƒ´·∏µ-e øƒÅlamƒÅrƒÅ-ye  øabbƒÅsƒ´, Tehran, 1350 ≈†./1971-72.pp. 791-801, 807-11). To undermine the growing power of the Kurdish element, the Safavid and Qajar monarchs sent numerous punitive expeditions to the area, massacred the population of Mokrƒ´ principality (Eskandar Mon≈°ƒ´ TorkmƒÅn, TƒÅrƒ´·∏µ-e øƒÅlamƒÅrƒÅ-ye  øabbƒÅsƒ´, Tehran, 1350 ≈†./1971-72., pp. 811-14), transferred thousands of Kurds (J.

Rhoads, Manchus & Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1861-1928, University of Washington Press, 2001 better known by his title Prince Duan (or Prince Tuan, ), was a Manchu prince and statesman of the late Qing dynasty. He is best known as one of the leaders of the Boxer Rebellion of 1899‚Äì1901. Early life and career Zaiyi was born in the Aisin Gioro clan as the second son of Yicong (Prince Dun), the fifth son of the Daoguang Emperor. His family was under the Bordered White Banner of the Eight Banners. He was adopted by his father's cousin, Yizhi (Â•ïË™å; 1827‚Äì1850), who had no son to inherit his Prince Rui peerage. In 1861, Zaiyi was made a beile, before succeeding Yizhi as a junwang (second-rank prince) under the title \\"Prince Duan of the Second Rank\\" (Á´ØÈÉ°Áéã) in 1894. Prince Duan sided with Empress Dowager Cixi and opposed the Hundred Days' Reform movement initiated by the Guangxu Emperor and his allies. After the reformist movement was crushed, in 1899, Empress Dowager Cixi designated Prince Duan's son, Puzhuan (Ê∫•ÂÑÅ; 1875‚Äì1920), as First Prince (Â§ßÈòøÂì•) in her plan to depose the Guangxu Emperor and replace him with Puzhuan. However, since the ambassadors of other countries did not recognise Puzhuan's legitimacy, the empress dowager was forced to abandon her plan. Role in the Boxer Rebellion A leading conservative and strongly anti-foreign politician, Prince Duan was one of the main supporters of the Righteous Harmony Society (Áæ©ÂíåÂúò; \\"Boxers\\") during the Boxer Rebellion of 1899‚Äì1901. He arranged a meeting between Empress Dowager Cixi and Boxer leader Cao Futian. In 1899, Prince Duan set up his own private armed forces, the Tiger and Divine Corps,Lanxin Xiang, The Origins of the Boxer War: A Multinational Study, Routledge, 2002, p. 220 which was among the several modernised Manchu banner forces. During the crisis in June 1900, he headed the Zongli Yamen (foreign affairs ministry) and commanded the Boxers who besieged the Beitang cathedral. He was also in command of the Beijing Field Force against the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance. Prince Duan's younger brother, Zailan (ËºâÁÄæ), was also one of the leaders of the Boxer Rebellion. Prince Duan fell out of favour with the imperials after the Boxers were defeated, and the Qing government was forced to side with the Eight-Nation Alliance against the Boxers. The victorious Eight-Nation Alliance named Prince Duan as one of the masterminds behind the rebellion. In 1902, the Qing government issued an imperial decree condemning Prince Duan for his involvement in the Boxer Rebellion. Prince Duan and his family were exiled to Xinjiang.Peter Harrington & David Chandler, Peking 1900: The Boxer Rebellion, Osprey Publishing, 2001 According to Empress Dowager Cixi's lady-in-waiting Yu Deling, the empress dowager blamed Prince Duan for the Boxer crisis and for issuing an imperial decree ordering the killing of all foreigners without her authorisation and knowledge.Derling, Princess Two Years in the Forbidden City, (New York: Moffat Yard & Company, pg. 361 (New York: Moffat Yard & Company, 1911). Life in exile and brief return to Beijing Prince Duan did not end up in Xinjiang during his exile. Instead, he went to Alashan, west of Ningxia, and lived in the residence of a Mongol prince. Around 1911, he moved to Ningxia during the Xinhai Revolution when the Muslims took control of Ningxia. After that, he moved to Xinjiang with Sheng Yun. Prince Duan lived in exile until 1917, when the general Zhang Xun briefly restored Puyi, the Last Emperor who abdicated in 1912, to the Qing imperial throne. He was regarded as a national hero by the ruling elite because of his aggressive anti-foreign stance. The Beiyang government of the Republic of China invited him back to Beijing and cooperated with him. Prince Duan's hatred for things regarded as foreign to China, however, never changed. He refused to eat when a military officer threw a party for him in Western style. He also became angry when he heard about his grandchildren riding in trains because he believed that trains were objects alien to China. Foreigners were furious when they learnt that Prince Duan had returned to Beijing, and started protesting to the Beiyang government. As a result, Prince Duan moved back to Ningxia and lived the rest of his life there. The Beiyang government increased his stipend by 50%. He died in 1923. Martial arts Prince Duan left his name in the history of Chinese martial arts. Yang Luchan, the founder of Yang-style taijiquan, and other famous martial artists were patronized by Prince Duan. It was in the prince's residence that copies were made of a seminal classic forty chapter text of taijiquan principles for Luchan's son Yang Banhou as well as Wu Quanyou, the first teacher of Wu-style taijiquan. Family Prince Duan was a cousin of the Guangxu Emperor because the emperor's biological father, Prince Chun, was the seventh brother of Prince Dun, Prince Duan's biological father. Prince Duan also had an additional layer of familial ties with the Guangxu Emperor: His wife, Jingfang of the Yehenara clan, was the third daughter of Guixiang (Ê°ÇÁ••), Empress Dowager Cixi's younger brother. Guixiang's second daughter, Jingfen, was the Empress Consort of the Guangxu Emperor. However, the Genealogy of the Aisin Gioro Family (ÊÑõÊñ∞Ë¶∫ÁæÖÂÆóË≠ú) does not confirm that Prince Duan's wife was Jingfang, Empress Dowager Cixi's niece. Prince Duan's primary spouse was the daughter of Shaochang (Á¥πÊòå) from the Irgen-Gioro clan (‰ºäÁàæÊ†πË¶∫ÁæÖÊ∞è). She bore Prince Duan's eldest son, Puzhuan (Ê∫•ÂÉé). Prince Duan's secondary spouse was the daughter of Gongsangzhu'ermote (Ë≤¢Ê°ëÊú±ÁàæÈªòÁâπ), a jasagh-prince from the Mongol Borjigin clan. She gave birth to Pujun (Ê∫•ÂÑÅ), Prince Duan's second son. Portrayals in media Prince Duan is portrayed by Australian actor Robert Helpmann in the 1963 American historical film 55 Days at Peking.

Mexican historian Enrique Krauze is the founder of the magazine and he is also editor. The publisher is Editorial Vuelta, a prominent publishing company co-founded by the Nobel Prize laureate in Literature, Octavio Paz. The headquarters of the magazine is in Mexico City. The magazine is the heir to previous Latin American literary magazines, specifically Vuelta, which ceased publication in 1998 with the death of its founder Paz. At beginning of the 2000s, the magazine launched its website, which was designed by Danilo Black. According to statistics publicized by the magazine on its tenth anniversary, 40% of its pieces during its first decade have been written by Mexican authors, 25% by non-Mexican Spanish-speakers, and 25% by non Spanish-speakers. The latter works were translated specifically for the magazine. Some of the regular contributors of the magazine are leading intellectuals of Latin America and other countries: Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel Zaid, Rodrigo Fres√°n, Guillermo Sheridan, Fernando Savater, Hugo Hiriart, Juan Villoro, Alberto Barrera Tyszka, Jos√© de la Colina, Jos√© Emilio Pacheco, Enrique Vila-Matas, Adolfo Castanon, Roger Bartra, David Rieff, Bisam √Ålvaro, Jorge Edwards and Patricio Pron. Letras Libres publishes about history, culture, and social issues and is a leading voice in discussing feminist and environmental issues. Controversially, Standish and Bell classified Letras Libres as \\"right wing\\" in its political views, although it has published left-wing writers as well. They say that, as it represents the cultural and literary establishments in Mexico, it can be classified as right wing. This definition is questionable because the magazine does not promote right-wing views and all leading magazines include authors who are members of the establishment.

Background and the robbery  Dinsio's accomplices were his brother, James Dinsio, his nephews Harry and Ronald Barber, his brother-in-law Charles Mulligan, alarm expert Phil Christopher and Charles Broeckel. The Dinsio crew was from Youngstown, Ohio and Christopher and Broeckel were from Cleveland. Amil Dinsio was the mastermind of the operation but he worked closely with his brother, James, an explosives expert and designer/fabricator of burglary tools. His brother-in- law, Charles Mulligan, was the driver and look-out man. The inclusion of Phil Christopher and Charles Broeckel was forced upon Dinsio by the person who clued him in on the score. Dinsio reluctantly took Broeckel along as muscle only, which proved to be a critical mistake. He had no skills needed to assist in any other way with the score as he was nothing more than a petty thief. Broeckel helped inside the vault to bust open safe deposit boxes. Christopher played a key role in disarming the alarm. The total stolen from this score was estimated at nearly $9 million.http://50cases.freedomblogging.com/2009/11/13/day-12-the-largest-bank- burglary-in-us-history-targets-nixon%E2%80%99s-millions/305/ The gang gained entry to the vault by using dynamite to blast a hole in its reinforced concrete roof.  Investigation and arrests  While the burglary itself was executed perfectly, the thieves made the mistake of perpetrating a similar crime back in Ohio a few months later. The FBI linked the two burglaries, and their investigation of transportation records revealed that five of the gang members had travelled to California on a single flight using their own names. A sixth man, James Dinsio, arrived on a separate flight the day before the crime. They also learned of the townhouse used as an HQ, which had been rented by one of the gang members. A search initially found nothing, until the dishwasher was checked. The burglars had forgotten to run the dishwasher before returning to Ohio, and the recovered fingerprints permitted federal arrest warrants to be made. This led to the arrest and conviction of all the burglars, along with recovering most of the loot as well.  Trial and witness tampering  Earl Dawson, who assisted the police and testified against the gang, was offered money by his brother Harold Dawson to influence his testimony. Earl Dawson was placed in the witness protection program as was Charles Broeckel, who testified against his co-conspirators in exchange for immunity from prosecution.  In popular culture  Accounts of the burglary and investigation have been shown on truTV and Investigation Discovery. Dinsio‚Äôs book, Inside The Vault, was self-published in 2014 with the assistance of his daughter. The 2012 movie Superthief discussed Christopher's knowledge of alarm systems and his role in the planning and execution of the burglary. The incident is used as the basis of the 2019 movie Finding Steve McQueen.

There is no legal definition in the United States for predatory mortgage servicing. However, the term is widely used and accepted by state and federal regulatory agencieshttps://www.scribd.com/doc/14459600/Turning-a-Blind-Eye such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Trade Commission and Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While there are no specific laws against predatory mortgage servicing abuses, there are local, state, and federal laws against many of the specific practices commonly identified as predatory mortgage servicing abuses, and various state and federal agencies use the term as a catch-all term for many specific illegal activities in the mortgage servicing industry. Predatory mortgage servicing is not to be confused with predatory lending which is used to describe the unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent practices of mortgage brokers and lenders during the mortgage loan origination process.http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_52/b4015147.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_businessweek+exclusives Predatory mortgage servicing typically occurs on subprime, Alt-A, scratch and dent, and toxic mortgages that are being serviced by special or default servicers or servicers and lenders that are financially in trouble. There are many motives for predatory servicing practices and a report titled Misbehavior and Mistake in Bankruptcy Mortgage Claim by Katherine M. Porter, professor of law at the University of Iowa details the effects and damages caused by servicing abuses. In mortgage securitization transactions, the mortgage servicer forwards the borrower's payment of principal and interest to the certificate holders (investors) of the special securitized trust that owns and holds the promissory notes secured by the mortgages and deeds of trust. The mortgage servicer, however, is allowed to retain late fees, BPO fees, inspection fees, and other fees charged or assessed to a borrower's account. In addition to the fee income, the servicer is allowed to retain the net liquidation proceeds of any foreclosure sale (net after foreclosure expenses and principal balance to investors). This provides an incentive to unscrupulous servicers who aggressively interpret mortgage documents to add additional fees to a borrower's mortgage account. Many times, the additional fees added on create an event of default allowing the mortgage servicer to foreclose on the property. This practice is commonly referred to as manufacturing a default or manufactured default.

In his youth, having left primary school and home, he worked his way around the world, visiting relatives in Hampshire, England. He enlisted in the Mounted Rifles in the Boer War at 19, giving a false age. He was educated as a late entrant at Otago University, completing the work for an MA about 1914, but was never awarded the degree as he had not matriculated. Responding to an invitation to train as a Presbyterian minister (although an Anglican by upbringing) he spent four years at Knox College. He was the top student in his years in Hebrew and Greek. He married in 1914, and in 1917 went to France as a padre with the artillery with the rank of Captain. He was the Minister of the St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church Hamilton 1925‚Äì1946.The Centennial book A Century of Faith (1976), published in April 1985, has passages on the Rev.

Literary career  Ruth Gilbert's earliest verse was written about 1926; she was first published in the Hamilton High School magazine in the 1930s, but copies have yet to be found. Interviewed in 1991, Ruth Gilbert said that as a child of the manse her earliest influences came from hymns and the Bible.MacKay, Deirdre. \\"Escaping into poetry gave her life vitality\\", Nelson Evening Mail. Reproduced in Wright, Niel. Sketch Profile of Ruth Gilbert pp.49‚Äì51. \\"My father recited poems to all the family ‚Äì and listening to him read from the Bible Sunday after Sunday gave me an ear for words and their music.\\" Her first attempts at rhyme were a source of merriment to her family. One of her earliest memories is being laughed at by a family group on the veranda of her grandparents' place for parodying a hymn which goes: ::The great physician now is near ::The sympathising Jesus ... Her own version in tune with the original went: ::Oh little fly oh don't you die ::I'll ask the Lord to help you. She has an equally clear recollection of the first original poem she wrote when she was 11. It read: ::A mass of brightest gold was she ::And not as any other tree ::For she was golden as the sun ::That through the branches played and run. \\"I knew the last line was wrong but didn't know what to do about it.\\" Many years later the poem reappeared, much altered as \\"The Wattle Tree\\" and started with the lines: ::You blazing there, a living core of light, ::Were the first poem a child longed to write. ::A spendthrift gold among the careful green ... At 12 she started to read other people's poetry, an interest that was encouraged by the wealth of reading material at the manse. \\"My father had a study which had books from floor to ceiling and, provided I had clean hands, I was allowed to read what I liked.\\" An early favourite was Thomas Wyatt and later she enjoyed Yeats, Graves and many of the French poets. \\"The music and artistry of their work stayed with me for the rest of my life.\\" Otherwise Ruth Gilbert's first publications were in 1941 in the Evening Post and in Art in New Zealand. \\"Joseph\\" appears in Lyric Poems of New Zealand 1928‚Äì1942, edited by C. A. Marris. A 1966 interview report Hard Lines for Women Writers states: \\"Ruth Gilbert, who wrote verse from about nine, kept black books with \\"the most ghastly verse\\" and contributed to her high school magazine, was in her early 20s when a friend suggested she should show her verse to C.

Selected Poems 1941‚Äì1998 was compiled in 1998 by Ruth Gilbert, at the age of 80, with the co- operation of an editor, Derek Bolt. It is significant in that it presents the early poems and the Sappho poems as part and parcel of her oeuvre.  Themes and critical recognition  From 1941 to 1966, Ruth Gilbert's reputation was prestigious. After 1966 her opportunities to publish in established outlets shrank. Her efforts to find commercial publishers for collections to be called The Lovely Acres, The Tenth Muse and Selected and Collected Poems were unsuccessful, and from 1984 she relied on small publishers. Up to 1966, reviews of her poetry were probably more numerous in the provincial presses of New Zealand and Britain than have so far come to light. But since 1966 balanced, appreciative and authoritative reviews and interviews have appeared by James Bertram, Heather McPherson, Lauris Edmond, Derek Bolt, Deirdre Mackay and others.Collected in Wright, F. W. Nielsen. Sketch Profile of Ruth Gilbert and How about Honouring the New Zealand Poet Ruth Gilbert on her 85th Birthday. Ruth Gilbert always shows as a traditionalist poet who moves freely and comfortably within formalism, notably lyrical and melodious, usually dramatic and narrative, rarely explicitly confessional. In her brief autobiographical comments, Ruth Gilbert makes it clear that from earliest childhood she was aware of religion and nature, and religious material and the natural world are a staple throughout her poetry, so overwhelmingly that people may read and see her as a devout Christian. But she herself says a very early poem of hers parodies a Christian hymn in commenting on the natural world. All her use of religious material moves in the same direction, even for some readers to the point of comic parody. A comic poem called \\"Aged Eighty Four\\", published in 1944, was inspired by the experience of nursing her mother while she was dying of cancer. It is consistent with her refusal to express grief as a reaction to the natural world. She knows the reality of human life as thoroughly as anybody, but she holds and expresses confidently that the natural world is a positive good. In her 1970 study of contemporary poets, Professor Joan Stevens places Ruth Gilbert in the Georgian tradition. :Ruth Gilbert's talent is for the straightforward evocation of brief moments of emotion, particularly those of the child or the woman, within the tradition of the romantic lyric. For her, the poetry seems to lie more in the words themselves than in the experiences; she is willing to take over poetic resonances established by others, rebuilding then for her own purposes: ::How steeped in beauty these old names are; ::Saffron, Sandalwood, Cinnabar ... :This is a Georgian attitude, resulting in low-pressure poems of simple statement. If she has a poetic ancestor, it is Walter de la mare, who is close at hand in \\"Phobia\\". \\"Legendary Lady\\" and \\"Portrait.\\" : :Some of these moments of emotion are as imagined in the lives of others, particularly within Bible stories, where such figures as Joseph, Rachel and Lazarus are sympathetically probed. Some are personal to the poet, as \\"Sanatorium\\" and, nearer to the bone, \\"Fall Out\\". Some are crystallised into small perfection, as in \\"Li Po\\", \\"Metamorphosis\\" and \\"The Trees of Corot.\\" : :Ruth Gilbert has made several attempts to increase her scale, by binding lyrics into a sequence. Of these the most successful is \\"The Luthier\\", which, even if conventionally romantic in essence, has the merit of a more vigorous vocabulary, and more complex rhythms than she has commanded elsewhere. :At her best, she can set up quiet ripples ‚Äì never disturbing ones ‚Äì which take her meaning beyond the sensitive but unadventurous moment which she describes. Her later work, however, suggests a growing awareness of the forces to be tapped when the form has been hammered out by the pressure of the content and is not a mere relaxed handling of old words and shapes. There may therefore be different work ahead of her. But her natural place is with the Georgians.Joan Stevens. Contemporary Poets of the English Language, 1970 Chicago. London 1971. New York Niel Wright has also written on Ruth Gilbert's Georgianism.Wright, F. W. Nielsen. Celebrating Ruth Gilbert and the Triumph of Kiwi Georgianism: An Essay in the Literary History of Aoteaoa 2002. Wright, F. W. Nielsen. Survey of Critical Documents on Kiwi Georgianism. 2010 Ruth Gilbert's \\"Lazarus\\" sequence was singled out for praise in a 1990 entry on her work. \\"The poems are quiet, lyric, occasional, sometimes slight, about music and biblical stories and places ‚Äì NY, Samoa, England. But the earliest post-war poems about Lazarus are striking. In a group of moving poems about birth ('Quickening', 'Justification', 'Still-Born': 'O child who did not cry, you cry for ever/ Through all my nights'); about woman's need for love, and loss of it; about woman's silence ('She Who is Silent', 'By Bread Alone'), and about facing death of a loved one: 'Death is of the Grass'.\\"Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (eds). The Feminist Companion to Literature in English: Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present 1990. Critics have remarked on her lyricism and mastery of form. \\"She uses conventional, usually rhymed forms confidently and often elegantly, with an essentially lyrical talent. Some notable poems on her war experience, when she practised as a physiotherapist in the Wellington region, are included in Complete Early Poems 1938‚Äì44 (1994). Her work includes autobiographical sequences (\\"The Sunlit Hour\\", 1955, \\"The Luthier\\", 1966) and travel sequences (\\"Tusitala's Island\\" in Collected Poems, 1984). Her references are often biblical, as in the anthologised \\"Leah\\", or classical, as in the extensive set of short poems on Sappho themes written after she learnt Greek at the age of 75 (Breathings, 1992).\\"Roger Robinson and Nelson Wattie (eds).

Campaign In the run up to the election a private Conservative poll was leaked which showed them 17% behind Labour and likely to only win in 4 wards as compared to 18 for Labour. However Labour and the Liberal Democrats accused the Conservatives of leaking the poll in order to lower expectations. The Conservatives would have lost control of the council on a 7% swing from the 1994 election, or if the 1997 general election results in the area were repeated. However Wandsworth had low council tax levels, the lowest in the country, and the Conservatives had recently cut the tax by 24%. This meant commentators expected the Conservatives to stay in control of what was described as their showpiece council. For the election 9 of the 22 wards that made up the council were seen as being marginal. Election result The results saw the Conservatives increase their control of the council gaining an extra 5 seats. This meant that with 50 seats the Conservatives had the most seats they had yet had on the council. Labour lost seats in St John and Roehampton wards, which was put down to the closure of the local Queen Mary's Hospital. Voter turnout at 40% was 10% down on the previous 1994 election.

Established in the year 1964 with moderate beginnings. The school is affiliated to the CISCE board (Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations).  History  In 1954 a young missionary couple, Mark & Huldah Buntain obeyed the call of God on their lives and travelled by ship from Canada to Kolkata (then Calcutta), India. From the onset of their ministry, the Buntains faithfully proclaimed Jesus and reflected his light through acts of compassion. Moved by the plight of the city's poor and homeless children Pastor Buntain set up the first Assembly of God Church School in Kolkata at Park Street in 1964. Pastor Buntain's great love & compassion for the poor led to the setting up of a feeding program which provided daily nutritious meals for those struggling for survival on the streets and in the slums of Kolkata.  Insight into the School  The administrative office and senior section of the school is located at Park Street, while the junior section is located at Royd Street. AGCS Main Building at Park Street The school emphasizes on academic, co curricular and spiritual training. The unique feature of this school is its morning chapel. The discipline is quite strict and methodical. The campus is quite spacious. Classrooms airy and clean corridors. The teaching staffs and non teaching staffs are very cooperative. One gets to hear success stories from overseas guests and alumni. There is an active alumni association too. This school has a large batch size with 130+ students taking the Class 10 examination. The average score was 77.14%. The school offers 10 subjects to students (Students need to take 6 subjects: Typically, English, second language, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies + 1 elective (optional)). The school also takes active part in keeping Kolkata green and arranges a number of nature projects. The school also organises various inter- house competitions which include debates, elocution, sports and so on.  Greenathon  The annual fest of the school is ‚ÄòGreenathon ‚Äì Our Dream Kolkata Green‚Äô. The school endeavours to provide a vibrant forum to interact with the students and to create young environmental catalysts that would become the future ‚Äòchange agents‚Äô. It started in the year 2011. AGCS Junior section at Royd Street The school received the PlanetPoints Planet-friendly event certification, for its efforts in organising Greenathon 2014 in the greenest way possible, Mr. Victor Singh, the School Principal and the chief guests planted saplings in the school premises and marking the beginning of the signature Mini-Marathon (of approx. 2.8 km) in the heart of the city.

The vast majority of surfaces, synthetic or natural, are extremely rough on the scale of the wavelength. Images obtained from these surfaces by coherent imaging systems such as laser, SAR, and ultrasound suffer from a common interference phenomenon called speckle. The origin of this phenomenon is seen if we model our reflectivity function as an array of scatterers. Because of the finite resolution, at any time we are receiving from a distribution of scatterers within the resolution cell. These scattered signals add coherently; that is, they add constructively and destructively depending on the relative phases of each scattered waveform. Speckle results from these patterns of constructive and destructive interference shown as bright and dark dots in the image M. Forouzanfar and H. Abrishami-Moghaddam, Ultrasound Speckle Reduction in the Complex Wavelet Domain, in Principles of Waveform Diversity and Design, M. Wicks, E. Mokole, S. Blunt, R. Schneible, and V. Amuso (eds.), SciTech Publishing, 2010, Section B - Part V: Remote Sensing, pp. 558-77. Although commonly referred to as \\"speckle noise\\", speckle is not noise in its generally understood sense of an unwanted modification to a desired signal. Rather, it is the signal itself that fluctuates, because the scatterers are not identical for each cell, and the signal is highly sensitive to small variations in scatterers. Speckle in conventional radar increases the mean grey level of a local area. Speckle in SAR is generally serious, causing difficulties for image interpretation. It is caused by coherent processing of backscattered signals from multiple distributed targets. In SAR oceanography, for example, speckle is caused by signals from elementary scatterers, the gravity-capillary ripples, and manifests as a pedestal image, beneath the image of the sea waves. The speckle can also represent some useful information, particularly when it is linked to the laser speckle and to the dynamic speckle phenomenon, where the changes of the speckle pattern, in time, can be a measurement of the surface's activity.  Speckle reduction  Several different methods are used to eliminate speckle, based upon different mathematical models of the phenomenon. One method, for example, employs multiple-look processing (a.k.a. multi-look processing), averaging out the speckle by taking several \\"looks\\" at a target in a single radar sweep. The average is the incoherent average of the looks. A second method involves using adaptive and non-adaptive filters on the signal processing (where adaptive filters adapt their weightings across the image to the speckle level, and non-adaptive filters apply the same weightings uniformly across the entire image). Such filtering also eliminates actual image information as well, in particular high-frequency information, and the applicability of filtering and the choice of filter type involves tradeoffs. Adaptive speckle filtering is better at preserving edges and detail in high- texture areas (such as forests or urban areas). Non-adaptive filtering is simpler to implement, and requires less computational power, however. There are two forms of non-adaptive speckle filtering: one based on the mean and one based upon the median (within a given rectangular area of pixels in the image). The latter is better at preserving edges whilst eliminating spikes, than the former is. There are many forms of adaptive speckle filtering, including the Lee filter, the Frost filter, and the Refined Gamma Maximum-A- Posteriori (RGMAP) filter. They all rely upon three fundamental assumptions in their mathematical models, however: * Speckle in SAR is a multiplicative, i.e. it is in direct proportion to the local grey level in any area. * The signal and the speckle are statistically independent of each other. * The sample mean and variance of a single pixel are equal to the mean and variance of the local area that is centred on that pixel. The Lee filter converts the multiplicative model into an additive one, thereby reducing the problem of dealing with speckle to a known tractable case.  Wavelet Analysis  Recently, the use of wavelet transform has led to significant advances in image analysis. The main reason for the use of multiscale processing is the fact that many natural signals, when decomposed into wavelet bases are significantly simplified and can be modeled by known distributions. Besides, wavelet decomposition is able to separate signals at different scales and orientations. Therefore, the original signal at any scale and direction can be recovered and useful details are not lost.M. Forouzanfar, H. Abrishami-Moghaddam, and M. Gity, \\"A new multiscale Bayesian algorithm for speckle reduction in medical ultrasound images,\\" Signal, Image and Video Processing, Springer, vol. 4, pp. 359-75, Sep. 2010 The first multiscale speckle reduction methods were based on the thresholding of detail subband coefficients.Mallat, S.: A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing. Academic Press, London (1998) Wavelet thresholding methods have some drawbacks: (i) the choice of threshold is made in an ad hoc manner, supposing that wanted and unwanted components of the signal obey their known distributions, irrespective of their scale and orientations; and (ii) the thresholding procedure generally results in some artifacts in the denoised image. To address these disadvantages, non-linear estimators, based on Bayes' theory were developed.

He played a total of seven Test matches on these tours, and scored one Test try ‚Äì against Australia during the 1904 tour. After settling in Australia, Swannell played a single game for his new home when they faced New Zealand. He was viewed as a violent player, and this made his unpopular with other players. Former Australian captain Herbert Moran said of him that \\"... his conception of rugby was one of trained violence\\".Moran, Paddy; Viewless Winds ‚Äì the recollections and digressions of an Australian surgeon; P Davies Pub., London (1939) During the Second Boer War, Swannell served in the British Army in South Africa, rising to the rank of lieutenant.

Promoted to major on 1 January 1915, he was killed on 25 April 1915 while taking part in the Landing at Anzac Cove, during the first day of the Gallipoli Campaign.Lane, Daniel, \\"ANZAC hero Ted Larkin: The greatest sacrifice of all\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, (18 April 2015). Personal history Swannell was born in Weston Underwood, Buckinghamshire on 20 August 1875 to William and Charlotte Swannell, and was the third child of at least five siblings.King's Sympathy for Major Swannell's Mother, The (Sydney) Refereee, (Wednesday, 30 June 1915), p.13. His father was a farmer, who ran a farm which employed 17 adults and children. He was home schooled as an infant before beginning his formal education at Repton School. After leaving school he attended the Thames Nautical Training College where he gained qualifications as a second mate.An Old Hesperus Boy: The Late Major Swannell, The Daily Commercial News and Shipping List, (Tuesday, 12 October 1915), p.4. He remained single throughout his life.Major Swannell's Will, The (Sydney) Daily Telegraph, (Saturday, 7 August 1915), p.7. In 1897 he made his first visit to Australia, as a mate on a schooner. On his return to Britain, Swannell joined the British Army and served in South Africa during the Second Boer War,Required: Football Boots & A Love of Country colonialrugby.com where he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 35th Battalion (Buckinghamshire) Imperial Yeomanry on 20 January 1902. He retained the rank of honorary lieutenant when he resigned his commission on 3 February 1903. It was reported that during his time in South Africa, he was personally recommended on the field for a commission by General Lord Methuen. Swannell was a keen self-promoter, claiming a number of exploits that were so abounding, that his adventures were \\"too numerous to be recorded\\". These claims included: fighting among the insurrectionists in Uruguay, to have hunted seal down the South American coast and around Cape Horn as well as Labrador, and to have played rugby in France, Germany, South Africa, India and North and South America. Many of these claims are unsubstantiated. One claim that is problematic, made by the Fielding Star newspaper in 1909, was that he took part in the Cape Frontier war. This cannot be a reference to the Xhosa Wars as the last of that series of wars ended in 1879, when he was merely the age of four. An article from 1925, claimed he represented Wales and Argentina. After touring Australia with the British Isles team for the second time in 1904, he settled in Sydney. A keen all-round sportsman he coached not only rugby but also hockey, was vice-president of the Sydney Swimming Club, and training senior military cadets for surf life-saving examinations. He also joined the Australian Militia, and by 1914 had reached the rank of captain and had passed the promotion exams for the rank of major. Rugby career Swannell played as a forward, and in his last Test specifically at number eight. He was an unconventional and hard rugby player, known for his violent play. He would turn up for training in unwashed kit, and wore the same pair of breeches for every game, again unwashed. His poor personal hygiene and overly violent playing style, made him an unpopular character in the eyes of other players. Swannell first came to note as a rugby player when he represented English club team Northampton. It was while with Northampton that Swannell was invited to tour with Matthew Mullineux's British Isles team, on their 1899 tour of Australia. Swanell played in 17 matches of the tour including three of the four Tests against the Australian national team, missing only the opening defeat. Swannell scored in only one game on the tour, a try in a win over the New South Wales Waratahs on 29 July 1899. 1904 British Isles team, Swannell is back row, second left Swannell returned to Britain with the touring team, and was reselected for the 1904 tour, this time taking in Australia and New Zealand. Swannell played in 15 games, including all four Test Matches, three against Australia and the final Test against New Zealand. In the third Test, Swannell scored his first and only international points, a try against Australia in Sydney. The British Isles were victorious over the Australians, but lost the New Zealand match, this was the first international game that Swannell had been on the losing side. In the New Zealand clash, Swannell's violent playing style, was targeted by countering with equally rough play. He left the field at the end of the match with two black eyes, and bleeding, but with his spirit undaunted. When the touring British team returned home after the 1904 campaign, Swannell along with team-mates David Bedell-Sivright, and Dr. Sidney Crowther decided to remain in Australia, to begin new lives, although Crowther later returned to England. Swannell joined club team Northern Suburbs,Honour Board Northern Suburbs Rugby Club based in Sydney. In 1905 he was selected to play for the Australian national team, even though he had already faced them as an opponent on six occasions. The match was against New Zealand, and was the first overseas tour the Australians had undertaken; Australia lost 14‚Äì3. Wallaby captain Herbert Moran didn't mince words when speaking of Swannell in Viewless Winds saying \\"Swannell was, for a number of years, a bad influence in Sydney football...his conception of rugby was one of trained violence\\" With his playing career behind him, Swannell continued his involvement with the sport by coaching at youth and school level, namely at St Joseph's College where he coached the team to a number of championships. He was an advocate for team training and in particular for forwards to rehearse scrummaging and break-down techniques. He argued that the forwards won or lost the game. In 1909, he became Secretary of the Metropolitan Rugby Union, and in 1910 the club raised his salary from ¬£200 to ¬£250. Financial stress on the club lead him to resign in 1911 to save expense, but he continued in an 'honorary position'. He also served as a referee from 1911 to 1914, earning praise for his ability to control the game. While in Australia, Swannell was often approached by the sporting press for his opinion on rugby matters.

She was married to Meghanada (Indrajit), who was the eldest son of Ravana, who defeated Indra, hence received his title. In one of the Purana, the birth of Sulochna is mentioned. One day Lord Shiva took a bath and after the bath, Goddess Parvati was making him ready. She made him wear the tiger skin, rudra mala, and snakes. When she was tying the snake on Shiva‚Äôs hands, the snake was tied too hard that it dropped its two tears on the ground. These drops gave birth to two girls, Sunaina and Sulochana. The snake said that since it was his drops, the girls belonged to him and his Naga race. Parvati said that she was the one who accidentally tied the snake hard enough to give birth to the girls, hence she should have them. Both then asked Lord Shiva as to who should get the girls. Lord Shiva advises that since both were equally responsible, both of them should claim one girl and raise them. Parvati took Sunaina, River Goddess Narmada came and requested that she would like to raise the girl, and would give her back when Sunaina is getting married. Narmada raised her and married off to King Janaka, who would later become Sita‚Äôs parents. The other girl, Sulochana, was taken by the Naga race and raised as one of their own, and later married her off to Meghnad, the son of Ravana. In the ballad Meghnad Bodh Kavya, Prameela is said to be Indrajit's wife. So, it can reasonably be assumed that Sulochana was also known as Prameela. Sulochana was very brave and exhibited this virtue when Meghanada, her husband, was going to war with Rama and his younger brother Lakshmana, she supported her husband by not crying and never stopped or requested to not to go to war.

It had needed the financial assistance of larger concerns, chiefly the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway, and the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway. It opened its line progressively from 1859 to 1861, delayed by exceptionally difficult tunnelling at Colwall and Ledbury. The company was purchased by the West Midland Railway in 1860, and that company amalgamated with the Great Western Railway in 1863. The line was double track as far as Malvern at first, but was later doubled throughout except for the two tunnels. The line was conceived chiefly as a through railway for passenger and goods trains; the local traffic remained thin. The line remained a secondary main line, and is in operation today. Conception The Worcester and Hereford RailwayThe London and North Western Railway decided to promote a narrow (standard) gauge Worcester and Hereford Railway in the 1852 session of Parliament. It had allies in the Midland Railway and also the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway, and hoped to reach the rich mineral deposits of South Wales by running over those railways. Its Bill was rejected in the Lords in 1852, but it returned with a revised route in 1853. The Broad Gauge interest promoted a different line joining the two cities, intending to keep the LNWR and its friends out of South Wales. The narrow gauge line was successful, and its Act was passed on 15 August 1853;Carter says 7 August 1853.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , pages 625 and 626 authorised capital was ¬£750,000.Herbert Rake, The Worcester and Hereford Railway, in the Railway Magazine, May 1908 Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, page 241. The broad gauge line was thrown out; but at the time Parliament was suspicious of large groupings of railways in the hands of one dominant company, and it struck out all the clauses in the Bill giving powers of subscribing for shares, or for working arrangements, by the LNWR or the Midland Railway. The Worcester and Hereford Railway was therefore authorised, but left on its own, and it found itself unable to raise capital to build its line. A return to Parliament in the 1855 in an attempt to have the assistance clauses reinstated was also rejected. This left the W&HR; in a state of stagnation. After a year or more the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway took up the cause of the W&HR;, encouraged by directors of the NA&HR; who had become also members of the Worcester and Hereford Railway board, and later the Midland Railway joined in the group of potential suppliers of funds. An application for the necessary powers was made in the 1858 session, and by now Parliament had softened its position, and the Bill was passed. Construction could now be started and a double line was in the process of being constructed from Worcester to Malvern, and a single line from there to Shelwick Junction, where the line would join the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway a few miles north of Hereford. At Worcester there was to be a triangular junction. A triangular junction had been authorised at Shelwick also, but this was never made.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927, volume 1, pages 537 to 542MacDermot, pages 524 to 529 Opening Ledbury stationThe line was opened in stages. The first section was from Henwick (at Worcester but on the west side of the River Severn) to Malvern Link was opened on 25 July 1859. The line was worked by the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway company, although the line was not as yet physically connected to it. The bridge over the River Severn at Worcester remained to be completed. When it was presented to the Board of Trade inspecting officer, he declined to sanction its use for passenger trains as the slender arches had too great a deflection. The bridge spans were stiffened and the line between Tunnel Junction, at the north apex of the triangular junction with the OW&WR; at Worcester, and Henwick opened to traffic on 17 May 1860; trains reversed at Tunnel Junction to get access to and from Shrub Hill station. On 24 May the other end of the line was extended from Malvern Link to Malvern Wells. The west-to-south part of the Worcester triangle was opened to traffic on 25 July 1860.Leslie Oppitz, Hereford and Worcester Railways Remembered, Countryside Books, Newbury, 1990, , page 82Rex Christiansen, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 13: Thames and Severn, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1981, , page 94 There were two tunnels, between Malvern and Colwall (1567 yards) and at Ledbury (1323 yards); the Malvern tunnel was particularly difficult due to the rock being exceptionally hard.MacDermot, pages 542, 543and 551 > It was decided not to blast the rock in the Malvern tunnel, as the engineer > was bringing down from London, a novel contrivance in a tunnelling machine > of extraordinary power, driven by steam, which had been intended for use in > the siege operations before Sebastopol, now rendered unnecessary. The West Midland Railway Great Malvern stationFriendly relations between the OW&WR; and the NA&HR; ripened into a proposed amalgamation, which would also purchase the Worcester and Hereford Company. A Bill for the purpose was introduced into the 1860 session of Parliament and eventually became enacted. The combined company was to be called the West Midland Railway. Worcester and Hereford shareholders were guaranteed 4% from the opening of their line, rising to 5% in the third year. The necessary Bill was passed, and the amalgamation took effect, and the West Midland Railway was created, on 1 July 1860.By Act of 16 June 1860. At the same time the Worcester and Hereford Railway ceased to exist, its undertaking having been absorbed by the new company.MacDermot, pages 524, 525 and 543Christiansen, page 85 West Midland Railway amalgamated with the GWR Relations between the Great Western Railway and the West Midland Railway were not especially harmonious, and it came as a shock to many when in 1861 it was announced that they had settled their differences and were to be amalgamated. An amalgamation act would be needed but in the meantime the companies would act as far as legally possible as a single system. The Act came into effect on 1 August 1863.MacDermot, pages and 547 and 553 Completion of the Worcester and Hereford Railway Worcester Foregate Street stationFinishing the Malvern Tunnel was the key to opening the rest of the Worcester and Hereford line. The opening took place on 15 September 1861. It had the effect of physically connecting the two parts of the West Midland Railway: the former OW&WR; and the former NA&HR.; It also provided a new through narrow (standard) gauge route between London and South Wales; this was important as most of the collieries in South Wales were on narrow gauge lines there, and transhipment of coal had been a major deterrent in conveying coal to London and Southampton over the GWR and its partners. At the same time the LNWR gained access over the line to South Wales.MacDermot, pages 550 and 551 Double track The line was built with single track from Malvern Wells to Shelwick Junction. Double track was provided in that section, except in the two long tunnels, by 1885.Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, 25 inches to one mile, published 1887, surveyed 1885, various sheets Midland Railway John Speller writes: > The Midland Railway had running powers over the Worcester & Hereford line > via the Stoke Works Branch and the Oxford, Worcester & Wolverhampton line > from Droitwich Spa to Worcester, making the route part of the Midland > Railway's route line from Birmingham to Swansea.

In the 1970s the signal box and junction trackwork were abolished, and the line to Henwick station worked as two single lines, combining into a double line west of Henwick. Singling The line between Malvern Wells and Shelwick Junction was singled in 1984. Passenger train services The 1895 Bradshaw shows six daily stopping trains, supplemented by three running from Worcester to Gloucester via Ledbury. There were three daily North and West Expresses, generally with through coaches from Manchester, Liverpool and Birkenhead to Bristol and Cardiff.Bradshaw‚Äôs Rail Times for Great Britain and Ireland: December 1895, reprint, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2018, By 1922 the stopping train service was similar, although more of the stopping trains terminated at Malvern. There were several semi-fast services, and Birmingham was the dominant focus, with two London to Hereford trains. In 1938 the local service was broadly similar, but with several additional journeys from Worcester to Malvern, shown as third class only, suggesting they were auto- trains. In 1960 there were substantially fewer stopping trains although auto- trains to Colwall were still evident. There were several semi-fast Birmingham to Cardiff trains, and the London to Hereford services had increased considerably, with many fewer Birmingham to Hereford trains on the route.British Railways Western Region Public Timetable, Summer 1960 The present day The line continues in use as a secondary main line, with London to Hereford trains as well as local trains using Birmingham as their focus. Freight traffic is light. Gradients The summit of the line is at Colwall; from the north-east it is approached by an eight-mile climb of 1 in 120 to 1 in 80 from Leominster Junction; from the west there is a five-mile climb at 1 in 80 leading to it. The line from Ledbury to Shelwick Junction is undulating.

The necropolis consists of a series of vaults set in a seaside hill, four primary chamber-tombs, and a surrounding burial area. In 1985, UNESCO declared Kerkouane and its necropolis a World Heritage Site, because \\"[t]he remains constitute the only example of a Phoenicio-Punic city to have survived.\\" The necropolis was discovered in 1929 by a local Islamic schoolteacher. This schoolteacher found a large store of buried possessions in the tombs, the most valuable of which he proceeded to sell to treasure hunters and collectors. The sold loot variously included jewellery, ceramics, and scarab gems. Many of the funerary objects and large pottery were too burdensome to be removed, and so were left in the tombs or destroyed. The discovery of the necropolis was not formally documented until some time later, after the schoolteacher revealed his source of wealth to an enquiring law officer.McGuinness, p. 163 Further excavations have since been undertaken by historians and archaeologists. Many of the objects recovered have been sundries with little value, left over from the schoolteacher's pillage and the ransacks of grave robbers after him: bones, eggs, altars, amulets, bronze coins, razors, toiletries, obsidian and basalt relics, and earrings, among others.MacKendrick, p. 17 Exceptions include an ancient Greek signet ring; a jasper scarab depicting an animalistic Egyptian god; and a set of rare perfume flasks, which was claimed by the Fragonard museum in Grasse, France.McGuinness, p. 166 The most precious find to date is a red-painted sarcophagus with a cover in the shape of a woman identified as the goddess Astarte (Ishtar), protector of the dead, or one of her worshippers. The woman is dressed in a robe and wears a sacred crown known as a polos. She is covered in red, blue, and yellow plaster, and is ‚Äì with the exception of her feet ‚Äì perfectly intact. The sarcophagus is prized as one of the only known Punic wood carvings still existing; for this reason, it was taken to Zurich, Switzerland for treatment shortly after its discovery. When news of the find broke, the carved woman was dubbed \\"the princess of Kerkouane\\" by the Tunisian press. The sarcophagus now rests in the Kerkouane site museum.

Shock polar in the (\\\\varphi ,p) plane  Shock polar in the pressure ratio-flow deflection angle plane for a Mach number of 1.8 and a specific heat ratio 1.4. The minimum angle, \\\\theta, which an oblique shock can have is the Mach angle \\\\mu =\\\\sin^{-1}(1/M), where M is the initial Mach number before the shock and the greatest angle corresponds to a normal shock. The range of shock angles is therefore \\\\sin^{-1}(1/M)\\\\leq\\\\theta\\\\leq\\\\pi /2. To calculate the pressures for this range of angles, the Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot equations are solved for pressure: \\\\frac{p}{p_{0}}=1+\\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{\\\\gamma +1}(M^{2}\\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta -1) To calculate the possible flow deflection angles, the relationship between shock angle \\\\theta and \\\\varphi is used: \\\\tan\\\\varphi =2\\\\cot\\\\theta\\\\frac{M^{2}\\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta -1}{2+M^{2}(\\\\gamma +\\\\cos 2\\\\theta )}. Where \\\\gamma is the ratio of specific heats and \\\\varphi is the flow deflection angle.  Uses of shock polars  One of the primary uses of shock polars is in the field of shock wave reflection. A shock polar is plotted for the conditions before the incident shock, and a second shock polar is plotted for the conditions behind the shock, with its origin located on the first polar, at the angle through which the incident shock wave deflects the flow. Based on the intersections between the incident shock polar and the reflected shock polar, conclusions as to which reflection patterns are possible may be drawn. Often, it is used to graphically determine whether regular shock reflection is possible, or whether Mach reflection occurs.

Synopsis  Freddy is a computer engineer working at Menlo Computer Machine. His secretary notifies him that his ex-wife had a whirlwind romance with flamboyant, successful used car dealer Big Sid and is marrying him in days. Freddy agrees to take in Tommy, his eight-year-old son, while they're on their honeymoon. He meets them at Sid's opulent mansion, where he also meets Sid's attractive daughter, Sidni. Tommy comes to idolize Big Sid for his wealth, while the low-key Freddie feels inadequate and fumes. Mr. Menlo is depending on Freddy to convince Admiral Norton to buy a $10 million mainframe computer, but the gung-ho officer is unimpressed by computers. Freddy's co- worker Don hatches a plan to use the computer to predict football game results that will allow Norton to win his betting pool. It succeeds, and Freddy uses his newfound connection with the admiral to request a visit to a navy ship for himself and Tommy. Big Sid lands a world-record bluefin tuna while fishing on his honeymoon, which Freddy resents even more. Sid returns early with an idea to run an event on his car lot where people can try to break records of all types. Freddy and Tommy's visit to the USS Enterprise is cancelled as the aircraft carrier is delayed at sea by bad weather, so he takes Tommy to a roller skating rink. Tommy would rather go to Big Sid's record event and Freddy finally acquiesces. But the rink has lost his shoes. When the rink's owner questions whether Freddy came in wearing shoes, an exasperated Freddy leaves wearing the skates, vowing not to return them until he gets his shoes back. At Big Sid's, a news crew mistakes Freddy for one of the record-seekers and interviews him. Freddy calls the rink and finds out they have recovered his shoes. As he's about to change out of his skates, he sees his interview on the snack bar television. Other customers are impressed and wish him luck, which makes him think he can impress Tommy with the record. He returns the shoes, promising to pick them up after he has broken the endurance record in another 142 hours. Driving home, his skates jam on the pedals and he's stopped by a police officer, who eventually comes to understand and drives him the rest of the way. Without a car, he tells Tommy to take a taxi to go to his apartment. Sidni drives him instead and they have dinner together. Tommy is impressed by his dad's record attempt. At Menlo, Freddy's co-workers are incredulous and Mr. Menlo is furious, especially as Freddy's skates mark his office floor. He gives Freddy an ultimatum to remove the skates, but after thinking it over, Freddy decides to stand up for himself and quits. He spends the next few days looking for a new job as well as skating everywhere. Admiral Norton calls Don, looking for the computer's predictions for the coming weekend. When told that Freddy has quit, he refuses to recommend the purchase. Mr. Menlo grudgingly re-hires Freddy, who demands a promotion to head of the research department. Freddy feigns an injury and uses a wheelchair to avoid being seen skating during the presentation to the admirals. Immediately after the presentation, Freddy hastily skates to meet a news crew on the street to be certified for the record. His family watches on TV, reacting in horror as he helplessly rolls backward down a ramp at the end of the interview. After a madcap careen down hilly streets, he hits the side of a tour bus, ending up in a full body cast. Sidni informs him he has been given three world records: for the length of time on skates, for the highest speed on skates (over 70 mph) and for breaking the most bones in one accident, beating Evel Knievel's record.

More than 1,500 were supplied to the British Army in World War I for use as staff cars. Each Vauxhall chassis was sold with a three-year guarantee including regular inspections. The 25 hp car appeared for the first time at the Olympia Motor Show in November 1912 alongside two of its three stablemates: the 6-cylinder 5-litre 30 hp car and the lighter weight 25 hp Prince Henry. All cars had a new tapered bonnet which \\"runs flush into the body\\". The smallest Vauxhall 16-20 was not displayed. Vauxhall's 23-60 replaced the 25 in July 1922. History In 1911 Vauxhall introduced its Prince Henry which had much sporting success. Many of these cars were fitted with heavy bodies and to better cater for this trade, Vauxhall re-tuned the engine, de-rating the maximum power to . The 25 was marketed as the \\"weight carrying chassis\\". Top speed is around 60 mph. {Brendon limousine for 1913 |The wartime staff car 1914 |} :;on the Western Front, France {thumb |thumb |} {George V Vimy Ridge 11 July 1917 |} Engineering The substantial chassis has semi elliptic leaf springs and rigid axles front and rear. The engine, with fixed cylinder head and bore of 95 mm and stroke of 140 mm, drives the rear wheels via a multi-plate clutch and four speed transmission separated from the engine. The engine, clutch and transmission are mounted on a sub frame. There are no brakes on the front wheels but the car has a transmission brake immediately behind the gearbox operated by the foot pedal. The rear wheel brakes are operated by hand lever inside the car. About 4500 were made in total including 1556 supplied to the armed forces. It was superseded by the 23-60 which had an overhead valve engine and four wheel brakes. Road Test ‚Äî swift and silky running In April 1921 ‚Äî having tried what he regarded as a new model ‚Äî the motoring correspondent of The Times wrote: \\"Speed is an asset in a motor-car. Few motorists of experience care to drive at high speed habitually but the feeling that the car has a big reserve of power which may at any time be loosed, and the ability to indulge, on open stretches of road, in bursts of exhilarating speed, to flatten out hills almost as though they were level ground are pleasures which few can fail to appreciate once the charm has cast its spell.\\" Vauxhall‚Äôs new 25 hp model results from valuable experience gained between 1914 and 1919. The War Department models were undeniably harsh and little attempt was made to provide a refined car but, in this new car, speed stability and smoothness have been successfully combined. For a driver this car is delightful. All the controls operate with refined efficiency and the engine is full of life. The suspension is good. The character of the engine, strong yet smooth brakes, light steering and the car‚Äôs steadiness on the road make the 25 require only the little effort enough for a small car. Speed (gear) changes are \\"difficult to achieve without scrape or grunt\\". However double clutching allows noiseless changes. Rear brake adjustment is not well placed and requires tools. This Vauxhall‚Äôs signs of progress in motor-car design include: an oil filter at the bottom of the crankcase readily extracted from the front without trouble; easily carried out adjustments may be made to the air pressure pump supplying the carburettor with petrol, the timing chain, the fan belt. Redesign of lubricating systems: the front gearbox bearing is accessed through a quickly detachable lid etc.; the valve stems are lubricated; grease-cups have been replaced by ball-valve oilers. Fitted tool cases are provided in the running boards.

Damaged before its first flight, Handley Page disowned it, but it was rebuilt and flew for a time in 1910 as the Planes Limited Biplane. Design and development Despite the company type letter and its retrospective designation as the H.P.2, the Type B biplane was only partly Handley Page's work. It was conceived by W.P. Thompson of Freshfield, near Formby in Lancashire, who had registered ideas of aircraft control by variable wing area and centre of gravity movement and was keen to build an aircraft with \\"pendulum stability\\", i.e. with most of its mass mounted flexibly below the wings.Letter from W.P. Thompson Flight 25 February 1911 p.171 Apparently he originally thought in terms of a tailess machine. In 1909 he commissioned Handley Page to build a prototype. This was done at Barking with input from both Handley Page and Thompson's assistant Robert Fenwick. The Type B had a standard fabric-covered spruce frame. The wide gap biplane wings were of two-bay form though in the absence of a fuselage between the wings there were further interplane struts. Two tail booms, each based on a cross-braced pair of members joined to the upper and lower wings, supported a biplane tail. Between the tailplanes were a pair of linked rudders. The Type B had no fuselage: the 60 hp (45 kW) Green four-cylinder inline water-cooled engine was flexibly mounted below the lower wing and drove a pair of pusher propellers, mounted at lower wing level, via a pair of chains. The pilot sat ahead of the engine attached to it between a pair of mainwheels. A pair of small wingtip wheels was added for stability. The undercarriage collapsed on the first attempt at flight in late 1909 before the aircraft left the ground. During repairs, a storm caused more damage and Handley Page decided to have no more to do with what he considered a failure and nicknamed it \\"The Scrapheap\\". He did allow Fenwick, financed by Thompson to complete the repairs and modifications at Barking, including the addition of ailerons and the replacement of the chain-driven pair of propellers by a single direct-drive propeller. This work was completed by mid-1910 and Thomson had the machine transported to Freshville, where he had established an organisation named Planes Limited and had a flying field. On 29 November 1910 the Type B finally flew, performing well enough for Fenwick to be granted Royal Aero Club pilot's certificate. By this time it was known as the Planes Limited Biplane. It crashed a few days later in poor weather, but was rebuilt once more and flew from nearby Formby sands.

Harry Angping, the PSC Chairman, wants to send the country's athletes to China, world sports' superpower, to have an intensive training which can greatly boost the skills of the athletes especially in the sports of volleyball, diving, shooting, cycling and weightlifting. The country is looking after its gold and silver medallists at the latest SEAG which was held last 2007 although some of them have already retired. The country is said to have a powerhouse team in the sport of billiards and snooker which is composed of former and current world champions such as Efren Bata Reyes, Ronato Alcano, Alex Pagulayan and Rubilen Amit. The country is expecting to get a perfect 10 gold medal in the said sport because of its great athletes. Another powerhouse team in Philippine national team is swimming. It has been said that the swimming team is almost composed of its Olympian tankers like Miguel Molina, Ryan Arabejo, James Walsh, Daniel Coakley, Christel Simms and Erica Totten.  Expectations  The country hopes to rebound from its worst finish in SEAG last 2 years. The country placed sixth over-all with 42 golds, 91 silvers and 96 bronzes. The country is hoping to regain the over-all championship from Thailand even though it will really have a tough way. The country is still unsure of how many gold medals can the athletes garner since the number of athletes joining the international competition is still undetermined although some of the athletes such as Nathaniel Padilla, Shiela Mae Perez, Hidilyn Diaz, Rexel Ryan Fabriga, Willy Wang and Miguel Molina. The country will send its one of the lowest number of delegates which is 153 and officials which is 47 although this is not a final count according to POC. Although the number of athletes and officials to be sent in this SEAG edition is just 1/3 of the number of delegates sent in the 2007 SEAG, it is known that the Philippine team is still a powerhouse team because all of the included athletes in the list are gold and silver medalists in the 2007 SEAG and 2008 Beijing Olympians. The PSC promised to boost the earnings of the athletes who will get gold medals for the country at the upcoming SEAG. |}  Medals   Issues  Philippine NSA's still have leadership quarrels which greatly affect the training of its athletes even though there are only barely three months left before the national competition happens. Lack of government funding is also another factor why Philippine athletes have not yet been sent to other countries such as China to have an intensive training program. The country is focusing more on subjective sports such as boxing, judo, taekwondo, diving and karatedo than objective sports such as athletics, shooting, swimming, weightlifting, lawn tennis, table tennis and badminton which are really rich in medals. The country's athletes in the said subjective sports can easily be cheated since those sports are scored by judges.

It was the terminus of the Ross and Monmouth Railway which joined the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway just south of the station. History The station was opened on 1 June 1855 by the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway four years after line had received parliamentary consent to be constructed. On 29 July 1862 the line was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway and in 1869 the line was converted from broad gauge to standard gauge in a five-day period. In 1873 the Ross and Monmouth Railway to Monmouth via Lydbrook was opened and it terminated at the station. The station then passed on to the Western Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. A line from Ross-on-Wye to Tewkesbury was authorised by parliament in 1856 but was never built. The lines to Ross closed in stages. On the Ross and Monmouth Railway passenger services were withdrawn and the section from Lydbrook Junction to Monmouth Troy was closed on 5 January 1959. The remaining section remained open until 1 November 1965 for freight traffic only. The Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway closed to passengers on 2 November 1964 and the line south to the junction at Grange Court closed on 1 November 1965. The line going north to Rotherwas Junction and Hereford Station closed when passenger service were withdrawn in 1964.http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/post- medieval/railways/hrfd_ross_glouc.htm The brick built station building has been demolished and the site redeveloped into an industrial estate.http://www.ross-on- wye.com/index.php?page=ross_540-The_Railway_in_Ross&pg;=3 The brick goods and engine sheds still stand.

Mungello quotes sources for both 1585 and 1586 as Semedo's date of birth. \\\\- 18 July, 1658), was a Portuguese Jesuit priest and missionary in China. Life √Ålvaro Semedo was born in Nisa, Portugal in 1585 or 1586. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1602, and on 29 March 1608, he left for Goa and the Far East aboard Nossa Sra. do Vencimento. He arrived in Macau in 1610, and Nanjing in 1613. Along with another Jesuit, Alfonso Vagnoni, he was imprisoned during an anti-Christian campaign in Nanjing in 1616, and then sent back to Macau, where he stayed till 1621. As the persecution campaign in the mainland China abated, Fr. Semedo changed his Chinese name from Xie Wulu to Zeng Dezhao and re-entered China, now working in Jiangsu and Jiangnan provinces. He spent most of his term in China in the central and southern provinces; perhaps his only trip north was the one he made to Xi'an in 1625, during which he was the first European to see the recently unearthed Nestorian Stele. In 1636, Semedo went back to Europe as a procurator, sent by his Order to recruit people for the China mission and to ensure continued assistance from the church in Europe. During his sojourn in Europe, he wrote a long report on China, which was translated from Portuguese and published in Spanish, in 1642, under the title Imperio de la China. After his return to China, Semedo served in Guangzhou (Canton) as the Vice- Provincial of the Jesuit China Mission. During several years after the fall of Beijing to the Manchus in 1644, he continued to work with the Ming loyalist regimes in the Southern China (notably, sending Micha≈Ç Boym to the court of the Southern Ming Yongli Emperor),Mungello, p. 139 even as most Jesuits elsewhere in China were switching their loyalty to the recently established Qing Dynasty. Once the Qing took Canton, Semedo was detained, but was freed a few months later, reportedly due to the interference of Beijing-based Johann Adam Schall von Bell. He spent the rest of his life in Guangzhou, where he died. Works by √Ålvaro Semedo online * The history of that great and renowned monarchy of China.

He began his career as an actor at the Old Vic in his early 20s, excelling in the plays of William Shakespeare. During this time he also sang in the opera chorus. In 1923 he began to appear as a soloist with Lilian Baylis's opera company at the Old Vic; mostly in buffo roles. While there he met his future wife, operatic mezzo-soprano Edith Coates. The couple married in 1933 and often performed together.Lloyd, Powell biography at operissimo.com (in German) Lloyd remained with Baylis's company when they moved to the Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1931 and later became a producer and director for the company. Among the many roles he created on stage at Sadler's Wells were Bardolfo in Falstaff, Basilio in The Marriage of Figaro, Bobyl in The Snow Maiden, Goro in Madama Butterfly, Monostatos in The Magic Flute, Spoletta in Tosca, and Va≈°ek in The Bartered Bride. He also had two major successes at the Royal Opera, London: the witch in H√§nsel und Gretel (1934) and David in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg (1936) under conductor Thomas Beecham. The latter role was recorded on Columbia Records. Lloyd's career was put on hold while the London stages were closed during World War II. After the war he worked mainly as an opera director and producer. He worked for the Sadler's Wells Theatre, Theatre Scarborough, the Carl Rosa Opera Company, and the opera houses in Dublin and Johannesburg during the 1940s. In 1951, he directed Balfe's opera The Rose of Castille at the first Wexford Festival. In 1955 he joined the Welsh National Opera where he worked for a decade.

The station is currently owned by Paul Coates, through licensee Coates Consulting, LLC, and features programming from Citadel Broadcasting. Translator History KTLU was initially proposed by State Representative Emmett Holman Whitehead to serve as Rusk's lone radio facility. An application was filed with the Federal Communications Commission on July 13, 1955, seeking a construction permit to erect a Class D 500 watt daytime facility on 1580 kilocycles, from a transmission site at the Lion's Club Recreation Park, 1.1 miles ENE of the courthouse in Rusk, Texas. The construction permit was granted in September, with a minor change involved, moving the proposed transmission site from the park to 616 North Main St. in Rusk. KTLU was officially licensed for operation in December 2, 1955. E.H. & Marie Whitehead would utilize the print and broadcast media platforms they built to support causes benefitting Rusk and Cherokee County for the next 66 years. Together, they successfully defended the operations of the Rusk State Hospital when Austin auditors suggested closure in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, saving almost 1,000 jobs in the area. The Whiteheads would go on to add an FM broadcast facility to the E.H. Whitehead Enterprises portfolio, when 97.7 KWRW signed on in 1981. At its peak, Whitehead Enterprises owned the Rusk Cherokeean, the Alto Herald, radio stations KTLU and KWRW-FM, as well as E-Z Vision Cable Company. On January 15, 2009, the longtime KTLU format changed from oldies to classic hits, simulcasting the FM sister 97.7 KWRW as Classic Hits 97.7. After the death of E.H. Whitehead, the station's license was transferred to the Rusk Cherokeean newspaper and overseen by members of the Whitehead family. The beginning of big changes were on the horizon for the AM/FM pair in Rusk, Texas. On May 15, 2015, KTLU split from its simulcast with 97.7 KWRW, which had been sold to Paul Gleiser and physically moved out of Rusk to operate as the FM counterpart to 600 KTBB in Tyler, relocated to 97.5 FM and relicensed to Troup, Texas. KTLU itself rebranded as \\"Classic Hits 103.9\\", simulcasted on FM translator K280CL 103.9 FM. K280CL simultaneously moved from its original transmission facility in Palestine, Texas to Rusk, Texas effectively replacing the lost KWRW 97.7 allocation that had been licensed to Rusk since 1981. K280CL now operates from the current KTLU (and former KWRW) tower site. On July 15, 2017, KTLU changed their format from classic hits to classic rock. On September 14, 2017, after 62 years of continuous ownership and operation, the Whitehead family sold KTLU & K280CL to Paul Coates' Coates Consulting, LLC. The sale of both facilities was consummated on December 13, 2017. East Texas Results Media closed the offices in Jacksonville, and took all six stations licensed to them silent as of July 1, 2019. KZXM, KFRO-FM, KLJT, and KMPA have all since been sold to the Educational Radio Foundation of East Texas, owner and operator of Christian stations KVNE and KGLY. KTLU and KEBE were both silent, awaiting sale of the facilities to new ownership. Both facilities had until July 1, 2020 to return to broadcasting, or by law, the licenses for both would be revoked, and the facilities deleted. On June 18, 2020, sister station KEBE returned to broadcasting, along with its associated FM translator, airing a classic hits format under the \\"K-Hits\\" branding. KTLU and K280CL have also returned to the air utilizing the K-Hits branding and classic hits format, however, KEBE and KTLU are not simulcasting with each other.

He served two terms as head of the institution, in 1954‚Äì1960 and 1978‚Äì1983. Early life Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Spitzig left his home country in 1937 as he always wanted to be a missionary and was influence by the La Salle Brothers‚Äô commitment to education. He also admits to always dreaming of teaching in a foreign country. He was a student brother when he grabbed the opportunity when there was a call for volunteers to work in South-East Asia. As an Educator His first assignment was at Saint Joseph's Institution, Singapore in 1938 at the age of 19, before he was transferred to St. John's Institution, Kuala Lumpur (SJI) in 1941. Spitzig was teaching in SJI when the Japanese landed in Malaya during World War II. He was 20 years old then. He was arrested by the Japanese and was sent to Pudu Prison. Later he was transferred as a prisoner of war (PoW) to Changi Prison, Singapore from 1941 to 1943. According to Spitzig, Once World War II was over and SJI reopened, Spitzig immediately resumed teaching. In 1954, he was made principal of SJI. During this time, he went all out to champion education matters. In 1956, he renovated the school and added 14 classrooms at a cost of M$90,000. Spitzig also wrote the school's famous School Rally. It was also during his time that construction of the St John‚Äôs Primary School began on the site of the Old Boys‚Äô Club. The building could accommodate 24 classes and would cost M$220,000. The school was officially opened by Brother Fintan Blake on 16 September 1960. During the same year, the new chapel on the middle floor of SJI was officially opened and used on 19 October. At the end of 1960, he was transferred to St. Xavier's Institution, Penang, as principal. La Salle School, Petaling Jaya Spitzig founded La Salle School, Petaling Jaya and also eventually served as the principal of the secondary school from 1967 to 1975. On 2 April 1956, Spitzig, who was then Director of St. John‚Äôs took a historic step by applying for a piece of land in Petaling Jaya on which to erect a school run by Christian brothers. The vision at that time was to acquire a ten-acre site on which to erect a primary school, with a secondary school to follow later. As the population grew so did the pressure for places in existing schools, so on 15 July 1959, Spitzig made yet another request for permission to commence work on the construction of six classrooms (now known to all PJ Lasallians as the ‚ÄòOld Block‚Äô) to house primary classes which had launched La Salle PJ on the educational scene in January 1959. A new building completed in 2003 was to replace the Old Block. Second stint as Brother Director In 1978, Spitzig was transferred back to SJI as director and principal. During this time, he presided over the school's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. He also re-introduced the annual English and Bahasa Malaysia public speaking competition to the school. Public speaking became part of the English and Bahasa Malaysia curriculum and was compulsory for all students. Spitzig retired as Brother Director in 1983. Post-retirement Even after retiring as Brother Director of SJI, Spitzg continued his contributions in the education field. He has always said that his best time as an educator was in 1983, after retirement, when he became interested in schools in rural areas in Sabah. He had defied advice to visit the children who live deep inside the forest and was often driven there by volunteers in a special vehicle. According to Spitzig: Awards and recognition * Spitzig was conferred the Order of Canada, a coveted award, by the Governor-General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson in 2004 for his six decades of education service to the people of South-East Asia. * He was conferred a Datukship by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin in February 2009 for his many contributions to education in Malaysia. Death Prior to his death, Spitzig was a wheelchair user and spent his retirement in the Little Sisters of the Poor Home in Cheras. Spitzig died on 18 August 2009 at 4.44pm in Assunta Hospital. His wake was held in St. John's Institution, Kuala Lumpur on 19 August while his funeral mass was held in St. John's Cathedral, Kuala Lumpur the next day.Renowned missionary dies at age 91 References * Bro Spitzig‚Äôs commitment rewarded with awards, The Star, 19 February 2009. * An undying passion for education, The Star, 20 February 2009. * Renowned missionary dies at age 91, The Star, 19 August 2009.

The Project The scientific relevance of the project can be understood considering that cracking crosswords requires human-level knowledge. Unlike chess and related games and there is no closed world configuration space. A first nucleus of technology, such as search engines, information retrieval, and machine learning techniques enable computers to enfold with semantics real-life concepts. The project is based on a software system whose major assumption is to attack crosswords making use of the Web as its primary source of knowledge. WebCrow is very fast and often thrashes human challengers in competitions,G.Angelini, M. Ernandes, E. Di Iorio, \\"WebCrow: Previous competitions\\" especially on multi language crossword schemes. A distinct feature of the WebCrow software system is to combine properly natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the Google web search engine, and constraint satisfaction algorithms from artificial intelligence to acquire knowledge and to fill the schema. The most important component of WebCrow is the Web Search Module (WSM), which implements a domain specific web based question answering algorithm. The way WebCrow approaches crosswords solving is quite different with respect to humans:John S. Quarterman,\\"Google as AI\\" Whereas we tend to first answer clues we are sure of and then proceed filling the schema by exploiting the already answered clues as hints, WebCrow uses two clearly distinct stages. In the first one, it processes all the clues and tries to answer them all: For each clue it finds many possible candidates and sorts them according to complex ranking models mainly based on a probability criteria. In the second stage, WebCrow uses constraint satisfaction algorithms to fill the grid with the overall most likely combination of clue answers. In order to interact with Google, first of all, WebCrow needs to compose queries on the basis of the given clues. This is done by query expansion, whose purpose is to convert the clue into a query expressed by a simplified and more appropriate language for Google. The retrieved documents are parsed so as to extract a list of word candidates that are congruent with the crossword length constraints. Crosswords can hardly be faced by using encyclopedic knowledge only, since many clues are wordplays or are otherwise purposefully very ambiguous. This enigmatic component of crosswords is faced by a massive use of database of solved crosswords, and by automatic reasoning on a properly organized knowledge base of wired rules. Last but not the least, the final constraint satisfaction step is very effective to fill the correct candidate, even though, unlike humans, the system can not rely on very high confidence on the correctness of the answer. Competitions WebCrow speed and effectiveness Tom Simonite, \\"Crossword Software Thrashes Human Challengers\\", New Scientist has been tested many times in man-machine competitions on Italian, English and multi-language crosswords The outcome of the tests is that WebCrow can successfully compete with average human players on single language schemes and reaches expert level performance in multi-language crosswords.

Overview It begins in the south-eastern corner of the city centre, at the Trongate, where it is pedestrianised as far as Queen Street. This section forms the major shopping section of the road, including the St. Enoch Centre and the Argyll Arcade (a Victorian arcade principally containing jewellers). It passes underneath the expanse of railway lines at Glasgow Central Station (the so-called Hielanman's Umbrella) before becoming a major thoroughfare (A814) connecting the city centre to the M8 motorway and the Clydeside Expressway running alongside the River Clyde; however while traffic continues freely on the expressway, Argyle Street itself, which ran north-west through Anderston until the redevelopment of the area in the 1960s, now terminates as a through road after passing under the motorway at Anderston railway station, instead existing as an address in two unconnected sections. The route then joins St. Vincent Street at Finnieston/Sandyford and is revived as a major thoroughfare as it heads out towards the West End of the city. It connects with Sauchiehall Street at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, and the road itself ends just beyond the Kelvin Hall on a bridge over the River Kelvin, where it becomes Dumbarton Road entering Partick. coronavirus lockdown. 7 April 2020. History Kelvingrove Art Gallery as seen from Argyle Street in the West End of Glasgow. Originally known as Westergait, Argyle Street led west from Trongate to the city's West Port, the western gate out of the city's walls. It was renamed in honour of the Duke of Argyll, some time after the removal of the West Port in 1751, as a result of the expansion of the city westward. The old West Port Well stood at the beginning of the street. On both sides of the street stood courts where businesses operated: Sysdney Court, Morrison's Court, Moodies's Court, Wellington Court, Wilson's Court, Buchanan Court, Turner's Court and Pratt's Court. Major reconstruction of the area at the turn of the 1970s which saw the construction of the Glasgow Inner Ring Road, the demolition of Anderston Cross and its replacement with the Anderston Centre complex changed the line of Argyle Street, the eastern half now terminating underneath the Kingston Bridge approach viaduct whilst the main vehicle route over the motorway runs along St. Vincent Street, leaving a 250-metre stretch of the western half of road in Anderston isolated as a cul de sac.

They shortened the name and released a self-titled extended play on Rubber Records in 1992. After a year Douglas Lee Robertson had replaced Arch on bass guitar. In 1997 Marcus Goodwin replaced Dom on lead guitar and their second album, Memory Lane Traffic Jam was released in the United States (US) on Not Lame Recordings; it was acclaimed by AllMusic reviewer, Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"immediately catchy, but [the songs] grow stronger upon each listen ‚Äì a hallmark of a truly fine pop album.\\" They were twice nominated for an Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Award, for 'Best Adult Contemporary Album' in 2000 for their third album, Sweeter Than the Radio and 'Best Independent Release' in 2002 for \\"Rain, Hail, Shine\\" from their next album, Broken UFO. While on hiatus, Jenkins pursued his solo career before briefly reuniting the band which released another album, The Good China, in 2007. Jenkins then issued his third solo album in 2008, while other band members became involved in separate projects. History Charles Jenkins had been a solo artist in Adelaide where, as Chuck Skatt, he formed The Mad Turks from Istanbul as their vocalist in 1984 with Dominic Larizza (as Dom Benedictine III) on drums and later on guitar, Martyn Christopher on bass guitar and Matthias Eckhardt on guitar. The band relocated to Melbourne by 1989, renamed as The Mad Turks after Eckhardt left, Jenkins took up rhythm guitar, and they disbanded there in 1991. Jenkins and Larizza recruited his brother Arturo \\"Arch\\" Larizza (ex-The Saints) on bass guitar and Derek Smiley on drums to form Chuck Skatt and His Icecream Hands in 1992. The name was shortened to Icecream Hands which Jenkins took from the lyrics of a 1984 Robyn Hitchcock song \\"Flavour of Night\\" (from I Often Dream of Trains) and is an English term for masturbation. Their debut release, Ice Cream Hands was a six-track Extended play (EP) on independent label Rubber Records and distributed by Shock Records. In 1993 they released a full-length album, Travelling... Made Easy, and Douglas Robertson replaced Arch Larizza on bass guitar‚ÄîArch re-united with Chris Bailey (ex-The Saints) in Bailey's backing band. Travelling... Made Easy was released in Europe in 1995 on Blue Rose Records with four additional tracks and was described as \\"quite an accomplished and ambitious effort\\". In Australia they released their second EP, Supermarket Scene in 1994 followed by two more EPs Olive (November 1995) and Here We Go 'Round Now (July 1997). On 11 June 1997 the band performed on the RMITV show Under Melbourne Tonight. Marcus Goodwin (ex-Yolk) had replaced Dom Larizza on lead guitar by August 1997 and they released their second full-length album, Memory Lane Traffic Jam. By then Rubber Records was being distributed by BMG and the album was released in the United States on Not Lame Recordings. Three bonus tracks were added to the US release, which was acclaimed by AllMusic reviewer, Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"immediately catchy, but [the songs] grow stronger upon each listen -- a hallmark of a truly fine pop album\\". Sweeter Than the Radio, co-produced by Icecream Hands and Wayne Connolly, was released in 1999. One of the singles, \\"Nipple\\" was written by Jenkins about an early girlfriend who attracted his attention at a bus stop. With a lack of commercial success they nevertheless achieved critical acclaim when the album was nominated for an ARIA Music Award, for 'Best Adult Contemporary Album' in 2000. Their next album, Broken UFO, produced by Shane O'Mara and East Van Parks, contained the track, \\"Rain, Hail, Shine\\" which was nominated as 'Best Independent Release' at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002. Rubber Records released a 2√ó CD greatest hits collection, You Can Ride My Bike: The Best of the Icecream Hands in 2004. While on hiatus, Jenkins pursued his solo career to release two albums, Bungalow (2004) and The City Gates (2005) on Parole Records. Icecream Hands briefly reunited for The Good China, issued in 2007 on the independent label Dust Devil Music. Jenkins returned to his solo work and released Blue Atlas on Dust Devil Music in 2008. Robertson (as \\"Doug Root\\") joined Melbourne-based alternative rock group Root! in 2008, he had guested on their debut album, Root! (2007). They released a second album, Get Up Yourself in 2009.

He is a member of Icecream Hands, has released eight solo albums and is a member of Charles Jenkins and the Zhivagos.Courier Mail 29 October 2008 Charles Jenkins delves into movies to sing the blues by Noel Mengel Early life Following his birth in Mildura, Victoria, Jenkins moved to Adelaide, South Australia. Music Jenkins started as a solo performer and later joined the band The Mad Turks From Istanbul. In 1989, Jenkins relocated to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia with the band, but the Mad Turks disbanded soon after the move and Jenkins formed a new band called 'Icecream Hands'. The band formed in 1992 and was originally named 'Chuck Skatt and His Icecream Hands'. Jenkins revealed in 2007 that the first of the five albums that Icecream Hands recorded, Travelling... Made Easy , sold poorly and he attributed this to \\"too many chords and too many words\\". Icecream Hands functioned as a band for 16 years and Jenkins has stated that becoming a father significantly affected the manner in which he wrote songs for the quartet, as he was forced to exercise a greater degree of self-restraint: \\"I'm very fond of that album (Memory Lane Traffic Jam) because of the heartache that went into it. It was a real struggle.\\" The band's third album Sweeter than the Radio was released in 1999 and the independent label they were signed to had secured an arrangement with major label Bertelsmann Music Group, otherwise known as BMG. Up until that point, the band had never received the backing of a corporate music company and subsequently released five songs from their BMG-backed work, followed by constant touring. Jenkins explained afterwards: \\"I never saw (the lack of chart success) as a missed opportunity. I thought we were lucky just to have a major label.\\" By the time the third album Sweeter Than The Radio was released, again through independent Melbourne, Australian label Rubber Records, but BMG was no longer involved and Jenkins spoke of \\"one girl in Melbourne\\" handling duties by that stage. Prior to the band's fifth and final album, a 'best of' compilation, titled The Best of the Ice Cream Hands - You Can Ride My Bike was released by Rubber Records on the first day of 2004. Containing 43 songs, the live performance that coincided with the release of the compilation was described by an Australian music journalist as \\"strong, poetic songs filled the show with moments of sweet sonic purity. Melbourne is lucky to have them [Icecream Hands].\\" During periods of inactivity by the members of Icecream Hands, Jenkins recorded three solo albums, including Bungalow from 2004. As a solo artist, Jenkins released a total of four studio albums between 2004 and 2010, and 2010's Blue Atlas, released on Dust Devil Music, introduced the public to a new band called the Zhivagos. Writing for website Mess + Noise, JP Hammond concluded that \\"There's no better soundtrack of hope [Blue Atlas] to close 2008.\\" Charles Jenkins and the Zhivagos have released three studio albums as of January 2014: Walk This Ocean (2010), Love Your Crooked Neighbour with Your Crooked Heart (2012) and Blue Atlas (2010). Released on Silver Stamp Records, Love Your Crooked Neighbour with Your Crooked Heart received a 4-star rating from music journalist Iain Shedden, who, writing for The Age newspaper, stated: > There's a smattering of gospel-tinged singalong, exquisitely crafted > balladry and melodic invention in the mix as well, all matched by a sharp > tongue and an ear for a killer hook. Jenkins received a grant from the Australia Council in 2013 to record an album centred upon the theme of water. Along with band members Dave Mine, Davey Lane, Art Starr and Matty Vehl, Jenkins created Too Much Water in the Boat that consists of songs such as \\"Sweet Mildura\\", \\"Seven Creeks (the cross dresser Steve Hart)\\" and \\"The Barrel Song\\". On 3 January 2014, Jenkins's band previewed the album on \\"The Inner Sleeve\\", Paul Gough's program on the ABC's Radio National network. Gough described Jenkins's work as \\"wry, insightful pop songs that have more to say than most\\". Too Much Water in the Boat was produced and engineered by Justin Rudge, and features backing harmonies from ex-Icecream Hands member Douglas Lee Robertson, described by Jenkins as \\"extraordinary\\".

Brooks and illustrated by Kurt Wiese. When an airplane from a secret airstrip terrorizes the performances of his friend Mr. Boomschmidt's circus, Freddy learns to fly, then gets a plane to track the criminals and stop their activities. Plot summary Freddy is convincing Sniffy the skunk to read Robin Hood when Mr. Boomschmidt arrives at the Bean farm with Boomschmidt's Stupendous and Unexcelled Circus (formerly Boomschmidt's Colossal and Unparalleled Circus). He has a \\"snorter\\" of a dilemma, as he puts it. Mr. Boom invites the Bean animals to his small circus to observe. The show is interrupted by Mr. Condiment's lawyer, who claims that performer Mademoiselle Rose is endangered by the circus animals. The Bean farm animals easily put the lie to that, but the show is interrupted again by a plane bombing with sacks of flour. The performance is ruined. Finally the truth comes from Mr. Boom who \\"pretended to be a lot more simple-minded than he was so as to mix people up\\": Condiment is behind the disruptions: forcing Rose to marry him. Freddy decides to learn to fly, and to chase the bomber. The flying instructor says he will be chasing a World War II fighter ‚Äî faster than any plane Freddy can acquire. At any rate, Mr. Bean is so proud of Freddy he buys him a plane and turns Bean farmland into an airstrip. Reading of Freddy's feat in the newspapers attracts inventor Uncle Ben to the farm to perfect his bombsite, but the device cannot be perfected before generals come to evaluate it. They leave, unsatisfied. In disguise as a woman, Freddy investigates Condiment. Condiment is pressuring the bookstore owner into carrying his comics, including Lorna, the Leopard Woman, In the Lair of the Great Serpent. The circus boa constrictor sneaks up on Condiment as a prank, suggesting, \\"Want a little hug?\\" He flees in terror, giving Freddy the idea to pose as Lorna. Using a phony Spanish accent, he visits Condiment, letting drop that he is the Leopard Woman. Uncle Ben considers undermining enemies by selling them his defective bombsite, until Freddy discovers by accident that it is good at finding lost change. (This eventually proves to be more interesting to the generals.) Freddy's is plane now freed from bombsite testing, he takes it up for a ride. He arrives at the circus in time to spot the mysterious plane. He gives chase, but is outdistanced. Back in his Leopard Woman disguise, Freddy lures Condiment into a dark circus trailer. He claims Condiment promised to marry him, and is enraged. The lights go off, and Freddy substitutes a live leopard for himself. When Condiment revives from fainting, Freddy is back, with Rose at his side. Condiment is convinced Freddy is the Leopard Woman, and cancels the comic. Freddy hopes Condiment is sufficiently frightened to leave Rose alone. For days, unseen, Freddy follows the mysterious plane, starting closer to its destination each time, and finally locating its secret airfield. He returns to discover the skunks have taken Robin Hood to heart, and sporting quarterstaffs and bows. This gives Freddy the notion to use them as spies, parachuted by umbrella onto the distant airfield. The pig encourages the unenthusiastic skunks appropriately: :\\"'Why, how now, lads?' he said. 'Ye tell me ye be bound for a life of adventure in the merry greenwood, and yet methinks ye hang back when ‚Äòtis question of trading hard knocks with a stout foe.'\\" (p. 131) They protest they are not cowards like rabbits ‚Äî which is overheard by one of the \\"Horrible Ten\\" gang of rabbits. This leads to two fracases, but the rabbits are appeased when allowed to join the mission. The team is successfully dropped on the airfield. After a couple days they tire of spying, and determine to destroy the plane. Without resources, they steal gunpowder from the criminals in a house by the airfield, and are highly pleased when they succeed in destroying it. Unaware, Freddy lands, and is discovered by Condiment not only to be a pig, but also the Leopard Woman. He is taken prisoner, but is soon freed by the skunks and rabbits. They easily convince Condiment he is about to be roasted and eaten for ‚ÄúPeople who read comics will believe almost anything‚Äù. Condiment is tied up, but later escapes, so the confrontation continues, until the gang escapes. Freddy's detective partner, Mrs. Wiggins the cow, arrives in disguise, fooling him, and giving her the opportunity to say, \\"I know you! You‚Äôre the fat, lazy good-for-nothing pig that lives on poor old Mr. Bean.\\" She disguises herself as the Demon Woman of Grisly Gulch ‚Äî another character in Condiment's comic books. Completely cowed, as it were, Condiment is forced to write a confession of his crimes. Back at the circus, Rose cries when she reads it. In the moment of emotion, Condiment realizes he has a bargaining chip: in exchange for dropping charges, he informs Mr. Boom that Rose wants to marry him. There is a wedding the next day, and for the first time since Freddy has known him, Mr. Boom mixes himself up. Illustrations There are 36 black and white, pen and ink drawings by Wiese, endpapers, and a full color cover, both depicting scenes from the book. Each chapter starts with a half page illustration, while a full page illustration is placed close to an event within each chapter. There is an additional half page map of the secret airfield layout. The cover shows a P-39 Airacobra. However, as seen in the illustrations for chapters 9 and 17 and the endpapers, this is not Freddy's plane, but the one used by his adversaries. This is artistic license, as the P-39 was a famous WWII fighter, and well known to English speaking readers.

The Edicts of Ashoka were either carved on in-situ rocks or engraved on pillars erected throughout the empire; examples of both are found in Delhi. The first in-situ rock edict was discovered in Delhi in 1966, and establishes the city's ancient historical link with the Ashokan era (273‚Äì236 BC).Sharma, pp. 1, 10‚Äì11 A glorious chapter to Delhi‚Äôs history was added as recently as 1966 with the discovery of an inscription by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, engraved on a rugged rock, an outcrop of the Arvallis, near Srinivaspuri, west of Kalkaji temple‚Ä¶ Direct association of emperor Ashoka (273‚Äì236 BC.) of the Maurya Dynasty with Delhi has been brought to light only recently by the discovery of a shorter version of his Minor Rock Edicts carved on a rock near Srinivaspuri. This discovery also indicates that Delhi lay on the trunk route connecting the main cities of ancient IndiaPeck, p.26. The city is situated where a spur of the Aravalli Hills meets the Yamuna River, and these outcrops were the sites of some early settlements ... Before the 3rd century BC, India was controlled by numerous competing chiefs and kings, and during this time urban centres of some size developed. One of these became the base of powerful Mauryan Empire, created by Chandra Gupta Maurya and consolidated by his grandson Ashoka (reigned 272‚Äì232 BC). Ashoka ruled from Pataliputra, modern Patna, but held sway over most of the Indian subcontinent. He aimed at government in a very real sense, controlling the affairs, or at least exhorting a certain way of life, through his famous edicts‚Ä¶ However, the most exciting Mauryan discovery, made in 1966 was of an Ashokan Rock Edict found at Kalkaji (East of Kailash), in South Delhi, indicating that there must have been a reasonably important settlement nearby. Delhi's stone pillar edicts were transported from their original sites in Meerut and Ambala during the reign of Firuz Shah Tughlaq (1351‚Äì1388 AD). They were erected in Feruzabad, the fourth medieval city of Delhi, established by Feroz Shah Tughlaq.Sharma, pp.1,10‚Äì11Peck, p.28.The remains of an inscription, on a smooth rock face projecting from the top of a rocky hillock, can be seen under an ugly concrete shelter in a small neighbourhood park in East of Kailash, nor far from the ISKCON temple on the Raja Dhirsain Marg it was discovered in 1966 and is an important part of Delhi‚Äôs history and heritage, because it implies that somewhere nearby was a settlement important enough in the 3rd century BC for an edict to have been carved. Among the cluster of religious institutions on the nearby hilltops, the Kalkaji Temple is said to be of great antiquity, and might have had a settlement around it. The inscriptions are written in Prakrit, a colloquial language used in everyday speech. The edicts were intended to teach the people of the morals and ideals of civilised living, to bring peace and harmony to the vast empire. The philosophy bears a striking resemblance to the teachings of the Buddha, which his followers believe lead to enlightenment (the universal law of nature), and the constituent elements of the world as it is experienced (the characteristic of elements).Peck, p.28 History Until the 3rd century BC, a large region of the Indian subcontinent was ruled by Chandragupta Maurya (322‚Äì298 BC), founder of Mauryan Empire. He was the grandfather of Ashoka. Ashoka's father Bindusara ruled from 297‚Äì272 BC. Ashoka, known as Ashoka the Great, after he took over reigns of the Mauryan Empire from his father then expanded and consolidated his grandfather's region into a much larger empire with command over large swathes of the Indian subcontinent and with his capital at Pataliputra, the present day Patna in Bihar.Peck, pp.26‚Äì28 Ashoka ruled for three decades. During his reign, he underwent a dramatic change in his life-style after winning the Kalinga War of 261 BC, at the cost of immense loss of life. As one of his edict inscriptions states: \\"150,000 people were forcibly abducted from their homes, 100,000 were killed in battle, and many more died later on\\". This event had a profound impact upon him. He was repentant. He then decided to renounce further warfare. He then converted to Buddhist religion, as the ethos of Buddhism (teachings of Buddha, an awakened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end suffering (or dukkha), achieve nirvana, and escape what is seen as a cycle of suffering and rebirth} appealed to him. His 13th edict is a form of self indictment: \\"Even a hundredth or a thousandth part only of the people who were slain, or killed or abducted in Kalinga is now considered as a grievous loss by Devanmpiya, beloved of the Gods, i.e., Ashoka\\". He avowed that his future actions would entirely be on spiritual lines and devoted to the spread of the doctrine of the right conduct. Two years after the Kalinga war, as a primary member of the Buddhist faith, for 265 days, he undertook a nationwide pilgrimage of holy places of Buddhist religion. On his return to Pataliputra, his capital, in 258 BC, after a grand celebration, he launched his missionary campaign throughout his empire and even spread to South India and Sri Lanka. Ashoka's son Mahindra was involved in this mission. In 257 BC, he got the first four of his 14 rock edicts inscribed in different parts of his empire. Out of the fourteen rock edicts, one rock edict has been discovered in Delhi, though not in a complete form. While edicts inscribed on rocks were found in many parts of the world, erection of carved pillars was unique to Ashokan times, totally independent of any other structures.\\"Bhandarkar pp.205‚Äì206\\">Bhandarkar pp.205‚Äì206 Edicts Replica of Ashoka's Major Rock Edict at Girnar, Gujarat, displayed at the entrance to the National Museum, Delhi Ashokan edicts are significant for the message they convey on the teachings of Buddhism. They have been found across his empire, written in several languages and scripts, but most of those found in India are written in Prakrit, using the Brahmi script. To spread the message in the north-western of the empire, edicts were written in Kharoshti script. Bilingual and bi-scriptural edicts have also been discovered in Kandahar and Afghanistan, written in Greek and Aramaic. Ashokan edicts written on rocks or pillars are considered unique and permanent as compared to the palm leaf or bark writings (perishable materials) of the past during the Harappan civilization, or even early Mauryan Empire edicts. The Brahmi script was not deciphered until 1837, by James Prinsep, an Indian antiquarian. The edicts of Ashoka deal with codes of conduct in respect of moral and religious views, as his personal messages. The edicts are of two types: the in-situ rock edicts and the pillar edicts, both of which are found in Delhi. The rock edicts are further subdivided into two categories, the \\"major rock edicts\\" and the \\"minor rock edicts\\", based on their age. Minor rock edits are the earliest, followed by major rock edicts, and then the pillar edicts. Major rock edicts have been discovered across India, with 14 personal declarations by Ashoka. Two have been moved to Delhi from their original locations. The minor edicts, which predate the major edicts, have been discovered at 17 locations in different regions of the country. Ten of them are categorized as \\"minor rock edict I\\" that proclaim Ashoka's religious commitments and urge people to adopt this path. The last seven edicts, include the category of \\"minor rock edict II\\" that urges people to be obedient and respectful to parents, elders and teachers. The last seven rock edict include the Delhi edict (found in 1966) that is categorized as minor rock edict I. One particular minor rock edict that is housed in Asiatic Society, Calcutta is a dictum to the Buddhists urging them to read the seven scriptural texts. The six basic pillar edicts, which are carved on sandstone, deal mainly with the spread of moral values; Ashoka's Dhamma cover topics such as kindness, forbearance, and concern for the welfare of his people. These edicts are fairly uniform in their language and text, unlike the rock edicts, but the Delhi-Topra pillar has a long additional message. It abridges and reaffirms the content of other pillars, and to some degree those of the Major Rock Edicts also. Rock edict in Delhi A rare Ashokan rock edict of the 3rd century BC. found in Delhi enclosed in a crude concrete shed during the 20th century Ashokan edict details on in-situ rock surface in Delhi, but fading The in-situ Bahapur rock edict () was discovered in Delhi in an engraved form on a small patch of rock exposure in Srinivaspuri, one kilometer north of Kalkaji temple, close to Bahapur village in South Delhi. The edict categorized as a \\"Minor edict\\" written in Brahmi script was a first person message of Ashoka, which exhorts people to follow the Buddhist way of life. It is inscribed on a rock surface with irregular lines and letter size with a number of lines not clearly decipherable. The edict translated into English reads: The rock edict epigraph was discovered on an inclined rock face by a building contractor operating at the site for building a residential colony. Archaeologists immediately examined it on 26 March 1966 and identified it as representing the Minor Rock Edict I of the Ashokan period in the light of its similarity with edicts in 13 other places in different parts of India, such as Barat in Jaipur division (to which Delhi rock edict has close resemblance) and the two pillars in Delhi. The Delhi edict was recorded as the 14th epigraphic version. The inscription covers an area of size length and height of the rock face. There are ten lines of writing of varying length written in Prakrit language in early Brahmi script and lacks uniformity of the aksharas (letters). One interpretation for the rock edict at Bahapur in Delhi is that it represents the trans-regional trade route of North India as an ancient trade link between the Gangetic Delta and the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. The second view is that it marks the site of a temple since it has been found at the base of a rock exposure near the present day Kalkaji temple. It is claimed that at Kalkaji, where the new Kalka Mandir (temple) exists now, was the old location of a temple (one of the five temples in Delhi) built by Pandavas, heroes of the epic Mahabharata period.

They were chiseled at the quarry and then transported to various places in the country. They were chiseled from massive rock blocks of square and long, which were extracted from the quarry. They were chiseled as monolith pillars of size between and in length with an average diameter of .Bhandarkar p.206 The pillars were cut, dressed, finely polished into circular columns, and carved with edicts, before being transported to various locations in the country. Two were transferred to Delhi in the 14th century by Feroz Shah Tughlaq.Bhandarkar pp. 206‚Äì207 The two pillar edicts are still in Delhi. The one on the Delhi ridge opposite the entrance of Bara Hindu Rao Hospital, close to the Delhi University campus, is popularly known as the Delhi-Meerut Pillar. The other, in the grounds of Feroz Shah Kotla, is known as the Delhi-Topra Pillar. Feroz Shah Tughlaq, who ruled from Delhi as Sultan during the medieval period between 1351 and 1388, was a keen historian, architect, game hunter, and with deep sense of commitment to build public utilities related to irrigation works and establishing urban towns. Feroz Shah, during one of his campaigns, was enthralled by the two spectacular monoliths ‚Äì inscribed Ashokan pillars he saw, one at Topra near Ambala and the other near Meerut, till then undeciphered ‚Äì and decided to shift them to his palatial Feruzabad palace in Delhi as \\"totemic embellishments\\". He shifted the pillars from these places and got them erected in Delhi; the former in his new capital and the latter on the ridge, near Pir-Ghaib, his hunting palace. The first pillar was erected in the 1350s, next to the Friday mosque in the new city of Feruzabad.).Sharma, pp. 1, 10‚Äì11Flood p. 248 Near the gate of the building that holds the Ashokan pillar, every Thursday afternoon is a kind of djinns date, as a large number of people visit the place to either mollify or revere the djinns or genies (said to be a pre-Islamic belief) that are believed to prowl there.Peck p. 82 Delhi-Meerut pillar A portion of the Meerut pillar, with a segment of the Edicts of Ashoka, now in the British Museum. The Delhi-Meerut pillar (), was shifted from Meerut, in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi by Feruz Shah and erected at a location in the northern ridge of Delhi, close to his hunting palace, between the Chauburji-Masjid and Hindu Rao Hospital. It was an elaborately planned transportation, from its original location, using a 42-wheeled cart to bring it up to the Yamuna river bank and then further transporting it by the Yamuna river route using barges. As seen now, it is of height but the pillar was damaged in an explosion during the rule of Farrukshiar (1713‚Äì19). The five broken pieces were initially shifted to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta and later brought back in 1866 and re-erected in 1887. In the early 17th century, William Finch, a historian chronicler, observed that the pillar had \\"a globe and half moon at top and diverse inscription upon it\\".Sharma pp.136‚Äì137Peck p. 91 File:Asokan Pillar.JPG|Delhi-Meerut pillar File:Delhi- Meerut pillar inscription.jpg|Delhi-Meerut pillar inscription File:Ashoka pillar delhi4.png|Transcription Delhi-Topra pillar Ashokan Pillar at the ruined palace in Feroz Shah Kotla, shifted from Topra village in Yamunanagar district, Haryana to Delhi, called the Delhi-Topra pillar. The Topra Ashokan Pillar (), moved from Topra Kalan in Yamunanagar district of Haryana, was erected above the palace building at Feroz Shah Kotla is high (with one metre below the platform) and made of sandstone. It is finished very well vis-√†-vis the second pillar located in Delhi at the ridge. The inscription in Brahmi script, which was deciphered by James Princep, a renowned scholar in Indian antiquarian studies in 1837, conveys the same message as the other Ashokan Pillars erected such as \\"code of dharma:virtue, social cohesion and piety\\" but with one difference that on this pillar there is also a reference to issues related to taxation. The building that houses the pillar is a three-storied structure built in rubble masonry. It has a large number of small domed rooms in the first and second floors, with links to the roof. Rooms on each floor have arched entrances, which are now stated to be used for pujas (worship). It is a pyramidal shaped structure with reducing size at each level with the pillar installed on the terrace of the building. It is conjectured that originally the pillar had a lion capital (similar to the Ashoka Emblem), which is the National Emblem of India. Feroz Shah is said to have embellished the top of the pillar with frescoes in black and white stone topped with a gilded copper cupola. But at present, what is visible is the smooth polished surface of the pillar, and an elephant carving added much later.Sharma p.131Peck p.85 It has also been noted that this pillar, apart from the Ashokan edict, has another set of text inscribed in Sanskrit \\"below and around Ashokan edict\\", in nagari script. This inscription records: \\"the conquests of Visala Deva Vigraharaja IV of the Chauhan dynasty, which was still ruling over Delhi at the time of Ghurid conquests in the 1190s, and his victories over a Mlechha (presumably \\"Ghaznavid or Gharid\\"). With this finding, it has been inferred that Visala Deva reused this pillar to record his triumphs in wars.Flood pp.249‚Äì250 File:Delhi-Topra Ashoka pillar.jpg|Delhi-Topra Ashoka pillar File:Ashoka Pillar at Feroze Shah Kotla, Delhi 05.JPG|Inscriptions (Brahmi on top, Devanagari below) File:Ashoka pillar delhi1.png|Transcription Transportation techniques Transportation of the Topra pillar to Delhi. Sirat i-Firuz Shahi, 14th century illustration. The transportation of the massive pillars to Delhi, planned under the direction of Sultan Feruz Shah, was documented by contemporary historian Shams-i- Siraj.Bhandarkar pp. 207‚Äì209 The truncated pillar now at the ruined palace of Feruz Shah came from Khizrabad, in the upstream reaches of the Yamuna River, about from Delhi. The transportation of the pillar was highly demanding, requiring soldiers (both cavalry and foot) to pitch in with all tools and tackles to transport it to Delhi. Silk cotton from the Silk cotton tree, the simal, was gathered in large quantities to surround the pillar before it was lowered horizontally to the ground. The covering was then removed, and replaced by reeds and raw hide to protect the pillar. A 42-wheeled cart was used to transport it to the river bank, where it was loaded onto a large boat. The cart required 8,400 men to move it, 200 to each wheel. A purpose-built palatial building was constructed out of stone and lime mortar to house the pillar. The square base stone was placed at the base of the pillar before the task was completed. The building is now in a ruined state, but the pillar still stands as it was erected.

Born a Yorkshireman, well-educated, he emigrated with his new wife, Emma, to New Zealand in 1856 aged 34 and they took full part in the development of the new colony's important institutions. Early life Andrew was born at Whitby, North Yorkshire, England. His parents were James Andrew, an Anglican clergyman, and Jane Chapman, of the Chapman banking family (grand daughter of John Chapman - Simpson, Chapman and Co.). He obtained a scholarship to University College, Oxford and graduated BA and MA in 1844 and 1847, respectively. In 1848, he was ordained priest. He had become a fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, and vicar of St Michael at the North Gate at the comparatively young age of mid 20s. On 6 December 1855, Andrew married Emma Fendall, youngest daughter of Henry Fendall, vicar of Crambe. and of the Fendall banking family (grand daughter of William Fendall, Old Bank). The marriage broke the tradition of celibacy for Fellows of Lincoln College, so Andrew had to resign. The couple emigrated to New Zealand, arriving at Lyttelton on the Westminster on 7 June 1856. Other Fendalls went to New Zealand before them, and the Christchurch suburb of Fendalton is named after the original landholding of her brother Walpole. Oxford University Andrew was preceded at Oxford University by his elder brother William who won a fellowship at Worcester College and was followed by his younger brother James who distinguished himself in the classics. In later life James became a well known surgeon at St Bartholemew's and a noted medical author, he was subsequently elected a fellow of Wadham College. Member of Parliament He was on the Wellington Provincial Council, representing the Wairarapa East electorate from 1867 to 1876. He represented the Wairarapa electorate from 1871 to 1877, when he resigned. As a parliamentarian he was a strong advocate of enfranchising the right for women to vote and active on educational issues. Educationalist He was also an educationalist; an Anglican priest he was known as \\"Parson Andrew\\" in Nelson, New Zealand where he was head of Nelson College, and he was a supporter of the new University of New Zealand. Andrew's role within the University of New Zealand was a supporter of its inception as a member of the house of representatives advocating a federal university structure for New Zealand. He was appointed to The University of New Zealand senate in 1874 and then appointed as Vice Chancellor of The University of New Zealand in 1885, he maintained the position of Vice Chancellor until 1903. Andrew oversaw the founding and establishment of Victoria University College (now Victoria University of Wellington) as Victoria University's founding Vice Chancellor and was a vocal advocate for a University of New Zealand college being established in Wellington, as Wellington was the capital of New Zealand. Andrew received three honorary degrees, one from the University of New Zealand, one from the University of Melbourne and one from the University of Sydney. He later returned to Oxford University and had his Robes returned as the policies on marriage of the Oxford Dons had changed and he had also been widely recognised as the Vice Chancellor of The University of New Zealand. He described his return and restoration of his Oxford robes as the most satisfying moment of his life. Ica Station Andrew purchased a pastoral farming estate in the Wairarapa on the north bank of the Whareama river near Tinui and Castlepoint which he built up until in 1889 he was taxed on 18,170 acres. The bales of wool it produced were shipped from Castlepoint to London with his initials as their identifying mark. As a scholar of ancient Greek literature and Oxford University lecturer in ancient Greek and named John (Ioannis) it was his habit to write his initials I.C.A. and Ica (eye-car) soon came to be the recognised name of his station.

Originally published by Catalyst Game Labs, Eclipse Phase is now published by the game's creators, Posthuman Studios, and is released under a Creative Commons license. Setting Eclipse Phase is a post-apocalyptic game of conspiracy and horror. It takes place after a World War III project to create artificial intelligence known as TITANs has gone rogue, resulting in the deaths of over 90% of the inhabitants of Earth. Earth is subsequently abandoned, and existing colonies throughout the Solar System are expanded to accommodate the refugees. The setting explores a spectrum of socioeconomic systems in each of these colonies: *A capitalist / republican system exists in the Inner System (Mars, the Moon, and Mercury), under the Planetary Consortium, a corporate body which allows the election of representatives but whose shareholders are nominally most powerful. *An Extropian/Propertarian system is established in the Asteroid Belt. The Extropians are split into two subfactions, an anarcho-capitalist group, more closely related to the Hypercapitalists and a mutualist group, related closely to the Anarchists. *A military oligarchy rules the moons around Jupiter. *An alliance of Scandinavia-style social democracy and Collectivist anarchism are dominant in the Outer System. From there, the setting explores various scientific advances, extrapolated far into the future. Nanotechnology, terraforming, Zero-G living, upgrading animal sapience, and reputation systems are all used as plot points and background. With all of this, the game encourages players to confront existential threats like aliens, weapons of mass destruction, Exsurgent Virus outbreaks, and political unrest. Mechanics Eclipse Phase uses a simple roll-under percentile die system for task resolution. Players roll the percentile dice (by rolling two ten-sided dice with one of the dice representing a 10 value), and compare that roll to a target number with the goal being to match or go under that number with the roll. Unlike most similar systems, a roll of 00 does not count as a 100. In addition, any roll of a double (11, 22, 33 etc.) is a critical. If the double is under the target number it is a critical success, while being over the target number constitutes a critical failure. For damage resolution (whether physical damage caused by injury or mental stress caused by traumatic events), players roll a designated number of ten-sided dice and add the values together, along with any modifiers.

In the fifties the MPA became involved in the introduction of the Ivor Novello Awards in 1956. A few years earlier in 1951 the MPA became a founder member of the British Joint Copyright Council (which would later become the British Copyright Council in 1965). In 1976 the association acquired ownership of the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society (MCPS). The MPA was a founder member of British Music Rights (formed in 1996) together with the British Academy of Composers, Songwriters and Authors (BASCA), the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society and the Performing Right Society. In 2008 British Music Rights grew into an expanded body called UK Music.http://www.mpaonline.org.uk/History-of-Music-Publishing In October 2015 Jane Dyball was named CEO of MPA Group of Companies bringing together the MPA, Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society (MCPS), Independent Music Publishers e-Licensing (IMPEL) and Printed Music Licensing Limited (PMLL) under one umbrella.http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/jane-dyball-named-permanent- ceo-of-mpa-group-of-companies/ In 2018 IMPEL became a standalone entity to focus on its independent members' interests. MPA Group The MPA currently owns and operates two commercial businesses: * Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society ‚Äì MCPS is the UK collection society that licenses mechanical (or reproduction) copyrights on behalf of over 26,000 music publisher and composer members. * Printed Music Licensing Ltd ‚Äì PMLL represents music publishers to allow UK schools to make copies of printed music. Conduct International Music Score Library Project In April 2011, the MPA issued a DMCA takedown notice against the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP), a publisher of public domain sheet music. Go Daddy, the domain name registrar for the IMSLP, removed the domain name \\"imslp.org\\", leaving it inaccessible. The MPA's argument was similar to that made in 2007 by Universal Edition. In particular, the MPA claimed that Rachmaninoff's 1913 choral symphony The Bells violated US and EU copyright.Text of the MPA's letter to Go Daddy According to IMSLP, the action is without any merit.\\"IMSLP Under Attack\\" by Carolus, IMSLP Forum (21 April 2011) Almost 24 hours later, the MPA announced on Twitter that they had asked Go Daddy to reinstate the domain name.Tweet by Will Lines, Music Publishers Association (UK) (22 April 2011)  Hargreaves Review  The Hargreaves Review has made recommendations that include exemptions of copyright such as 'format shifting', where music users would be allowed to copy music from one format to another legally; for example, copying from CD to MP3 ‚Äì an act that is technically illegal under UK law. The MPA has taken a firm stance against these recommendations. The MPA claims that this could cost publishers up to ¬£40 million a year.Music Week (2012) 'MPA weighs in on Copyright proposals'. 6 April 2012, p. 4. An explanation of why the customers of their members should pay an extra ¬£40 million has not been given. The Hargreaves Review also proposes an exemption for parodied works. This has also been fiercely opposed by the MPA. Operation Creative In August 2016 the MPA joined the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit's Operation Creative initiative in the fight against online music piracy.http://www.worldipreview.com/news/music-publishers-association-joins- pipcu-s-operation-creative-12070 http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/mpa-joins-pipcus-operation- creative/  Tony Pool Award  Created in 2018, The Tony Pool Award Award recognises and celebrates the achievements of those who have shown an outstanding contribution to the administrative areas of the music publishing industry. The Tony Pool Award was created to recognise and applaud all those individuals that work in the ‚Äúback office‚Äù areas of royalties, copyright, business affairs, finance, HR and IT for music publishers. While not in the spotlight, music publishing depends on this backbone to deliver its ¬£505 million contribution to the UK economy. The award is in memory of the late Tony Pool who died in 2016. Tony spent most of his working life with Boosey & Hawkes, eventually becoming Head of Business Affairs. He was a firm advocate of copyright reform and made a significant contribution to political discussions in the UK and in Europe. He also paved the way for the creation of British Music Rights.  The MPA Richard Toeman Scholarship  Founded in 2006, The MPA Richard Toeman Scholarship is designed to: * Support the progress of outstanding individuals working within the music publishing industry. * Encourage potential or new recruits to the industry to develop their skills via work placement or study. * Offer tailored support to recipients towards a successful career in the music publishing industry. The scholarship is in memory of the late Richard Toeman who died suddenly in March 2005 following a successful 40-year career at Josef Weinberger Ltd. Throughout his career, Richard generously gave his time and expertise to the MPA and to the music publishing business as a whole. He was admired and respected by colleagues working across all sectors of the industry. The MPA is proud to pay tribute to his considerable contribution to our work via the Richard Toeman Scholarship.http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=1034667&sectioncode;=1  Events  From training courses to member socials and the MPA's legendary Christmas Lunch, the MPA hosts a varied range of events for its members and the wider industry.

It is known for its ancient Vishwanath Temple dedicated to the god Shiva, which is similar to the one in Varanasi (Kashi). The other well known temple here is dedicated to Ardhanareshvara, a half man half woman form of Shiva and Parvati. The name Guptakashi has legendary significance linked to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Its religious importance is considered next to that of Varanasi, believed to be the most pious of all Hindu pilgrimage sites. The temple town is located on the way to the Kedarnath, one of the Chota Char Dhams and Panch Kedars. It has the scenic backdrop of the snow-covered peaks of Chaukhamba and enjoys a salubrious weather throughout the year. Legend Popularly-narrated legend holds that subsequent to the Kurukshetra war of the epic Mahabharata, the Pandavas on the advice of god Krishna and other sages wished to atone for their sins of fratricide and BrƒÅhmanahatya committed by them during the war by seeking pardon from Shiva and also pray for his blessings before attaining salvation. But Shiva was not willing to meet them since he was annoyed with them for the unjust events of the war. He, therefore, avoided meeting them at Kashi and went incognito as the bull Nandi to Guptakashi in Uttarakhand. But Pandavas pursued him to Guptakashi and recognized him in the disguised form of Nandi. When Bhima, the second Pandava brother tried to hold the bull by its tail and hind legs, Nandi vanished from Guptakashi, into the ground (into a cave for hiding), but reappeared later as Shiva in five different forms namely, hump at Kedarnath, face at Rudranath, arms at Tungnath, navel and stomach at Madhyamaheshwar and the locks at Kalpeshwar. The vanishing act of Shiva gave the name Guptakashi (hidden Kashi) to this place on the bank of the Mandakini River. In the upper reaches of the Bhagirathi River, there is another Kashi, called the Uttarkashi (North Kashi). Mythology also states that Shiva proposed to Parvati at Guptakashi before they got married in the small Triyuginarayan village at the confluence of Mandakini and Sone-Ganga rivers. However the old route of 14 km from Gauri Kund to Kedarnath via Rambara was completely washed away in the 2013 North India floods, and new route of 15-16 km was made by the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM). The distance of Guptakashi to Kedarnath however remains at 22 kilometers and 729.77 meters, which is most important to the celestial nupitials.New Route to Kedarnath According to Puranic literature, Kashi and Kanchi (Kanchipuram) are considered as two eyes of Shiva. Keeping this connotation in view, six more \\"Kashi\\"s have been prescribed to be as sacred and spiritual as the main Kashi - Varanasi. Pilgrims, who cannot undertake the long journey to the main Kashi, can travel to the closest Kashi. The six other \\"Kashi\\"s cover all the regions of the country. These are: Uttarkashi and Guptakashi in Uttarakhand in Northern Himalayas, Dakshinkashi in Southern India, the Guptakashi in Eastern India is at Bhubaneswar, the Kashi at Nashik (also Paithan) in Western India and a Kashi in Mandi in Himachal Pradesh in Western Himalayas. The Puranas state that all the Kashis have the same degree of sanctity and reverence as the main Kashi - Varanasi. Another legend declares that when the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb demolished the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in 1669, and constructed Gaynvapi Mosque (he had even renamed Varanasi as Mohammad√¢b√¢d), the Shiva Linga was shifted to Guptakashi for safe keeping. But the original linga of Kashi Vishwanath is stated to have remained here from the time it was shifted. Structures The main temple is dedicated to Shiva as Vishwanath (ruler of the world). The architectural style of this temple is akin to other temples in Uttrakhand, such as Kedarnath, built in stone with a high tower over the sanctum and a wooden frame and sloping roof in typical architectural style of the region, at the top of the tower. At the entrance to the temple, there are two dwarpalakas (entrance guards) on both sides. The exterior fa√ßade is painted with lotuses. At the top of the entrance door, there is an image of Bhairava, a terrible form of Shiva. To the left of the main shrine, there is a smaller shrine dedicated to Ardhanareeshvara and at the entrance to this temple there is metallic statue of Nandi facing Shiva‚Äôs image in the temple and offering reverential worship. This statue has a Swastika, a typical Hindu symbol, painted on its side, with its arms aligned in a clockwise direction, considered as an auspicious direction. Apart from the main Vishwanath temple, a large number of Lingas, symbols of Shiva, are seen in and around Guptakashi, which has resulted in the popular terminology ‚Äòjitne pathar utne shankar‚Äô meaning \\"as many stones, those many 'Shiva's\\". Another temple town called the Ukhimath is located on the opposite bank of the Mandakini river where, during the winter months when Kedarnath temple is inaccessible due to snowy conditions, the symbolic deity of Kedarnath is shifted via Gaurikund, Phata, Guptakashi to Ukhimath to continue worship uninterrupted. The temple priests of Kedarnath stay at Guptakashi during the winter period. In a small pond (kund) called the Manikarnika Kund here, in front of the temple, a Shiva-linga is bathed by two springs, representing the rivers Ganges (Bhagirathi) and Yamuna. The Yamuna spring water emanates from a goumukh (spout in the shape of a cow‚Äôs mouth) and the Bhagirathi spring flows through trunk of an elephant strategically placed above the linga. In addition, there are few other important sites to visit in the vicinity of the temple town. These are the Gandhi Sarovar (lake) from the town where the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed. Vasukital, from Kedarnath, is yet another enchanting lake that beholds the visitor with floating ice and sparkling water. At Ukhimath, on the opposite bank of the river, there is a stupa, which according to the local version represents the grave of Nala. There are also evidences of a love legend narrated, locally only, of Krishna‚Äôs grand son Aniruddha and demon king Banasura‚Äôs daughter Usha at Ramgarh (in Ronitpur), near Ukhimath, about away from Guptakashi. This love affair led to a war between Krishna and Banasura in which the latter was killed, resulting in the end of Banasura's dynasty. Geography Scenic backdrop of Chaukhamba range of hills at Guptakashi Guptakashi is located in the Northern Himalayan belt within the Mandakini river valley, which has lush green forests. A number of streams and rivulets drain into the main Mandakini River. It has salubrious climate with its elevation being around . The snow sparkling view of the Chaukhamba peak is a lovely sight to behold in the morning hours from here. The valley has large magnolia trees (locally called Champa) that provide a sweet scented atmosphere to the place. The temple of Madhyamaheshwar is northeast of Guptkashi. The road from Guptkashi to Kalimath and the trek from Kalimath to Madhmaheshwar provide the scenic beauty of Chaukhamba, Kedarnath and Neelkanth peaks. Access It is approachable from Rudraprayag by road over a distance of . Rudrprayag is approached from Haridwar or Rishikesh by the National Highway, which goes to Badrinath and beyond. It is from Rishikesh.
