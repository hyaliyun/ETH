Early life Gorges was born in 1618 to Henry Gorges of Batcombe, Somerset and his wife Barbara Baynard, daughter of Thomas Baynard of Colerne, Wiltshire. He was a student of Lincoln's Inn in 1638. Deputy governor of Maine In 1640 Gorges was selected by his distant cousin, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, to be deputy governor of the Province of Maine in New England.History of Parliament Online - Gorges, Thomas The province was at the time a small number of sparsely populated communities in present-day southern Maine. Thomas was a Puritan, and established friendly relations with the nearby Massachusetts Bay Colony, whose governor John Winthrop described him as \\"sober and well-disposed\\".Preston, p. 335 Gorges was responsible for establishing a stable government in Maine, something his relative William had been unable to do a few years earlier. Gorges' success at governance was somewhat short-lived. He departed the province in 1643 to fight in the English Civil War, and the province was eventually absorbed into Massachusetts, which also made territorial claims to the area. Legal and parliamentary career Upon his return to England, Gorges supported the Parliamentary cause. He resumed his law study and was called to the bar in 1649.

Life and career Kingston Bridge, completed 1828. St Mary's, Hampton (1829‚Äì31). Edward Lapidge was the eldest son of Samuel Lapidge, the head gardener at Hampton Court Palace and one-time assistant of Capability Brown. The Lapidge family lived in a house called The Grove, which still exists, in Lower Teddington Road. In Surrey Lapidge built Esher Place, a brick house, stuccoed in imitation of stone, with an Ionic portico on each side, for John Spicer. He showed a view of the garden front of the house at the Royal Academy in 1808. At Norbiton Place he carried out considerable additions and alterations for its owner, Charles Nicholas Pallmer, including a dairy in the style of an Indian temple. In 1807 he built Hildersham Hall in Cambridgeshire for Thomas Fassett (formerly of Surbiton Hall, Surrey). He showed a drawing for the house, a stuccoed villa incorporating a former farmhouse in one wing, at the Royal Academy in 1814. In 1811 he was engaged by the Rev. John Kirby of Mayfield, Sussex, to rebuild the vicarage there. Lapidge was appointed surveyor to the County of Surrey in 1824. The next year he was given the job of replacing the bridge at Kingston upon Thames, after the Kingston corporation dropped its plan to build a cast iron structure due to a rise in cost of the metal. Lapidge designed a five-arched stone bridge in a Classical style, which was opened in 1828. He designed a number of churches: St John, Hampton Wick (1829‚Äì30), St Mary, Hampton (1829‚Äì31), and St Andrew's Church, Ham (1830‚Äì1) all of brick, in the Gothic style, and St Peter's, Hammersmith in a Greek Ionic style, in brick finished with Bath stone dressings. The Gentleman's Magazine described St Peter's as \\"a very fair specimen of modern Grecian architecture\\", adding that \\"the tower has considerable merit. The design is novel and pleasing, and the proportions are harmonious. The interior is however chaste and formal, displaying even a presbyterian nakedness\\". Lapidge himself donated the site of the church at Hampton Wick. As well as these buildings on the west side of London he built St James, Radcliffe (1837‚Äì8), in the East End, in the Early English style, in brick with stone dressings. Further afield he built the church of St John in the park of Doddington Hall, Cheshire (1837). He entered designs for the competitions for a new range of buildings for King's College, Cambridge in 1824, in which he came third; for the new Houses of Parliament in 1836; and for the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge in 1837, proposing a domed building, ornamented with sculpture. In 1830, he was invited by the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University, William Chafy, to design a new botanic garden for the university. The expense of acquiring the necessary land caused the plan to be shelved, and Lapidge waited for more than ten years for his bill to be paid. The gardens were eventually laid out in the mid-1840s, but not under his supervision. In 1836‚Äì7 he made considerable alterations to St. Mary's Church, Putney, repairing the tower and rebuilding the body of the church in yellow brick with stone dressings and Perpendicular windows, and in 1839‚Äì40 restored All Saints' Church at Fulham. In around 1838-41 he oversaw the construction of the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum, (now Springfield Hospital), a grand Tudor-style composition designed by William Moseley (then County Architect for Middlesex) making minor changes to the original design. Lapidge was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1838. Pupils George Wightwick, articled to Lapidge in 1817, later became a leading architect in Plymouth. In 1846 Lapidge paid for the patenting of a new type of suspension bridge, invented by another pupil, Henry Heathcote Russell. Death He died on 19 February 1860 at Hampton Wick.

Working at the Case Western Reserve University,https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/robert-fantz/ Fantz introduced in 1961 the visual preference paradigm - showing that infants look longer at patterned (e.g. checkered) images rather than uniform images. An innovation in this task was the measurement of the duration of the infant gaze rather than just the direction of first gaze. In 1964, Fantz extended this idea to habituation situations, to show that over multiple exposures to the same and a different image, the infant gradually exhibited a preference for the novel stimulus. The researcher could now estimate an infant's discriminatory and perceptual capability by showing different images in highly controlled situations, often within a stagelike box, and observing which changes in the scenarios the infant would perceive as novel.

They earned the nickname ‚ÄúThree Greenhorn Englishmen\\" because they bought land for what was believed to be an inflated price.  Early lives  Born in 1835, John Morton was from a family of eight brothers and sisters in Salendine Nook, Huddersfield, England. They lived near a public house by the name of The Spotted Cow, which was owned by Samuel Brighouse who had a son, also Samuel, born in 1836. The Mortons were pot-makers, having originally moved from Scotland in the 1580s to escape from religious persecution. They settled in Salendine Nook because of a particular type of clay which was good for making pots. John and Samuel were cousins. In 1862, they decided to sail for Canada to join in the Caribou Gold Rush and met William Hailstone on the voyage. In June of that year, they arrived at the place that today is Vancouver.  Caribou Goldfields  The town of Barkerville which grew up in the Cariboo Gold Rush (1865)With Brighouse and Hailstone, Morton tried prospecting in the Caribou gold fields. They made two trips, walking a distance of some 1,400 miles. Although unsuccessful in their main endeavour, Morton chanced upon a profitable side-line in selling horseshoe nails. A blacksmith in the outlying territory had run out of nails, and Morton saved the day by producing twenty- two nails from his outfit and making the sum of twenty-two dollars in the process. The three friends returned to the small settlement of New Westminster to ponder their next move.  The Brickmaker's Claim  One day, Morton was passing by a shop window in the settlement when he saw a lump of coal for sale in the window. In a later newspaper report it was recorded that \\"his interest was specially excited\\". Coal was a rare commodity in those parts, the only available fuel being wood. But most of all, the sight had triggered his interest as a potter: he knew that a certain kind of clay used in pot-making was usually found near coal deposits. He entered the shop and on asking the shopkeeper where the coal had come from was pointed in the direction of a native who was disappearing down the road. Morton hurried after the Indian, caught up with him and made arrangements to visit the coal seam. Taking a guide, he first visited False Creek and then Coal Harbour. He found little of value in the soil: most of the coal seam and clay deposit had been washed away. Document showing land on Burrard Inlet purchased by the Three Greenhorns in 1862 But the situation of the land at Burrard Inlet, overlooking a natural deep water harbour, so impressed Morton and his friends that they set about making enquiries about purchasing it. They discovered that it had neither been staked nor surveyed, and so they acquired 180 acres each, the maximum stake permissible under the law of the time, bought for $550.75. The lot contained what later became the West End district of Vancouver. By Christmas 1862, they had cleared a small part of the land and created a log cabin, much to the derision of the local inhabitants who christened them \\"The Three Greenhorns\\". It was even suggested that the colonial government had deliberately placed a shiny piece of coal in the shop window with the intention of enticing someone like Morton to buy the land. Although their investment in this remote piece of forest was considered a futile one, there was another person who was interested in the land. Robert Burnaby made a claim that he had obtained the original preemption for the property, but his claim was dismissed by the court. Judge Chartres Brew condemned the documents Burnaby produced as forgeries, saying that they were \\"obviously written by a liar or a knave.\\" The cabin was situated on a bluff above the sea. The greenhorns turned their hand to raising cattle and becoming brick makers. Only one of them remained in the cabin a month at a time, while the others went to work in New Westminster. But the brickmaking business failed - in a country where wood was in plentiful supply, bricks were not in great demand at that time, the clay was of poor quality and New Westminster was too far away to transport large quantities of bricks to. There was the solitude, too, which on one occasion made John Morton feel very exposed. He was woken at night by noises outside the cabin. Getting dressed, he went to take a look and saw a gathering of Indians chanting and the body of a woman hanging from a tree. Next day he reported the matter to the police in New Westminster and an investigation revealed that the dead woman had killed a baby and been hanged for murder.  Deadman's Island  Deadman's Island 1911 A government surveyor who was surveying the boundaries of the Bricklayer's Claim, offered a small island in the bay known as Deadman's Island (also shown on some maps as Coal Island) to Brighouse for $5, but Brighouse declined in the belief that they already had plenty of land. In 1865, Morton rowed across to the island and was fascinated to find hundreds of red cedar boxes perched in the upper branches of the trees. But going to touch one of the boxes, he found it fragile and it crumbled easily, showering him with the bones of a long-deceased Indian. The boxes contained the bones of Squamish people and when Morton made enquries with the chief of the tribe, he was told that the island had been the site of a massacre in which some 200 tribesmen had been killed. Morton quickly changed his mind about buying the island.  New Liverpool  The land originally known as the Brickmaker's Claim was later renamed \\"New Liverpool\\" by investors keen to develop the area. The Greenhorns tried to sell the land as lots, claiming New Liverpool would soon be a major city, but initially they had had no success. In 1886, they were persuaded to donate one third of the property to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) as an incentive for them to build a railway through to Coal Harbour, hoping that this might bring people to the area to buy the lots. By the time CPR had made it to Gastown, however, the \\"Three Greenhorns\\" had parted ways, feeling that they had been cheated. Morton went to California in search of gold, and Brighouse went to farm in Richmond. Hailstone had sold his interest to Brighouse for a $20 gold piece, several sacks of flour worth $5 and an Indian pony with a string halter worth $25, and returned to England. Entrepreneur John McDougall was contracted to clear a large part of the Three Greenhorns' \\"Liverpool Estate.\\" He was known as \\"Chinese McDougall\\" because the Chinese labourers he used to do this. But in February 1887 the Chinese workers were attacked by an angry mob who burned their homes and forced them to leave town. In 1887, the lots began to sell, with prices from $350 to $1,000, as people realised the potential of the area. With CPR building rail lines, a hotel was going up, roads were being laid through the area plus the establishment of Stanley Park, lots began to move quickly. By 1888, the area was gaining respectability and had swiftly become an attractive investment to wealthy and elite buyers with fine views across Burrard Inlet and a reasonable distance from the smelly warehouses of Gastown.  The West End  Marine Building (1929-1930)The West End grew up on the Brickmaker's Claim as \\"high class\\" residential housing, although this declined with the development of Shaugnessy by the CPR in 1911. Today, Vancouver's art-deco Marine Building marks the site of the Greenhorns‚Äô log cabin.\\"The birth of a city, from humble beginnings as a two-block strip on the Gastown waterfront\\",Vancouver Sun, 6 April 2011, At 22 stories and a height of 341 feet, the building overlooks the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The West End of Vancouver neighbours Stanley Park and the areas of Yaletown, Coal Harbour and the downtown financial and central business districts.Vancouver History and Heritage  Later lives  In 1864 Brighouse purchased almost 700 acres of land in the area that would become the town of Richmond and became a man of considerable wealth. After farming in the district, he returned to Vancouver in 1881. He became an alderman in 1887, having been involved in obtaining the City Charter. In 1911 he returned to England and died there two years later. On his return to England, Hailstone married and had two daughters. He then returned to the Vancouver area and remitted his earnings home, but his wife died and left everything to their daughters. He returned to Yorkshire and, according to rumour, he died after falling down stairs and breaking his neck. Morton's first wife was Jane Ann Bailey of Blackpool, England, but she died in childbirth in 1881. At this time, Morton was subsisting on doing odd jobs such as ditch digger and milk roundsman. He placed his daughter in a Roman Catholic convent in New Westminster and his son with a private family. However, Jane had owned a tea merchant's business in Blackpool, England, with her brother James. Morton was able to claim her entire share of the business, worth about 700 pounds, and use the money to retain his part in the Brickmaker's Claim and, in 1884, to purchase a large farm at a place called Mission. He married Ruth Mount, set up a brickmaking business in Clayburn, part of the town of Abbotsford, and ran the farm at Mission. It was from here, on 13 June 1886, that his family saw the Great Vancouver Fire burning in the distance. Ruth Morton described life in Vancouver with her husband: ‚ÄúMr. Morton and I came over from New Westminster one summer‚Äôs day in 1884 for an outing, just my late husband and myself. We had to buy our tickets for the stage the previous day, and afterwards we drove over the old Hastings Road, then a corduroy road through the trees. Mr. Morton was anxious that I should see the white sand at English Bay, and we tried to hire a boat by which we could go out of the First Narrows, but no seaworthy boat could be procured‚Äîthey were all leaky‚Äîso we did not go. He was very fascinated with the beauty of Vancouver as it was then. Whilst Mr. Edmund Ogle, my nephew, and I were waiting on the beach for Mr. Morton at Gastown, in front of us was a sow digging up the clams, and a crow hopping in front of her getting a meal from the bits of the clams. Edmund Ogle started a dry goods business in Vancouver, on Carrall and Powell streets I think, a week before the fire; all was destroyed; he lives in Toronto now. We saw the English church [St. James] and at George Black‚Äôs [Hastings] had lunch, and then went back to New Westminster on the stage, and from there up to Mission to the farm. At the time of the fire we were living at Mission. That Sunday afternoon a cloud of black smoke hovered high in the air across the river; it was evident a big fire was burning somewhere.\\" When Morton died in 1912, he left an estate valued at approximately $769,000. His will was dated 22 May 1911 and witnessed by a nephew of Ruth Morton and a Baptist preacher. The will left $100,000 to the Baptist Educational Board of B.C. together with over seven acres of land in South Vancouver. Before his death he not only laid the cornerstone of the First Baptist Church at the corner of Nelson and Burrard streets but set aside the equivalent of $11,000 dollars to build the Baptist Church since known as the Ruth Morton Memorial in South Vancouver.

It was the second largest producer of gold during California's Gold Rush. In 1898, the largest ever Pelton wheel for its time was built for the mine. The North Star Mine Company also owned locations on Weimar Hill, adjoining and south of the North Star Mine. It shut down during World War II after its consolidation with the Empire Mine. Geography The mine is located by Wolf Creek, on Auburn Road, west of the Empire Mine. It is approximately in size and situated in a southerly direction, the north boundary of the North Star being at an average distance of southerly from the Irish-American Mine. Within the surface boundaries of the North Star, there is a ledge of rock known as the \\"North Star Ledge\\", its top or apex wholly within the surface boundaries. History The French Lead, or North Star vein, was discovered in the Fall of 1851 by the Lavance Brothers, who with nine other Frenchmen, formed the Helvetia and Lafayette Gold Mining Company. In 1858, the sheriff sold the company to Edward McLaughlin to settle an $8,000 judgement. In Feb. 1860, it was purchased for $15,000 by the owners of the North Star Group, which became the North Star Quartz Mining Co. in 1861. The North Star Gold Mining co. was incorporated in 1867. The mine shut down in 1875 after reaching a depth of 1,200 feet. The North Star Mining Co. was incorporated in May 1884, by William Bowers Bourn II, and the mine was reopened.McQuiston, F.W., 1986, Gold: The Saga of the Empire Mine, 1850-1956, Grass Valley:Empire Mine Park Association, Johnston, W.D., 1940, The Gold Quartz Veins of Grass Valley, California, USGS Professional Paper 194, Washington:US Government Printing Office Bourn sold the North Star to James D. Hague in 1887. Hague reorganized the company as the North Star Mines Co. in 1889, and acquired Gold Hill, New York Hill, and the Massachusetts Hill mines. The Lafayette Hill ledge by Wolf Creek was pronounced by the State Geologist in 1855 as being one of the best-producing for quartz mining in California.In the 1860s, reserves were estimated to be not less than thirty thousand tons, worth in the aggregate of $900,000. Competition between Grass Valley Gold District's 95 mines was fierce, forcing them to open, close, and re-open at various times. Each was concerned with power sources to extract the gold. Many, like the North Star, used wood-fired engines to generate steam, depending on the surrounding forest for firewood. The North Star Mine was the Grass Valley Gold District's deepest mine, measuring vertical depth. North Star House at the North Star Mine was built by Julia Morgan. In 1895, Arthur De Wint Foote settled in Grass Valley, having been hired to design and construct an electric-generating plant for the mine. At the mine's powerhouse, he installed the largest operating Pelton water wheel to that date;Brower, p.56 it was the largest tangential water wheel in the world. The powerhouse is a designated California Historical Landmark. In 1901, the North Star \\"Central\\" vertical shaft reached the North Star vein at 1630 feet. In 1905, Julia Morgan designed a mansion for Foote and his wife, the illustrator and writer Mary Hallock Foote; the North Star House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. In 1911, with his partners, Foote purchased the Tightner Mine in Alleghany, California. Two years later, in 1913, he designed and built Foote's Crossing Road along the Middle Yuba River to improve transportation between the two mines; the road became a National Register of Historic Places landmark. Foote's son, Arthur Burling Foote, who started at the North Star as an assistant, went on to become the mine's manager after his father's retirement in 1913. In 1918, the North Star brought suit against the Empire Mine for underground encroachment upon its claim, but the boundaries were resolved, and the matter never went to trial. In 1927, the Central shaft reached a depth of 3700 feet (8600 level). By 1928, the North Star's total output value was approximately $33 million. The following year, Newmont Mining Corporation purchased the Empire Mine and the North Star Mine, consolidating them to become Empire-Star Mines, Ltd. The Empire-Star was forced to shut down by the U.S. War Production Board during World War II. After the war, a shortage of skilled miners forced the suspension of operations in the deeper portions of the mine by 1951. Mining operations were suspended on 5 July 1956, due to a local labor union strike. Miners Superintendents and administrators of the mine included William H. Rodda (later of the Norambagua Mine), John C. Coleman, his brother, Edward Coleman, and Arthur De Wint Foote. Its early owners were all miners such J. C. Coleman, E. Colman, W. H. Rodda, Josiah Rodda, John Rodda, William Kitto, William Hosken, William H. Thomas, James Dods and John Harper. The mine and mill employed over seventy men. Three-quarters of them had emigrated here from Cornwall, England where they had worked in the depressed tin mines. These Cornish miners introduced the Cornish pump and the Cornish pastie to the area. Operations 350px North Star sheeted veinlets, polished slab of granodiorite showing sheeted zone of carbonate veinlets. The North Star vein has an east and west course, with a dip of about twenty-three degrees to the north. This mine was opened by an incline shaft sunk on the course of the vein to a depth of nearly . The lowest perpendicular depth attained was approximately . It was opened by seven levels. The vein varied in thickness from a few inches to , with an average of about . The explorations in the fifth level extended about east of the shaft. The total known extent was estimated at . The lower level was driven east of the shaft. Above the three lower levels, the ground was virgin to surface, and little was extracted from the two next to the bottom. The ore was raised by tram wagons on the incline, with a wire rope. The vein was enclosed in greenstone. A vertical hoisting and ventilation shaft was sunk east of the incline. This shaft was set to cut the mine on the level of the fourth gallery. The shoots of ore in this ground had an easterly pitch. The ore had a gradually increasing tenor of gold. The North Star Mine Company owned upon the course of the lode. Between 1861-1865, the net returns were approximately $500,000, about one-fourth of which was expended in permanent improvements on the property. These included the drain tunnel, half a mile long, which was the most considerable item, and a new mill of sixteen stamps. About $375,000 of the net savings were returned to the owners in dividends, obtained from the use of a six stamp mill during 1862-63, which was subsequently enlarged. The returns for the year 1866 were $315,000, derived from the crushing of 6,000 tons of ore. The ores of this mine are considerably sulphuretted, but the value of the sulphurets in gold was much less than in the nearby Eureka Mine. The North Star did not possess chlorination works, but dressed their tailings by hand rockers for sale. The ores showed free gold, often in very fine masses, implanted in quartz, which resembles that of the nearby Rocky Bar Mine and Massachusetts Hill Mine. The sixteen stamp mill, erected in 1866, had a capacity of crushing about two tons to the stamp daily. The water in this mine was light, a supply for the use of the amalgamation works being derived from a neighboring ditch company. This circumstance, as well as the low angle of the dip of the vein, favored very greatly the economy of development of the North Star to a great depth. Powerhouse When the mining operations expanded subsequent to the California Gold Rush, the powerhouse was added. In 1895, it became the site of the largest tangential water wheel in the world. In 1878, Lester Pelton of Camptonville brought a strange machine to the Miners Foundry in nearby Nevada City. The Pelton wheel, about the size of a car tire and referred to as \\"Wheel One\\", was put on display for mine owners. It used cups on a wheel to draw water and harness power. Running out of trees to burn, the North Star decided to switch to hydraulic power, and Arthur De Wint Foote designed the wheel which drove four new compressors that delivered of air pressure for to the mine's central shaft. For his ingenuity, Foote was made the North Star's superintendent. The powerhouse has been turned into the North Star Mine and Powerhouse & Pelton Wheel Museum. The New Verde Mining Company donated an acre of land and the remains of the old power house. The wheel was saved from the scrap heap by a Grass Valley resident who raised $2,000 to purchase the wheel and donated it to the Historical Society. The powerhouse is also a designated California Historical Landmark. Its plaque's inscription reads: > NORTH STAR MINE POWERHOUSE > > The North Star Powerhouse, built by A. D. Foote in 1895, was the first > complete plant of its kind. Compressed air, generated by Pelton water > wheels, furnished power for the entire mine operation.

At the time, Edmund was chairman and principal owner of the Edmond de Rothschild Group, a private banking group headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Although she was raised Roman Catholic, she converted to Judaism stating: \\"It would not have been possible to have the name Rothschild and be a Catholic... Nor would it be right for the son of a Rothschild to be half-Jewish and half-Catholic.\\" They had one son born in 1963, Benjamin de Rothschild, shortly after their marriage.New York Times: \\"Wine Talk; Another Rothschild Stands Behind a Bordeaux\\" October 1, 1997 Lhopitalier used the noble title of her husband (Baroness), issued to the Rothschild family under the Second French Empire.

Its creators are Mumbai-based artist Vivek Goel and Mumbai-based writer Vijayendra Mohanty. Overview Ravanayan is divided into twelve chapters spread over ten issues. It is an imaginative take on the life of Ravana, the antagonist of Ramayana. Ravanayan is an independent 10- chapter (7 issue) comic book series project being undertaken by Vijayendra Mohanty (writer) and Vivek Goel (artist). https://www.facebook.com/ravanayan/info Characters and contents Apart from Ravana being the chief protagonist instead of Rama, Ravanayan departs from Ramayana in other ways. The creators of Ravanayan address Ravana with the honorific title of 'Lord' because, as they reason out, his kingdom had flourished under his able rule. Physical appearance of most characters has also been re-imagined. Ravana has been depicted as \\"handsome, muscular man with flowing locks of white hair ... He is also clean-shaven, without the 'clich√©d, ugly moustache'\\" which is traditionally used to depict any asura. Most prominently, Ravana, as is the case with popular depictions, has not been shown with ten heads, but instead, the ten qualities that each of the heads stood for have been incorporated in his personality. Again in contrast with the original Ramayana, creators have focused less on characters related to Rama and more on those related to Ravana. They have made an attempt in the second chapter to explain how a small incident gave glimpses of future personality of the three brothers ‚Äì Kumbhakarna, Vibhishana and Ravana. Research for the project The creators had consulted Valmiki's original Ramayana, and apart from that Arshia Sattar, Devdutt Pattanaik, Penguin Books' Guide to Ramayana. The creators have also used their imagination to re- interpret the characters.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Lancaster and Morecambe, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Christ Church was built between 1855 and 1857 to a design by the London architect Henry Martin. It was built as a chapel for Lancaster Grammar School and the local workhouse. The church was paid for and endowed by Samuel Gregson, a local industrialist and MP. In 1889 a south aisle was added, designed by the local architects Paley and Austin. It provided 152 seats, and cost about ¬£1,000. In 1894‚Äì95 a west baptistry was added by the same practice, then known as Paley, Austin and Paley. The same practice (by now Austin and Paley) converted the organ chamber into the Storey chapel, the organ having been moved into the south transept. In 1919 a war memorial was installed in the churchyard. It was in Derbyshire stone, high, and cost ¬£400. This was designed by Henry Paley, then trading as Austin, Paley and Austin. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed in squared coursed sandstone and has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave, a west baptistry, a north porch, a north transept, a north vestry, a chancel with a lower roof, a south aisle with a chapel, and a south porch. At the west end is a pair of turrets. Most of the windows in the church have pointed arches and contain Geometric tracery. The turrets have square bases that broach to octagons. The bell openings are gabled and above them are spirelets. At the west end of the nave is a five-light window containing Perpendicular tracery. Beneath the window and between the turrets is the baptistry. Springing from the baptistry are gargoyles. At the west end of the south aisle is a three-light window. The south aisle is in six bays separated by buttresses. Five of the bays contain two-light windows with trefoil heads. The sixth bay, probably the site of an earlier transept, contains a three-light window. On the north side of the church is a porch, with one bay to the west and three bays to the east, all with two-light windows. In the north transept, the north window has three lights, and the west window two lights. The north wall of the vestry contains a four-light mullioned window and a doorway; the east wall has two two-light windows. In the east wall of the chancel is a three-light window; the south aisle and chapel each have two-light windows, and in the south wall of the chapel are two two-light windows. Interior Between the nave and the south aisle is a four-bay arcade. The font, dating from 1914, is made from sandstone and marble. It has a wooden cover, carved as a Gothic spire. Over this is a wrought iron crane with an ornate arm. The reredos is in marble and dates from 1916. Some of the stained glass was made in the middle of the 19th century by Powell. Elsewhere there is a \\"magnificent scheme\\" of stained glass by Carl Almquist and E. H. Jewitt of Shrigley and Hunt, installed between 1892 and 1909, described in the Buildings of England series as \\"one of their best and most important ensembles\\". The three-manual organ was installed in 1857, and was rebuilt, enlarged and moved into the north transept in 1937 by Henry Ainscough of Preston. External features To the north of the church is a sandstone war memorial dating from 1919. It has been designated as a Grade II listed building.

His grandson would serve in the First World War in the Royal Engineers under Sir Gordon Guggisberg, who later became Governor of the Gold Coast (Ghana). Due to an acquaintance, limes were exported from the Gold Coast from 1924. In July 1955 the lime juice gained a Royal Warrant of Appointment to Her Majesty. The company was the sole distributor of Dubonnet in the UK from 1938. The Lime Marmalade was introduced in the 1930s. Its slogan in the 1940s was The Difference is Delightful. It was marketed as a British Empire Product. During the war it was restricted under the jam ration. Ownership The company was based in London, but the premises were mostly damaged by bombs on 7 September 1940, although a new site had been built at St Albans. After the war, the company was based on Grosvenor Road in St Albans, Hertfordshire. There was another plant at Boxmoor Wharf at Hemel Hempstead,Boxmoor Wharf which closed in 1983. Lime juice was transported to the site from Brentford by canal.

Formerly owned by the banker Henri de Rothschild and then residence of the prefect maritime of the Var, it became a public park in 1986. It features the trees, flowers and plants of Provence, the Mediterranean and the tropics, and includes a grand alley of plane trees, a giant bougainvillia, spring-fed fountains and basins, orchards, kitchen gardens and vineyards, a solar-powered \\"orchard\\" cooled by mist, and a view of the mountains of the Var. It is classified by the French Ministry of Culture as one of the Remarkable Gardens of France. History The Fief of Baudouvin (the Proven√ßal spelling of Boudouin) is mentioned for the first time in 1437, when Ren√© of Anjou, the last Count of Provence, authorized the donation of the castle of La Valette, and the domaine of Baudouvin, which depended upon it, to El√©on de Glandev√®s, the Seigneur of La Garde. The act of donation mentioned that the domaine included several springs, and extended from Mont Coudon to the town of Salli√®s-Ville. Gaspard de Thomas, the Baron de la Garde, sold the domaine in 1612 to Claude Cabisson, the ecuyer of La Valette. It remained in his family until the domaine passed by marriage to the family of Jacques de Rippert, the Seigneur of Revest. The old manor house was demolished in 1785, and replaced by the current house. After the French Revolution, the house became the property of the family of a M. Benet. In 1926 it was purchased by the banker Henri de Rothschild. His chief gardener and manager, Bonnefoy, planted the current gardens, orchards and vineyards. After World War II it became the official residence of the prefet maritime of the Var, then, in 1986, it became the property of the town of La Valette-du-Var. The town later commissioned the landscape architecture firm of Alep to add contemporary gardens to the original gardens created by Henri de Rothschild. The Domaine reopened in its present form in 2008.Site of the City of La Valette-du-Var. Description The park is located at the foot of Mount Coulon. A long alley of plane trees leads through orchards and vineyards to the house, built in 1785, which is now a gallery for exhibitions. A fountain and terrace are located in front of the house. The kitchen gardens reflect the history of La Valette, which traditionally produced watercress, strawberries, and lemons, which were provided for the crews of ships departing from Toulon for long voyages.site of city of La Valette-du-Var. The park includes a gardens of aromatic and medicinal plants; bamboo and other tropical plants; citrus trees; vegetable gardens; a terrace for viewing the large basin and Mount Coulon; and a \\"solar garden\\" composed of masts with solar panels, which generate electricity and also produce a cooling mist in summer.

The project has gathered songs in Yiddish, a language put on the Red List of Threatened Languages by UNESCO. Before World War II the number of native Yiddish speakers amounted to 11 million people. During Holocaust 6 million Jewish people were killed, thus the number of Yiddish speakers halved. The language continued in literature, oral speech, Ashkenazi folklore, and in songs. The project is unique as the Jewish songs in Yiddish, which had been persecuted in various places that Jews had settled, and generally played only by small klezmer ensembles beforehand, were for the first time performed by a large symphony orchestra. Reception Efim Alexandrov, the author, art director and soloist of the project, Honoured Artist of the Russian Federation, singer and custodian of Yiddish song tradition, was awarded for his cultural activities including this project, with the Russian National Award ‚ÄúPerson of the Year‚Äù in 2001 and the ‚ÄúPerson of the Year ‚Äì 5764‚Äù Award of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia in 2004.

The concert program included not only the songs created in Jewish shtetles in the Yiddish language, but also those that were written by people who left the shtetles after the Pale of Settlement had been abolished. In the 10 years that the project exists several concert programs have been created, and over 150 The Songs of Jewish Shtetle concerts have been played in the USA, Canada, Germany, Israel, Australia, Russia, and CIS countries. Efim Alexandrov is engaged in continuous research to restore the Yiddish musical culture.

USPS 499-920 Design and development The first Condor I was introduced in 1932. The aircraft was further developed into the Condor II and the IIA, which replaced strut bracing with a cantilever wing. Following the Second World War the two-seat Condor IV first flew in 1951 and was put into series production by Schleicher. The Condor series was built from wood, with the wooden-framed wing covered in doped aircraft fabric. The Condor IV has a span wing that employs a Goettingen 532 airfoil at the wing root, changing to a NACA 0012 section at the wing tip. The wings have balanced DFS-style dive brakes for glidepath control. The horizontal stabilizer is of an all-flying tail design. The landing gear was originally a dolly for take-off, with the aircraft landing on a fixed skid, although at least one was modified to use a fixed monowheel. Some sources state that there were a total of 18 Condors constructed, while one other says that the total number is unknown, but includes at least 18 Condor IVs built under licence in Argentina.VGC News no. 133, Summer 2011, Vintage Glider Club At least one Condor was converted to a motorglider.

The intention was for the power-egg to be carried to the glider by the retrieve crew, fitted to the glider and the pilot to fly the glider back to home base without the need to de-rig and transport by trailer. In practice it was found to be impractical due to the complexity of the mounting, as well as time and effort required to mount the power-egg.

One day, supermodel Sarah Easton (Amanda de Cadenet) enters his taxi and they have a short but intense exchange. A few days later, he sees her by chance when having dinner with his two close friends, and they have a short interaction. The movie develops with the two of them becoming interested into each other and slowly falling in love while Sarah's husband is away in Rome for two months. Michael occasionally writes her love poems and surprises her with romantic gifts such as a thousand roses delivered to her hotel room in Spain, when Sarah went there to visit her husband. Towards the end, there is an intense conflict between Sarah and Michael, in which Sarah says how Michael doesn't understand her life and that everything happens on his terms. Michael reveals that he was a writer and had known her kind of life, but did not feel fulfilled so gave up and became a cab driver instead. Sarah goes back to her husband and Michael sends her his best-selling book (which made him famous in the past) along with a last letter with which the film ends.

Though there are many prehistoric sites in the surrounding area, it remains one of the earliest known settlements in the immediate vicinity of Wells, and may have been a precursor to the present day city. It consists of two or three interlinked sub-enclosures, with what appears to be a field system extending to the east; an unusual layout, the site remains relatively little studied and has not been archaeologically excavated. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and shares its name with the surrounding King's Castle Wood‚Äîtoday a Somerset Wildlife Trust nature reserve‚Äîthough this name is probably a modern invention.  Background Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status.

He founded the Street Warriors organization in 2003. As of 2011, Best remains active preaching nonviolence and delivering blankets, food and supplies to poor people of Newark with his van and on his feet. Biography Best grew up in the city's South Ward.Biography from Earl Best‚Äôs Street Doctor websiteBrian Falzarano, 'Street Doctor' Leaves His Mark on Newark with 'The Fingerprint' , West Ward Patch, August 8, 2011 He was arrested for bank robbery on June 13, 1983, and subsequently convicted, at least partially on the basis of fingerprint evidence. He spent ten years in solitary confinement while serving 17 years in prison for the robbery. During his solitary imprisonment, he studied spiritual writings, psychology, and law, and he prayed that he would be able to help others if released. In a 2011 interview, he said: \\"I wanted to make a difference in kids' lives because no one made a difference in mine.\\" Best was released from prison in 2000. Within three years, he set up an organization called Street Warriors with several other former criminal offenders. Its programs included a summer youth program, mentoring for teenagers living in public housing, gang awareness and intervention programs for adults and youth, and sports activities including a boxing club and a basketball team.About Street Warriors, NJ.com, March 20, 2008 For a few years, the organization maintained a center, but the center closed due to a lack of ongoing funding. Best now runs his charitable activities out of a donated van. Street ministry Best carries goods such as blankets and food in his van, for distribution at places where homeless people or panhandlers congregate. He says that people relax after eating, and he stays to \\"hang out\\" with people after he drops off his donations. \\"Peace is about being relaxed, and you know what, food relaxes people. You don't see people frowning when they eat. Food is peace.\\" The locations Best serves food include abandoned buildings, panhandling sites, prisons, juvenile halls, and schools. He says that part of his street ministry is giving people \\"food for the mind and for the heart ... If they're about violence, I show them how in my own life I took the energy I put into violence and put it into peace.\\" Best says he gives kids his cell phone number and urges them to phone him first if they ever decide they're going to \\"do something bad.\\" His other charitable activities for young people include organizing a beach trip for 60 teenagers to celebrate Father's Day.

In 2008, Best was unexpectedly honored by GQ Magazine at its Gentlemen's Ball in New York City, receiving an award from actor Forest Whitaker. In 2009, Best eulogized a fellow anti- violence activist, Yusuf Shabazz, who died from gunshot wounds at age 22. Shabazz had been arrested for selling drugs at age 16, but had managed to turn his life around. He received training in film editing from a non-profit youth group, Aspira, and began to make films about ending gang violence.

Afterward, he became part of the political machine run by US Senator from New York Roscoe Conkling, and was appointed as the Collector of the Port of New York from 1870 to 1871. Life Murphy was born in Ireland in 1821. He emigrated to the United States as a young man and entered the fur business. He became interested in politics, joining first the Whig party and later the Republicans. In 1848, he married Mary Gibbs (died 1897), and they had five children. Their son, Edgar Gibbs Murphy, became well known as a champion pigeon-shooter. Another son, Thomas Vinton Murphy, married Cora Howarth. They had a business running munitions and a gambling house in the 1880s.Lillian Gilkes, Cora Crane: A Biography of Mrs. Stephen Crane, Indiana University Press; 1st edition (1960) Murphy made his fortune selling equipment to the Union Army during the American Civil War, and soon thereafter became involved with the Republican political machine run by Roscoe Conkling. He was a member of the New York State Senate (7th D.) in 1866 and 1867. In 1870, Conkling asked President Ulysses S. Grant to appoint Murphy to the office of Collector. Murphy antagonized other New York Republican factions by firing their members from Custom House jobs and replacing them with men loyal to Conkling. Murphy became sufficiently unpopular so that Grant was forced to replace him, appointing Murphy's friend, Chester A. Arthur, to the post in his place. After his removal, Murphy ran for Congress from New York's 9th congressional district, but was defeated. He was elected again as a member of the State Senate in 1879. He eventually owned a horse farm in Deal, New Jersey. He died at his home in 1901 of kidney disease. His funeral was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

William Richardson Linton (2 April 1850 in Diddington, Huntingdonshire ‚Äì 7 April 1908 in Ashbourne, Derbyshire), Corpus Christi College, M.A., was an English botanist and vicar of the parish of Shirley, Derbyshire. He was regarded as one of the leading batologists of his day. Life Linton was born in Diddington in Huntingdonshire in 1850. He married Alice Shirley (daughter of Rev. Walter Waddington Shirley and Philippa Frances Emilia Knight Shirley) on 26 January 1887, with whom he had one daughter, Viola Marion Linton. He became the vicar of St Michael's church in Shirley. St Michael's, Shirley Linton collected botanical specimens and records, often working with his elder brother who was also a cleric. (Rev. Edward Francis Linton was based mainly in Edmondsham in Dorset). In 1890 W.R.Linton published a short article in the Journal of Botany describing a new species of hawkweed (Hieracium holophyllum) found in Derbyshire. In 1892 he and his brother published a short eight page guide called Some Scottish Willows which they followed two years later with Set of British Willows. Linton wrote an extensive book about the flora of Derbyshire, published in 1903. The front cover of his Flora contained a large illustration in gold leaf of Rubus durescens, a species of bramble unique to Derbyshire which he had earlier discovered. Linton is credited with the first description of Rubus durescens.Rubus durescens, Encyclopedia of Life, Retrieved 17 August 2015 His Flora contained 1,030 species of flowering plants and ferns. He considered around 910 (88%) of these native, 70 (7%) aliens and 50 (5%) casuals. He also included mosses and liverworts. He included two maps of the county and two illustrations of plants he considered special in the area. In addition to the one shown on the cover, he also included a line drawing of Epipactis atroviridis, which he considered a species new to science that grew locally. The bramble is still recognised as a local species, but the orchid is no longer accepted as valid, and is probably just a form of the broad-leaved helleborine (Epipactis helleborine). In 1905 Linton published An account of the British Hieracia. He died in 1908 in Ashbourne in Derbyshire. He and his wife, who died in 1911, are buried in the churchyard of St Michael's church in Shirley.Some Memorial Inscriptions - Shirley, Derbyshire St Michael's Churchyard, Wishful Thinking, Retrieved 17 August 2015 In 1969 Linton's Flora was brought up to date by a committee of local Derbyshire botanists, led by Professor A.R.Clapham as editor, and published by Derby Museum and Art Gallery. That work was itself further built upon and completely revised in 2015 by the publication of the fourth work to bear the name The Flora of Derbyshire, but which extensively references data collated by W.R.Linton, and contains a full biography of his botanical life and achievements.

Page 175 He came from a family recently converted to Roman Catholicism by the Dominican priests but like many of the time, retained some of the Aymara religious beliefs. Our Lady of Copacabana Under the influence of the Dominicans, Yupanqui's monotheistic beliefs increased while studying religion and started admiring the works of European religious art. Legend has it that one night, a beautiful woman carrying in her arms a child appeared in the fourth month of the Indian calendar and was charged with the task of making the image. This image later became known as Nuestra Senora de Virgen de la Candelaria or Our Virgin Lady of the Candles. Father Antonio Montoro, who was the presiding parish priest at the time insisted that the image of the virgin be likened to European faces, but Yupanqui insisted that the face of the statue be likened that to the native people of Bolivia. Later art career Later in his life, Yupanqui created three other replicas of his famed Marian image and sent to three different places. One statue resides in Cocharcas, Peru while another one is located in Pucarani, Bolivia and another was sent to Tucum√°n in northern Argentina. The sculpture Our Lady of Cocharcas is attributed to him Death and sainthood Yupanqui later died in 1616 in the monastery of Oblates of the Order of Saint Augustine in Cusco, Bolivia. The statue Yupanqui made was crowned Queen of Bolivia on August 1, 1925 by the Republic of Bolivia, as accorded with national honors by the centenary of the country, with the participation of President Bautista Saavedra, officiating Archbishop Augusto Sieffert in a solemn High Mass and religious ceremony, along with Monsignor Gaetano Cicognani, the Apostolic Nuncio to Bolivia sent by Pope Pius XI. In 2011, the Roman Catholic Bishops' Conference of Bolivia petitioned the Holy See to canonize Yupanqui as the first saint of Bolivia.

Broughton is an American psychologist and professor who specialises in cultural studies, media and visual culture, youth culture, popular culture, gender, and violence. Broughton graduated from Cambridge University with both a BA and Masters of Arts, later earning his PhD at Harvard University. He became an Associate Professor of Psychology and Education at the Teachers College at Columbia University in 1976, and continues to hold the position. Early life and education Broughton was raised in a small village 15 miles south of London. His parents were organizers of their community's film society, and he \\"grew up as a Cinema Paradiso projector boy\\". He later spent six influential years in the UK's Reserve Officers' Training Corps, where he became an expert on explosives and hand grenades. He claimed the experience increased his interest in the military aspects of culture and graphic imagery used to justify war. After a short period pursuing a career in journalism, Broughton began studying psychology at Cambridge University. While there he earned both his BA and Master of Arts degrees. After graduating from Cambridge he moved from England to the United States, where he earned his PhD at Harvard University. While at Harvard he partly focused his studies on the world-views and moral development of adolescents. His unpublished doctoral dissertation was titled The Development of Natural Epistemology in Adolescence and Early Adulthood. Teachers College, Columbia University Broughton became an Associate Professor of Psychology and Education at the Teachers College at Columbia University in 1976 and continues to hold the position. When Teachers College underwent departmental reorganisation in the mid 1990s, Broughton retained his title but moved to the Department of Arts and Humanities, where he expanded classroom techniques to include the use of music, advertising, magazines, video games, television, and the internet. His classes often cover cultural studies, media and visual culture, youth culture, popular culture, gender, and violence. In October 1999 Broughton co-ordinated a conference at Teachers College titled \\"Children, Culture and Violence\\". The conference brought together experts on school violence, and was sponsored by Teacher's College, Adelphi University, Long Island University, and the Glass Institute for Basic Psychoanalytic Research. Most presentations addressed the roots of violence and finding ways to break the cycle. Some of his students organised the first national conference on Cultural Studies and Education, which was held at Teachers College. In June 2003 Broughton contributed severals works to Columbia doctoral student and curator Frank Shifreen's art exhibit Art Against War. The exhibition featured posters analysing war from over 14 countries. Broughton co-founded the \\"Film and Education Research Center\\" with doctoral advisee Kelvin Shawn Sealey. FERA is now a part of the Center for Educational Outreach and Innovation at Teachers College, and its stated mission is to explore the interplay between cinema, teaching, and learning. It is a research, publishing, and teaching project. On 26 March 2004, FERA hosted actor and scholar Cornel West of The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions at Teachers College to give a program entitled Film & Education: The Matrix of the Possible. In April 2005, Sealey again worked with Broughton to organise Project Citizen, a series of academic film discussions in talk show format.

He has served as an editorial board member and consultant to the International Journal of Art & Design Education, the International Journal of Education and the Arts, and Studies in Material Thinking. Sullivan, who graduated from Ohio State University in 1984 with both a Master of Arts and a Ph.D., has taught art at the University of New South Wales's College of Fine Arts, and the Teacher's College at Columbia University. He is the current director of the School of Visual Arts at Pennsylvania State University. Education Sullivan attended Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio where he earned his Master of Arts and later graduated with a Ph.D. in art education in 1984. Sullivan's scholarly interests include visualization in the art process, studio-based research methods and theory for different art disciplines. Artistic career ;Streetworks (1995‚Äìpresent) In the early 1990s Sullivan began creating \\"Streetworks\\", unique conceptual art pieces built from materials he picked up from gutters and sidewalks. Under the guise of semi-anonymity, he constructs the pieces on specific sites such as subway stations, abandoned buildings, parks, bridges, and other locations. While the pieces have mainly appeared in the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, they have also appeared in Boston, Tokyo, Venice, Beijing, the Bahamas, and Sydney. ;Exhibitions Throughout his career Sullivan's art has been featured in numerous shows and exhibitions. In March 2010 Sullivan contributed art pieces to the international traveling exhibit Global Perspectives: Works on Paper. In New York City it displayed in the Broadway Gallery, and also featured such artists as May Stevens. In April 2010 he participated in the exhibition Art is Me, Art is You at the Korean Cultural Center, Los Angeles. The show included a public art walk performance where the artists symbolically 'wore' their artwork. Teaching career University of New South Wales (1988-1998)  In 1988 Sullivan joined the faculty at the University of New South Wales in Kensington, Australia, where he remained for over ten years. He served as a senior lecturer in art education in their College of Fine Arts. ;Critical Influence CD (1998) In 1998 Sullivan produced a CD-ROM entitled Critical Influence: A Visual Arts Research Project, which documented two contemporary artists preparing for an exhibition, and explored the influences and contexts between their separate art practices. Made while at the University of New South Wales, it was intended to accompany an exhibition called Critical Influence at the Ivan Dougherty Gallery in February and March 1998. Columbia University (1999-2009) In January 1999 Sullivan departed from the University of New South Wales to join the faculty in the Department of Arts and Humanities at Teachers College, Columbia University. He served as Chair of the Department of Arts & Humanities, as well as associate professor of art education. Lecturing history  ;InSEA World Congress (2002) In 2002 Sullivan served on the Congress Executive Committee of InSEA's 31st World Congress in New York City. On 4 November 2005, Sullivan presented \\"Research Acts in the Visual Arts\\" as part of the John M. Anderson Lecture Series at the Pennsylvania State University School of Visual Arts. Three years later, on 7 and 8 March 2008, Sullivan served as a keynote speaker at NYU Steinhardt in Greenwich Village. On 2 February 2009, he was sponsored by the Interdisciplinary Research Group from the College of Visual and Performing Arts at Syracuse University to present the lecture \\"The Artist as Research Trickster\\". He presented \\"Art Practice as Research: New Roles for New Realities\\" at Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on 11 November 2009. The lecture was part of the Rose and Rudy S. Ackerman Visual Arts Lecture Series. Penn State University (2010-present)  Effective 1 August 2010, Sullivan was appointed director of Pennsylvania State University's School of Visual Arts. He is also a professor of art education at the college. Writing/editing career ;Seeing Australia (1994) Sullivan is the author of Seeing Australia: Views of Artists and Artwriters, a paperback book released on Piper Press in 1994. It was also published as a poster book in 1994, and there was a second reprinting in 1996. ;Art Practice as Research (2005, 2010) In 2005 Sullivan published the book Art Practice as Research: Inquiry in the Visual Arts, which described many of his artistic philosophies on education and research in detail. It was published by SAGE Publications on both paperback and hardback. The book later underwent a major update and revision and was republished early in 2010. His research partly investigates the thinking process, making processes, and practices used in visual arts. He presents the argument that the creative and cultural inquiry undertaken by artists is a form of research. ;Articles Sullivan has written numerous articles focusing on visual research practices in art and education, published in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, and Asia. He has held editorial positions with both Studies in Art Education and Australian Art Education. He is also an editorial board member and consultant to the UK publication International Journal of Art & Design Education, the International Journal of Education and the Arts, and Studies in Material Thinking. He has served as senior editor for Studies in Art Education, the research journal of the NAEA. He has contributed numerous chapters to books and text books, as well as editorials to peer-reviewed journals such as Studies in Art Education and Australian Art Education. He also contributed articles to Artlink in 1999 and Art in Education in 1988 and 1986. In 2004 he was listed in Who's Who in America.

He belonged to a merchant-landowner bhavnani family settled in Sindh of British India. Seth Vishandas established many cotton ginning and rice threshing factories in different areas of Sindh, such as Manjhu, Hyderabad, Nawabshah, Dadu and Badin. He also was involved with Sindh political and social services. Early life Birth and education Seth Vishandas was born in Manjhu, a village in Tehsil Kotri, Sindh of Talpur dynasty in 1843 AD, one month before the invasion of Sindh and annexation to British India. He was full-blooded Sindhi, as his father and mother both were of Sindhi origin. When he was 18 years old, he left his family home to seek a teacher. He walked all the way from Sindh to Punjab, and near Lahore, he found a famous saint called Gulabdas who became his guru for many years. Family Seth Vishandas‚Äòs father was Seth Nihalchand Lakhmichand of Manjhu, who was born in 1798 and died in 1865. Vishandas had one brother, Lilaram. Seth Vishandas married Beejhalbai, the daughter of Seth Dunimal Tilokchandani, a businessman from Manjhand. The couple had three sons: the eldest, Seth Harchandrai Vishandas, was a lawyer and famous politician who became known as the ‚Äúfather of modern Karachi.‚Äú Seth Udhavdas Vishandas, the second son, was born in Manjhu in 1896, took on the family business as a landlord and cotton merchant, and died in his hometown in 1926. Seth Srichand was the third son. Vishandas also had four daughters: Gungalbhai, Panjalbai, Motibai, and Chandibai. Professional life Mercantile background Seth Vishandas owned vast lands and commerce, which after successful management, made him one of the wealthiest men in Sindh. Along with being a landlord and managing cotton and rice factories, he was also a large-scale timber contractor who allowed the poor to sell wood from his land to make a living. Vishandas was also known to permit low-income cattle owners to graze their cattle on his land. Local and political affairs He attended the first, second, and third sessions of Indian National Congress. The 28th session of Congress in 1913 was held in Karachi largely due efforts of Vishandas, his son Harchandrai, and Ghulam Mohamed Bhurgari. He and Harchandrai served respectively as Chairman and Secretary of the reception committee during that session. Vishandas was a member of the Karachi District Local Board and the president of Kotri Tehsil Local Board until his death. Social reformer Vishandas opposed the injustices within the Deti-Leti system long before any official reform was attempted or enacted. He wrote a book promoting a radical cure for this societal ill and sent a free copy to various Panchayats. He then traveled from village to village, town to town, instructing Panchayats and seeking to educate the public about why and how reform should be instituted. Vishandas‚Äòs ideas and efforts were part of the pre-independence pioneering movement toward the abolition of the dowry system. A decade following Vishandas‚Äòs death, the then-provincial government of Sindh passed an enactment known as the Sind Deti Leti Act of 1939, which was the earliest official attempt to bring an end to the evils within dowry system. While this early enactment was unable to achieve the desired impact, as were other similar failed Deti Leti reform attempts of the 1950s, it sparked a gradual movement that finally culminated in India‚Äôs Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961. Vishandas also is remembered for being a proponent of education and investing in the betterment of the communities in which he lived. He built a library in Kotri and founded schools in Manjhu, his place of birth, and in Hyderabad, where he had taken up residential quarters (known as Vishin Nagar). He also established a hospital, Rest house, and grain shop in Hyderabad. In credit of his role as a social reformer, Vishandas was conferred with the title of Rai Bahadur. Death Afflicted by asthma complications, Seth Vishandas died in 1929 in Hyderabad, Sindh. Two of his sons died during his lifetime, Harchandrai in 1928 and Udhavdas in 1926. Three years after his death, his third son Srichand died in 1932. Vishandas left behind over 8,000 acres of land and two huge ginning factories, which were distributed equally among his sons and grandchildren.

The river water diversion barrage across the Pranahita river is located at Thammidihatti village in Komaram Bheem district of Telangana. This lift canal is an inter river basin transfer link by feeding Godavari river water to Krishna river basin. The chief ministers of Telangana and Maharashtra states reached an agreement in 2016 to limit the full reservoir level (FRL) of the barrage at 148 m msl with 1.85 tmcft storage capacity. In the year 2016, this project is divided into two parts. The scheme with diversion canal from the Thammmidihatti barrage to connect to existing Yellampalli reservoir across the Godavari river is presently called Pranahita barrage lift irrigation project. This scheme is confined to providing irrigation facility to nearly 2,00,000 acres in Adilabad district using 44 tmcft water. The second part is called Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme where water from Godavari river after the confluence by the Pranahita tributary, is lifted from Medigadda barrage near Kaleswaram temple town via Yellampalli reservoir (FRL 148 m msl) to provide lift irrigation facility in Karimnagar, Warangal, Nizamabad and Medak districts. This scheme is similar to the old Pranahita Chevella lift irrigation scheme with number of pumping stations, barrages (Medigadda barrage across Godavari at FRL 100 m msl with 16 tmcft storage, Annaram barrage across Godavari at FRL 120 m msl with 3.52 tmcft storage and Sundilla barrage across Godavari at FRL 130 m msl with 1.62 tmcft storage), balancing reservoirs, etc. Interstate agreement Under Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal award agreements, Maharashtra state earlier agreed for construction of barrages by the undivided Andhra Pradesh state across the Pranhita river which is forming common boundary between the two states. This agreement limits new water uses in Maharashstra to nearly 300 tmcft in a year from Pranahita and Indravati river basins. In the Pranahita basin, 23 river basin points are identified whose upstream water availability is totally allocated to Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh states. Maharashtra state is also allocated another 76 tmcft water from the downstream of these river basin points which forms nearly 30,000 km2 in the Pranahita basin area. This area receiving in excess of 1250 mm average yearly rain fall, yields more than 300 tmcft in a 75% dependable water year. Thus more than 224 tmcft water is available at Thammidihatti barrage location for use in Telangana state after accounting the permitted uses by Maharashtra. Already Maharashtra is using more than 300 tmcft permitted water in the Pranahita basin alone drastically reducing water yield at Thumbadihatti barrage point. History The foundation stone was laid by the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Dr. Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy in 2008. Signing of an agreement by Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to implement the Rs. 17,000-crore mega project of Pranahita-Chevella at Delhi in the presence of Chief Ministers of both States opened a new chapter with regard to utilisation of water in the Godavari basin. Andhra Pradesh has so far spent Rs 1,600 crore on various packages of the project, which was designed by a group of engineers to use 160 Tmcft of Pranahita water and serve 16.4 lakh acres in the water scarcity areas of Adilabad, Karimnagar, Warangal, Nizamabad, Medak, Nalgonda and Ranga Reddy districts. This huge investment would have been a waste if Maharashtra had opposed to it. Maharashtra's consent is seen crucial because the barrage required for the project to divert Pranahita waters will have to be built in its territory also. The water from this barrage will be transferred into the reservoir of the Yellampalli project already constructed across the Godavari, before being released to the intended areas, including Hyderabad city (30 tmcft) for drinking purpose. Maharashtra state can also benefit equally by envisaging lift irrigation schemes for uplands irrigation by drawing water from the left bank of the barrage as the left bank of the barrage is close to steep hill ridge (above 190 m MSL). Moreover, this barrage is the suitable diversion point to transfer Pranhita water to water deficit Marathwada region of Maharashtra via Sriram Sagar reservoir. So the higher storage capacity and the higher full reservoir level (full reservoir level at 152 m msl with 5 tmcft storage) of the barrage is also in the interest of Maharashtra state. Earlier in the Babli barrage dispute, Maharashtra claimed that it has right to use the water available in the Sriram Sagar reservoir as per the agreement dated 06.10.1975 of Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal and Supreme Court upheld the claim of Maharashtra Pranahita-Chevella is the costliest of Jalayagnam projects requiring 3,466 MW of power & annual electricity of 7.5 billion KWhr with 530 meters average pumping head. The initial 222 meters pumping head up to Middle Manair reservoir can be saved if it is possible to divert water via SRSP Flood Flow Canal from Sriramsagar reservoir whose water availability /inflows could be enhanced to 250 tmc when Maharashtra and Karnataka do not over use the Godavari water in excess of their water use entitlements. Alternate to Medigadda, etc barrages The barrage at Thammidihatti can be constructed with FRL at 148 m msl but the shortfall in water requirement can be augmented by interlinking Pranhita river with Indravati River in to Thummidihatti barrage pond or its main water diversion canal with an aqueduct ( at ) across Pranhita river. The point of diversion from the Indravati river is at 174.5 m msl which is the minimum draw down level (MDDL) of the proposed Bhopalpattanam dam. Bhopalpattanam Hydro project is a proposed joint project of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh states as identified in GWDT award. Initially, a weir would be constructed across the Indravati river where its bed level is at 170 m msl to divert its water by gravity canal with tunnels to reach Thammidihatti pond. The weir would get submerged when the Bhopalpattanam dam is constructed up to proposed FRL at 200.254 m msl without any effect on the link canal use. The link canal would also supply irrigation water in Pranhita basin of Maharashtra and the excess water diverted to the Thammidihatti pond can also be used by Maharashtra for lift irrigation. Once Bhopalpattanam dam is constructed, it would also ensure water transfer throughout the year by Indravati to Pranhita link canal in addition to hydro electricity generation. Once Medigedda and other barrages are constructed, it rules out the construction of Inchampally project which is very crucial to Telangana state for harnessing the Godavari water for its full needs to the extent of 1000 tmcft. Interlinking Indravati river with Pranhita river by gravity canal is many times economical proposition for the successful operation of Pranahita Chevella lift irrigation scheme and also useful to Maharashtra without submerging any land (other than river bed) in Chhattisgarh state.

The two trains derailed each other, and four cars fell off the viaduct. 40 people were killed, at least 192 were injured, 12 of which were severe injuries. This serious traffic disaster was caused by both the critical defects of design and the rough management of the bullet train company. Officials responded to the accident by hastily concluding rescue operations and ordering the burial of the derailed cars. These actions elicited strong criticism from Chinese media and online communities. In response, the government issued directives to restrict media coverage, which was met with limited compliance, even on state- owned networks. The collision is the only fatal crash involving high-speed rail (HSR) in China, and is the third-deadliest HSR accident in history, after the 1998 Eschede derailment in Germany and 2013 Santiago de Compostela derailment in Spain. High speed was not a factor in the accident, however, since neither train was moving faster than , a moderate speed for a passenger train. The accident, the first of its kind, had a profound impact on the development of high-speed rail in China. Public confidence in high-speed rail eroded, resulting in fewer passengers using the service. Construction of high- speed rail lines in China was temporarily suspended as the accident was under investigation. Speeds on other major high-speed rail lines in China were reduced. China's reputation in high-speed railway technology was scrutinized internationally. In response to the accident, Railways minister Sheng Guangzu announced a comprehensive two-month railway safety review. The official investigation completed in December 2011 blamed faulty signal systems which failed to warn the second train of the stationary first train on the same track, as well as a series of management failures on the part of railway officials in carrying out due procedure. The accident and subsequent safety improvements helped implement further safety measures helping prevent any further safety accidents in China's high speed rail network. During the years 2012 to 2019, China's high speed rail network did not have any serious accidents. Background The Chinese government has invested billions of dollars in the rapid expansion of its high-speed railway network in recent years, including over RMB¬• 700 billion (US$109 billion) on high speed rail in 2010. China's high speed rail now stretches across more than expanding to by 2012, and is planned to double to about by 2020. The nation's entire rail network carried 1.68 billion rides in 2010 with little or no cause for alarm. The BBC too had reported that at this pace, by 2012, mainland China would have had more high-speed railway tracks than the rest of the world put together, a prediction that came true subsequently. Technology in use Signalling Railway signalling systems are designed to prevent any train from entering a stretch of track occupied by another train. But in the Wenzhou collision, Train D301 ran onto the track occupied by Train D3115, indicating a signal failure. The 28 July 2011 announcement, by the Beijing National Railway Research and Design Institute of Signals and Communication, that signal equipment had a design flaw, and that it would \\"shoulder responsibility\\" for the accident, confirmed that the accident was a result of signal failure. The signalling technology installed on Chinese high speed lines, including the Ningbo‚ÄìTaizhou‚ÄìWenzhou railway where the accident occurred, is Chinese Train Control System CTCS-2 which is the Chinese version of European Train Control System Level 1. The CTCS-2 system uses the classical technology of track circuits to detect the presence of a train on a piece of track. In addition, CTCS-2 uses both fixed-data balises (track-mounted transponders) and controllable-data balises controlled by a Lineside Electronic Unit (LEU) to transmit essential information and signal instructions from the Train Control Center to trains. Information and signal instructions are transmitted by the balises as \\"telegrams\\", which are picked up by a balise transmission module mounted under the head of the train, and sent to an on-board \\"vital computer\\" for decoding. Using the data it has received, the computer calculates a \\"speed control curve\\" showing the maximum speed the train can maintain while allowing sufficient braking distance before any danger. The information is displayed to the train driver on a monitor. Should the driver disregard this information by overspeeding, or enter a danger zone, the Vital Computer can make an automatic brake application. As of 31 July 2011, Chinese authorities had failed to provide any logical explanation of why the safeguards built into the CTCS-2 signal technology had failed to work in the Wenzhou collision. Various announcements indicated both defects in equipment (lightning strikes had disabled devices) and defects in operating procedures (staff operated signals in \\"manual mode\\"). Chinese official announcements were both confused and confusing. An Lusheng, the chief of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, was quoted as saying that a device had \\"failed to turn from green to red\\". But CTCS-2 equipped trains do not rely on drivers observing green or red wayside signals, the driver has a computer-controlled monitor in front of him. Early announcements spoke of Train D3115 being stopped by a lightning strike, but that would not cause the accident. The second train D301 should not have been allowed to run into it. Whether Train D3115 was stopped by lightning or for any other reason is irrelevant. The fuzzy and confused official announcements up to 31 July gave increasing hints that a lightning strike caused some wayside-mounted piece of signal equipment to malfunction (the official investigation report in December 2011 identified a trackside LKD2-T1 signal assembly which malfunctioned after being struck by lightning, causing a false indication in the control center that a section of track was unoccupied). If the equipment was not fail-safe, an incorrect response by staff could then cause an accident. Significantly, on 28 July 2011, An Lusheng \\"faulted the quality of equipment, personnel and on-site controls. He described safeguards as 'still quite weak'.\\" On 4 August 2011 a high-ranking work safety official ruled out the possibility of natural disaster having caused the train crash. \\"Now I can say for sure that this is not a natural disaster,\\" Huang Yi, the spokesman and a leading official with the State Administration of Work Safety, said during an on-line chat hosted by people.com.cn, the online arm of People's Daily. He added that the railway authorities had also pointed out loopholes and deficiencies in safety management, which had emerged in the accident. The official investigation, completed in December 2011, blamed faulty signal systems which had failed to warn the second train of the stationary first train on the same track, as well as a series of management failures on the part of railway officials in carrying out due procedure. Rolling stock CRH2-139E, the trainset that was destroyed in the accident. This picture was captured in February 2011, five months before the accident. The two trains involved were based on technology from Bombardier and Kawasaki. Train CRH1-046B is a variant of the Swedish Bombardier Regina, while the second train CRH2-139E is a derivative of the Japanese E2 Series Shinkansen 'bullet train.' Kawasaki and other companies in Japan are currently challenging China's high-speed rail project for patent license violations. The Chinese maker has been attempting to patent the same technology and alleged improvements. The trains were of the \\"D train\\" class and thus in the first generation of China's express trains, not the faster \\"G train\\" class, which travel at more than . Accident chronology On 23 July, at roughly 20:00 CST, CRH train D3115 (CRH1-046B), carrying 1,072 people and travelling from Hangzhou to Fuzhou South came to a halt over a viaduct near the Ou River. Shortly after, CRH train D301 (CRH2-139E), carrying 558 people and running from Beijing South to Fuzhou, crashed into the rear-end of the stationary D3115. The cause of the crash was initially said to be a lightning strike on one of the line's overhead power lines due to a lightning storm occurring south and west of the viaduct. Lightning reportedly struck the first train, which caused it to stop on the tracks. However, five days after the incident, the Beijing National Railway Research & Design Institute of Signals and Communications Co. Ltd., a railway research institute, claimed responsibility, stating in a report that a signal on the track failed to turn red, and staff failed to notice the error. A much more detailed description of what happened in the accident, correcting earlier accounts, was published in the December 2011 report of the official investigation. The first train D3115 was stopped not by losing power as a result of the lightning strike, but was stopped by the signal system, the Automatic Train Protection (ATP). The lightning had struck a trackside LKD2-T1 signal assembly, burning out its fuses, and violating the rule that it should be 'fail-safe'. This had caused an incorrect indication in the control center that the track section containing train D3115 was unoccupied (the so-called 'green signal'). The driver He Li of train D3115 worked to override the ATP and, after more than seven minutes of waiting, at 8.29 p.m. he got the train moving again, overriding the ATP. As train D3115 entered the next section of track, where the track circuits that indicate the presence of the train were working correctly, the control center now saw that the track section was occupied. But driver Pan Yiheng of the following train D301 had already been given instructions to proceed onto the section of track where D3115 had been stopped, when the control center had a false indication that the track was unoccupied. Despite a message from the control center that D301 should proceed with caution, less than half a minute later train D301 running at collided with train D3115. The fifteenth and sixteenth coaches at the rear of D3115 and the front four coaches of D301 were derailed ‚Äì four coaches fell off the viaduct. Three carriages came to rest horizontally on the ground below while the fourth came to rest vertically, one end on the ground and one end leaning against the viaduct. Soon after the accident, the damaged railway carriages were seen being broken apart by backhoes and buried nearby. The medical teams responding to the accident consisted of staff from Zhejiang No. 1 Hospital, Zhejiang No. 2 Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital and Taizhou Hospital. The evening of the event, 500 Wenzhou residents gave blood in response to early radio appeals by the local blood bank. A survivor, Liu Hongtaohe, recalled that \\"the train suddenly shook violently, casting luggage all around. Passengers cried for help but no crew responded\\" in an interview with China Central Television. CCTV reported on 25 July that the Railways Ministry had declared that 39 people were killed and 192 injured. Two-year-old Xiang Weiyi was the last person rescued, 21 hours after the train crash. Her parents had been killed in the crash. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said on 25 July that two U.S. citizens were among the dead. The Italian consulate of Shanghai said that an Italian citizen was among the dead: Assunta Liguori, a 22-year-old student of the Universit√† degli studi di Napoli L'Orientale. Liguori was travelling with Giovanni Pan, a 23-year-old student from L'Orientale, of Chinese origin. Government response Chinese Communist Party general secretary Hu Jintao and Premier of the State Council Wen Jiabao called for \\"all-out efforts to rescue passengers\\". Train operations were suspended on the line while damaged infrastructure was repaired. Fifty-eight trains were canceled the following day. Sheng Guangzu, the Railways Minister, ordered an investigation into the accident, and arrived at the scene of the accident on midday 24 July. He also apologised for the horrific accident. Vice-Premier Zhang Dejiang flew into Wenzhou to lead rescue efforts. The Ministry of Railways announced that three high-ranking railway officials were fired immediately after the crash. They were identified as Long Jing, head of the Shanghai Railway Bureau; Li Jia, party secretary and the deputy chief of the bureau, He Shengli. The Chinese government had sacked railways minister Liu Zhijun in February 2011, for allegedly taking over 800 million yuan in kickbacks connected with contracts for high-speed rail expansion. Zhang Shuguang, the deputy chief engineer of China's railways, was also arrested in February 2011 and alleged to have amassed $2.8 billion in overseas accounts. The government ordered a two-month nationwide safety campaign on 26 July, as the families of victims demanded more answers. Sheng Guangzu apologised for the collision on behalf of the Railways department and said the campaign would focus on improving China's high-speed network. Government officials had not explained by 25 July why the second train was apparently not warned of the disabled one before the crash took place. Lawyers in China were ordered by the Wenzhou Judicial Bureau not to take on cases from the families of the crash victims. According to a statement issued by the Wenzhou Lawyers' Association, lawyers were told not to take cases because \\"the accident is a major sensitive issue concerning social stability\\". The Wenzhou Judicial Bureau later apologized for the statement, saying its wording had been formulated by the Lawyers' Association and had not been approved. Alt URL The Wenzhou train collision had an immediate and major effect on China's high-speed rail program. The Chinese government formed a commission to investigate the accident with a directive to report its findings in September 2011. On 10 August 2011 the Chinese government announced that it was suspending approvals of any new high-speed rail lines pending the outcome of the investigation. The Minister of Railways announced further cuts in the speed of Chinese high-speed trains, with the speed of the second-tier 'D' trains reduced from . The speed of the remaining trains between Shanghai and Hangzhou was reduced to as of 28 August 2011. To stimulate ridership, which had suffered due to concerns about safety, on 16 August 2011 ticket prices on Chinese high-speed trains were reduced by 5 percent. The train crash sparked public anger on the safety of high speed trains in China and on the handling of the accident, even in otherwise tightly controlled Chinese media. Quality and safety concerns will likely have a serious impact on China's ambition to export cheap high speed train technology to other countries. In November 2011, the state-controlled The Beijing News reported that an investigation by the Chinese government into the collision has concluded that \\"poor management of the local railway administration\\" was to blame. The final report, which was released after a delay in December, found 54 officials responsible along with flaws in the design of the local control centre and some onboard components. Official media directives The Chinese authorities have been accused of attempting to silence reports into the cause of the crash. The Chinese Communist Party's propaganda department has reportedly ordered the media not to send reporters to the scene, not to report too frequently and not to link the story to high- speed rail development. Thomson Reuters reported that the propaganda department issued directives to the nation's media instructing them to not question or elaborate on reports of the train crash. In their coverage, media were directed to promote the theme 'in the face of great tragedy, there's great love.' Xinhuanet released a number of state-sponsored, touching stories as Propaganda Department's indication, such as \\"Love in this sublimation,\\" \\"a city of love and warm\\" and comments. Still, according to the BBC, several Chinese newspapers published editorials criticising the railway ministry, and the state-run Global Times had an unusually scathing editorial. On Friday, 29 July a second directive was issued banning all coverage of the story 'except positive news or that issued by the authorities'; the sudden ban forced newspapers to scrap seven-day anniversary stories they had prepared. The China Business Journal scrapped eight pages, 21st Century Business Herald twelve pages and The Beijing News nine pages. The state-run Xinhua newswire was forced to warn subscribers not to use an investigative report it had issued. The ban was flouted by Beijing-based weekly The Economic Observer, which published an eight-page feature on 30 July, with a front-page letter pledging to pursue the truth on behalf of Xiang Weiyi, the 2-year-old survivor who was orphaned in the crash. Investigation On 28 December 2011 the official accident investigation report presented to the State Council was released to the public. According to this report, the accident occurred due to severe defects in the design of control center equipment, lax equipment inspection and failure to adequately respond to equipment malfunction caused by lightning. The report names 54 officials as bearing responsibility for the accident and the botched rescue effort. The most senior official implicated in the report is former minister Liu Zhijun, who had been detained on corruption charges before the accident, but nonetheless is accused of improperly raising the operating speed of the Ningbo-Taizhou-Wenzhou Railway and compressing the construction schedule of the railway, which resulted in curtailed safety inspection of the line. He is also blamed for failing to assign proper duties to a newly created office within the MOR to oversee passenger-dedicated high- speed railway lines, failing to resolve bureaucratic overlap in the oversight of HSR safety within the Ministry that weakened regulatory oversight, and failing to direct subordinates to institute proper review and inspection procedures for newly developed signaling equipment, which led the defective LKD2-T1 signal equipment to be put into operation. Other senior MOR officials cited include deputy minister Lu Dongfu, MOR chief engineer He Huawu and former MOR deputy chief engineer Zhang Shuguang. The report also assigns fault to executives and engineers of the China Railway Signal & Communications Corp., which designed, produced and installed the defective equipment, executives of the Jingfu Railway (Anhui) Corporation, which permitted the faulty equipment to be installed improperly in breach of the contractual terms. Numerous officials of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, which operates the line, are also singled out for blame including former bureau chief Long Jing, who was fired shortly after the accident, as well as deputy bureau chief, Wang Feng, who ordered that wrecked train carriages be buried in pits dug on-site. The chief and deputy chief of Wenzhou South Station are faulted for inadequate oversight of employees. Among the most junior persons cited is Zang Kai, a worker at Wenzhou South Station who discovered signal failure on the D3212 Train but, in breach of protocol, failed to file a log report of the malfunction and did not communicate with the D301 Train. Reaction Wang Yongping's press conference On orders from the authorities, the rescue effort concluded less than a day following the accident, and the damaged train cars were seen being broken apart by backhoes and buried nearby. The Railway Ministry justified the burial by claiming that the trains contained valuable \\"national level\\" technology that could be stolen. However, hours after the rescuers had been told to stop searching for survivors, a 2-year-old girl was found alive in the wreckage. Chinese media was especially skeptical of the rescue efforts, particularly the burial of trains. In a press conference, the spokesman of the Railway Ministry, Wang Yongping, said that the burial was for facilitating the rescue work. The answer prompted heckling and gasps of disbelief from the journalists assembled. Wang then said to a journalist, \\"whether or not you believe [this explanation], I believe it.\\" (\\".\\") This phrase eventually became an internet meme. When asked why a little girl was found after the rescue work had been announced finished, Wang said, \\"This was a miracle. We did find a living girl in the work thereafter. That was what happened.\\" (\\".\\") There was no evidence that experts or officials entered the front car to investigate the cause of the accident when it was buried. Families of the victims of the crash were outraged at what they viewed was an inadequate investigation, as well as poor organisation and relief in the aftermath of the disaster. Images of the wreckage being shovelled into the pits were circulated widely on the Internet, and led to speculation over a possible mishandling by the government or concealing evidence crucial for the ongoing investigation. Chinese media Despite reported directives from the Publicity Department, Chinese media, both independent and state-owned, directly criticized the Ministry of Railways and voiced their skepticism of the government. Such challenges to officially sanctioned orthodoxy were bold and rare, particularly on programs aired on China's state-owned television. In one instance, in response to Wang Yongping's assurance at the press conference that the Chinese railway system was running on \\"advanced technology\\", news anchor Bai Yansong retorted on China Central Television, \\"The technology may be advanced, but is your management advanced? Are your standard operating procedures advanced? Is the supervision advanced? Is your respect for people advanced? Are all the minute details advanced? At the end of the day, is your overall operational capability advanced?\\" Similarly, Qiu Qiming of CCTV program 24-Hours launched into an on-air tirade about Chinese society: \\"If nobody can be safe, do we still want this speed? Can we drink a glass of milk that's safe? Can we stay in an apartment that will not fall apart? Can the roads we travel on in our cities not collapse? Can we travel in safe trains? And if and when a major accident does happen, can we not be in a hurry to bury the trains? Can we afford the people a basic sense of security? China, please slow down. If you're too fast, you may leave the souls of your people behind.\\" Qi Qixin, a professor at the Transportation Research Institute of Beijing University of Technology, remarked that \\"the problem may have come from the mistakes of dispatching management, instead of technological failure,\\" and \\"The system should have an ability to automatically issue a warning or even stop a train under such circumstances,\\" in a press release. Ren Xianfang, senior analyst at IHS Global Insight in Beijing, said that the pace of development in China had been \\"phenomenal\\", but warned it could not be sustained in the long run. The driver of the crashed train, Pan Yiheng, was hailed as a hero in some quarters on 26 July, for preventing the disaster from becoming worse. He tried to brake the train to keep it from crashing into the rear of the train ahead; he was killed when the brake handle pierced his chest in the crash. It has been stated that had he not acted, at least one more train car would have been derailed, likely increasing the death toll. Online communities Internet users were skeptical that the crash was caused by a natural disaster, instead blaming officials, with one frequently forwarded comment on Sina Weibo microblogging service stating \\"When a country is so corrupt that one lightning strike can cause a train crash ... none of us are exempt. China today is a train rushing through a lightning storm ... we are all passengers\\". MOR Spokesman Wang Yongping gained particular notoriety online, with netizens parodying his various statements and attacking his credibility and character. Numerous cartoons, and even a music video ridiculing him, appeared. On 16 August, he was dismissed from the Ministry of Railways, ostensibly because of his botched handling of the press conference. Wang endured severe stress throughout the negative publicity online, and he was eventually transferred to a position at the Organization for Cooperation of Railways in Poland on 18 August. In reaction, a web post commented sarcastically \\"Quick! Sell all your Polish high-speed rail stocks!\\" Some commentators defended Wang, saying he was merely a scapegoat in a corrupt system. Netizen activity about the crash was also examined. Stock markets Shares in CSR Corp., which built one of the two trains in a joint venture with Canada's Bombardier Inc, fell by 14%, while China Automation Group Ltd., which was responsible for the design and production of the safety and control systems for railways, saw its shares fall by 19% in Hong Kong on 24 and 25 July. China Rail Construction, builder of more than half of the nation's rail links since 1949, fell 6.7%. Shares in China Railway Group also temporarily slid down 7.7%. The high-speed rail woes added to negative market sentiment from the US debt deadlock, sending the Shanghai Composite Index down 3 per cent to 2,688.75. CNR shares fell 9.7%. Overseas An official at Saudi Railways Organization, the kingdom's train network operator, declined to comment on the Chinese crash or whether it might affect the company's decision to award a part of a 2009 $1.8 billion rail contract to a Chinese company. Edwin Merner, the president of Atlantis Investment Research Corp. in Tokyo, reckoned the crash would cause a temporary loss of trust in Chinese railway technology. The crash drew sharp contrasts between China and Japan, with both Chinese online commentators and international publications pointing out that Japan has never experienced a crash on its high-speed rail lines, despite being in operation for over forty years. Many Japanese experts zoomed in on the accident, which was headlined on the front page in almost all major Japanese newspapers the morning after it occurred. In an editorial titled \\"Chinese government must stop cover-ups, trivializing life\\", the Daily Yomiuri called for the national overhaul of signaling systems and lauded the role of social media. The Economist editorialized strongly against the Chinese government, asserting that the accident has \\"shown the limits of dictatorship.\\" At Miller-McCune, Shank and Wasserstrom opined that the crash marks a serious \\"legitimacy crisis\\" for the Chinese government and could mark the end of a \\"confident era.\\" David Bandurski wrote in the International Herald Tribune that the accident and its response was \\"emblematic of a callous, unresponsive political culture that prioritizes instant results over public well-being and accountability.\\" Bandurski called China's high-speed rail development an unsustainable venture mired by political intrigue, corruption, and a 'Great Leap Forward'-style mentality. Conversely, Robert Zeliger of Foreign Policy drew comparisons between China's railway safety record and those of India and the United States. Citing journalist Lloyd Lofthouse, Zeliger points out that between 2007 and the time of the Wenzhou crash, 20% of the 177 accidents during this period actually occurred in the United States, 15% in India, and only 4% in China. He highlighted the much higher death toll of accidents on India's railways. Meanwhile, the Hindustan Times, while criticizing the Chinese government's response, recognized the need for India to \\"learn from\\" China's accident and apply further scrutiny to its own rail networks. Aftermath , the crash has remained the only serious accident on the Chinese high-speed rail network, which now accounts for two-thirds of the world's total high-speed railways, carries over 2 billion passengers every year and still is undergoing large scale expansion.

Early life and performance career Stevens was born in Herculaneum, Missouri to a factory worker father and a mother who owned and operated a small town general store. He debuted on Broadway in 1969, dancing in The Fig Leaves Are Falling (book and lyrics by Allan Sherman and music by Albert Hague). This was followed by roles in the 1970s productions of Billy, Jimmy, The Boy Friend, On the Town, Seesaw, and Irene, in addition to the 1973 benefit concert Sondheim: A Musical Tribute. Stevens also went on to perform with Chita Rivera and Christopher Chadman in Rivera's acclaimed nightclub act Chita Plus Two, which he also choreographed.Gottfried, Martin (2003) All His Jazz: The Life and Death of Bob Fosse. Boston: Da Capo Press. Choreography and A Chorus Line As his career as a Broadway gypsy took off, Stevens transitioned into a choreographer, assisting Peter Gennaro on Irene and co- choreographing the short-lived rock musical Rockabye Hamlet with Gower Champion. In 1975, Stevens had the honor of assisting Bob Fosse on the musical Chicago, which starred Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera, who would become a lifelong friend and frequent collaborator with Stevens. Additional choreography credits include the short-lived Broadway musical Rachael Lily Rosenbloom (And Don't You Ever Forget It) and the Frank Loesser revue Perfectly Frank on Broadway in 1980. Perhaps Stevens' greatest contribution to musical theatre history, however, was his decision to organize a series of tape sessions among Broadway dancers with Michon Peacock, which would eventually become the internationally acclaimed musical A Chorus Line. Originally conceived as a way to create a resident company of dancers who would create their own productions, Stevens and Peacock initially arranged the first tape session, inviting a group of seasoned Broadway dancers and Broadway director/choreographer Michael Bennett to \\"talk about life and what it means to be a dancer.\\"Walsh, Thommie in Lee, Baayork et al. (2006) On the Line: The Creation of A Chorus Line Milwaukee: Hal Leonard Productions As these initial talks developed into A Chorus Line, many of Stevens' stories and anecdotes made their way into the show's script. Stevens participated in the first workshop of the show at the Public Theater, where he played the role of Larry, before ultimately leaving the show to work on Chicago. Hollywood Stevens' choreography credits soon expanded to include film and TV as well. In 1974, Stevens choreographed the dance sequences in The Great Gatsby with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow; he then went on to choreograph such films as The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas with Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton, and Johnny Dangerously with Michael Keaton, and She's Having A Baby with Kevin Bacon. Some television credits include specials for Mary Tyler Moore, Cheryl Ladd, Disneyland's 30th Anniversary, and the People's Choice Awards. He also performed in the film Tommy and the 1971 TV special of Dames at Sea starring Ann-Margret and Ann Miller.

Off-Broadway he choreographed Zombie Prom, The Body Shop, and directed and choreographed Sheba. He also did the national tours of Dreamgirls in 1997 and 1998, and the 20th Anniversary Tour of Jesus Christ Superstar. Other cutting edge work included The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, the recreation of Bob Fosse's original choreography for Chita Rivera: The Dancer's Life on Broadway, staging numbers for Martin Short and Nathan Lane on Late Night with David Letterman, and was currently developing the new musical La Familglia. Death Stevens died in 2011 after battling Hodgkin's lymphoma. His life was commemorated on November 8, 2011 with the tribute performance In Celebration of Tony Stevens at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, which featured performances by Chita Rivera, Jack Lee, Sam Harris, Debbie Gravitte, Michon Peacock, Laura Kenyon, Harvey Evans, Robert Cuccioli, Nathan Sampson, Andy Bew, Carol Schuberg, Dante Puleio, and Gerry McIntyre.

The Peugeot suspension was reinforced and the Peugeot engine had its capacity increased from 1290 cc to approximately 1500 cc. The extensive use made of Peugeot parts promised a car that would retail at a competitive price. Unfortunately, however, Eug√®ne Martin never got through the hurdles necessary to put his promising design into series production. Nevertheless, its appearance at the Motor Show attracted the attention of Jacques Bernard of Salmson, and Martin found himself invited to take charge of the technical development of Salmson‚Äôs own contender in the coup√© sector. The result was the Salmson 2300 Sport. In the end this would turn out to be the last car produced by Salmson, but it nevertheless enjoyed commercial success ahead of anything achieved by the Martin-Sp√©ciale, and also competed, from 1955, over three successive years in the Le Mans 24 Hour Race.amicale.salmson.free.fr References Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of France Category:Car manufacturers of France ","title":"Martin-Sp√©ciale"},{"id":"32508800","text":"The Dressmaker is a 1988 British drama film directed by Jim O'Brien and starring Joan Plowright, Billie Whitelaw and Pete Postlethwaite.

Two years later, he became a cabinet minister in the Mamata Banerjee ministry. In December 2018, he was elected mayor following the resignation of the incumbent Sovan Chatterjee. He is the first Muslim since the independence of India to become the mayor of the city. Personal life Hakim's grandfather migrated from the Gaya district of Bihar to Kolkata and started his business. His father, Abdul Hakim, was a law officer for the Kolkata Port Trust. Hakim's mother, Manika Mukhopadhyay is a Hindu and was an assistant head-mistress of a school in Kolkata. Her ancestral house is in Faridpur district, Bangladesh. He is married to Ismat Hakim. They have three daughters‚ÄîPriyadarshini, Shabba and Afsha. They live in Chetla, a neighborhood of South Kolkata. He is nicknamed Bobby after the Australian cricketer Bobby Simpson. Hakim graduated from Heramba Chandra College with a degree in commerce. He is the organizer-in- chief of the Chetla Agrani Durga Puja committee. Ministerial career In the late 1990s, Hakim was first elected as a councilor of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. On 11 November 2009, he was elected to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Alipore constituency after defeating Communist Party candidate, Kaustav Chatterjee by a margin of 27,555 votes in the by- poll. In the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, Hakim won from the Kolkata Port constituency as a candidate of the All India Trinamool Congress. He received 63,866 votes and defeated his nearest rival Moinuddin Shams of the All India Forward Bloc by a margin of 25,033 votes. Subsequently, he became the Minister of Urban Development and Municipal Affairs in the first Mamata Banerjee cabinet. On 3 March 2013, the Ultadanga Flyover (located in East Kolkata) collapsed, leaving three people injured. Hakim blamed a crack that was detected in the flyover as a reason behind the collapse. He said that the problem was \\"not related to maintenance but a technical fault in the bolt system\\". In June 2014, he announced that 22 new municipalities would be created in West Bengal. In the 2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, Hakim defeated his nearest rival, Rakesh Singh of the Left Front-Indian National Congress alliance by a margin of 26,548 votes. On 16 June 2017, he was appointed chairman of the Tarakeswar Development Board. Mayor of Kolkata On 20 November 2018, Sovan Chatterjee, then mayor of Kolkata, resigned as a cabinet minister. Two days later, he resigned from the post of the mayor of Kolkata. Subsequently, Trinamool Congress announced that Hakim would be their mayoral candidate. The state government passed the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (Second Amendment) Bill, 2018. This allows a candidate who is not a member of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation to be appointed mayor of the city, provided they are elected to the same within a period of six months. On 28 November 2018, Hakim filed his nomination. The following day the Bharatiya Janata Party announced Mina Debi Purohit (former deputy mayor) as their mayoral candidate. He secured 121 votes while Purohit received five votes; Hakim was elected mayor. He became the first Muslim since the independence of India to be elected mayor of Kolkata. On getting elected, Hakim said that \\"pollution and environment are two areas\\" on which he would like to work. He also setup a WhatsApp number, promising to act on complaints received on that mobile number. Making Kolkata cleaner and greener, ensuring a continuous supply of drinking water to the city, building toilets in slums and making the slums \\"model residential areas\\" were his priorities as mayor. In January 2019, it was announced that Hakim would contest ward no. 82 of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. In a by-election, he won the ward and defeated his nearest rival Jiban Sen of the Bharatiya Janata Party by a margin of 13,987 votes; Hakim received 16,564 votes. Controversies In 2016, the Narada sting operation video was released in which Hakim was seen allegedly taking bribes. On 19 September 2017, he was questioned for eight hours by the Central Bureau of Investigation at Nizam Palace about the sting operation. Hakim said that the CBI probe was a \\"political conspiracy\\" against his party and that \\"he was not seen taking cash in any of the footage\\". Before the 2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, Hakim, while speaking to Maleeha Hamid Sidiqqui of Pakistani newspaper Dawn, referred to his constituency as \\"mini-Pakistan\\". However, he denied making such a statement. He said \\"she (the Pakistani journalist) only asked me that this place looks like Karachi of Pakistan. I did not make any comment\\". He also said that he was \\"being targeted for being a Muslim and that it was a communal conspiracy\\".

He was the Deputy Speaker of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from 2016 until his death in December 2018, and previously a cabinet minister in the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) government's first term in office. He had held the portfolios of Minister for Cooperation and Inland Water Transport and Minister for Correctional Administration. Safwi retired from the IPS in 2005 as Director General of Police (Fire and Emergency Services) in West Bengal. He held many other offices during his IPS career and was a recipient of both the President's Police Medal for distinguished service and the Police Medal for Meritorious Service. Owing to his specialisation in law and order management, Safwi was appointed as the first-ever Inspector General of South Bengal with an aim to control the rising crimes in the state.However, despite his accomplishments, many felt that his differences with the then Chief Minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, resulted in him being unfairly denied a chance to serve as Police Commissioner of Kolkata. After retiring from the IPS, Safwi entered politics. He was inspired to join the TMC in 2009 by Mamata Banerjee's honesty and the service she had rendered to the people, especially the farmers in Singur. He had publicly stated his desire to defeat 'Buddhababu\\" from his home turf of Jadavpur, in the 2011 Assembly Elections, as the main aim of his political career. However, following an intervention by TMC Supremo, Safwi was allotted a different constituency owing to his rapport with TMC MP Sultan Ahmed. The move turned out to be a masterstroke as not only was he was elected for that party as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA] from the Uluberia Purba constituency in the 2011 West Bengal state assembly election, with a margin of over 19,000 votes but the election also witnessed his closest friend for over four decades, Retired IAS Officer Manish Gupta, defeating Buddhababu from his own seat of Jadavpir. Safwi was inducted as a cabinet minister in the Mamata Banerjee government on 20 May 2011. In 2016, Safwi was renominated by the TMC from the Uluberia Purba seat and retained it by a margin of 16,269 votes. Owing to his seniority and experience in administration, he was elected unanimously as the Deputy Speaker of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly.

It 2014 the work started with ang of ‚Çπ2100 crores and completed in October 2017 and water was released by irrigation Minister, Harish Rao. It took a little over three decades to be completed.https://telanganatoday.com/telangana-harish-rao-vows-ensure- water-20-lakh-acres The ayacut The original design for the project was 25 TMC water capacity, but later it was increased to 40 TMC to reach the prescribed target. This project provides water to the most drought prone areas in Mahbubnagar. The water is sourced from Krishna river, by lifting water 300 meters above river level and channeling into the reservoir. Achampet Branch Canal will be expanded by a length of 14 km, creating an additional ayacut of 15,000 acres (10,000 acres in Uppunuthala mandal and 5,000 acre) in Achampet mandal. Reservoirs Around 51 balancing reservoirs with 20 TMC water capacity are proposed under MGKLIS for assured water supply to the ayacut. They are scheduled to be completed by June 2019. The Buddaram Peddavagu Lake is proposed to be converted into a reservoir in 2018. It was conceptualised and conceived way back in 2008, due to delays it is completing in June 2019. With this reservoir, the entire parched lands under Wanaparthy district will get water for irrigation. This would also ensure continuous flow of water Water Lifting This project has three lifts, first lift in Eluru (Kollapur mandal) second in Jonnalaboguda village and third lift in Gudipally village. There are small reservoirs yet to be constructed to store the water which is lifted from the backwaters of the Srisailam. This project serves water through canals which will fill the lakes of all the villages and towns present in the five constituencies of Mahabubnagar district. Pumps ABB partnered for industrial-strength water pumping technology with Andritz AG, to deploy five of its massive and high-capacity 30-megawatt (MW), 11-kilovolt (kV) motors, each capable of pumping 23,000 litres per second. ABB also supplied substation equipment, transformers, and a digitally-enabled supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) monitoring system that ensures a steady and reliable drawing of power from the grid and smooth pumping of water into the reservoir.

Project It is located in Pulichintala village in Guntur district near the Krishna River, between Vykuntapuram barrage near Amaravati and the Nagarjuna Sagar dam. It has 30 Tmcft live storage capacity to impound the Krishna river flood waters generated from the catchment area located downstream of Nagarjuna sagar Tail Pond. This project reservoir will provide timely water supply to downstream Prakasam Barrage. Water to the Prakasam Barrage can be supplied from Pattiseema lift / Polavaram irrigation canal during monsoon months. Vellatur lift irrigation scheme (near ) with 13,000 acres irrigated area in Nalgonda district drawing water from the Pulichintala reservoir has been constructed. This lift can pump water from MSL when the reservoir's gross storage is as low as 4 Tmcft. The proposed Yadadri Thermal Power Plant would also draw its water needs from the reservoir. Godavari Penna River Linking Main article : Vykuntapuram Barrage To stabilize the existing irrigated ayacut area under Nagarjuna Sagar right canal, a new lift project construction with greenfield alignment was started having five-step ladder pumping Stages and Canal to transfer 7,000 cusecs of Godavari water from Prakasam barrage back waters into the Nagarjuna Sagar right canal near Nekarikallu in the first phase of Godavari Penna River linking project to utilize 73 tmcft of Godavari water. With FRL 25M newly created Vykuntapuram Barrage pond will have back waters beyond Pokkunuru up to the toe of Pulichinthala Project. It is more economical to construct First stage pump house of this lift project to lift water from Prakasam Barrage Back water into Newly Created Vykuntapuram Barrage pond and the second Lift stage from Vykuntapuram Barrage pond to Existing K.L Rao sagar pulichintala Project and later lift Stages from K.L Rao Sagar to Nagarjuna sagar right canal. It will shorten the length of this lift project canal, Pressure Main and fewer lift stages and also enables to lift water up to Srisailam Project via existing Reversible Reverse turbine pump houses in Nagarjuna Sagar Dam and its tail pond project. It is even more economical if with construction of a new gravity canal from Ibrahimpatnam to Vykuntapuram Barrage pond to deliver the Polavaram right main canal/ Budameru diversion canal waters directly into the Vykuntapuram barrage pond since Polavaram right main canal level is 33 m MSL at Ambapuram hill near Vijayawada. A low level lift canal from the Krishna river located near at MSL in the downstream of Pulichintala dam will be executed to feed Godavari water diverted from Polavaram Dam to some of the existing command area (situated below 60 m MSL) under Nagarjuna Sagar right bank canal to facilitate extension of Nagarjuna Sagar right bank canal connecting to Kandaleru feeder canal / Somasila reservoir for serving irrigation needs in Prakasam, Potti Sriramulu Nellore and Chittur districts including Chennai drinking water supply.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Furness, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of four other local parishes. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The oldest fabric in the present church is the late Norman south doorway, dating from the 12th century. Alterations and additions were made to the church in the 16th and the 19th centuries. In 1873‚Äì74 the church was restored by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. This included rebuilding the nave, restoring the chancel and adding a new aisle. They removed the west gallery and reseated the body of the church. Stone from St Bees was used for the external dressings, and the interior was faced with Runcorn sandstone. In 1900 the south west tower was replaced by Austin and Paley, the successors of Paley and Austin. Architecture The church is constructed in stone rubble with ashlar dressings, and has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave, a three-bay chancel, a south aisle, a south porch, and a southwest tower. The windows and bell openings are round-headed, following the style of the Norman doorway. The tower is in three stages, with buttresses and a corbel table. At its summit are a coped parapet and gablets to the east and west. The bell openings are louvred. Internally, the arcade is carried on round piers. In the aisle is a restored piscina. The stained glass includes works by Kempe, Shrigley and Hunt, and by William Morris, (designed by Burne-Jones). External features In the churchyard to the south of the church are three more Grade II listed buildings. The sundial is possibly the stump of a medieval churchyard cross. The Atkinson monument consists of a headstone dated 1805. Also to the south of the church is a group of four tombs dating from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. There is a ring of 12 bells in the tower. Originally a ring of 8, they were augmented to 10 and later to 12.

A series of public hearings were held throughout 2011 and 2012. The Inquiry published the Leveson Report in November 2012, which reviewed the general culture and ethics of the British media, and made recommendations for a new, independent, body to replace the existing Press Complaints Commission, which would have to be recognised by the state through new laws. Prime Minister David Cameron, under whose direction the inquiry had been established, said that he welcomed many of the findings, but declined to enact the requisite legislation. Part 2 of the inquiry was to be delayed until after criminal prosecutions regarding events at the News of the World, but the Conservative Party's 2017 manifesto stated that the second part of the inquiry would be dropped entirely, and this was confirmed by Culture Secretary Matt Hancock in a statement to the House of Commons on 1 March 2018. Background In 2007, News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were convicted of illegal interception of phone messages. According to the News of the World, this was an isolated incident, but The Guardian claimed that evidence existed that this practice extended beyond Goodman and Mulcaire. In 2011, after a civil settlement with Sienna Miller, the Metropolitan Police Service set up a new investigation, Operation Weeting. In July 2011, it was revealed that News of the World reporters had hacked the voicemail of murder victim Milly Dowler. Prime Minister David Cameron announced that a public inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 would be chaired by Lord Justice Leveson on 13 July 2011. 14 September 2011 press release stated Part 1 of the Leveson Inquiry would be addressing: : and Part 2: : Part 2 would have been addressed later because of ongoing investigations by law enforcement organisations in Operations Weeting, Elveden and Tuleta. Inquiry On 20 July 2011, Cameron announced in a speech to Parliament the final terms of reference of Leveson's inquiry, stating that it would extend beyond newspapers to include broadcasters and social media. He also announced a panel of six people who have been working with the judge on the inquiry: * Sir David Bell, former chairman of the Financial Times * Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty * Lord Currie, former Ofcom director * Elinor Goodman, former political editor of Channel 4 News * George Jones, former political editor of the Daily Telegraph * Sir Paul Scott-Lee QPM, former Chief Constable of West Midlands Police The Inquiry was funded through two Government departments: the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Home Office. Core participants were designated by Leveson as being: News International, the Metropolitan Police, victims, Northern and Shell Network Ltd, Guardian News and Media Ltd, Associated Newspapers Ltd, Trinity Mirror, Telegraph Media Group, and the National Union of Journalists. In January 2012 Surrey Police were added to the list of Core Participants. 14 September 2011 press release also named 46 politicians, sportsmen, other public figures, and members of the public who may have been victims of media intrusion and who have been granted \\"core participant\\" status in the inquiry. As of November 2011 this number had increased to 51. Leveson Love Triangle It was reported in the media that Leveson had attended two parties in the prior 12 months at the London home of Matthew Freud, son-in-law of Rupert Murdoch and head of Freud Communications PR firm. According to The Independent, Freud had \\"agreed to do some free consultancy work for the Sentencing Council.\\" The revelations led to a number of Labour MPs calling for Leveson to be removed from the Inquiry. These were two large evening events attended in Leveson's capacity as Chairman of the Sentencing Council, and with the knowledge of the Lord Chief Justice. Witnesses Oral evidence was taken at the Royal Courts of Justice, and was streamed live over the Internet. Over three modules, 337 witnesses were called and about 300 other statements made. Hearings for the first module took place from November 2011 to February 2012, and considered the relationship between the press and the public. This module included testimony from Sally Dowler (mother of Milly Dowler), Kate and Gerry McCann (parents of the missing Madeleine McCann), and Chris Jefferies who was wrongly arrested for the murder of Joanna Yeates in 2011. The inquiry heard joint testimony from Anna van Heeswijk (Object), Jacqui Hunt (Equality Now), Heather Harvey (Eaves) and Marai Larasi (End Violence against Women) as well as the singer Charlotte Church regarding the image of women in tabloid journalism. It also included the actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, the author J.K. Rowling, and figures from journalism and broadcasting: Nick Davies, Paul McMullan, Alastair Campbell, Piers Morgan, Kelvin MacKenzie, Richard Desmond, Ian Hislop, James Harding, Alan Rusbridger, Mark Thompson, Lord Patten, Michael Grade, Lord Hunt and Paul Dacre. The next module (February and March) examined the relationship between the press and police, and saw testimony from political and police figures, including Brian Paddick, Lord Prescott, Simon Hughes, John Yates, Andy Hayman, Sir Paul Stephenson, Elizabeth Filkin, Lord Condon, Lord Stevens, Lord Blair and Cressida Dick. The final module (April to June), on the relationship between press and politicians, saw testimony from a variety of senior politicians, including four Prime Ministers, along with press figures such as Aidan Barclay, Evgeny Lebedev, James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch, Viscount Rothermere, Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks. Report Publication The 2,000-page final report was published on 29 November 2012, along with a 48-page executive summary. Leveson found that the existing Press Complaints Commission was not sufficient, and recommended a new independent body, which would have a range of sanctions available to it, including fines and direction of the prominence of apologies and corrections. Membership of the body would be voluntary, but incentivised by schemes such as a kitemark, an inquisitorial arbitration service for handling tort claims such as libel and breach of privacy, and by allowing exemplary damages to be awarded in cases brought against non-participants in the scheme, something not usually part of English law. Leveson rejected the characterisation of his proposal as \\"statutory regulation of the press\\". Leveson also made recommendations regarding the Data Protection Act, the powers and duties of the Information Commissioner, and about conduct of relations between the press, the police, and politicians. He praised the satirical magazine Private Eye for previously having refused to join the Press Complaints Commission, saying it was an 'understandable consequence' of the perceived closeness between the Commission and 'those so often held to account by that publication'. Reaction Shortly after the publication of the report, David Cameron made a statement to the House of Commons. Cameron welcomed many of Leveson's findings, but expressed \\"serious concerns and misgivings\\" regarding the prospect of implementing the changes with legislation. Ed Miliband, the Leader of the Opposition, called for full implementation of the report. Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, and leader of the Liberal Democrats was unable to agree on a position with his coalition partner Cameron, instead making his own statement agreeing that changes in the law were necessary. In leading newspaper stories the following day, the Financial Times, the Daily Telegraph, The Independent, The Times, The Sun, the Daily Express, and the Daily Mirror broadly agreed with Cameron's position, while The Guardian declared that Miliband has taken a \\"principled position\\", but that \\"great care\\" would be required for the legislation. It stated that \\"[Cameron] who commissioned it and who has had very little time in which to study it, should think carefully before dismissing significant parts of it.\\" It added, \\"The press should treat it with respect ‚Äì and not a little humility.\\" Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, which had never signed up to the PCC, said he was in concurrence with a lot of Leveson's findings and the handling of the inquiry. However, he disagreed with suggestions that those publications which did not voluntarily join up to the proposed self-regulatory body should be penalised by paying heavy costs and exemplary damages on potential libel actions, even if they won the case. The leader of the National Union of Journalists, Michelle Stanistreet, hailed Leveson's backing of a contractual \\"conscience clause\\". Victims group Hacked Off called for full implementation of Leveson's recommendations, starting a petition which was signed by over 145,000 people (as of 10 December 2012). Gerry McCann noted that Cameron had earlier made a pledge that he would implement the report if it was not \\"bonkers\\". J.K. Rowling, who gave evidence to the inquiry, wrote that she did this in good faith and felt \\"duped and angry\\" by the Prime Minister's response, and victims refused to meet the Culture Secretary, speaking of a sense of \\"betrayal\\". Talks regarding implementation between politicians and the press were scheduled to start in December 2012, and Lord Hunt, the current chair of the PCC, said the new regulator should be set up by summer 2013. Addressing a conference in Sydney on privacy and the internet, Lord Justice Leveson stated he was watching developments in the UK \\"with interest\\", but declined to comment further. He said: \\"It is because I treat the report as a judgment and judges simply do not enter into discussion about judgments they have given. They do not respond to comment, however misconceived; neither do they seek to correct error.\\" A small issue which received some minor press attention, was an incident where the Leveson report incorrectly listed a \\"Brett Straub\\" as one of the founders of The Independent newspaper. The name originated from Wikipedia vandalism by one of Straub's friends as a prank, who in several erroneous edits falsely included Straub's name in several articles across the site. Associated Newspapers Ltd challenged a ruling on the admissibility of anonymous evidence by inquiry chairman Lord Justice Leveson. The presiding judges refused the application for judicial review on the grounds that individual anonymity requests should be dealt with by the chairman of the inquiry rather than the judiciary. Maria Miller expenses row On 12 December 2012, it was reported that during a telephone call to The Daily Telegraph Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman, Craig Oliver, had warned the newspaper against running a critical story on MP's expenses claimed by Culture Secretary Maria Miller because of her role in enacting proposals in the Leveson report. Downing Street denied that any threats were made. The Telegraph had reported that Miller had claimed ¬£90,000 of expenses between 2005 and 2009 for a house in which her parents were living. Miller herself claimed they were dependents. The Parliamentary Commission for Standards subsequently launched an investigation into Miller's expenses. Writing in The Guardian on 15 December, the journalist Tanya Gold argued the episode demonstrated the need for a free press. Cost According to page 388 of the Government Response to the House of Lords Select Committee on the Inquiries Act 2005 published in 2013, the total cost of the Leveson Inquiry was ¬£5.4 million.

It was commissioned by King Charles III of Spain and headed by botanists Hip√≥lito Ruiz L√≥pez, Jos√© Antonio Pav√≥n Jim√©nez and Joseph Dombey. Background During the 18th century, Europe saw a flowering interest in the science of botany that in Spain crystallized in the organization of a series of scientific expeditions to Spanish colonial territories in America, the Pacific islands and Asia. King Charles III of Spain was very much in favor of this type of scientific research and provided funding for several explorations in the later part of the century. Preparations Due to his formation under Casimiro G√≥mez Ortega at Madrid's Royal Botanical Garden, Hip√≥lito Ruiz L√≥pez was named head botanist of the expedition, with French physician Joseph Dombey and pharmacologist Jos√© Antonio Pav√≥n Jim√©nez appointed as his assistants. Two prestigious botanical illustrators, Joseph Bonete and Isidro G√°lvez, also accompanied the expedition. Expedition The expedition sailed from C√°diz in 1777 and arrived at Lima in April 1778. For over ten years, from 1778 to 1788, they explored the territories of present Peru and Chile studying and collecting specimens. The expedition suffered all kinds of setbacks during this time, ranging from the sinking of the ship San Pedro de Alcantara in 1784 that carried numerous botanical samples, a 1785 fire in the Peruvian population in Macora that resulted in the loss of additional samples and equipment, to quarrels between the members of the expeditionary team, specially between Ruiz and Dombey, that resulted in the latter leaving the group in 1784. He was replaced by Juan Jos√© Tafalla Navascu√©s that same year. In 1788, the bulk of the expedition returned to Spain, leaving only Tafalla in Peru with a mandate to continue sending material. Painters Xavier Cortes and Jose Gabriel Rivera joined botanist Agustin Jose Manzanilla in 1793. Between 1799 and 1808, an herbarium was set up in the territory of present Quito (Ecuador) to further study the Huayaquilensis Flora, that continued making regular mailings of material to Spain until the death of Tafalla in 1811. All together, more than 3,000 specimens of plants were collected and 2,500 life-sized botanical illustrations were produced, and when they returned to Spain they brought back a great many living plants, among which was a medicinal remedy for the flu as well as toothaches, using as a base the boiled sprouts of Buddleja incana. The collections that arrived in C√°diz in 1788 were in the most part in good condition, and were housed in Madrid's Royal Botanical Garden and the Gabinete de Historia Natural, the precursor of the Museum of Natural History. The discoveries included about 150 new genera and 500 new species, which still retain the names given them by Ruiz and Pav√≥n. Unfortunately, a part of the collection consisting of 53 crates with 800 illustrations, dried plants, seeds, resins and minerals was lost when the ship transporting it was wrecked on the coast of Portugal. Publications Flora Peruviana, et Chilensis. Hip√≥lito Ruiz L√≥pez and Jos√© Antonio Pav√≥n Jim√©nez published Flora Peruviana et Chilensis prodromus in ten volumes, richly illustrated with engravings of the specimens. The first four volumes were published between 1798 and 1802. The last six volumes were published after the death of Ruiz. Ruiz and Pav√≥n also published together Systema vegetabilium florae peruvianae chilensis in 1798, and Flora peruviana, et chilensis, sive descriptiones, et icones, between 1798 and 1802. The journals Ruiz produced for his exploration of South America during these years are remarkable for their breadth of ethnobotanical and natural history knowledge. Of particular interest at the time was pharmacological knowledge of New World plants such as Chinchona, the source of the anti-malarial, quinine. In addition to detailed descriptions and paintings of the flora and fauna of Peru and Chile, Ruiz observed the geology and weather of the area, and included cultural information about the life of the Indians and the colonists of the area. The result of these observations was the publication of Quinolog√≠a o tratado del √°rbol de la quina in Madrid, 1792, that was promptly translated into Italian in 1792, German in 1794 and English in 1800. In addition to the detailed descriptions and paintings of the flora and fauna of Peru and Chile, Ruiz also reflected on the geology and the weather conditions of the explored territories. He also included ethnological information about the lifestyle of both the indigenous population and the colonists that had settled in those areas. Aftermath Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid Hip√≥lito Ruiz L√≥pez was named a member of the Royal Academy of Medicine in 1794, and he published various works in that body's Memoires. After Ruiz died on 1816, Pav√≥n sold a part of the collections of the expedition to Aylmer Bourke Lambert, who had translated several botanical papers from the expedition, and to Philip Barker Webb. Thanks to Lambert, he was later elected member of the Linnean Society of London. The main collection consisting of more than ten thousand engravings remained at the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid, together with 2,254 botanical drawings with descriptions. Most of the documentation related to the expedition and the Flora peruviana publication is at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, in Madrid. The ethnological material from the expedition can be found today at the Museum of the Americas, also in Madrid. Also in the Archives of the Real Jard√≠n Bot√°nico in Madrid was Flora Huayaquilensis an expedition by Juan Jos√© Tafalla Navascu√©s, a Spaniard who was one of the first who traveled to South America and documenting the different plants with wonderful paintings and written descriptions. All of this work was in the archives and only published by Dr. Estrella after searching the Real Jard√≠n Bot√°nico in Madrid archives and finding the informaction that formed, Flora Huayaquilensis and finally the life work of Tafalla was published.

His brother Charles was also a professional footballer. Born in Nottingham, Shelton played for Notts Rangers, Notts County, Loughborough and Ilkeston Town, and earned six caps for England between 1889 and 1892. Early career Alf Shelton was one of three brothers ‚Äì Harry and Charlie Shelton the others ‚Äì who did so much for Nottingham football. Alf was educated at St. Nicholas School, which he left to join Notts Rangers. He signed in 1884. When the club collapsed in 1888 he, along with other members, threw in their lot with \\"The Magpies\\", the nickname for Notts County. He signed in August 1888. A wing half with exceptional stamina, he was a difficult player to get past. He also excelled in heading, often getting his head in the way of goal-bound shots. NOTE: The Dykes book claims that Alf Shelton left Notts Rangers and signed for Notts County because Notts Rangers collapsed. Wikipedia and Football Club History Database show that Notts Rangers played in the 1888‚Äì89 and 1889‚Äì90 FA Cup competitions and took part in the first season, 1889‚Äì90, of the Midland League. 1888‚Äì89 season Alf Shelton, playing at wing‚Äìhalf, made his Notts County & League debut on 8 September 1888 at Anfield, the then home of Everton. Notts County lost to the home team 2‚Äì1. Alf Shelton appeared in 21 of the 22 League matches played by Notts County in season 1888‚Äì89. 21 appearances was the record for a Notts County player in season 1888‚Äì89. As a wing‚Äìhalf (21 appearances ) he played in a Notts County midfield that achieved big (three‚ÄìLeague‚Äìgoals‚Äìin‚Äìa‚Äìmatch‚Äìor‚Äìmore) wins on two separate occasions. (registration & fee required) 1889 onwards Alf Shelton appeared in both of Notts County' two FA Cup Finals and won six England caps, and in 1892 was offered the opportunity to captain the newly formed Liverpool club. Despite what constituted a most generous offer at the time (¬£250) per annum he was not tempted to leave the Magpies. He played for Notts County from 1888‚Äì1896 and then moved to League Division 2 club, Loughborough. He only stayed with Loughborough for the one season, 1896‚Äì1897. He signed for Ilkeston Town in July 1897. Ilkeston Town competed in the Midland League and the FA Cup. One of their two best cup runs was in 1897-1898 when they reached the 5th Qualifying Round. It is not known whether Shelton played in that Cup run but he was on their books as a player. (registration & fee required) End of career Ilkeston Town folded in 1900 and it is assumed that is when Shelton retired as a player. In the same year he returned to Notts County as a Director on the Club' Board. He was on the County Board until 1910. He died in tragic circumstances on 24 July 1923. It is not recorded whether he worked at the Royal Ordnance Factory, but he was on site and was killed when a crane collapsed onto him. In one source the factory is described as a Cammell Laird factory. The factory was opened by H. M. Government in 1916 as a Royal Ordnance Factory to manufacture shells for the Western Front. Cammell Laird built the factory and managed it on behalf of HM Government. In the year Shelton met his fatal accident the site had been bought outright by Cammell Laird and the site was used to make railway goods wagons.

The archive was founded by Paul Meier in 1997 at the University of Kansas and includes hundreds of recordings of English speakers throughout the world. IDEA is divided into 10 major sections: Africa, Asia, Australia-Oceania, Caribbean, Central America, Europe, Middle East, North America, South America and Special Collections, with further divisions by country. Most speakers read a passage of scripted text and also speak some unscripted text, usually containing biographical information about themselves, such as their age, where they were born and where they have lived. This allows the listeners to evaluate the subject's accent or dialect based upon where that subject has spent most of his or her life. The Special Collections section contains unique information related to accent and dialect studies. For instance, one subsection is devoted to Holocaust survivors while another features readings of \\"Comma Gets a Cure\\" (the standard scripted text for most IDEA subjects) by trained speech teachers in the General American dialect. Another part of the Special Collections section is devoted to oral histories and allows subjects to discuss the places in which they grew up and reflect on their heritage. Still another subsection of the Special Collections contains native speakers pronouncing place names, people names and idioms from well-known plays often produced in the theatre. The speakers sometimes add interesting commentary on these words and terms. The geographical locations of all the subjects featured on the site can be viewed on IDEA's Global Map. The Archive is used primarily by students of accents and dialects, researchers, linguists, actors and those wishing to either study English pronunciation or learn a new dialect or accent. Anyone can submit a sample recording by visiting the \\"Submit A Sample\\" page of the Website. University of Kansas professor and dialect coach Paul Meier, author of Accents & Dialects for Stage and Screen, created IDEA. Since its founding in 1997, the Archive has added approximately 70 associate editors, who are responsible for gathering new primary-source recordings. Senior editors are Eric Armstrong, Geraldine Cook, John Fleming, Bill McCann, and David Nevell. Cameron Meier is executive editor, and Dylan Paul is webmaster and special consultant.

The core theme of the museum is the presentation of Bronze Age settlements. The museum has three reconstructed single-room houses (Wohnstallh√§user) or longhouses (Langh√§user) that combine livestock stalls and living accommodation under one roof, a burial hut (Totenh√ºtte) and a pit-house (Grubenhaus), as they would have looked based on local archaeological finds. The longhouses have been further enhanced by various, everyday household and handiwork items. One of the longhouses contains an exhibition of the important aspects of life in the Bronze Age some 3,000 years ago. The museum gives visitors a diverse range of historical activities such as bronze casting, bread baking, Feuerschlagen, spinning and weaving as well as modern activities to participate in and try out. In 1969 the first archaeological discoveries of ceramic shards and building floor plans were made during building work at Lake Hitzacker (Hitzacker See). Not until 1987 were planned archaeological digs carried out on the area, because the expansion of the lake and upgrade of a federal road endangered the cultural monuments. The following years yielded further finds and floor plans. In 1990 the Hitzacker Archaeological Centre was founded due to the importance of these discoveries. The museum is sponsored by the L√ºchow- Dannenberg District Archaeological Society (Kreisarch√§ologie L√ºchow- Dannenberg) and the Society for the Hitzacker Archaeological Centre (F√∂rderverein Arch√§ologisches Zentrum Hitzacker e.V.). The open-air museum is a place recognised by the town of Hitzacker for registry office weddings that are accompanied by a supporting programme by the museum.

On the other side it says \\"Slaves, or men subdue to an absolute power, don't have homeland, because homeland is not connected to the place of birth, but in the free exercise of the citizen rights.\\" (Los esclavos, o los hombres sometidos al poder absoluto, no tienen patria, porque la patria no se vincula a la tierra natal, sino en el libre ejercicio de los derechos ciudadanos.) The 1837 generation () was an Argentine intellectual movement named after the date a literary hall with most of its members was established. Influenced by the new romantic ideas, they rejected the cultural Spanish heritage of the country. They did not acknowledge any national roots in the indigenous peoples or the period of European colonization, focusing instead on the Revolution as the birth of the country, as it gave them freedom, the possibility to behave as free people. They considered themselves \\"sons of the May Revolution\\", they were born shortly after it, and wrote some of the earliest Argentine literary works. The group established a literary hall in 1837 in Buenos Aires, hence the name. This Sal√≥n Literario closed six months after it was created because of the reiterated warnings from the government. Initially, they claimed to be neutral in the Argentine Civil Wars, they wrote works biased against the federal governor Juan Manuel de Rosas (such as El Matadero by Esteban Echeverr√≠a or Facundo by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento) because Rosas was the Buenos Aires government of that time, but they were also against the former Unitarian governments, with whom they didn't agree in their absolutist manners that were considered by them as a mere restoration of the manners of the Spanish colony. Their efforts to install a full democratic Republic and guarantee civil rights by means of a peaceful propaganda were vain and shortly after that they ended up exiled or assassinated. After Rosas was overthrown in 1852, their writings inspired the first Argentine Constitution in 1853, and their persons promoters of the Organizaci√≥n Nacional, the articulation and organization of the political divisions, infrastructure and institutions of the country, that in its final form didn't was federal nor unitarian but a balance of both. They were called \\"unitarians\\" in a loose sense and by Rosas propaganda. Some notable members of this generation were Esteban Echeverr√≠a, Juan Bautista Alberdi, Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento who was president between 1868 and 1874, Miguel Can√© (senior), Bartolom√© Mitre, Andr√©s Lamas, Antonio Somellera, Vicente Fidel L√≥pez, Carlos Tejedor, Juan Bautista Pe√±a, Florencio Varela, Juan Cruz Varela, Jos√© M√°rmol, Jos√© Rivera Indarte (Buenos Aires), Quiroga Rosas, Antonino Aberastain, Santiago Cort√≠nez (San Juan), Benjam√≠n Villafa√±e, F√©lix Fr√≠as (Tucum√°n), Francisco √Ålvarez, Paulino Paz, Enrique Rodr√≠guez, Avelino Ferreyra, Ram√≥n Ferreyra (C√≥rdoba), Juan Thompson (Corrientes).

Design and development The K7 was intended as a two-place trainer with good performance, a rare combination in trainers of its time. The K7 is constructed with a welded steel tube fuselage, covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. The wing is a wooden structure with a doped fabric covering and employs a Goettingen 533 (16%) airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a Goettingen 533 (14%) section at the wing tip. The wing features powerful dive brakes. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel. The earlier Ka-2 variant has a plywood monocoque fuselage. After 550 had been built, the K7 was superseded in production by the Schleicher ASK 13. The K7 can be converted into a K7/13 with a conversion kit to lower the wing to the mid-wing position and installation of a one-piece canopy, rendering the aircraft similar to the ASK-13.

Gorges and Mason, who between them claimed most of the territory north of the mouth of the Merrimack River, formed the Laconia Company to explore the interior, and they hired Neale to do this exploration, as well as to administer Mason's \\"lower\\" plantations on the Piscataqua River (on the coastline of present-day New Hampshire). In 1630 Neale arrived at Piscataqua. His administration of the lower plantations was marred by boundary disagreements with Thomas Wiggin, who administered the upper plantations on the river.

He returned to England in 1633; the Laconia Company venture failed.

He studied medicine at Utrecht University, specializing in cardiology. He worked as a cardiologist at the Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem, for 26 years (1977-2003). In 2001, his large-scaled prospective study to the near-death experiences after cardiac arrest was published in the medical journal The Lancet.Lommel, Pim van, Ruud van Wees, Vincent Meyers, and Ingrid Elfferich. ‚ÄúNear-Death Experience in Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: A Prospective Study in the Netherlands.‚Äù The Lancet 358, no. 9298 (December 15, 2001): 2039‚Äì2045. In 2007, the first (Dutch) edition of his bestseller Consciousness Beyond Life: The Science of the Near-Death Experience, was published.Lommel, Pim van. Consciousness Beyond Life: The Science of the Near-Death Experience. New York: HarperOne, 2011.  Reception  Neurobiologist Dick Swaab praised Lommel's research for mapping patients‚Äô experiences and opening up the subject of near-death experiences (NDEs) to the medical world. But he also claimed that Lommel's book ignores scientific knowledge, including some conclusions from his own research. He further argued that Lommel does not refute neurobiological explanations, gives no scientific basis for his statements and borrows concepts from quantum physics without ground (quantum mysticism). According to Swaab, Van Lommel deviates from the scientific approach and Consciousness Beyond Life can only be categorized as pseudoscientific.Swaab, Dick. (2014).\\"We Are Our Brains: From the Womb to Alzheimer's\\". \\"However, he should not fool people by giving his book the subtitle The Science of the Near-Death Experience. Nor should he, a doctor, frighten off potential organ donors with his completely unscientific theories.\\" Jason Braithwaite, a senior lecturer in Cognitive Neuroscience in the Behavioural Brain Sciences Centre, University of Birmingham, issued an in- depth analysis and critique of Lommel's prospective study published in the medical journal The Lancet, concluding that while Lommel's et al. study makes a useful contribution, it contains several factual and logical errors. Among these errors are Lommel's misunderstandings and misinterpretations of the dying-brain hypothesis, misunderstandings over the role of anoxia, misplaced confidence in EEG measurements (a flat electroencephalogram (EEG) reading is not evidence of total brain inactivity), etc. Jason concluded with, \\"it is difficult to see what one could learn from the paranormal survivalist position which sets out assuming the truth of that which it seeks to establish, makes additional and unnecessary assumptions, misrepresents the current state of knowledge from mainstream science, and appears less than comprehensive in its analysis of the available facts.\\"Braithwaite, J. J. (2008). \\"Near Death Experiences: The Dying Brain\\" . Skeptic. Volume 21, Number 2. Retrieved 2014-07-12. In his book Lommel also supported alleged psychic abilities of some NDErs. Skeptic Donna Harris in a review for the book wrote the research was unreliable as it was taken from self-reported surveys and interviews and \\"since any type of paranormal or intuitive power remains unproven, it is troubling that the author doesn‚Äôt question these abilities, and just includes them as accepted facts.\\"\\"Broadcasting from the Great Beyond a book review by Donna Harris\\".

Wilderness MCIs may include blizzards, earthquakes, avalanches, landslides, floods and forest fire, but they need not be natural disasters. Mass casualties have also been caused by human error in parties of climbers or explorers, with or without complications from inclement weather.http://www.thecityedition.com/2012/First_Aid.html#mass In mass casualty incidents, emergency service providers must prioritize their patients using a process called triage in order to make the most of their limited resources.  Response  Extrication and evacuation Transporting an injured person out of the wilderness on a stretcher can be a difficult exercise requiring considerable manpower. It is advised that at least one person stay with an injured party and that no one attempt to seek help by travelling alone over inhospitable terrain.  Golden hour  In emergency medicine, some advocates assert that there is a golden hour which refers to a time period lasting from a few minutes to several hours following traumatic injury being sustained by a casualty, during which there is the highest likelihood that prompt medical treatment will prevent death. While most medical professionals agree that delays in definitive care are undesirable, recent peer reviewed literature casts doubt on the validity of the 'golden hour' as it appears to lack a scientific basis. Dr. Bryan Bledsoe, an outspoken critic of the golden hour and other EMS \\"myths\\" like critical incident stress management, has indicated that the peer reviewed medical literature does not demonstrate any \\"magical time\\" for saving critical patients. Responder certifications First aid Wilderness first aid (WFA) is the specific discipline of first aid which relates to care in remote areas, where emergency medical services will be difficult to obtain or will take a long time to arrive. Locating the victim precedes assessment and intervention and in the case of wilderness response is often a difficult matter. Specialists in white water rescue, mountain rescue, mine disaster response and other fields are often employed. In some cases, emergency extrication procedures at incidents such as automobile accidents are required before assessment is possible. Only once the location of the victim has been determined, a trained responder has been dispatched and successfully reached the victim, can the ordinary first aid process begin. Assessment is then enabled and it follows carefully specified protocols which have been refined through a long process of evaluation.  Certification  Wilderness First Aid is a relatively new field compared to regular or 'urban' first aid. For this reason, there are a number of boards and societies which have been formed in recent years to attempt to establish normalized standards for wilderness first aid certification and wilderness medicine in general. Currently, there are no national standards for wilderness medicine, however one of the most popularly followed curricula is the \\"National Practice Guidelines for Wilderness Emergency Care\\" published by the Wilderness Medical Society in 2010. The American Red Cross Wilderness & Remote First Aid (r.2010) certification is valid for 2 years. In Canada the first WFA courses were taught in the mid 1980s and the first organization to adopt standards was the Wilderness First Aid and Safety Association of BC (defunct since 1998). St. John Ambulance provides a Wilderness First Aid course  First responders  A Wilderness First Responder (72- to 80-hour course) certification is both a higher certification than a Wilderness First Aid or (16- to 20-hour course) certification, and may also be used to upgrade an Emergency Medical Technician to a Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician. Outdoor Emergency Care is a National Ski Patrol certification, but it doesn't fully meet the requirements for a WFR certification. Training and certification organizations A number of fellowships are available for emergency medicine graduates including prehospital medicine (emergency medical services), hospice and palliative care, research, undersea and hyperbaric medicine, sports medicine, ultrasound, pediatric emergency medicine, disaster medicine, wilderness medicine, toxicology, and Critical Care Medicine.

It set an unofficial duration British record but vandalism prevented a cross-Channel attempt. Design and development The Phantom was a single-seat, clean, high-performance glider designed for Mr Percy Michelson with distance records and a cross-channel flight in mind. It was an all-wood aircraft, built of spruce and plywood. The wing had a single spruce spar with stressed ply to the leading edge forming a torsion box. At the time, the choice of the biconvex R.A.F. 34 airfoil was unusual, the concave/convex G√∂ttingen forms being generally used. The wing was high mounted on a long, shallow pylon just behind the open cockpit, braced with a single lift strut on each side. Its tailplane was low mounted and the rudder rounded and generous, mounted on a narrow fin. It landed on a long skid reaching from the nose to well behind the wing trailing edge. The Phantom first flew on 11 June 1931. Operational history The Phantom gained its Certificate of Airworthiness in November 1931. Advertisements from July 1931 show that Cloudcraft hoped to sell the Phantom equipped as both Standard and Special models but the company closed for business at the end of 1931, so only was built. One of the Phantom's earliest outings was to the glider demonstration at Bunster Hill, overlooking Ilam, Staffordshire, on 27‚Äì28 June 1931, one of the Lyons Tea meetings. Unfortunately, some of the ply became detached near the cockpit and no flights were made. The month after its maiden flight, the repaired Phantom demonstrated its intended long-duration ability by unofficially breaking the British glider duration record with a flight of over 4¬º hours. The pilot was \\"Mungo\\" Buxton. It was the first time that the time set by Maneyrol in the Peyret Tandem at the British Glider Competition nine years earlier had been bettered by a British pilot and aircraft in Britain. Its owner, Michelson, intended to try for the Cellon prize for an unpowered cross-English Channel flight but the aircraft was seriously damaged by vandals on the cliffs near Dover. He could not afford to have it repaired and put it up for sale in 1932. The remains were bought by the Bradford and County Gliding Club in April 1933. It seems they wanted it for its instruments and launch rope, for the Phantom was too lightly built for club work. The remains ended up at the Slingsby Aviation works at Kirbymoorside; they were there in 1938 but may have been burned during World War II.

Portrait of J√≥zef Wieniawski. J√≥zef Wieniawski (23 May 183711 November 1912) was a Polish pianist, composer, conductor and teacher. He was born in Lublin, the younger brother of the famous violinist Henryk Wieniawski. After Franz Liszt, he was the first pianist to publicly perform all the √©tudes by Chopin. He appeared with Liszt in recitals in Paris, London, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Brussels, Leipzig and Amsterdam. Although now neglected, J√≥zef Wieniawski enjoyed a reputation as one of Europe's finest musicians. At the very end of his life a young journalist asked him how long he intended to serve music. He replied: \\"As long as I remain young!\\" Life J√≥zef Wieniawski studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Pierre Zimmermann and Antoine Fran√ßois Marmontel in 1847,Randel, Don Michael (1996), The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music, p. 984, Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, leaving in 1850. In 1855 he received a scholarship from the Tsar of Russia to study with Franz Liszt in Weimar and from 1856 until 1858 in Berlin with Adolf Bernhard Marx, with whom he studied music theory. After he had performed between 1851 and 1853 as a companion to his brother, he decided to follow a separate career as a piano virtuoso. On concert tours through Europe, he performed not only his own compositions, including the Piano Concerto in G minor, but also the works of composer Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Liszt, Schumann and Weber. According to Liszt, he was the first pianist after him to perform Chopin's √©tudes, all in public. After returning to Paris he established friendly relations with Rossini, Gounod, Berlioz and Wagner, also approaching the Imperial Court and becoming a favorite artist of Napoleon III. He then moved to Moscow where he was named to the piano faculty at the Moscow Conservatory, founded in 1866. Contrary to the affirmations of many established sources, he never became a professor at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels but lived again in this city from 1902. He died in Brussels, aged 75. Collaborations J√≥zef Wieniawski also had works by contemporary Polish composers in the repertoire, such as Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko, Moritz Moszkowski, Carl Tausig, W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈ªele≈Ñski, Antoni Stolpe and Edouard Wolff. As a chamber musician he frequently performed with the most renowned violinists, cellists and singers of his time, including Pablo de Sarasate, Henri Vieuxtemps, Apolinary Katski, Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, Jen≈ë Hubay, Leopold Auer, Joseph Joachim, Carlo Alfredo Piatti, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Louis Di√©mer, Pauline Viardot and Marcella Sembrich. In addition to a symphony and a piano concerto, Wieniawski composed among others a piano sonata, 24 √©tudes, two concert √©tudes, a ballad in E flat minor, polonaise, mazurka, barcarolles, impromptus, waltzes, and many short piano pieces. His compositions, written to be played at his own concerts, bear superior artistic qualities and technical difficulties of the highest level, giving so a clear idea of their author's performing abilities.Ochlewski, Tadeusz & Michalski, Grzegorz (1979), An outline history of Polish music, p. 45, Interpress, He left 11 mechanical recordings of his piano pieces which to date have not come to light.

Amide ligands have two electron pairs available for bonding. In principle, they can be terminal or bridging. In these two examples, the dimethylamido ligands are both bridging and terminal: File:Tris(dimethylamino)aluminium dimer.png|Tris(dimethylamino)aluminium dimer File:Tris(dimethylamino)gallium dimer.png|Tris(dimethylamino)gallium dimer In practice, bulky amide ligands have a lesser tendency to bridge. Amide ligands may participate in metal- ligand œÄ-bonding giving a complex with the metal center being co-planar with the nitrogen and substituents. Metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides form a significant subcategory of metal amide compounds. These compounds tend to be discrete and soluble in organic solvents. Alkali metal amides Lithium amides are the most important amides, as they are readily prepared from n-butyllithium and the appropriate amine, and they are more stable and soluble than the other alkali metal analogs. Potassium amides are prepared by transmetallation of lithium amides with potassium t-butoxide (see also Schlosser base) or by reaction of the amine with potassium, potassium hydride, n-butylpotassium, or benzylpotassium. The alkali metal amides, MNH2 (M = Li, Na, K) are commercially available. Sodium amide (also known as sodamide) is synthesized from sodium metal and ammonia with ferric nitrate catalyst.

Unlike many other bases, the steric bulk prevents this base from acting as a nucleophile. It is commercially available, usually as a solution in hexane. It may be readily prepared from n-butyllithium and diisopropylamine. Transition metal complexes Early transition metal amides may be prepared by treating anhydrous metal chloride with alkali amide reagents, or with two equivalents of amine, the second equivalent acting as a base: :MCln \\\\+ n LiNR2 ‚Üí M(NR2)n \\\\+ n LiCl :MCln \\\\+ 2n HNR2 ‚Üí M(NR2)n \\\\+ n HNR2*HCl Transition metal amide complexes may be prepared by: * treating a halide complex with an alkali amide * treating an alkoxide complex with an amine * deprotonation of a coordinated amine * oxidative addition of an amine With two organic substituents, amides derived from secondary amines can be especially bulky ligands.

The unit was included in the list of regiments transferred to Confederate Service by the Arkansas State Military Board July 28, 1861, but the unit was not fully organized at that time. An election for Field Grade Officers was conducted on July 28, but the results were contested by Captain John Logan of Company G because only eight companies were present, instead of the required ten. A new election was ordered by the State Military Board and it was held on August 8, 1861. The results were the same as the first election with the exception that Mark S. Miller was elected lieutenant colonel in the place of Hordley. The field grade officers received their commissions in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States on August 8, 1861.Rushing, Ranks of Honor, page 3  Battles  The regiment was ordered to Little Rock on August 9, 1861, and remained there until August 20, when the unit was ordered to Pine Bluff. The unit boarded boats on August 27 for the five-day trip by river to Memphis Tennessee where the unit arrive on 1 September 1861. The unit remained in the Memphis area until September 26 when the unit was ordered to Fort Pillow, Tennessee.Rushing, Ranks of Honor, page 7 The unit was eventually brigaded with the 12th Arkansas, commanded by Col. E. W. Gantt; was stationed at Island Number Ten on the Mississippi River, and transferred back and forth to New Madrid at the will of General Gideon J. Pillow.Sikakis, Stewart, Compendium of the Confederate Armies, Florida and Arkansas, Facts on File, Inc., 1992, , page 91. Island Number Ten was surrendered April 15, 1862, after a terrific bombardment by the enemy's mortar-boats and gunboats, aided by an overflow which nearly submerged the island. The Confederate defenses consisted of dissolving earthworks and twenty guns. Maj. W. J. Hoadley, of Little Rock, spiked his battery of guns and made his escape with one section of the battalion. The others were included in the surrender documents, and were transported to Camp Butler near Springfield, Ill., then to Camp Chase (Chicago), the officers to Johnson's Island, Lake Erie.Hardy, Gary \\"11th Arkansas Infantry Regiment\\", Accessed 21 July 2011, http://thehardyparty.com/civil_war/11th_regiment_ark.htm Lieutenant Gibson, of Company H, was shot dead on Johnson's island by a Federal sentinel because he crossed the \\"dead line\\".  Reorganization and consolidation  The 11th and 12th Arkansas Infantry Regiments were exchanged September 16, 1862, at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Because their original one-year enlistment was expiring, the regiment was required to be reorganized for two additional years. This reorganization resulted in the election of the following officers:Col. John M.

The reorganized regiment was ordered to lower Mississippi. In March 1863, the 11th and (Griffith's) 17th Arkansas Infantry Regiment were consolidated and mounted. Colonel John L. Logan was placed in command. The consolidated regiment was dispatched to Clinton, Mississippi, to head off the raid of the Federal General Grierson, but failed to meet him. At this time Colonel Logan served as the commander of a brigade which included 11th/17th so Col Griffin, originally of the 17th Arkansas, was often in field command of the consolidated regiment. The unit operated outside the fortifications of Port Hudson during the siege in March 1863. This detachment operated against the army under General Banks in Louisiana, and took a number of prisoners, among them Gen. Neal Dow. Some members of the 11/17th Consolidated Arkansas Mounted Infantry were captured at the Siege of Port Hudson on July 9, 1863. These men were later released and exchanged in Arkansas and many would later join Poe's Arkansas Cavalry Battalion.National Park Service, Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System, Confederate Arkansas Troops, Poe's Battalion, Arkansas Cavalry,  Unofficial reorganization west of the Mississippi River  In November 1863 Colonel Logan made a trip to Richmond Virginia and made an impassioned request for the transfer of his regiment back to Arkansas. Colonel Logan's request for the transfer of his battalion fell on deaf ears, but he was personally transferred to the Trans- Mississippi Department. Colonel Griffith of the 17th Arkansas assumed command of the 11/17th Consolidated Regiment and led the unit until the end of the war. Colonel Logan eventually achieved his purpose to a degree. When members of the 11/17th Consolidated Arkansas Mounted Infantry were released on furlough to return to Arkansas for recruiting duty in early 1864, many elected to remain in Arkansas rather than return to their command in southern Mississippi. Instead of returning to Colonel Griffin's command, many of these soldiers reported to Colonel Logan in the Trans Mississippi and by late 1864, Colonel Logan's unit, now recognized as the 11th Arkansas Cavalry Regiment or Logan's Arkansas Cavalry Regiment,National Park Service, Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System, Confederate Arkansas Troops, Logan's Regiment, Arkansas Cavalry, was back on the roster of units for the Department of the Trans- Mississippi.United States.

Personal life Victoria Horn began studying the piano at age three and later learned the guitar. At an early age she showed promise in the areas of both fashion design and music (winning a young designer award at age 16.) She is also an accomplished show jumper with a long familial tradition in the sport. She is often referred to by her writer/feature artist name \\"Lady V.\\" Musical career By the age of 17, Horn had some musical experience behind her including live performances. During this year she became a latter-day member of 1970s pop group The New Seekers under the name Vikki James. Not long after this she recorded for other artists on a number of dance songs. Her first major songwriting release, a song from 2001 called \\"Days Go By\\" performed by Dirty Vegas, peaked at No. 14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Play following its implementation in an advertisement for the Mitsubishi Eclipse. \\"Days Go By\\" continued to garner heavy radio play throughout 2002 and win a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording as well as an ASCAP Pop Music Award for its author. In 2003, a song she cowrote for Enrique Iglesias (featuring Kelis) entitled \\"Not in Love\\" won the Billboard Latin Dance song of the year and enjoyed top ten placement in many sales charts around the world. In 2008, Horn co-wrote the song \\"This is Us\\" which appeared on the Keyshia Cole album A Different Me. The album went on to sell one million copies. As well, during this year, Horn collaborated with songwriters David \\"DQ\\" Qui√±ones, Erika Nuri, Rodney Jerkins, and Evan Bogart to found The Writing Camp. The Writing Camp wrote Brandy's debut single \\"Right Here (Departed)\\" off her 2008 album Human. The song was picked as the album's leading single and Brandy's first release with Epic Records, following her split with Atlantic Records in 2005. Fellow co-writer Rodney Jerkins said about Ms. Horn, \\"'I've had the pleasure of writing with Victoria Horn on a lot of great music. Her great sense of melody and new fresh approach to concepts and lyrics is what I love about her writing. She is definitely one of my new favorite songwriters to work with.\\" In 2009, Demi Lovato's Here We Go Again album, on which Horn wrote the song \\"Got Dynamite,\\" released straight to no. 1 on the Billboard chart. In late 2012, Horn began working more in the genre of electronic dance music. Her vocals are featured on many DJ records and she has begun writing for artists including David Guetta, Markus Schulz, Armin van Buuren, Above and Beyond, and Chicane. Horn is also active within the songwriting community. She runs a private professional songwriters and producers rights group called the Songwriter Awareness Collective, that represents 800 musicians and works closely with BASCA, PRS and ASCAP. She maintains a Facebook group that provides songwriters with a forum to discuss issues relevant to their field. Aside from EDM and her artist writes, Horn is now focusing on writing with just a few key songwriters such as Los from the Jackieboyz, EDM artist and songwriter Christian Burns and Rhys Fulber - delerium whom she shares a cinematic electronic project.

The difference between fogponics and other forms of aeroponics is that while aeroponics typically delivers nutrient rich water to the roots using a spray (relatively large particles in air), fogponics uses one of a number of mechanisms (for example ultrasonic, compressed air, or heating elements) to form a suspension of much smaller particles of water (5‚Äì30 Œºm), or even as a vapour.

Biography  He is of Dominican descent and went to Seward Park Campus  Music career  Johnny met Romeo, lead singer/songwriter and co- producer of Aventura, in 2002 and initially performed security functions for them. A trust developed between the two, and in 2003 Johnny became the group's personal manager. Largely due to Johnny's efforts, Aventura in its storied career amassed a Latin Grammy nomination in 2007 for the album K.O.B. Live, over 25 Premio Lo Nuestro Awards, over 20 Latin Billboard Music Awards, over 15 Premio Juventud Awards, and an MTV VMA for Latin Artist of the Year. Romeo Santos launched his solo career in 2011, with the critically acclaimed \\"Formula Vol. 1\\", which is multi-platinum and had five #1 hits (the first artist to do so in nearly 16 years). Romeo won the Billboard Award for the Latin Album of the year, MTV VMA Award as Best Latino Music Artist, 2 Premio Juventud Awards, 3 Latin Billboard Awards including Album of the Year, and was nominated for an Alma Award as Favorite Male Music Artist and an American Grammy for Best Tropical Album. His Formula Vol. 1 Tour was sold out domestically and internationally, visiting over 60 cities and 3 sold-out shows at the World's Most Famous Arena, Madison Square Garden, with the production of a DVD reliving this moment in history, \\"The King Stays King\\" on sale. In September 2013, Romeo and Johnny were invited to the White House for the Musica Latina event in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. In February 2014, Romeo released his second solo album, ‚ÄúFormula Vol. 2‚Äù, which is certified diamond, has won 3 Soberano Awards, 5 Premio Juventud Awards, 9 Premio lo Nuestro Awards, had a record-breaking 21 nominations for the Latin Billboard Awards, taking home 10 of them, and has won the 2015 and 2016 American Billboard Award for Top Latin Artist. The first leg of his Formula Vol. 2 World Tour was sold out, including two historic nights at Yankee Stadium, making him the first Latin artist to ever headline and sell out a show at the world's most prestigious ballpark, joining the ranks of Madonna and Paul McCartney on the very short list of solo artists to ever achieve such a feat. And in 2015, Santos‚Äô global appeal has reached an unparalleled level, selling out stadiums across the world from the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina, to Spain and across Europe. From June 2016 until July 2017, Johnny was the President of Roc Nation Latin, a newly formed division within the company. In this capacity, Johnny managed the day-to-day operations of the division and was tasked with scouting and retaining top talent. In July 2017, Romeo released his third solo album, ‚ÄúGolden‚Äù, which is already multi-platinum and has 2 #1 hits. With these #1 songs, Romeo Santos leads all Latin artists with the most number one hits this decade. The success of Marines' work ethic can be measured by Aventura's and Romeo Santos' spectacular growth, which continues to extend into new markets today, far from his humble South Bronx roots.  Entrepreneurship  Johnny owns several organic delis that service the people of the Lower East Side of Manhattan and is a principal business partner with key investments in several restaurants and nightlife establishments in New Jersey.  Police career  Johnny attended John Jay College School of Criminal Justice until he was recruited by the NYPD on August 30, 1993 for his work as an undergraduate. In March 1994 Johnny graduated from the New York Police Academy in the top 10% of his class foreshadowing his future success as a New York Police officer. In March 2003, Johnny was promoted to the rank of sergeant, the rank which he retained until he retired from the force in February 2009. During his tenure as a police officer, which included the height of the crack epidemic in the 1990s, Johnny made and assisted in more than 1,000 arrests. Throughout his career as a public servant for the City of New York, Johnny was assigned to various commands. He worked out of the 13th Precinct from 1994 through 2003, as a supervisor at the 33rd Precinct in Washington Heights from 2003‚Äì2004; he was subsequently assigned to Manhattan North Grand Larceny as Supervisor from 2004‚Äì2007 and later a supervisor in Astoria, Queens at the 114th Precinct. During his tenure on the force, Marines was awarded 12 Excellent Police Duty medals as well as 4 Meritorious Police Duty medals for 4 separate Bribery arrests.LES Sports Academy Back to School Basketball Tournament and School Supplies Giveaway http://www.mannyzoom.com/fotos-reparticion-de-utiles- escolares-con-johnny-marines/  Philanthropy  Despite all of his success, Johnny Marines has not forgotten his humble roots. Johnny has dedicated a large portion of his time, effort and resources to giving back to his community. In conjunction with Aventura and Romeo Santos, Marines has co- funded toy drives in New York and the Dominican Republic; he has donated turkeys for hundreds of needy families during the holidays; several times a year, Johnny and his mother ship barrels of food to the Dominican Republic and school supplies to low income families; and he has helped coordinate Romeo's hospital visits to sick children throughout the Metropolitan Area. Also, Johnny has helped to fund and to create a non-profit, Lower East Side Sports Academy, in the Lower East Side of Manhattan which has joined up with the NYC Police Athletic League and has over 300 children participating every summer. Johnny established the Johnny Marines Blessings Foundation, which aims to foster, support, and fund educational advancement initiatives within New York City.

Petrarca-Preis was a European literary and translation award named after the Italian Renaissance poet Francesco Petrarca or Petrarch. Founded in 1975 by German art historian and publisher Hubert Burda, it was primarily designed for contemporary European poets, but some occasional non-Europeans appear in the list of laureates. The award was first distributed over a twenty-year period (1975‚Äì95) and included the categories Literature and Translation. Then it was followed for a decade (1999-2009) by a Hermann-Lenz-Preis and resumed in 2010. The first jury consisted of fluxus participant Bazon Brock, poets Michael Kr√ºger and Nicolas Born, and novelist Peter Handke. When the prize resumed in 2010, Peter Handke and Michael Kr√ºger still were on the jury, together with the authors Alfred Kolleritsch (himself awarded in 1978) and Peter Hamm. \\"We want to support a national and regional culture in Europe\\", founder Hubert Burda initially said at the 2011 awards. An explicit goal was to watch out all over Europe for authors who gave a distinctive voice to their prevailing culture.2011 Homepage of the prize.

Image credit: Argonne National Lab. The kinetic inductance detector (KID) ‚Äî also known as a microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) ‚Äî is a type of superconducting photon detector first developed by scientists at the California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2003. These devices operate at cryogenic temperatures, typically below 1 kelvin. They are being developed for high-sensitivity astronomical detection for frequencies ranging from the far-infrared to X-rays. Principle of operation Photons incident on a strip of superconducting material break Cooper pairs and create excess quasiparticles. The kinetic inductance of the superconducting strip is inversely proportional to the density of Cooper pairs, and thus the kinetic inductance increases upon photon absorption. This inductance is combined with a capacitor to form a microwave resonator whose resonant frequency changes with the absorption of photons. This resonator- based readout is useful for developing large-format detector arrays, as each KID can be addressed by a single microwave tone and many detectors can be measured using a single broadband microwave channel, a technique known as frequency-division multiplexing. Applications KIDs are being developed for a range of astronomy applications, including millimeter and submillimeter wavelength detection at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) on the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory, and the IRAM 30-m telescope. They are also being developed for optical and near- infrared detection at the Palomar Observatory. Since their ability to be frequency-division multiplexed allows KIDs to achieve small detector package sizes, KIDs have also gained popularity in airborne balloon astrophysics as a more compact and less massive alternative to transition edge sensors.

This song serves as the lead single from the singer's debut studio album, Mannequin Factory. Produced by Moroccan-Swedish producer RedOne, who had originally discovered Black, \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" is influenced by the genre of rock, lyrically stating how the listener should be proud of who they are. The song was released digitally in the United States on March 29, 2011, and managed to chart at number forty-four on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. A music video for \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\", shot and directed by Sanaa Hamri, was released on March 27, 2011. The music video pays homage to Porcelain Black's high school experiences, where she was constantly teased by \\"snobby rich kids\\", but never gave in to the pressure of her peers around her. The video serves as a form of revenge for Porcelain Black against high school tormentors. \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" garnered mixed reviews from critics, most of whom were shocked by Porcelain Black's image and sounds but favored her apparent perception of herself as the \\"offspring\\" of fellow musicians Britney Spears and Marilyn Manson and their individual styles. Porcelain Black performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman, marking her debut televised appearance. The song was featured in an episode of Beavis and Butthead and in the 2013 film The Smurfs 2. Background and release \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" was written by Porcelain Black, Lil Wayne, RedOne, Bilal Hajji, with RedOne providing the song's production. In the song's writing credits, Porcelain Black and Lil Wayne are credited under their real names, Alaina Beaton and Dwayne Carter, Jr. respectively. After being introduced to Lil Wayne's manager, Derrick \\"EI\\" Lawrence, by producer RedOne, Porcelain Black stated that she met Lil Wayne in New York City when he heard \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\", where he expressed an interest in adding his vocals to the song. The single cover for \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" was revealed on March 21, 2011, alongside a snippet of the song. \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" was released digitally through the United States iTunes Store on March 29, 2011. Following the release of Porcelain Black's second single, \\"Naughty Naughty,\\" Dutch DJ, remixer and house music producer R3hab produced a remix of \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like,\\" making it available for free download through SoundCloud on January 24, 2012. R3hab went on to compliment Porcelain Black's original song, stating, \\"The original vibe is crazy, and I am a big fan of Lil Wayne. This track makes you wanna rage like the lyrics say! I see [the remix] as a rollercoaster ride. Breaks slow it down. Then there is a climb, and the big drop!\\" Porcelain Black complimented R3hab's remix in an interview with MTV News: \\"I wish[ed] his remixes were the official singles because they really pop off next level. I love all the spooky horror pop synths he throws in the mixes, and the breakdowns make me wanna throw back shots of whiskey and hair whip. If I could have sex with a song I'd def be tappin‚Äô dat remix!\\" Music and lyrics Described as \\"in-your-face\\", \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" is influenced by the genres of rock, dance-pop, and power pop, while containing \\"roaring\\" guitars and lyrics which aim to remind listeners to be proud of who they are. Vocally, Porcelain Black sings as if straining through \\"a maze of razorblades,\\" according to Steven J. Horowitz of YRB Magazine. The RedOne-produced track employs a beat that is reminiscent of his work with Lady Gaga. Porcelain Black screams in the chorus \\"Hey hey hey if you're ready to rage / Raise your hands up, this what rock and roll looks like / Yeah yeah yeah, wearing leather and lace / Raise your hands up, this what rock and roll looks like.\\" While being interviewed by the Los Angeles Times, Porcelain Black discussed in depth about the genre mix in \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\": Although the song's title references the physical appearance of what rock and roll looks like, Porcelain Black revealed in an interview with AOL's NoiceCreep that rock and roll is not dependent on the physical appearance of someone. She stated: Critical reception \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" received generally mixed reviews by critics, most of whom were surprised with Porcelain Black's outgoing persona and the pop production by RedOne. Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times complimented the song's production by stating that it could have been used by Lady Gaga. Ian Drew of Us Weekly called the single \\"shocking\\" and \\"electric\\". Allison Stewart of The Washington Post gave \\"This Is What Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Looks Like‚Äù a mixed review, describing Porcelain Black as a \\"girl-fronted version of M√∂tley Cr√ºe circa Dr. Feelgood\\". Jon Wiederhorn of Inked dubbed the song \\"a euphoric digital feast of raspy melodic vocals, four-to-the-floor beats, and keyboards that buzz like electric guitars.\\" Chart performance \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs at number forty-six, on the week ending July 18, 2011. The following week, the song went up two spots, peaking at number forty-four. The following two weeks, \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" remained stationary at number forty-four on the weeks ending August 1, 2011 and August 8, 2011, respectively. Music video Porcelain Black and Lil Wayne depicted as children in the music video. A music video for \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" was shot and directed by Sanaa Hamri at Citrus College in Glendora, California. Porcelain Black discussed the idea behind the music video for \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" with AOL's Carlos Ramirez, stating it was based on real life experiences. After Porcelain Black's mother had re-married, she was forced to move to Rochester, Michigan, which Porcelain Black described as \\"a really rich area\\". Attending high school, Porcelain Black was surrounded by \\"snotty rich kids\\" who would tease her saying \\"You're a fucking freak, what's your problem?\\", to which Porcelain Black would reply \\"You're boring and fake, get away from me.\\" Reviewing her past, Porcelain Black realized it would make for a good music video. A behind the scenes look at shooting the music video was released on May 12, 2011. In an interview with AOL Music's Contessa Gayles, Porcelain Black discussed the concept of the video as revenge. She stated: > It was about getting revenge. People were always hating on me, because I was > different. I was like, \\"I'm going to sing, I'm going to do this, I'm going > to do that,\\" they were like \\"OK, sure you are.\\" And I was like \\"No, I'm > serious. This is what I'm going to do.\\" And everybody was like, \\"Yeah > right.\\" Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a > going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I > was really going away. They were like, \\"You'll be back.\\" So it was kind of > just like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their > face. The music video debuted on March 27, 2011. The music video begins with a young Porcelain Black being teased by a group of blonde girls, who resemble \\"The Plastics\\" in Mean Girls (2004). As Porcelain Black is being teased, a young version of Lil Wayne comes to the defense of Porcelain Black, scaring away the group of blonde girls. The video then fast forwards nine years where Black, accompanied by her own entourage, walks past a group of snobby girls, giving them the middle-finger as she walks away leaving them in shock. As the video continues, Black gets revenge on her high school enemies by tearing up the school's library and cafeteria. During Lil Wayne's verse, the two are seen raging in the school's gym. Rapper Birdman makes a cameo appearance in this scene. Performances and usage in media Porcelain Black appeared at the 2012 Fashion Week to promote \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like.\\" Porcelain Black performed the song as the opening act for Lil Wayne on the I Am Music II tour. Porcelain Black made her first ever television appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman on Thursday, July 21, 2011. Porcelain Black wore a leather, leotard-like bustiere number, complete with mesh, fringe and metallic studs as she whipped her black-and-blonde hair around, while prancing across the stage with her gothic dancers. While making her debut televised performance, Lil Wayne did not appear alongside Porcelain Black. In an interview with AOL's NoiseCreep, Porcelain Black described her first televised appearance as \\"intense, amazing, surreal\\", revealing that prior to the performance she was very nervous stating \\"Oh my god! I'm about to give birth to a panic attack!\\" Becky Bain of Idolator compared Black's styling to that of Lady Gaga's. Contessa Gayles of AOL described Porcelain Black's choreography as \\"racy,\\" later complimenting Porcelain Black on her \\"two-toned, Cruella De Vil-inspired coiffure.\\" Porcelain Black walked down the runway in a camouflage corset designed by Falguni and Shane Peacock at the 2012 Spring Fashion Week, as her song played in the background. Her appearance there was used to promote the single. \\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\\" appeared in the tenth episode of the eighth season of Beavis and Butthead. Expecting the duo to comment on the disparity between the song's title and its genre, R.L. Shaffer of IGN noticed that no such comparison was made; instead, the classroom setting was criticized while the presence of Lil Wayne was appreciated. The song was also used in the 2013 film, The Smurfs 2.

She sank at anchor off Punta Arenas after an explosion on 26 April 1881. Her loss caused the deaths of 143 crew members, and there were 12 survivors. She was en route to join the Pacific Station. Her loss was initially the source of much speculation. Causes considered included an attack by the Fenians, a lost torpedo, and a coal gas explosion. An enquiry in September 1881 concluded coal gas was the cause. In November 1881, an explosion in killed three men and wounded seven; it was determined to have been caused by \\"xerotine siccative\\", one of a compound commonly called \\"patent driers.\\" A survivor of the Doterel explosion recalled smelling that compound shortly before the explosion. In 1883 the government determined xerotine siccative caused the first explosion on Doterel, which set off the more damaging explosion of the forward magazine. The Admiralty ordered the compound withdrawn from use in the Royal Navy and better ventilation below decks. Design and construction The Doterel class was designed by Nathaniel Barnaby as a development of William Henry White's 1874 . The graceful clipper bow of the Ospreys was replaced by a vertical stem and the engines were more powerful. The hull was of composite construction, with wooden planks over an iron frame. Power was provided by three cylindrical boilers, which supplied steam at to a two-cylinder horizontal compound-expansion steam engine driving a single screw. This arrangement produced and a top speed of . Ships of the class were armed with two 7-inch (90 cwt) muzzle-loading rifled guns on pivoting mounts, and four 64-pounder muzzle-loading rifled guns (two on pivoting mounts, and two broadside). Four machine guns and one light gun completed the weaponry. All the ships of the class were provided with a barque rig, that is, square-rigged foremast and mainmast, and fore-and-aft sails only on the mizzen mast. Crew Doterel would have had a normal complement of 140‚Äì150 men, although on the day of the explosion and sinking she had 155 men on board, despite five having deserted since leaving Sheerness. Some of the supernumeraries may have been bound for ships already on station in the Pacific; one of the survivors, Engineer Walker, was due to join . Construction Doterel was ordered from Chatham Dockyard and laid down on 13 May 1878. She was launched on 2 March 1880 from Number 3 slip, and was named by Miss Hunt-Grubbe, daughter of the captain of Steam Reserves at Chatham. She was commissioned on 7 December 1880. Service Sloops such as Doterel were used in the far-flung parts of Britain's maritime empire for constabulary duties. Barnaby, Doterels designer, was an enthusiast of heavily armed but un- armoured frigates, sloops and corvettes, arguing that the Navy's tasks were best accomplished by a number of small, cheap ships. The system of colonial cruisers provided an inexpensive peace-keeping force for the protection of British interests, and gave imperial representatives a supply of sailors, marines and guns to deal with petty tyrants, minor insurrections and banditry. p.10 Doterel was assigned to the Pacific Station, which included the western coasts of North and South America as well as China and Japan. Under Commander Richard Evans she sailed from Sheerness, Kent on 17 January 1881. Having called at Madeira, St Vincent and Montevideo, she anchored at Punta Arenas, Chile on 26 April 1881 at 09:00. Sinking At about 10:15 on 26 April while the ship was at anchor off Punta Arenas, an explosion occurred in the forward magazine. Eyewitnesses described how objects of every type were thrown high into the air, and a huge column of smoke was seen to rise from the ship. The ship sank instantly. Boats of every kind put off from shore to seek survivors, as well as from the missionary schooner Allen Gardiner, the Chilean schooner San Jose, and the pontoon Kate Kellogg. 143 of the 155 crew members were killed. The captain was one of the twelve survivors, rescued by a boat from San Jose. He was found stripped naked by the blast and bleeding from several wounds. Funeral service performed over the remains of those who perished by the explosion ‚Äì The Graphic, London 1881 That afternoon, crews recovered bodies from the water; only three were recovered whole. The various body parts were put into boxes and buried at sea the same afternoon. Reverend Thomas Bridges, an Anglican missionary at Ushuaia, presided over the mass funeral in the harbour for the many sailors killed in the explosion. Commander Evans, the captain of Doterel telegrammed the Admiralty from Montevideo on 3 May 1881: The ship's guns, screw and other valuable fittings were salvaged by and . The contemporary rules governing pensions allowed the widow or dependent children of the dead men a gratuity equal to a year's pay, although the loss of their property was not compensated. Cause of the explosion Recovery of Doterels wreckage Initial reports blamed an explosion in the boilers, which detonated the magazine. This was definitively proven to be false when the crew of Garnet found the boilers in perfect condition. Conjecture also suggested the Fenians could have blown up the ship with a coal torpedo, the explosion could have been caused by a Whitehead torpedo lost by in 1878, or coal gas from the bunkers might have caused the explosion. An enquiry was held at Portsmouth, which referred the evidence to a scientific committee. In September 1881, they determined that the explosion was caused by the detonation of coal gas in the bunkers, and that no crew members were at fault. On 21 November 1881, an explosion occurred in , caused by a drying compound called \\"xerotine siccative\\", also called a patent drier. Three men were killed and seven were wounded. It was not until 1883 that the cause of the Doterel explosion was settled. A surviving crew member of that ship, upon later smelling xerotine siccative while on board , stated that he had smelled it before the 1881 explosion. He explained to authorities that a jar of liquid had cracked while being moved below deck. Subsequent investigation revealed that just before the explosion in Doterel, two men were ordered to throw the jar overboard. While cleaning the leaking explosive liquid from beneath the forward magazine, the men may have broken the rule of not having an open flame below decks. The xerotine siccative exploded first, setting off the huge explosion in the forward magazine, which contained 4 tons and 7 cwt (4,456 kg) of explosives. The Admiralty ordered xerotine siccative to be discontinued from use in the fleet, and a system of ventilation was recommended for all ships of the Royal Navy.

It was a development of the unsuccessful Northrop 3-A design, but was itself a failure, being rejected by the United States Army Air Corps. The sole prototype was sold to the Japanese Army in 1937, but no production followed, with the type proving to be inferior to existing Japanese fighters. Design and development In 1935, Northrop had flown the Northrop 3A, a single-engined, single-seat monoplane with a retractable undercarriage, to meet a United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) requirement for a single-seat fighter. This was a development of Northrop's XFT prototype carrier fighter, and shared the XFT's instability and tendency to enter spins. The sole Northrop 3A prototype disappeared during a test flight over the Pacific on 30 July 1935, and Northrop decided to abandon further development of the 3A.Angelucci and Bowers 1987, p. 361. The Air Corps' requirement for a new fighter was still outstanding however, with final evaluation being delayed several times.Green and Swanborough 1979, pp. 10‚Äì11. Despite the warnings of his engineers, Eugene Wright, President of Vought, decided to buy the 3A project from Northrop with the hope of winning orders from the Air Corps, the purchase being agreed early in 1936.Angelucci and Bowers 1987, pp. 434‚Äì435. Vought's design team had little time to work on the new fighter if it was to compete in the Air Corps competition, and changes made to the design purchased from Northrop were relatively small, with an enlarged rudder being fitted in a bid to solve the handling problems of the XFT and 3A, while the undercarriage and engine cowling were also modified.Angelucci and Bowers 1987, p. 435. In this form, the prototype fighter, designated Vought V-141 by the manufacturer, made its maiden flight on 29 March 1936, piloted by Paul S Baker. Like the 3A, the V-141 was a low-wing monoplane with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage and an enclosed cockpit. It was powered by a 750 hp (560 kW) Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp Junior radial engine, a slightly more powerful version of the engine that powered the 3A.Angelucci and Bowers 1987, pp. 435‚Äì436.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 585. The competing bids were evaluated by the Air Corps in April 1936. Vought offered to sell V-141s at a unit price of $34,148 for a batch of 25 aircraft (excluding engines and Government provided equipment), reducing to $16,041 for a batch of 200 aircraft. Testing showed that the V-141 still had poor handling and was prone to spinning, and also suffered from tail flutter, leading to the Vought design being rejected. The primary winner of the competition was Seversky, with 77 P-35s being ordered.Green and Swanborough 1979, p. 11. Vought then decided to offer its fighter for export, modifying it with larger tail surfaces and renaming it the Vought V-143. This was offered to Argentina as a replacement for its obsolete Dewoitine D.21s. When it came to be tested in Argentina, Curtiss-Wright representatives, eager to sell the Curtiss 75, pointed out that the Vought was fitted with an anti-spin parachute in the tail. When the Argentines demanded that the spin characteristics be demonstrated without the anti-spin parachute, Vought refused, and the Curtiss 75 was selected by the Argentines instead.Hagedorn 1993, p. 321. Further rejections from Turkey, Norway and Yugoslavia followed. This led to Vought, in an attempt to solve the fighter's handling problems once and for all, to rebuild the aircraft again in May 1937, with a lengthened rear fuselage and a new taller tail resembling that of the Vought SB2U. The engine was replaced by an 825 hp (615 kW) R-1535-SB4G. Thus modified, the V-143 was tested again by the USAAC in June 1937 but was rejected again. The V-143 prototype was finally purchased by Japan in July 1937 for $175,000. It was tested by the Japanese Navy as the Navy Experimental Fighter Type V (short designation AXV1), but found to be inferior to existing Japanese fighters.Francillon 1970, p. 550.

The film stars Tom Cruise as the title character, with Rosamund Pike, David Oyelowo, Richard Jenkins, Jai Courtney, Werner Herzog, and Robert Duvall also starring. The film entered production in October 2011, and was completed in January 2012. It was filmed entirely on location in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It received mixed reviews but was successful at the box office. The film was released in North America on December 21, 2012. The musical score was composed by Joe Kraemer, performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony and recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. Cruise performed all of his own driving stunts during the film's car chase sequence. Cruise reprised his role in the 2016 sequel, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, based on the 2013 novel Never Go Back. Plot In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a man drives a van into a parking garage across the Allegheny River from PNC Park, dropping a quarter into the meter. He readies a sniper rifle and assassinates five people on the river's North Shore Trail from long range before driving off. The police, headed by Detective Calvin Emerson, find a shell casing as well as the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint on the coin belongs to James Barr, a former U.S. Army sniper. When the police raid his house, they find the van, equipment for reloading rifle cartridges, the rifle in question, and Barr asleep in his bed. During an interrogation by Emerson and District Attorney Alex Rodin, Barr is offered a choice between life in prison in exchange for a full confession or guaranteed death row, as Rodin has never lost a conviction. They are bewildered when Barr instead takes a notepad and writes \\"Get Jack Reacher\\". Reacher is a drifter and former Army Military Police officer. He arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news report about Barr and the shooting. Emerson and Rodin deny Reacher's request to view the evidence but agree to let him see Barr, who was attacked by fellow inmates and is now in a coma. Reacher meets Barr's defense attorney, Helen Rodin, the District Attorney's daughter, who has been saddled with the apparently hopeless task of saving Barr from the death penalty. Helen can let Reacher see the evidence if he will become her investigator. Reacher retorts that he is not interested in clearing Barr. He reveals that Barr had gone on a killing spree during his tour in Iraq but was not prosecuted because, unbeknownst to Barr, his victims were under investigation for numerous rapes and the U.S. Army wanted them forgotten. Reacher vowed that if Barr tried anything like this again, he would take him down. Reacher agrees to investigate if Helen visits the victims' families to learn about the people murdered that day. Reacher goes to the crime scene and finds inconsistencies about this location, thinking that a trained shooter would have done the killings from the cover of the van on the nearby Fort Duquesne Bridge. After Helen reports her findings about the victims to Reacher, he suggests that the owner of a local construction company was the intended victim, while the other victims served as a cover-up. After an apparently spurious bar fight, Reacher realizes that someone is attempting to strong-arm him into dropping his investigation. Reacher is later framed for the murder of the young woman who was paid to instigate the bar-room brawl, but this only motivates him further. Reacher eventually follows up a lead at a shooting range in the neighboring state of Ohio, owned by former U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Martin Cash, who will talk only if Reacher will demonstrate his U.S. Army sniping skills. The real perpetrators are a gang masquerading as a legitimate construction firm, led by a former Soviet political prisoner known only as the Zec (prisoner). The gang kidnaps Helen with the aid of Detective Emerson and holds her hostage at a quarry. After he steals Helen's Mercedes-Benz, Reacher outwits the mob guards, killing them with Cash's help, before confronting the Zec about the conspiracy. The Zec points out that Reacher has killed most of the witnesses against him and doubts that he would be convicted, while also admitting that any prison sentence he did serve would be relatively easy compared to his time in Siberia. Reacher shoots the Zec in the head on the spot. Reacher and Cash flee the scene with confidence that Helen will clear Reacher's name. When Barr awakens from his coma, he tells Helen that he has no recent memory but believes that he must be guilty of the shootings. Barr's mental reconstruction of how he would have committed the shootings confirms that Reacher's theory was correct from the beginning. Still unaware of all these developments, Barr is willing to accept both responsibility and his punishment, fearing that Reacher will mete out justice if the law does not. However, it is clear he will be cleared of charges in this killing spree. Cast Production Development Attempts to adapt author Lee Child's Jack Reacher novel series into a film have been made ever since the character debuted in 1997's Killing Floor. After being optioned with no success to PolyGram and later New Line Cinema, Paramount Pictures and Cruise/Wagner Productions acquired the film rights in 2005. Screenwriter Josh Olson was then hired to adapt Child's then-most recent novel in the Reacher series, One Shot (2005). In July 2010, Christopher McQuarrie, who previously collaborated with Cruise/Wagner Productions on the 2008 film Valkyrie, signed on to rework Olson's script and ultimately direct the film. Casting In June 2011, Tom Cruise was in talks for playing the role of Jack Reacher. The following month, Cruise closed a deal with the studios and signed on for the part. Some fans of the novel series became vocal over the casting of Cruise due to the actor's height not matching the description of Reacher in the novels. Explaining the casting decision, author Lee Child said that it would be impossible to find a suitable actor to play the giant Reacher and to recreate the feel of the book onscreen, and that Cruise had the talent to make an effective Reacher. Child also said, \\"Reacher's size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force, which Cruise portrays in his own way.\\" Of Cruise's relatively small stature, Child said, \\"With another actor you might get 100% of the height but only 90% of Reacher. With Tom, you'll get 100% of Reacher with 90% of the height.\\" Following the casting of Cruise, Rosamund Pike was cast as the female lead. Other actresses who were in the running for the role included Hayley Atwell and Alexa Davalos. By September 2011, the main cast was locked in with the hiring of David Oyelowo, Richard Jenkins, Jai Courtney, and Robert Duvall. Werner Herzog, primarily known for his directorial work, rounded out the cast in October 2011 when he signed on to play the film's chief villain. In April 2017, Dwayne Johnson revealed that he was in the running to play Jack Reacher before Cruise was hired. In a 2018 interview, two years after the 2016 release of the sequel, Child agreed that the readers were correct in their criticism, stating: > I really enjoyed working with Cruise. He's a really, really nice guy. We had > a lot of fun. But ultimately the readers are right. The size of Reacher is > really, really important and it's a big component of who he is...So what > I've decided to do is ‚Äì there won't be any more movies with Tom Cruise. > Instead we're going to take it to Netflix or something like that. Long-form > streaming television, with a completely new actor. We're rebooting and > starting over and we're going to try and find the perfect guy. Filming Production on the film began in October 2011. Cruise performed all of his own driving stunts during the film's signature car chase sequence. \\"Action to me is something very fun to shoot. The challenge in most car chases is you're trying to hide the fact that it's not the actor driving,\\" McQuarrie said. \\"The challenge here was the exact opposite. We were trying to find a way to show that it was always Tom driving. He's literally driving in every stunt sequence.\\" In February 2012, Kevin Messick, one of the film's executive producers, sued Don Granger and Gary Levinsohn, two other producers, for breach of contract over a joint venture agreement, claiming he had \\"helped to develop the film, renew Paramount's options for the rights to the book, and participated in the search for a screenwriter\\" but starting in July 2010, had been left out of meetings with the screenwriter and the studio and not given certain drafts of the screenplay while it was under development. Messick is suing for \\"unspecified damages, his producer's fees and the right to participate in any upcoming sequels.\\" Music The film's musical score was composed by Joe Kraemer, who previously scored director McQuarrie's The Way of the Gun (2000). Kraemer was announced as the composer for the film in July 2012, having already started work on it. After spending eight weeks working with McQuarrie on materials to present to producers, Kraemer's hiring was approved and he directly began working on the film's opening eight minutes. \\"I have a number of tricks that I use to spark the creative process,\\" said Kraemer on his scoring process after having seen the film. \\"Sometimes I'll use my mathematical understanding of music to devise a theme (such as the open fifths of Reacher's theme), sometimes I'll have an orchestral color in mind (i.e. the music for THE ZEC). The actual composing process probably resembles Max Steiner more than anyone else I know of. I start at the first frame of the movie and work my through to the end, chronologically, in order.\\" The film is noted for its balance between music and silence, with music primarily absent or reserved during a majority of the film's action sequences. Discussing his approach to this balance, Kraemer described, \\"Music can make such an impact when it enters a scene, and obviously the only way to do that is to have silence beforehand. I also generally like to have long tails on my cues so that they sort of fade away rather than ending abruptly. In this way, I try to weave music in and out very carefully so that the audience is as unaware as possible of the entrances and exits. I often cite Patton as a prime example of great spotting ‚Äì a three and half hour biopic with, what, twenty-eight minutes of score? That's unheard of today. But it worked!\\" The score was performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony and recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. A soundtrack album for the film was released on December 18, 2012 by La-La Land Records. ;Track listing Distribution Marketing The trailer for Jack Reacher was officially released on Cruise's birthday, , 2012. Theatrical release Jack Reacher, then titled One Shot, was originally slated to be released in February 2013. In March 2012, the release date was brought forward by Paramount Pictures to December 21, 2012, hoping to capitalize on the box office success of Cruise's Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Ghost Protocol, which was released at a similar point in 2011. The film's new release date pushed the release of World War Z back six months. The film was released in North American markets on December 21, 2012, with a premiere initially planned for Pittsburgh's SouthSide Works megaplex on December 15, 2012, which was to be attended by the film's stars, and Lee Child.Vancheri, Barbara, \\"Tom Cruise returning for 'Jack Reacher' premiere: Movie filmed in city; mid-December event first here in decades\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, November 25, 2012 On December 15, 2012, Paramount Pictures announced it was indefinitely postponing the film's premiere screening in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, out of respect for the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which had occurred the day before. The opening scene shows a sniper shooting at people including a woman holding a small child, and one point aiming the cross-hairs directly at her. Writer-director McQuarrie endorsed the decision, saying he and Cruise insisted upon it: Nobody should be celebrating anything 24 hours after a tragic event like that. We thought long and hard about it. This was not a snap judgment, because we wanted to give back to the city of Pittsburgh [by having the premiere there], because they were so great to us. The film held its United Kingdom premiere on December 10, 2012 at London's Odeon Leicester Square. It was released in the U.K. on December 26, 2012. Home media Jack Reacher was released onto Blu-ray and DVD formats in the United Kingdom on April 22 and in North American territories on May 7, 2013 by Paramount Home Media Distribution. The Blu-ray release contains two commentary tracks and three behind-the-scenes featurettes. Jack Reacher received a 4K UHD Blu-Ray release on June 26, 2018.

Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 63%, based on 180 reviews, with a rating average of 6.27/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Jack Reacher is an above-average crime thriller with a smoothly charismatic performance from Tom Cruise.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted score of 50 out of 100, based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade filmgoers gave the film was an \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Tom Cruise is in fine form as mysterious tough guy Jack Reacher finally reaches the big screen.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"This is Cruise's show. And he nails it. The patented smile is gone, replaced by a glower that makes Jack Reacher a dark and dazzling ride into a new kind of hell.\\" Dec 18, 2012 Many of the negative reviews still referred to the film as entertaining, including The Guardian, which called it \\"outrageous but entertaining\\". Peter Debruge of Variety was critical of the casting of Cruise as Reacher: \\"Reacher is a brawny action figure whose exploits would have been a good fit for the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone back in the day, but feel less fun when delegated to a leading man like Tom Cruise. The star is too charismatic to play someone so cold-blooded, and his fans likely won't appreciate the stretch. \\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \\"That Cruise fails to make a case for Reacher's allure, though, has less to do with physical dissonance than it does with the film's inability - stupefying inability, really - to otherwise make a case for the character's originality in a movie so choked with visual clich√©s and dreadfully moldy dialogue.\\" Sequel While Jack Reacher was intended to be a tent-pole for a film series, it was initially reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to its lackluster run at the North American box office. However, in February 2013, the possibility of a sequel became more likely after the film surpassed a gross of $200 million worldwide. On December 9, 2013, it was announced that Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions were moving forward with the development of a sequel, reportedly based on the 2013 Jack Reacher novel Never Go Back. Principal photography on the sequel, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, began on October 20, 2015, in New Orleans. The sequel was directed by Edward Zwick, produced by Tom Cruise, Don Granger, and Christopher McQuarrie and was written by Zwick, Richard Wenk, and Marshall Herskovitz. It stars Tom Cruise, Cobie Smulders, Patrick Heusinger, Aldis Hodge, Danika Yarosh, and Holt McCallany. The plot follows Reacher going on-the-run with an army major who has been framed for espionage, and it reveals a dark conspiracy. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back was released on October 21, 2016, in IMAX and conventional formats.Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - The IMAX Experience It grossed $161 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.

Jahrbuch des Landesarchivs Berlin (2008). Led by Bruno Ernst Buchrucker, groups of the Black Reichswehr wanted to bring down the Reich government of Chancellor Gustav Stresemann and replace the parliamentarian- democratic Republic with a national dictatorship. Another motive for the putsch was the Reichswehr's decision to disband work details, causing many of their members to lose their livelihood. The attempt to occupy K√ºstrin, a garrison city, was prevented by units of the Reichswehr. Buchrucker and other officers were arrested and sentenced for high treason to imprisonment in a fortress or prison. The bulk of the rebels were soon released and were not punished. For a short time, the putsch controlled the citadel and Fort Hahneberg, but were then forced to surrender to the Reichswehr.

From 2006 to 2012 he served as a member of the Maine House of Representatives, representing House District 118, part of Portland, Maine. From 2013 through 2016, Hinck held an at-large seat on the Portland, Maine City Council. Early life, education, and law career Hinck was born in Sacramento, California, and spent most of his childhood in the Liberty Corner section of Bernards Township, New Jersey and also lived in Bernardsville, New Jersey. He was an honor student, an Eagle Scout and a varsity athlete. After graduating from Bernards High School in 1972, he worked his way through the University of Pennsylvania as a taxicab driver, projectionist and theater usher. He graduated with a dual major in English and History. While an undergraduate, he co-founded a jazz club called the New Foxhole Caf√© in West Philadelphia. In 1976, Hinck spent six months teaching English language at the Iran-America Society in Isfahan, Iran. He traveled in the Middle East from Turkey through Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern India. In 1977, Hinck moved to Seattle, Washington, where he worked in the local movie business, managing a landmark movie theater and buying and booking films. He subsequently became involved with the Greenpeace movement, co-founded the national organization known as Greenpeace USA, and served as National Campaign Director. In 1990, Hinck earned a law degree from the UC Berkeley School of Law. Hinck was associate editor of the California Law Review where he also published The Republic of Palau and the United States: Self-Determination Becomes the Price of Free Association. In 1991, Hinck married Juliet Browne, whom he had met in law school. Browne is a partner at Verrill Dana law firm, where she is chair of the firm's Environmental Law Group. She is also a trustee of Unity College in Unity, Maine. After law school, Hinck initially practiced law with Morrison & Foerster, then California's largest law firm. At MoFo, Hinck represented defendants in securities fraud class actions such as In re VeriFone Sec. Lit., Civ. No. C-90-2705-VRW (N.D. Cal.) He then practiced with Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, a leading class-action law firm. Hinck worked on consumer and environmental class actions and served as plaintiffs' class counsel in the massive maritime environmental tort case In re Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. In 1993, both Hinck and his wife Juliet Browne took positions as Assistant Attorneys General in Palau, a United Nations trusteeship in the Western Pacific. Hinck successfully litigated a series of cases that in 1994 enabled the Republic of Palau to become a sovereign nation. Hinck also successfully prosecuted criminal cases including one where he gained the conviction of legislators for trafficking in dangerous narcotics. In 1995 he was designated Acting Attorney General for the new nation. In 1998, working with Lewis Saul & Associates, which has offices in Washington DC and Portland, Maine, Hinck filed the first statewide case in the country against oil companies over groundwater contamination in Maine caused by the gasoline additive MTBE. Subsequently, Hinck helped to organize cases nationwide for recovery from MTBE pollution. Environmental activism Greenpeace USA In November 1978, Hinck took a job in Seattle working for a monthly newspaper published by the environmental organization Greenpeace, then based in Vancouver, B.C. The next year, Hinck was hired as the Media and Campaign Director for Greenpeace Seattle. In late 1979, he represented that office at a meeting of the U.S.-based branches of Greenpeace and joined in the creation of the new national affiliate, Greenpeace USA. In the years that followed, Hinck was instrumental in building Greenpeace USA into one of the nation's largest and most influential environmental groups. He led Greenpeace campaigns on a range of issues related to preserving clean air and water, protecting the marine environment, and encouraging development of clean energy. From 1979 to 1981 Hinck played a leading role in efforts by Greenpeace Seattle and Greenpeace Vancouver to prevent oil pollution on the Northwest Coast. The Greenpeace campaign achieved a ban on oil supertankers in Puget Sound and an end to plans to construct the Northern Tier Pipeline. Hinck led Greenpeace in some of its earliest work on controlling toxic pollution. In 1982, Hinck and Greenpeace exposed the dangerous practices of the Western Processing Company, a waste- handling firm. The company, located in Kent, Washington, had surreptitiously buried thousands of barrels of dangerous toxic compounds on company grounds. Greenpeace pressure eventually led to federal EPA enforcement proceedings. The site was placed on the federal Superfund list and was eventually completely cleaned up with money from WPC and its clients, including Boeing. In 1983 Hinck assumed Greenpeace USA's key leadership position of Campaign Director. In that capacity, Hinck worked with Greenpeace Canada to confront a Russian whaling operation on the Siberian coast in the North Pacific. On July 18, 1983, Greenpeace's flagship Rainbow Warrior sailed into Soviet waters off Siberia just as the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission was underway in Cambridge, England. The Greenpeace ship landed at a remote whaling station, where seven Greenpeace activists went ashore and were arrested. The Rainbow Warrior started out to sea in order to deliver to the outside world documentation of the whaling operation and the arrest of Greenpeace workers. Pursued by a warship, a merchant vessel and a helicopter, the Rainbow Warrior escaped across the Bering Strait to US waters near Nome, Alaska. The Greenpeace activists were held captive for five days while Hinck negotiated their release with Soviet authorities. The transfer was made at sea on the International Date Line from a Soviet warship to the Rainbow Warrior before a worldwide media audience. Hinck collaborated on the worldwide effort to prevent dumping nuclear waste at sea. The work of Hinck's team at Greenpeace USA, along with that of collaborators, resulted in the U.S. government's dropping plans to recommence nuclear waste disposal at sea. Greenpeace subsequently achieved a total ban on nuclear dumping through the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, an international treaty now commonly referred to as the London Convention. Hinck also initiated efforts to curtail the incineration of highly toxic waste at sea. The efforts of Hinck and Greenpeace colleagues in North America and Europe resulted in a ban passed in the London Convention that effectively ended the practice. During this period, Hinck testified before Congressional committees and consulted on marine pollution issues with the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment and the National Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere. In 1985, Hinck led Greenpeace campaigns for the control of pollution and protection of clean water throughout North America. Hinck contributed to environmentalist successes against notorious toxic polluters, including the ASARCO Tacoma smelter in Washington state. For example, Chemical Waste Management (now WMX Technologies), later admitted that charges made against it for mishandling waste and other practices had \\"proved well-founded\\" and had resulted in important improvements. Hinck initiated efforts related to toxic waste and toxic product exports from the Western industrialized countries to lesser developed countries. This campaign culminated in the adoption of a treaty known as the Basel Convention, which regulates transboundary shipping of hazardous waste; 160 nations are now signatories to this treaty. In 1986 and 1987, Hinck and Greenpeace colleague Kelly Rigg initiated the first Greenpeace campaign to tackle environmental harm arising from the lending practices of the World Bank and other multilateral development banks. In 1996, after attending law school and practicing law in California, Palau and Maine, Hinck returned to Greenpeace. He was hired by Greenpeace International Executive Director Thilo Bode to serve as International Campaign Director. In that capacity, working out of the Amsterdam headquarters, Hinck served as delegate to the 1997 convention in Kyoto, Japan, which generated the Kyoto Protocol. Natural Resources Council of Maine From 2003 to 2006, Hinck worked as Staff Attorney for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, Maine's leading environmental advocacy group. Hinck worked on developing clean renewable energy and alternatives to toxic pollution. In 2004, Hinck and NRCM achieved a substantial victory with the signing into law of Maine's landmark electronic waste law, which for the first time required manufacturers to take responsibility for environmentally sound recycling of computers and TVs. While at NRCM, Hinck helped to make Maine a leader in reducing mercury pollution. Maine House of Representatives Elections Jon Hinck ran for the Maine House of Representatives in 2006 in Maine's 118th House District, based in the city of Portland. He defeated incumbent State Representative John Eder, a Green Independent, 52%-48%. In 2008, he won re-election to a second term against Joshua Miller, also a Green Independent, 74%-26%. In 2010, he won re-election to a second term against Green Independent Carney Brewer and Republican Mark Carpentier 72%-14%-14%. which covers part of Portland. Tenure In 2006 Hinck authored L.D. 837, An Act to Prevent Infant Exposure to Harmful Hormone-disrupting Substances, which would have set new guidelines for chemicals in children's products, including a ban on Bisphenol A, popularly known as BPA. The bill was defeated, but some of its provisions were subsequently adopted through rulemaking. During Hinck's two sessions as co-chair of Maine Legislature's Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology, the Committee worked on and unanimously passed out legislation on such subjects as: 1) rural broadband infrastructure, known in Maine as the \\"three ring binder\\"; 2) the smart grid; 3) ocean energy development; 4) energy corridors; and 5) Property Assessed Clean Energy (\\"PACE\\") legislation to provide innovative financing for efficiency, weatherization and residential use of renewable power. These bills were passed by the full legislature and signed into law by Governor Baldacci. In 2010, Hinck successfully sponsored LD 1535, An Act To Create a Smart Grid Policy in the State, which was signed into law in 2010. The law promotes development of an electrical transmission system to manage and reduce energy use. Hinck introduced a bill to encourage best practices and greater responsibility in the dispensing and prescribing of addictive painkillers like OxyContin; that bill has now been enacted as Resolve, To Reduce Opioid Overprescription, Overuse and Abuse. Committee assignments Hinck served as House Chair of the legislature's Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology and was later ranking member. He served on the Joint Select Committee on Maine's Energy Future and the Commission to Study Maine's Energy Infrastructure. He served for several years as vice-chair of the Energy and Environment Committee of the Council of State Governments Eastern Regional Council, an organization of legislators from Eastern states and Canadian provinces. Hinck was also a member of the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators and the National Coalition of Legislators for Energy Action Now, pushing the United States Congress for progressive energy and climate policies. Controversy Hinck's wife, Juliet Browne, served on Governor John Baldacci's wind power task force and was a leading pro-wind power attorney in the state. Some anti- wind power activists alleged that Hinck, as co-chair of the Utilities and Energy Committee, had a conflict of interest regarding projects from which his wife's clients would benefit. He requested a ruling from the state Ethics Commission, which ruled that he would not violate the Legislature's ethics code. 2012 campaign for U.S. Senate On November 12, 2011, Rep. Hinck announced his candidacy for the United States Senate seat then held by Olympia Snowe. Hinck collected over 2,000 signatures and appeared on the ballot for the Democratic Primary. Hinck lost the primary to State Senator Cynthia Dill, finishing in third place of the four contestants. Portland City Council In November 2013, Hinck won a seat on the Portland, Maine City Council and was sworn in on December 2. Hinck defeated Portland attorney Wells Lyons, receiving 7,101 votes, 58 percent of those cast, while Lyons received 5,171 votes, or 42 percent. For one year, Hinck chaired the Portland City Council's Energy & Sustainability Committee. Under his leadership in 2016, Portland: 1) committed to the construction of Maine's largest municipal solar power installation; 2) joined the fewer than two dozen municipalities in the United States that require energy building benchmarking of large commercial and residential buildings; and 3) committed to replace all of Portland's old street lights and changing them out for new energy-efficient LED units. In 2015, working with then Mayor Michael Brennan, Hinck was instrumental in assuring passage of a measure that for the first time set a minimum wage in the City of Portland higher than the statewide minimum. The new minimum wage of $10.10 an hour went into effect on January 1, 2016, and rose to $10.68 per hour on January 1, 2017, though the sub-minimum wage for service employees who receive tips was not increased, a carve-out that Hinck vocally supported. With the increase, Portland went from having the sixth lowest minimum wage in country as a function of the area cost of living to the nation's twelfth highest minimum wage. (In 2016, Maine voters passed a ballot initiative raising the minimum wage statewide to $12 by 2020; the statewide minimum wage became higher than Portland minimum wage as of January 1, 2019, making the city ordinance effectively moot.) In 2014, Hinck also played a lead role when Portland adopted an ordinance requiring a 5 cent fee on all disposable plastic and paper bags provided at supermarkets, grocery stores and other retail shops. Hinck was defeated on re-election by Pious Ali, who advocated for a bond opposed by Hinck to renovate the city's four most run-down elementary schools. Ali won with 63 percent of the vote, while Hinck received 20 percent and a third challenger, libertarian Matthew Coffey, received 17 percent.

Born in Bradford, Pennsylvania and raised in Buffalo, NY, Schlopy attended Orchard Park High School in Orchard Park, New York. He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines from 1981 to 1984 where he was a two-time Academic All-Big Ten placekicker.(Enter Schlopy as the last name on the search page, and press enter) As a Western New York native, Schlopy, a barefoot placekicker, signed a contract with the Buffalo Bills in 1985. In 1986 he signed with the Seattle Seahawks where he had an outstanding pre-season but failed to unseat incumbent Norm Johnson. https://apnews.com/e195f344059a6a9524270bdde73bd718 A highly sought-after free agent, Schlopy again signed with Buffalo in 1987 feeling that was his best opportunity to win a job. The Bills were under new head coach Marv Levy and new quarterback Jim Kelly. After a spectacular pre-season Schlopy, did not get the opportunity to attempt any field goals in the regular season and was released. He was called upon several weeks later during the 1987 NFL Players Strike to fill in as placekicker for the Buffalo Bills, while Scott Norwood took part in the strike. Schlopy attempted no field goals in his first two games, made one extra point and another extra point blocked. Schlopy played a crucial role in the Bills' win against the New York Giants, kicking two field goals for a 6‚Äì3 victory, the second coming with 19 seconds remaining in overtime. In doing so Schlopy became one of 3 barefoot kickers in NFL history to win a regular season game in overtime. Schlopy's professional football career ended after that game when the strike ended and Norwood returned. Schlopy became a cameraman on feature films beginning in 1989. He joined the IASTE local 600 Camera Guild in 1996.[3] His credits include Revenant (first assistant camera, 2015), Iron Man 3 (first assistant camera second unit, 2013), Transformers (first assistant camera, 2007), Air Force One (first assistant camera,1997), Seabiscuit (first assistant camera, 2003), Academy award winning Crash (first assistant camera, 2004), Swordfish (first assistant camera, 2001), Bad Times at the El Royale (first assistant camera, 2018), A Bad Moms Christmas (first assistant camera, 2017) Ride Along and Ride Along 2, (first assistant camera 2014 and 2016), Primary Colors (first assistant Steadicam 1998) Starship Troopers (first assistant Steadicam, 1997), Wanted (first assistant camera, 2008), The Rookie (first assistant camera, 2002) Red Dawn (first assistant camera, 2011), Jonah Hex (first assistant camera, 2010), High School (first assistant camera, 2010), G.I.

Applications to Covid-19 , studies and trials are underway that examine the possible benefits of nitric oxide in the treatment of Covid-19. This research is related to the role of nasal breathing in the creation of nitric oxide, which increases oxygen absorption in the lungs. Nitric oxide was also investigated as an experimental therapy for SARS. Brian Strickland, MD, a fellow in Wilderness Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital who studies ‚Äúacute respiratory distress‚Äù in high altitudes, is applying this research towards Covid-19. He is currently involved in clinical trials which apply the use of inhaled nitric oxide as a treatment for Covid-19. This approach was inspired by the work of Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at the Harvard Medical School N. Stuart Harris, who has been studying the effects of altitude sickness on mountain climbers, such as those who climb Mount Everest. Harris noticed that the consequences of high level altitude sickness on the human body mirrored Covid -19‚Äôs dysfunctional impact on the lungs. His focus on nitric oxide comes from its role in being able to breathe in high altitudes.

It was one of only four films to receive the honorary distinction \\"Film of the Nation\\" (\\"Film der Nation\\") by the Reich Propaganda Ministry Censorship Office. The success of the 1940 film Bismarck led to this film as a sequel. The film is also known as Bismarck's Dismissal in the United Kingdom, Schicksalswende (West German rerun title) and Wilhelm II. und Bismarck (new West German title).  Plot summary  The film shows Bismarck being dismissed by Wilhelm II of Germany and the dilettantes who surround him. An unscrupulous schemer plays on the king's desire to lead and so persuades him to the dismissal. This results in a disastrous two-front war by destroying Bismarck's treaty with Russia and leaving him to lament with the question of who would complete his work.  Cast   Soundtrack   Release and reception  The war with Russia delayed its release, and it was not exported, owing to the obvious parallels. Motifs Much emphasis was laid on Bismarck's notion of Greater Germany. His failure was depicted as leading to the Treaty of Versailles.

Blunt dissection consumes a large proportion of time in most surgeries and has not changed significantly in centuries. It requires great skill, can be tedious, nerve-wracking, and risky. Repairs are often required . Blunt dissection is contrasted to sharp dissection, the practice of slicing through tissues with scalpels, scissors, electrosurgery, or other advanced technologies usually employing heat. New devices are expected to soon make blunt dissection safer, faster and easier. Use in pneumothorax It is one method employed prior to the insertion of a chest drain following a pneumothorax. Following incision above the rib (to avoid the neurovascular bundle), blunt dissection of the subcutaneous tissue, external, internal and innermost intercostal muscles allows access to the pleura.BTS guidelines for the insertion of a chest drain Indeed, blunt dissection is now considered the favoured approach for the insertion of large bore chest tubes since it results in fewer complications.Haggie JA.

Early life and education  In 1974, Peng was born in Chengdu, Sichuan province, China. Peng's father is Peng Xiancheng. Peng graduated from Nankai University with a BA in fine arts in 1997, and earned a Masters of Philosophy in Aesthetics in 2000.  Work and themes  The Beijing-based artist's works often feature classical ink and color painting, depicting landscapes of trees, rivers, and pagodas. Her work reflects on the impact of globalization upon China's cultural heritage, often also featuring motifs of fashion and production. Her paintings are often placed on unconventional materials, such as the insides of shoes or molded torsos or legs made of rice paper, resembling the mannequins from which they were modeled. One series of works also included paintings of classical Chinese robes on paper and silk. Her mixed-media works deal with collective history, representation and replication, and often have a calligraphic element. After completing a painting, Peng will create a digital reproduction that is placed in conjuncture with the handcrafted original. Her work often contains a slight subversion of what initially appear to be strictly traditional works. Her work on clothing and shoes can also be read as delving into themes of embodiment, femininity, and history. Peng collaborated with the Italian shoe brand Sergio Rossi, to create ten editions of hand painted rice paper boots.  Letters  Her work, \\"Letters From a Distance\\", 2012, won the APB Foundation Signature Art Prize 2014. Consisting of materials such as handmade linen paper, jade pins, and oxbone scrollbars, Peng draws upon tradition, fixing upon such techniques as an end to themselves for exploration, rather than a medium. Peng also subverts her medium in Try to Write Me a Letter, 2013, and Two Ends of a Cloud, 2013, where delicate ink paintings are accompanied by the translation of two letters, one from Austrian poet Ingeborg Bachmann to Paul Celan, an important World War II poet, another from Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelly to John Keats. Keats later died, and Bachmann's affair with Celan fell apart. At first glance, the accompaniment appears ordinary, but the themes of love, longing, sorrow and loss are echoed by the depiction of a parting at the shore, and another scene of a scholar looking out over an embankment, as boats are moored and unloaded. While the comparison may appear clear, the expression of emotion as restrained within the paintings, but vividly described within the letters emphasize cultural differences. Peng's body of work continues to delve into these themes of yearning, a sense of alienation, and nostalgia for the past.  Awards and recognitions  From 2000 to 2006 she was editor for Yishu art magazine. She was one of 25 artists included in the \\"Contemporary Art from China: Visual Expression Through Ink and Paper\\" exhibition. Her work has been featured in exhibitions at the He Xiangning Museum in Shenzheng, the National Art Museum of China in Beijing, the National Art Museum of Malaysia, Fukuoka Art Museum in Yokohama, and Kunstmuseum Luzern in Switzerland. Her work resides in the permanent collection of the National Museum of Art in China, the Brooklyn Museum, the Asian Art Center of San Francisco, and the Hong Kong Museum of Art.

He was originally the drummer for The Stands (2003‚Äì2004) playing on both the band's albums however he left before the band eventually split up. Following his departure, Pilgrim has established a career as a singer-songwriter, releasing four solo albums to date: Lover, Love Her (2007), Sunshine (2009), Pixels and Paper (2011) and Morning Skies (2017). He has also drummed for several artists including John Power and Paul Weller. Biography Pilgrim joined The Stands as drummer in 2003 and played with the band for one year. The band were part of Liverpool's Bandwagon scene in the early 2000s and Noel Gallagher was an early fan of The Stands. Whilst in the band Pilgrim played on both their studio albums All Years Leaving (2004) and Horse Fabulous (2005) however he left before their 2005 U.S. tour. After leaving The Stands, Pilgrim played with The Cuckolds from 2005 to 2006 and began work as a session musician playing with artists such as Akeboshi and Sophie Solomon (who he also toured with). In 2007, he joined Northern Irish band The Fools and played on their only release, the Enjoy It EP (2007). Pilgrim joined John Power's band for the Willow She Weeps tour and also played on Power's third studio album Stormbreaker (2008). Pilgrim then went on to drum for Paul Weller joining his band for the 22 Dreams tour, after making his debut at a charity gig at the Roundhouse, London for a Crisis Consequences charity gig in March 2008. Pilgrim played on the album Wake Up the Nation (2010) and has been credited for a variety of roles on most of Weller's studio albums since. In 2011 Pilgrim also recorded and toured with the reformed Cast on their new album Troubled Times, in place of original drummer Keith O'Neill, which was released in March 2012. With Weller, Pilgrim has extensively toured North America, Europe, Asia, the UK and Ireland, also playing at the Sydney Opera House for a sold-out three-night run in early 2018. Weller has also allowed Pilgrim to play his own songs on several occasions at his shows, including Sunshine and Love on Your Side. In 2016, Weller's band took the advantage of a hiatus in touring to perform two tours of their own and release an album as The Songbook Collective, with the addition of Steve Cradock's wife Sally on backing vocals, keys and percussion. Most members wrote several original songs for the record, recorded by the group. They performed this original material alongside their other separate work at live shows. Pilgrim contributed three songs to the album: Weight of the World, Instant Gratification Blues and Laura's Song. Live, he would play several of his own songs including Firecracker and Explode the Sun with an acoustic guitar, backed by the rest of the band. He also sung on Ocean Colour Scene song The Circle, playing drums on the set-ending cover of The Jam's Art School. The band also performed at The Jam celebration show at Liverpool's Echo Arena in October 2016 alongside From the Jam and others, to end Nicky Weller's exhibition in the city, About the Young Idea. In 2017, Pilgrim released his fourth studio album Morning Skies. Recorded at Weller's Black Barn studios, the album featured several appearances from Weller, plus Danny Thompson on double bass and Rachael Jean Harris on backing vocals. He played several shows to promote the album, including two alongside Thompson at the Half Moon in Putney and Edge Hill University, Ormskirk. Also around this time, Pilgrim's third album Pixels and Paper was re-released on white vinyl to celebrate its fifth anniversary. In January 2018, prior to embarking on Paul Weller's Spring UK arena tour, Pilgrim released a demo entitled Beautiful Blue, for free download from his Bandcamp page. A fifth studio album, also featuring Thompson, has been discussed, although there has been no release date announced yet. In his tenth year in Weller's band, Pilgrim assumed a more forward role. Since 2017, Pilgrim had sat at the front during the acoustic encores, singing a verse of Wild Wood when it was played (Pilgrim came to national attention doing that on Jools Holland's Royal Albert Hall show to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his show Later... in 2017), also contributing acoustic guitar to Come On/Let's Go and Hopper. For a pair of shows with an orchestra at London's Royal Festival Hall in October 2018 and a BBC Radio 2 In Concert broadcast at the start of November, Pilgrim sat at the front of the stage playing acoustic guitar, with The Moons' Ben Gordelier on drums. Pilgrim also sung Conor O'Brien's verse in The Soul Searchers, providing backing vocals elsewhere.

The Royal Artillery Mounted Band with the Band of the Life Guards, Aldershot Origins From 1886 to 1939, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band served as the mounted counterpart of the Royal Artillery Band for horse artillery units of the Royal Artillery under the banner of the Royal Horse Artillery and was the United Kingdom's, and one of Europe's most famous mounted bands, and the favourite of Queen Victoria's. At the funeral of Queen Victoria on 2 February 1901, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band preceded the royal hearse, and the ceremonial troops of both the Royal Horseguards and the Lifeguards, followed by the Royal Artillery (Woolwich) Band. It was the first military band in Great Britain to ever appear on cinematic film. Like all bands of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Band maintained a full orchestra capability for which it was in great demand, particularly throughout Europe during the Cold War years. The Band was disbanded in 1984 as a result of Ministry of Defence cost-cutting measures. \\"...the largest mounted band ever seen\\" '[The Times, June 1984].  Historical basis of the RA Band  The first documented accounts of music in the 'English Artillery' date back to 1557 at the battle of St. Quentin (1557), where the Artillery had their \\"drumme and phife\\". Bands known as 'Hoboys' from the hautbois (oboes) of the French Horse Grenadiers, appeared throughout the cavalry and foot guards regiments. Twenty musicians from the 'Artillerie Band' augmented the Royal Band of King George II aboard a barge on the River Thames, situated \\"close to the Royal Barge\\" for the first performance of the 'Water Music', by George Frideric Haendel (H√§ndel), in 1717. It is likely that the Artillery raised additional musicians on ad hoc terms especially for the occasion (the title 'Royal' was first used in 1720). In 1731 we find the Hoboys of the Honourable Artillery Company, which consisted of three oboes, a curtall \\"and no more\\". The composer H√§ndel once again enlisted the services of the now 'Royal' Artillery Band on 27 April 1749 at the Royal Fireworks in Green Park. The number of musicians who augmented the Royal Band on that occasion is unspecified, but particular mention of the Artillery kettledrums is well documented. Also, the King had requested that \\"no fidels (stringed instruments) be used, but the composer wrote on the score that all the oboe and bassoon parts be doubled on strings (these players were again drafted from the Royal Artillery Band). Fifers were added to the Royal Artillery Corps of Drummers in 1748 on a permanent basis, and the Corps continued until after the Crimean War, when it became a bugle band. It soon became apparent that the bandsmen were becoming bored with the limited five-note compass of the instrument, and so they persuaded the instrument maker, Henry Distin to supply them with sets of his newly patented chromatic attachments, to enable the bugle to have the same compass as the cornet. This proved very successful, particularly after the furore created on Woolwich Front Parade, when two buglers performed the Mess Call, playing 'The Roast Beefe of Olde England' in (inadvertent) two-part harmony. The original kettledrums of the Royal Regiment of Artillery were of a uniquely large pattern, and were mounted on a carriage, designed especially for the purpose. In 1772 the carriage was used at the funeral of the first Duke of Marlborough, John Churchill. Until 1756 the carriage remained in permanent use, and then was stored in the Tower of London (where the artillery guns were made), where it was eventually destroyed by fire in the mid-nineteenth century. The uniform worn by the kettle-drummer, the driver, and the leader, was not the usual uniform of the Royal Artillery. Instead, they wore court livery, as is still seen worn by the drum majors and mounted musicians of the Household Cavalry, on royal, and State occasions today. The entitlement of the Royal Artillery Band to wear court livery (or State dress) still remains, though nowadays it is never exercised, and largely forgotten, most probably because they are not members of the Household Division. However, the Royal Artillery Band does maintain the distinction of being the only band, in which all of its members wear, as part of their ceremonial uniform, a band sword, at the waist. These distinctive swords were presented to the band by the Duke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria. The Royal Artillery bands were the only ones in the British Army, to wear gold belts, and gold crossbelts (all other musicians and bandsmen wear white, or composite patterned), as well as a uniquely styled musician's lyre badge, on the right forearm (all other musicians or bandsmen wear the British Army Bandman's Lyre on the upper arm). In 1994, because of the Band's role supporting the ceremonial duties of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, it was granted 'State' status, thereby becoming the eighth, and only non-Household Division band to carry that status. It is for this reason, that the Band will continue to remain at Woolwich, instead of relocating with the Regiment to Larkhill, the new permanent home of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. On 7 February 2012, the King's Troop relocated from St. Johns Wood, to Woolwich. Both the Royal Regiment, and the Royal Artillery Band, have always been particularly close to the hearts of the reigning monarchs of the United Kingdom, who have been Captains General of the RA in their capacity as commanders in chief of the British Armed Forces. Indeed, Her Majesty the Queen, Queen Elizabeth II, as well as holding the honorary appointment of 'Colonel-In-Chief' of several other regiments, also holds the more prestigious appointment of 'Captain General' of both the Royal Artillery, and the Honourable Artillery Company. Towards the end of the Seven Years' War (1756 - 1763), the Royal Artillery Band was formed, at the battle of Minden in Germany in 1762. Upon its arrival at Woolwich in 1762, where it would be permanently stationed, the status of the Band was made official. In 1763 other bands were adopted by various regiments and gradually became officially recognized. Prior to this period all bands (other than the RA Band) were raised only for special occasions and purposes, and were not paid for by the State, but by the officers of their particular regiments. Immediately afterwards they were dissolved. The Royal Artillery Band numbered eight players who \\"should be proficient upon the [oboe] and [bassoon] - four of each instrument\\". The articles of the band were written in German, but were also available translated into English, by virtue of the fact that the first eight musicians employed were German military personnel. The fact that the band was raised in Germany, in the same manner as the other Guards and regimental bands later founded, is by no means unusual. By November 1787, the Band (by now stationed at [Woolwich]) was under the command of its 'Master-Musician' Friederich Wiele, also an outstanding violinist. Among the eight musicians, there now numbered five Englishmen, and all of the musicians were capable of performing on stringed, as well as on wind, instruments. In 1795 the bandmaster George McKenzie described the band as possessing fifteen musicians. The proficiency of the musicians led to the desirability of more bands to entertain the numerous artillery regiments of the day. It is worth bearing in mind that although the Royal Artillery Band is the oldest permanent military band in Great Britain, its former years were not always within British shores, and because it remained unrecognized officially until 1762, 'official' bands existed first in the United States of America. By 1763 the second, and all subsequent military band in Britain became recognized officially. Indisputably, the Royal Artillery Band, with its well documented pedigree, is the oldest permanent employer of professional musicians in the kingdom, and the Royal Artillery Orchestra predates the first permanent civilian orchestra in the kingdom by 50 years (among those, there exists a long-standing rivalry between the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Hall√© Orchestra of Manchester, to claim this title) thereby making it Britain's oldest orchestra, with an entirely unbroken history. There are spurious claims by two other military bands, for being the oldest in the kingdom, but these cannot be substantiated, and that there is a significant difference between bands of drums and fifes, or trumpets, and those in which all instruments play in both four part harmony and counterpoint. In the case of the Artillery, their musicians were also required to play stringed instruments. History The Royal Horse Artillery Band (1797‚Äì1886) In January 1793, two troops of Royal Horse Artillery were raised, each being provided with two drummers \\"who also played upon the bugle-horn\\". In 1797 trumpeters were designated to these permanent troops. The band was supported financially solely by the officers of that regiment. At the advent of the nineteenth century, an unofficial mounted band is known to have existed in the regiment, because records show that it was supported and funded by the officers of that branch of the army, being under the charge of one Trumpet-Major Hall. In 1845, Bombardier Henry Lawson, one of the finest trumpeters in the country, and principal trumpet of both the Royal Artillery Band and the Royal Artillery Brass Band, was appointed as Trumpet-Major of the Royal Horse Artillery Band in 1845. Lawson, who joined the RA Band in 1823, was frequently compared with Koenig, the famous cornet player of Jullien's band. The Band improved considerably under his direction. He was succeeded, after his retirement in 1852 by Trumpet-Major George Collins, the brother of William Collins, bandmaster of the Royal Artillery Band. Collins introduced to the band, an instrument that he had helped to develop many years earlier, the 'keyed bugle' [a link to a history of the keyed bugle may be found in ¬ß7 below see esp. P.21]. The first bandmaster of the RHA band was James Browne, who was formerly principal flautist, and a violinist in the RA Band at Woolwich, who succeeded Collins in January 1870. Meanwhile, by the year 1869, so many brass instruments had been added to the band of buglers, that the title was changed to the Royal Artillery Brass Band. The RA Brass Band entered the lists of the Crystal Palace Band Contest in 1871, where it won the first prize of ¬£50. RA Band Drum Major, 1844 The Royal Horse Artillery Band when mounted now numbered 36 men, with kettle-drums and scarlet bannerols, and was regarded as the equal of the best cavalry bands in the army. As a dismounted band, they often deputized for the band of the Coldstream Guards. After the Franco-Prussian War, the numbers of troops in the Field Artillery increased substantially, with the result that the two large previously existing bands, the RA Band, and the RA Brass Band, because they were dismounted, found themselves without duty. The result was that the RHA Band was now required to attend all the parades of the Royal Horse Artillery and the Royal Field Artillery. The financial burden to the RHA officers who supported the band led to deep resentment, and the decision was made, in 1877, by the then Duke of Cambridge to form a new band from the best members of the RHA Band, and the RA Brass Band, with the express instruction that Bombardier Henry Lawson (of the RA Brass Band) be its bandmaster. A letter dated 13 November 1877 from the War Office confirms that a committee be set up to consider a plan put forward by the RHA for the formation of a mounted band for the whole regiment of artillery. On the disbandment of the RHA Band, its bandmaster, James Browne retired. Following the rider-training of the best members of the RA Brass Band, and together with the best members of the RHA Band, the new Royal Artillery Mounted Band came into being. The Royal Artillery Mounted Band (1886‚Äì1984) The Royal Artillery Mounted Band, which was for many dubbed \\"...the largest mounted band ever seen\\", was originally formed at Woolwich, London, on 19 January 1878, under the direction of its bandmaster, James Lawson, who had formerly led both the Royal Artillery Bugle Band and the Royal Artillery Brass Band. A surplus of horses from the Royal Horse Artillery and Royal Field Artillery prompted the creation of The Royal Artillery Mounted Band (Woolwich) which comprised 62 musicians, 42 of whom were mounted. Early years Later in the foundation year of the Mounted Band at Woolwich, news was received that the Duke of Cambridge had made the decision, that because of the large proportion of Horse and Field Artillery equipment, and troops situated in Aldershot, it was only right that the Garrison should have a mounted band permanently stationed there. During the following year, 25 mounted musicians and horses were posted to Aldershot, leaving 35 mounted musicians with the Royal Artillery Band in Woolwich. On 26 August 1887, the Woolwich 'mounted band' was suppressed. All of its members transferred to the Aldershot band. The remaining 12 musicians were absorbed into the Royal Artillery Band, which was ordered to provide a 'Mounted Portion' of twenty players. Eight musicians were immediately required to undergo rider training in order to prepare for mounted duty. The 'Mounted Portion' comprised: 1 'Serjeant in charge', 2 Bombardiers, and 17 'Bandsmen'. In 1894, the then Duke of Connaught arranged for a searchlight display to take place in Aldershot, for Queen Victoria. The Royal Artillery Mounted Band, as the main band opened the impressive display, that would become the first of the Aldershot Command searchlight tattoos, held annually to audiences often exceeding 500,000. Among its other prestigious engagements, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band \\"the largest mounted band ever seen\\" [The Times] had the privilege of heading the Lord Mayor of London's processions, and the funeral procession of Queen Victoria in 1901 where it preceded the hearse. Under its famous bandmaster, Mr James Lawson, the band contributed regularly to the Woolwich Town Hall concerts, but purely as a military band, \\"in which sphere [as was widely documented at the time], it eclipsed the Royal Artillery Band. It ought to be mentioned, that the famous Italian conductor of the Royal Artillery Band, Cavaliere Ladislao Zavertal, deliberately took no notice of Mr Lawson's achievements, preferring to concentrate his efforts into transforming the Royal Artillery Orchestra (Britain's oldest-established permanent orchestra, founded in 1763) into the ensemble that would become renowned throughout Europe. The instrumentation of the Royal Artillery Band in Aldershot came largely from the Royal Artillery Brass Band (formerly under the charge of Lawson), and consisted of 8 cornets, 3 tenor horns, two baritones, 2 E-Flat bombardons, and 1 pair of kettledrums. To this, 5 woodwinds, including E-Flat 'clarionette' and piccolo were added. All of the musicians were required to become proficient on stringed instruments - a required condition that has remained in all Royal Artillery bands from 1887 to the current day. In 1897 the 'mounted portion' of the Royal Artillery Band was disbanded, leaving the Aldershot band to fulfil all remaining mounted ceremonial duties. During the tour of New Zealand, by the Royal Artillery (Woolwich) Band (May 1913 - March 1914), approximately half of that band remained in London to provide an orchestra. The RA Bands Committee chose to allow Mr Henry Sims and the Royal Artillery Mounted Band to fulfill the London concerts at Queen's Hall, although the strings were actually augmented by those string players remaining in Woolwich. Orchestral music in all of the Royal Artillery's bands has always been maintained as an important, and integral feature of the Regiment's music, and the string sections in general, have always comprised mainly those musicians, whose primary instruments were/are stringed instruments. Likewise, primary brass, woodwind, and percussion players, would specialize in the military band ensembles. On 17 May 1913 The Royal Artillery Mounted Band gave the first performance at the opening of the new bandstand, at the riverside promenade (The Groves) in Chester. War years (1939‚Äì1945) In 1939 on the outbreak of war, the horses were returned to the Remount Depot. Before the end of 1940, the main four artillery bands were allotted their separate War stations. The Royal Artillery (Woolwich) Band was made responsible for tours in the Northern and Scottish Commands, and a single tour of duty in Northern Ireland. The Royal Artillery Mounted Band was renamed 'The Royal Artillery (Aldershot) Band' for the duration of the war, and moved in 1941 to Harrogate in North Yorkshire, to take over the Northern and Scottish Commands (to be stationed at Hildebrand Barracks, Penny Pot Lane, Harrogate), while the Woolwich band returned to London, to serve the South Eastern Command, with a small detachment of the band at Watford for the Eastern Command [the RA (Portsmouth) Band went to Cheshire for the Western Command, while the RA (Salisbury Plain) Band was sent to Bulford Camp for the Southern Command]. The number of days the Aldershot band spent away from headquarters, some of them in battle zones is: 176 (in 1941); 214 (in 1942); 171 (in 1943); 123 (in 1944). Upon the Band's return to Aldershot at the end of the war, at the King's suggestion, it was reinstated with the highly prized title 'Mounted Band' because of its former associations with the Royal Horse Artillery, and on the understanding that the RHA may at any time claim entitlement to the services of the Band above all requests by other regiments. It is also notable, that the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery (who, when their guns are on parade, are at the 'right of the line' of the British Army, and though not Household Cavalry, are nevertheless at the head of the Household Troops, which include the former) have always remembered the RHA connection of the Mounted Band with affection - still regarding them as their own - and the musicians were granted the right to be forever affiliated with this equestrian branch of the Service. The Royal Artillery Mounted Band, renamed 'Royal Artillery (Aldershot) Band' as the band of Northern Command, stationed from 1940-1945 in Hildebrand Barracks, Harrogate, North Yorkshire Post-war history and final years (1945‚Äì1984) On 1 August 1947 the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the Portsmouth and Salisbury Plain bands were granted staff band status, along with three other corps bands. In the case of these Royal Artillery bands, they were to be known as \\"minor staff bands\\" because they were under the administration of the Royal Artillery Band in Woolwich as the 'parent' unit. The then serving bandmaster of the Mounted Band, Mr David McBain, was commissioned as its first director of music. At that time, the band was stationed at Minden Barracks, Deepcut, Surrey. In 1967 the band moved to Germany where it replaced the Royal Artillery (BAOR) Band at Dortmund, although the 'BAOR' had, until then, been stationed in Oldenburg. During the band's extensive tour throughout Germany and in other European countries the band fulfilled many important engagements, including the British Week in Vienna ambassadorial event in October 1969. The band returned to the UK in 1972 to be stationed for the first time at Larkhill, on Salisbury Plain, where it replaced the newly styled 'Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band' (formerly the Royal Artillery (BAOR) Band). By now, it had been decided that the two bands would alternate locations every five years. The new arrangement continued until the final return of the Mounted Band to Larkhill, where it was disbanded within months of making its last-ever appearance at the Edinburgh Military Tattoo in 1984. The Royal Artillery was required in 1976 to provide a band to play for the Mounting of the Guard at Buckingham Palace. So that the Royal Artillery Band was able to still meet its previously agreed commitments for orchestra, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band formed the bulk of the 50-piece palace band, with its remaining men drawn from Woolwich. The Woolwich musicians being in the minority were thereby required to remove their band swords, to satisfy a uniform appearance. All three RA bands were reunited, with support from the various affiliated Territorial Army bands, at the Beating of the Retreat in June, 1980 on Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall Whitehall, in London, in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen, the Captain General of the Royal Regiment. The Royal Artillery Mounted Band, under the command of its Director of Music, Captain Brian Hicks, R.A. at West Riding Barracks, Dortmund During the 43-strong band¬¥s final five-year tenure in Germany, stationed at Dortmund, its strength rose briefly to 47 musicians (including three flutes, two oboes, thirteen clarinets, two bassoons, three French horns, and two euphoniums). Each of its musicians, in the true tradition of the Royal Artillery bands, played at least two instruments - one military band instrument and one orchestral (one of its musicians was recruited as a bouzouki player / violist, who also learned to play the clarinet!). This would be the high point in the size of the band, before it began to slowly diminish in size, though not in stature. The diversity and number of ensembles contained within the capabilities of the band were widely known and respected, and even included such exotic instruments as the accordion, and aforementioned bouzouki, with the band notably becoming the first to include a synthesizer in its commercial recordings under its then Director of Music, [Captain] Terence (Terry) Kenny. Musicians typically applied from all over the United Kingdom to join the band, responding to advertisements in such publications as 'Melody Maker' and 'Gramophone'. Kenny was succeeded by [Captain] Brian Hicks as Director of Music in October 1977. Hicks remained with the band until the first year of its return to Salisbury Plain. Prior to the band's return to the United Kingdom in 1982, it could still muster 38 musicians, however, following voluntary redundancies and postings to other bands, the number of musicians declined to 24 by the time its ultimate album was recorded, towards the end of 1983, at Wembley Studios, under the baton of [Captain] Frank Anthony Renton. Frank Renton did much to maintain the high profile of the Mounted Band, not least to boost the morale of the musicians awaiting their fates under the looming shadow of disbandment, with a choice of being posted to either Woolwich, or Germany to join the Royal Artillery Band and Alanbrooke Band respectively, or redundancy. Throughout its long history the Royal Artillery Mounted Band maintained a particularly high standard of performance, for which it will always be remembered. This held the band in good stead on the various occasions when, owing to its seniority, it would take precedence at prestigious events, such as during the Festival of Flanders on 6 September 1980, where at the 'Sportpaleis' in Gent, it was seen with the larger, and similarly famous Band of the Grenadier Guards. At the Sportpaleis, and at the Paleis des Beaux Arts (also in Gent), the band excelled both musically, and visually, with that of the Grenadier Guards again also participating. In spite of its many public appearances as a marching band and concert band, the band retained the kudos it had always received for its orchestra, and as such, by far exceeded the number of engagements it fulfilled as a military band. During its time in Dortmund, the orchestra regularly provided a 20-piece pit orchestra, to accompany the West Rhine Musical Society at the Garrison Theatre, Rheindahlen. The week-long productions included 'Princess Ida', 'Yeoman of the Guard', 'Fiddler on the Roof', 'Carousel', 'Patience', and 'My Fair Lady' among others, with further musicals to accompany at the Garrison Theatre, Dortmund, including 'My Fair Lady'. The Orchestra travelled regularly throughout the British Army of the Rhine area, and frequently across European borders, to perform at military bases, embassies, and also for civilian private hires. The orchestral library was almost as extensive as that of the military band. The Mounted Band was the only band of the British Army of the Rhine, to possess a true capability on stringed instruments, as each of its personnel, in the tradition of all Royal Artillery Band musicians, was expected to also play a stringed instrument in addition to either a wind, or a percussion instrument. The orchestra would typically play for three or four mess functions (i.e. banquets) per week, with certain musicians remaining to provide a dance band until the early hours in the morning, with most of the musicians still being required to appear in the military band on various parade grounds throughout Germany, in addition to frequent private (civilian) engagements and concerts. Many of the string players continued their careers in civilian orchestras, and at one time there was a predominance of ex-RA Mounted Band string players in the Royal Opera House Orchestra. Private orchestral engagements were particularly varied, and even included playing for all-Strauss galas and fashion shows, namely at the Hilton Hotel in Vienna, and accompanying artistes such as Harry Secombe, Eve Boswell, Moira Anderson, and others. These assets were suitably accorded the esteem they deserved, when on 25 October 1982, the last of the Band's quinquennial inspections, by the Inspector of Army Bands took place at Larkhill. The number of band members by that time at fallen to 33. In the traditions set by the band, as has indeed was also the case at the two previous Kneller Hall inspections (as they are usually dubbed), the Royal Artillery Mounted Band was awarded the highest possible marks in all areas, involving all ensemble combinations within the band. 1984 - Final year By the beginning of the year, the Band comprised 24 members, not including its Director of Music. By The last official photographs of the individual members of the Band were taken, and mounted in a large frame, to commemorate a band that had existed for almost a century. This set of photographs (shown above, right) is now in the possession of the Royal Artillery Band at Woolwich, London. The Orchestra and Dance Band were invited to play at the British Dental Association's Gala Dinner, at the Guildhall, London, on 16 June 1984, in the presence of the Lord Mayor of London. The Orchestra was conducted on that occasion by its Director of Music, Captain Frank Renton, RA. On the evening of 11 July the Band was present for a massed bands display, at the Royal School of Artillery, with the Royal Artillery Band, and bands of the 1st Battalion The Gloucester Regiment, 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. The final year of the Band was filled with numerous major engagements, culminating in a resounding triumph in Italy where the Band took part in the International Music Week in Turin and performed at the British Embassy in Rome (in June 1984). The last major engagement at which the Band performed, from mid-July until mid-August, was at the (now 'Royal -') Edinburgh Military Tattoo, as the senior band under the command of WO2 (BSM) S.M. Day. The other bands taking part at the time, including the Band of the Scots Guards, the Band of the Queen's Own Highlanders, the Band of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and the Royal Band South, of H.M. The Sultan of Oman. As the Mounted Band was at the time bereft of a director of music, the Tattoo Director of Music that year was Major D. Carson, Scots Guards. On 20 October 1984, a farewell dinner was held for the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, at the Warrant Officers' and Sergeants' Mess at Larkhill. Aside from the current members of the Band, three former band members attended, including Ernie Langhope, who served in the band from 1920 - 1945. For the occasion the RA (Woolwich) Band provided a six-piece mess orchestra. Days after the farewell dinner, the Band's remaining 24 members were posted to each of the remaining Royal Artillery's bands, with some following those who had already taken voluntary redundancy. Bandmasters and Directors of Music James Lawson became the first bandmaster of the Royal Artillery Mounted Band in Woolwich, and was succeeded by Henry Sims in Aldershot, who was bandmaster from 1886 - 1918. In 1919 it was decided by the Royal Military School of Music and the War Office, that 'Directors of Music' would head the three bands of the Household Cavalry, all bands of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Bands of the Royal Engineers, and the regimental bands of the five regiments of footguards of the Brigade of Guards. All other bands retained a 'Bandmaster' as head, and the Royal Artillery Band retained in addition to its director of music, a bandmaster, for the reason of it being the largest of all British military bands, with its own musical training establishment, the Junior Musicians Troop, Royal Artillery. Successors to Henry Sims were: *Augustus Joseph Dunn (1918‚Äì1920) *Thomas James Hillier (1920‚Äì1935) *Sam Rhodes (1935‚Äì1938) *David McBain (1938‚Äì1948) *Basil Hector Brown (1948‚Äì1958) *William Williams (1958‚Äì1966) *George Edwin Evans (1966‚Äì1972) *Terence Alan John Kenny (1972‚Äì1977) *Brian Erwin Hicks (1977‚Äì1982) *Frank Anthony Renton (1982‚Äì1984) In its last few months in existence, the band was conducted and managed by Drum Major Shaun Day. Four directors of Music of the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, during the postwar era, succeeded to the highest post in military music, that of Principal Director of Music, of the Royal Military School of Music, at Kneller Hall, Twickenham. The four DoMs were: David McBain, Basil Brown, George Evans and Frank Renton.

As a marching band, all RA bands wore the busby. In 1894 a new style black sable busby was introduced (the earlier busby having once replaced the shako from c. 1850 until the end of the 1860s) with a scarlet bag on the right, and a brass grenade on the left, which held a red cut feather plume. The busby was held in place on the head by a brass chin chain, on a black leather strap. The busby (originally the headdress of hussars) became the correct headdress for all mounted ceremonial duties, as well as for marching band. At some time during the late 1860s, the familiar modern helmet, with a ball replacing the usual spike (similar to that worn by policemen) appeared, which remained part of the uniform until 1894. [Shako >busby (c. 1850) >>modern helmet (from c. 1860) >>>modern busby (from 1894)] The tunic was not worn on horseback: the patrol jacket of the royal artillery was worn instead. The patrol jacket was made of navy blue cloth with a scarlet collar edged in gold lace; at each side on the front were gilt grenade badges. The front of the jacked was piped with yellow- ochre rope (later replaced with gold Russia braid) and was fastened by hooks and eyes. The shoulder straps were gold cords held in place by a gilt button at the collar. The cuffs of the jacket were navy blue with an Austrian knot in gold cord. The pouch belt (worn over the left shoulder) was white leather with a large black patent leather pouch (for carrying music cards, on the flap of which was fastened the RA gun badge. The waistbelt was also of white leather, with a brass snake-hook clasp. The RA band-sword [see \\"The Royal Artillery Band\\" (¬∂1) above] was not worn, and so the sword slings were linked together. Peculiar to the Mounted band were the girdles (similar to the broader stable belts of today) that were worn together with the pouch belts. The girdle (introduced in 1904) sported the RA colours, red, and blue, and was fastened with brass olivettes and loops (originally at the wearer's front, then at the side). A year later, a wider version, with a central stripe in blue was introduced to the RA Mounted Band, and later into the RA bands in Dover, Plymouth, and Portsmouth. In 1920, it was finally introduced into the RA Band at Woolwich. A more recent girdle design, still to be seen worn by some of the musicians in the 1980s, featured brass clasp-fastenings, adorned with the RA musicians' lyre. White leather gloves with clay-piping were uniquely worn in the Mounted Band (those worn in the other bands were of white brushed cotton). The riding breeches were navy blue with a broad scarlet stripe down the outer seam. The riding boots were of black leather and spurs were held on by straps. In undress, a blue forage (pill-box) cap with a gold lace band was worn. When marching, the mounted bands wore the standard officer pattern 'George' boot with 'dress' spurs fixed to the heel with screws, rather than the 'box' spurs as worn by officers. The silver-plated kettledrums were covered in a dark blue 'bib' (drum banner). The harness was of brown leather with a brass-studded bridle and a breast plate of brass, depicting the grenade badge. The shabraque was likewise decorated. The third, or 'foot rein' was fastened onto the stirrups. The bit reins, and bridal reins rested in the neck of the animal. The saddle was the standard army pattern. So as to make a distinction between the two bands, no kettle drum bibs or shabraques were used by the 'Mounted Portion' at Woolwich. In 1899, in anticipation of the start of the new millennium, the brass 'bomb' plume holder was moved to the front of the Royal Artillery busby, and the plume was changed from cut feather to scarlet horsehair. 1939-1984 During the Second World War, the band's uniform was identical to that worn by the RHA troops: khaki Service Dress with boots with puttees. The headdress was the khaki Service Dress cap, with a black leather chin strap, which continued to be worn by the Mounted Band until its last days. On the right arm forearm of the jacket, was a khaki worsted lyre, unique to artillery musicians. After the war, the band adopted, as its 'ceremonial' uniform, the No. 1 Dress jacket (blues) with scarlet facings, replaced the tunic. The corresponding No. 1 Dress trousers sporting a wide scarlet stripe on the outside seam were worn. Service stripes were permitted on No. 1 Dress jackets, and the RA stable belt continued to be worn. The busby was not reintroduced until the 1960s, the headdress of the time being the No. 1 Dress peaked cap. The Royal Artillery Woolwich Band continued to wear the band sword [an image of the sword can be found by following the link at the bottom of the page] with this uniform. Standard pattern black leather shoes were worn. After the reintroduction of the busby, close-fitting cavalry-style trousers were adopted, and these were buckled under the instep of the 'George' boot, by the aid of leather straps. Silver dress spurs were screwed to the heel of the boot. The stable belt was no longer worn, but replaced by the standard officer pattern leather cross belt, worn over the left shoulder, which was covered in 18 carat gold wire, with a small black patent leather pouch, onto which a gilt RA gun badge was fastened. In preparation for the birthday parade for Her Majesty The Queen, on Horse Guards Parade, London (June 1986), musicians from the surviving RA (Woolwich), and RA (Alanbrooke) bands were measured for the new design of tunic, in navy with scarlet cuffs and collar, quilted silk lining, and additional 18 carat gold braiding. The braiding was more pronounced according to the rank of the wearer. This is the design that continues to be worn by the present Royal Artillery Band. Regimental music The British Grenadiers The tune 'The British Grenadiers' was first adopted for use as a regimental march by the Honourable Artillery Company (the oldest British regiment), during the English Civil War. Although grenades were first thrown by artillerymen in 1643, the term 'grenade' was only first documented in 1688. Originally a Dutch song, the melody now known as 'The British Grenadiers' was brought to England by King William III of the Netherlands. Soon after the melody became popular in these islands, a version of it, titled 'The New Bath' appeared in a '17th Century Dance Book' by Playford. In the Netherlands, it is known as 'De jonge prins van Friesland' ('The Young Friesian Prince') after Prince Johann Willem Friso. In 1706, the march became the regimental quick march of the Royal Artillery, and was known as the 'Royal Artillery Grenadiers March', but was not declared 'official' until 1882. It first appeared in print, as 'The British Grenadiers' in 1740. As a regimental quick march, the short duration of the melody has always resulted in unwanted repetition, but in 1983, Lieutenant-Colonel Stanley Patch (then Director of Music) provided a suitable solution, by adding the 'Trio' section of another favourite artillery march, 'The Voice of The Guns', composed by Major F.J. Ricketts under the pseudonym 'Kenneth J. Alford'. The popularity of the tune 'The British Grenadiers' rivalled that of its contemporary 'Lilliburlero', and subsequently led to its adoption by all regiments who wear as their cap or collar badges, the symbol of the grenade. These include the Grenadier Guards, and all Fusilier regiments. The Trayne of Artillery's Grenadiers March Prior to the Royal Artillery adopting 'The British Grenadiers' as its regimental quick march, 'The Train of Artillery' (as it is now known) was the rather elegant (medium-)quick march of the royal regiment. This march first appeared in print, published by Thompson & Son, London, in 'The Compleat Tutor for the Fife', circa 1760. The first grenadiers were artillery men. The original military march is scored for eight players, comprising 2 piccolos (in two-part counterpoint), 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, and 2 drums. Two updated recordings exist by the Royal Artillery - one conducted by its director of music Major Robert Quinn, (in 18th Century style, albeit it scored for full modern military band), and a more up-to-date version, conducted by Lt Colonel Malcom Torrent. In Georgian times, the musicians ('bandsmen') would walk, rather than march, ahead of the fighting troops onto the battle field, in order to help boost the morale of the troops. The Minden Rose The origins of this march are obscure. The piece was first documented as 'Mindener-Marsch', and possibly came into being during the battle of Minden. In style, it is a ceremonial 'Reiter-Marsch', or cavalry march, and probably adapted to accompany the horse-drawn guns of the Artillery, from a German regional folk song. The Marquess of Granby's March This is the original slow march of the Royal Artillery, and appeared in print, published by Thompson & Son, London, in 'The Compleat Tutor for the Fife', circa 1760. The Marquess of Granby (the Earl of Rutland) was Master- General of the Regiment (1763‚Äì1772), and was preceded by General Ligonier (1759‚Äì1763) after whom, a now forgotten slow march 'General Ligonier's March' was named. The appointment 'Master-General' is nowadays known as 'Master Gunner, St. James's Park' (not to be confused with 'Master Gunner', which is a Warrant Officer special skills appointment). The Royal Artillery Slow March The Royal Artillery Slow March was written by Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Kent, and mother of Queen Victoria (herself \\"a most competent musician\\"), circa 1836. It is also the regimental walk march of the Royal Horse Artillery and at least one other regiment. Regimental Trot 'The Keel Row' The Royal Horse Artillery (and cavalry regiments) adopted this Tyneside air in 1903 on its publication by the War Office. This march is one example of the Regiment's intention to cater for all of its troops, drawn, as they were, from all regions of the United Kingdom. By comparison, almost all other regiments have traditionally recruited locally (e.g. the Devon & Dorset Regiment, the Durham Light Infantry, etc.). Regimental Canter 'Bonnie Dundee' The melody of 'Bonnie Dundee' dates back to the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. By 1600 the melody was certainly known all over Scotland and England. It appears in 'The Beggar's Opera' and was used by Robert Burns. It is also associated with a poem by Sir Walter Scott, which commemorates the Viscount of Dundee's bravery in the 1689 rebellion. It is believed that the title of this melody refers to the Viscount of Dundee, rather than to the jute-, and marmalade-producing City of the same name. Fanfare 'The Royal Regiment' The composer Frederic Curzon (b. 1899 London - d. 1973 Bournemouth) was at one time, a Gunner officer. Curzon wrote this fanfare for the opening of the Royal Artillery Association Rally in 1952. Its masterful use of both the RA's and RHA's 'Trumpet Call' typify the composer's penchant for incorporating melodies that he associated with his personal experiences in life. Of his many lasting compositions, perhaps the most perennial are the suites \\"Robin Hood\\", \\"In Malaga\\", \\"Dance Of An Ostracized Imp\\", \\"Galavant\\", and \\"The Boulevardier\\", all of which continue to be performed, and recorded by orchestras worldwide. Other notable composers who wrote specially for the Royal Artillery Band include Zavertal, Dvorak, C P E Bach, and Sir Arthur Bliss, Master of the Queen's Music. The military band medium has also attracted such eminent composers as Beethoven, Korngold, Meyerbeer, Fucik, Ganne, L√©h√†r, H√§ndel, Holst, Vaughan Williams, Morton Gould, Schickele, Walford Davies, Russell Bennett, Ives, and Malcolm Arnold, to name a few. The 'Eton Boating Song' The 'Eton Boating Song' is not connected to the famous British public school of the same name. It was composed in 1863 by one Captain Algernon Drummond, and transcribed by T. L. Mitchell, and the piano accompaniment was arranged by Evelyn Wodehouse. The words of Kipling's 'Screw Guns' from his 'Barrack Room Ballads' are well-known to RA officers and soldiers. Screw guns were so-named, because the barrels could be broken down into pieces, to be carried on mules in mountainous regions. They were last used during the Second World War, by RA Mountain Regiments in the campaign in Italy. The piece was arranged for orchestra, with a transcribed edition for military band, by Karl Kaps, as an 'English' (='slow', with 3 definite beats to the bar) waltz, and published by B. Feldman & Co. London.  Selected discography  Despite the relative paucity of commercial albums released by the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, many of their tracks were frequently broadcast over the radio throughout the 1970s, and original pieces from the Band's library were often heard in special arrangements by the leading light orchestras of the day, such as Paul Fenhoulet & His Orchestra ('Serenade For A Gondolier'), and Frank Chacksfield & His Orchestra ('Souvenir de Montmatre') on such shows as 'Friday Night Is Music Night', and on LPs. The prolific novelty compositions by former Director of Music Terry Kenny (including under numerous pseudonyms) continue to be recorded by military bands, and wind bands worldwide, and now closely rival the number of recordings of marches by British composer Kenneth J. Alford. The Band was the first British band to issue proper 'Big Dance Band' numbers in its recordings, since the Royal Air Force Band's 'Squadronaires' during, and immediately after the Second World War. \\"OUT OF THE BOX\\" The Royal Artillery Mounted Band Captain T.

A severe outbreak which is most notable for its tornadoes is called a tornado outbreak. The four kinds of severe weather produced in these outbreaks are tornadoes, severe wind, large hail, and flash flooding. Types Tornado outbreak A Tornado outbreak is the occurrence of multiple tornadoes in a region over a relatively short span of time. Usually, a tornado outbreak is the result of multiple supercells. Derecho or other squall line A squall line (commonly abbreviated SQLN) is a line of thunderstorms, most or all of which have attained severe limits, traveling in an organized fashion. The greatest threats within a SQLN are damaging winds, large hail, and flash flooding, though tornadoes are possible. A derecho is a squall line which is long-lived and consistently produces damaging winds across its entire track. Derechos almost exclusively cause flash flooding and wind damage, which can be very severe. Mesoscale convective system A mesoscale convective system is a mesoscale organized system which may produce severe weather along a relatively narrow area or path. The greatest threats in an mesoscale convective system are damaging winds, large hail, and flash flooding, though tornadoes are occasionally possible. Mesoscale convective vortex A mesoscale convective vortex is a tropical cyclone-like, warm core, a feature which may develop in a squall line, derecho, or MCS. Severe MCVs can become what are essentially small tropical storms or hurricanes, and can in fact become such cyclones, as in the case of Hurricane Barry in July 2019. An MCV will often trail a squall line on its south side. The greatest threats in an MCV are (in the center of circulation and south of the center) extreme winds and (north of the center) flash flooding, in addition to tropical cyclone formation.

Career   Educational Career  Dr. Suger started off as a researcher for IBM Research center. Then he went on to become a professor of Physics and Mathematics at Minerva and Freudenberg institutes. Later Dr. Suger found himself as a researcher once again, but this time as part of the Molecular Physics Group. At the same time he worked as an academic assistant for graduate students in Classical Mechanics attending the University of Austin. A trip to Guatemala brought him to the University of San Carlos, where he taught as a professor of Physics and Mathematics as before. This time working with Medical sciences, Chemistry and Pharmacy, Economics and Engineering faculty and teaching at a professor at both Del Valle, Mariano Galvez, and Francisco Marroquin. He went on to found the Galileo University of Guatemala, which he is currently serving as rector for.  Political Career  Eduardo Suger ran for president as the Commitment, Renovation and Order candidate. During his first run for President in 2003 he got 2.23% of the votes. In 2007 he got 7.45% of the votes, and in 2011 he took third place with 16.4% of the vote. He has gained popularity over time. Dr. Suger was inspired to run by his determination to better the education system in Guatemala.  Personal Life and Family  Dr. Suger was born into the family of Mrs. Estela Cofi√±o and Mr. Emilio Suger November 29, 1938. Dr. Suger was born in Zurich, Switzerland, but thought of himself as Guatemalan because his mother took him back to Guatemala while he was still a baby. His father entered WWII in the Switzerland military service, and there was no contact between his father and his mother. This prompted her to return to Guatemala in 1949 and remarry. He had four brothers from this new marriage and although they did still have a relationship, they did not interact like a normal family. Dr. Suger lived with his grandmother until she died when he was twelve. Dr. Suger was a great violin player. Starting young, he got praise and love for his talents, which he used to replace the lack of affection from his mother and other family. Dr. Suger used math to attract people as well. During high starting tutoring students, then buying textbooks and teaching from them, and by the time of graduation he was being paid to teach full classes to his fellow students. Using the money from teaching, help from Father Francisco Franco of La Asuncion Church, and help from the Swiss Consulate, he traveled back to Zurich to study at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and to meet his father. He was inspired by his role model Albert Einstein, who also studied at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Dr. Suger and his Father were reunited at a Swiss airport. In 1955 Dr. Suger took the admission exam after taking German language courses. He was accepted and on April 28th, 1958 he started teaching geometry and physics. Dr. Suger met Regina Castillo Rodriguez on a vacation in 1960. Four years of writing and visiting led to them marrying January 11th, 1964 in Guatemala. Right after the University of San Carlos offered him work, and he decided to stay in Guatemala. They had five children and now have nine grandchildren.

Overtone is best known for their vocal renditions of pop music and diverse repertoire. In 2009 they were discovered by Dina Eastwood, wife of actor/director Clint Eastwood while in South Africa shooting his film Invictus. Shortly thereafter they were asked to do the majority of the movie sound track. Overtone has featured as the opening act on the west leg of Corinne Bailey Rae's The Sea Tour and rock band OneRepublic. In December 2010 the casino and resort tycoon Steve Wynn hired Overtone as the feature band for a three-month run at his Wynn and Encore luxury casino and resort in Las Vegas. Overtone resided and performed out of Carmel and Los Angeles whilst being managed by Dina Eastwood. History The founding members of Overtone were University of Johannesburg alumni Eduard Janse van Rensburg and Emile Welman. The two were roommates in their fraternity and sang in the fraternity's local serenade group. After graduating, they decided to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. The other members were known to them by previous music ties and were asked to join the group. They performed at private functions, corporate events, and various music festivals including Aardklop, Innibos and the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees. In 2009 while doing a Queen tribute show in Cape Town, Dina Eastwood, wife of actor-director Clint Eastwood, by chance walked into the show. Clint Eastwood was in South Africa filming his movie Invictus, which is based on the 1995 Rugby World Cup. She was so impressed that she booked a private performance for the cast and crew of the film. A few days thereafter they were contacted and asked to record a demo song for the soundtrack of the film. Eastwood asked Overtone to do additional songs which led them to do the majority of the soundtrack. Dina Eastwood kept contact with the group and shortly before the release of Invictus brought them to the United States to help promote the film. During one of the scheduled promotional appearances on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Dina Eastwood ran into rock band OneRepublic, whom she knew from a previous philanthropic project, and introduced them to her band. After singing a few songs in their green room, OneRepublic invited Overtone to open for them at their show later that evening at The Troubadour in West Hollywood and at a tree lighting ceremony the following day at the Americana mall. Overtone has featured as the opening act on the west leg of Corinne Bailey Rae's The Sea Tour, performing in Vancouver, Portland, Seattle and San Francisco. In December 2010, the casino and resort tycoon Steve Wynn hired Overtone as the feature band for a three-month run in his Wynn and Encore luxury casino and resort in Las Vegas. After Invictus, Overtone moved to California, where they were managed by Dina Eastwood. The band have broken up in 2014 and members are pursuing their own individual careers. Invictus A turning point for Overtone came with their involvement in the film Invictus. Clint Eastwood asked them to record a demo of the song \\"Shosholoza\\", a popular traditional Ndebele song which has been considered the second national anthem of South Africa. After liking the first song, additional songs were requested including \\"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\\" (the South African national anthem), \\"Ol√© ol√© ol√© ‚Äì We are the Champions\\", \\"Hamba Nati\\", \\"World in Union\\", \\"Colorblind\\", \\"The Crossing (Osiyeza)\\" and the theme song to the film, \\"9000 Days\\". Overtone joined the promotional team in the United States where they appeared together with Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman on talk shows including The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Lopez Tonight. Overtone was invited to the film premi√®re which was held in Los Angeles on 3 December 2009, and also did a performance for the guests at the after party. Overtone and Natalie Stack of Natalie's Wish Foundation. Philanthropy Overtone has been connected to various charitable organisations both on home soil and abroad.

Early career After his father's death at age 13, he had to look for a job. Ramachandra worked as a clerk at the Minerva Mills where Ramachandra's father had also worked. In spite of taking up a job quite remote from mathematics, Ramachandra studied number theory all by himself in his free time; especially the works of Ramanujan. Ramachandra completed his graduation and post graduation from Central College, Bangalore. Later, he worked as a lecturer in BMS College of Engineering. Ramachandra also served a very short stint of only six days as a teacher in the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Ramachandra went to the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Bombay, for his graduate studies in 1958. He obtained his PhD from University of Mumbai in 1965; his doctorate was guided by K. G. Ramanathan.http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=98044 Later career Between the years 1965 and 1995 he worked at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and after retirement joined the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bangalore where he worked till 2011, the year he died. During the course of his lifetime, he published over 200 articles, of which over 170 have been catalogued by Mathematical Reviews. His work was primarily in the area of prime number theory, working on the Riemann zeta function and allied functions. Apart from prime number theory, he made substantial contributions to the theory of transcendental number theory, in which he is known for his proof of the six exponentials theorem, achieved independently of Serge Lang. He also contributed to many other areas of number theory. In 1978 he founded the Hardy‚ÄìRamanujan journal, and published it on behalf of the Hardy‚ÄìRamanujan society until his death.

Named for former Vancouver mayor and businessman John P. Kiggins, it opened in 1936. It is located at 1011 Main Street in downtown Vancouver. Architecture The Kiggins Theatre was designed in the Art Deco style by architect Day Walter Hilborn. The walls were constructed using formed concrete, with decorative motifs on the exterior and interior. The \\"Kiggins\\" neon sign is original, as are some of the interior light fixtures. The original marquee was replaced in the late 1950s. An elaborate mural originally painted inside the building no longer exists. History Construction of the Kiggins Theatre began on September 20, 1935. The theater opened on April 24, 1936, with a showing of the film She Married Her Boss, starring Claudette Colbert and Melvyn Douglas. The Kiggins operated continuously as a movie theater from 1936 to 1955. In 1958, the interior and exterior of the theater were renovated; the current marquee was installed at that time. The Kiggins reopened as part of the Adamson Theaters chain, which ran the theater for the next two decades. In 1980, the theater was acquired by a local church, and stopped showing commercial movies in favor of Christian films. The theater sustained moderate smoke and water damage after an electrical fire in 1981 and remained closed for nearly two years. After repairs and some renovation, the Kiggins reopened in 1983 and began showing second run double features through 1996. The theater was renovated again in early 1997, when some architectural features were restored, and more modern projection and sound equipment were installed. The theater reopened under new management in May 1997, and operated until May 2010, when it closed once again because of financial difficulties. The Kiggins was renovated and reopened under new management in September 2011. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

He played and taught natural horn only, but was also very interested in the first experiments with keyed horns. He successfully ensured the development of a distinctively French school of playing, marginally influenced by the invention of the valve horn.Humphries, John, The Early Horn: A Practical Guide (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 18, .

As a prize, he was awarded with an experimental horn model made by Lucien Joseph Raoux's studio, now one of the most impressive pieces in the museum of the Paris Conservatory. From 1806 to 1808, he was the principal hornist in the orchestra of the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux, and from 1808 to 1811, he worked for the Paris Opera Orchestra and the Paris Conservatory. He succeeded his teacher as professor in the Conservatory and held that position until 1833 when he was succeeded by the famous solo horn player (and his own former student) Jacques-Fran√ßois Gallay. Dauprat wrote the textbook M√©thode pour cor alto et cor basse (Paris, 1824), which is of much historical and methodological interest, and wrote five concertos for horn and orchestra and various compositions for chamber ensembles.

June 1905) (Vienna Museum) The Chamber Symphony No. 1 in E major, Op. 9 (also known by its title in German Kammersymphonie, f√ºr 15 soloinstrumente, or simply as Kammersymphonie) is a composition by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg. Schoenberg's first chamber symphony was finished in 1906 and premiered on February 8, 1907 in Vienna by the Ros√© Quartet together with a wind ensemble from the Vienna Philharmonic, under the composer's baton. In 1913, Schoenberg again conducted the piece, as part of the famed Skandalkonzert, in which the heterodox tonalities of Schoenberg's Symphony and, more so, of his student Alban Berg's works incited the attendees to riot in protest and prematurely end the concert. The first British performance was on 6 MayP. A.

Structure  The Chamber Symphony is a single-movement work which lasts approximately 20 minutes. Even though it is listed as one movement, the form can be considered as subdivided into as many as five continuous movements. Schoenberg himself outlined the following form using the rehearsal numbers as reference points: Schoenberg makes use of a \\"motto\\" theme constructed of fourths.Walter Frisch, The Early Works of Arnold Schoenberg, 1893‚Äì1908 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1993): p. 223. The \\"motto\\" theme helps delineate the structural articulation points in the piece. : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key e \\\\major \\\\set Staff.instrumentName = #\\"Hrn\\" \\\\partial 4*1 d\\\\ff \\\\bar \\"||\\" g c \\\\clef treble f bes8. ees16 ees4 } The \\"motto\\" theme first appears in measure 5 and is framed by two cadence which introduce the two main key areas. Cadence 1 in F major: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key e \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 \\\\tempo \\"Langsam\\" << { aes1\\\\fp~ aes4 aes'2.~ aes4 aes,2.~ aes4 2\\\\fermata } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { r2 bes,,\\\\f ees1( e! f2.) } >> \\\\bar \\"||\\" } ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\key e \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 << { r2 c2\\\\f s2 bes'~ bes1~ bes4 a2 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { s1 f1 s1 s2. } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { \\\\stemDown s1 r2 _( 1 2.) } >> \\\\bar \\"||\\" } >> } Cadence 2 in E major: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key e \\\\major umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\tempo \\"Sehr rasch\\" \\\\partial 4*1 << { dis!8.( cis!16 c2~ c8) b( dis!8. cis!16) c4.( b8 a gis fis dis! 4) } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { 4\\\\ff 2\\\\fp\\\\> 4\\\\\\\\! **|4\\\\fp\\\\> \\\\\\\\! r2 s4 } >> \\\\bar \\"\\" } ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\key e \\\\major umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 cis!8[ r16 f] a8 r \\\\times2/3 { a,->\\\\ff d,-> d'-> } gis!2-> \\\\times 2/3 { a8-> d,-> d'-> } gis2-> \\\\times 2/3 { a,,8-> d,-> d'-> } gis!4 \\\\bar \\"\\" } >> } Schoenberg's concept of developing variation can be observed in the relationship of the Scherzo theme to the rising chromatic line in the 2nd Violin part in Cadence 1, : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/4 \\\\key ees \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"sehr rasch\\" \\\\set Staff.instrumentName = #\\"Ob\\" aes2.->\\\\fff a-> \\\\bar \\"||\\" umericTimeSignature \\\\time 2/2 bes-> aes8 g bes4 aes8 g bes4 } as well as in the relationship of the slow movement theme to Cadence 2.Walter Frisch, The Early Works of Arnold Schoenberg, 1893‚Äì1908 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1993): p. 225-6. : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"sehr langsam\\" \\\\set Staff.instrumentName = #\\"1Vln\\" \\\\partial 4*1 g!8.( fis16 f4 a8. f16 ees4) }  Composition  Schoenberg claimed in later years that the work \\"was a first attempt to create a chamber orchestra.\\"  Instrumentation  It is scored for the following instruments: > 1 Flute/Piccolo, 1 Oboe, 1 English Horn, 1 E Clarinet, 1 Clarinet, 1 Bass > Clarinet, 1 Bassoon, 1 Contrabassoon, 2 Horns, and Strings (1 Violin I, 1 > Violin II, 1 Viola, 1 Cello, 1 Double Bass) Schoenberg respected the classical arrangement of the musicians on stage, instructing that all strings should be seated in the front row, the winds in the second row, and all the bass sounds should be grouped together. Although this composition is commonly called a chamber work, its performance requires a conductor. Some critics have claimed that an ensemble formed of ten winds and only five strings is inherently unbalanced; however, some of the voices are doubled so that no instrument is playing one-on-one against another. Nevertheless the piece requires highly trained musicians.  Arrangements   The composer himself arranged this piece for piano four hands in 1906. He also revised the composition for large orchestra in 1923 and again in 1935, which was catalogued as Op. 9b. The latter was premiered in Los Angeles by Schoenberg himself. * Fellow composer Alban Berg also arranged the composition for two pianos in 1914. * Between 1922 and 1923, Schoenberg's disciple Anton Webern made two different arrangements for this composition: the first arrangement was scored for violin, flute, clarinet, cello, and piano; the second was scored for piano, two violins, viola, and cello. The first arrangement was intended to be played alongside Pierrot Lunaire, which is similarly scored.  Notable recordings  Chamber Symphony No. 1 is one of the most recorded of Schoenberg's works and has received attention from conductors including Pierre Boulez, Simon Rattle, Riccardo Chailly, Claudio Abbado, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Zubin Mehta, and chamber groups such as the Hyperion Ensemble, Hagen Quartett and Orpheus. A 1998 performance conducted by Robert Craft on the Koch International Classics label and reissued in 2007 on Naxos received a positive critical response.

Eligibility The medal was established by the Canadian Government in September 1885 after consultation between the Governor General of Canada and the British Secretary of State for the Colonies. It was awarded to those who took part in the suppression of the North-West Rebellion of 1885 and who served west of Port Arthur, Ontario. Recipients included a number of volunteers, including the crew of the steamer \\"Northcote\\" for service at the Battle of Batoche, and members of the Prince Albert Volunteers for service at the Battle of Duck Lake. Initially, members of the NWMP were not eligible. However, a Canadian Order in Council of 13 December 1886 recommended that the NWMP receive the medal, this being accepted by the British Government on 16 February 1887. A total of 920 medals were then awarded to the NWMP. No British Army units took part, although seventeen British Army officers were attached to Canadian units. All those who received the medal, except for members of the NWMP, also received a grant of 320 acres of land, or scrip of $80 in lieu. During the 1930s, surviving NWMP recipients were each granted $300. Appearance The medal is a circular, silver and in diameter. The obverse, designed by L. C.

The reverse, designed by Thomas Brock, has the inscription \\"NORTH WEST 1885 CANADA\\" in three lines surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves. The medal is suspended from a ribbon in slate grey wide, with crimson stripes, from each edge.

Loeak's domain lies in the Ralik Chain and is shared with the iroijlaplap of Kwajalein, currently Imata Kabua. After a controversial court case utilizing the westernized American court system, Loeak rose to legitimacy after defeating his relative Melon Loeak who stood in line according to the natural line of patrilineal succession and existing records. In the most controversial sense of this case, Iroijlaplap Kabua Kabua testified on Anjua's behalf stating that Marshallese customs only allowed blue blooded royals being the blood son of the male chief to inherit the Iroijlaplap title despite there being an existing precedent with the Loeak's exercising such authority despite not being direct patrilineal descendants. The court case transcripts, particularly the summary judgment of this case, reveal that it was Kabua Kabua's testimony that won the case on behalf of Iroijlaplap Anjua Loeak who was the son ofiroojlaplap Albert Loeak. In the most surprising defeat, Melon Loeak, who was deemed the rightful heir by Iroijlaplap Lejolan Kabua, lost his legitimacy due to the prevailing reasoning of the American Trust Territory court system built on the most convincing arguments that neglected mentioning of sensitive issues prevalent in Marshallese customs. The court transcript revealed that blood was the main criteria despite there being existing evidence from the landowners (Alaps) of Kabinmeto where Albert Loeak grew up revealing that this was literally the pot calling the kettle black as Albert Loeak himself was not the biological son of Iroijlaplap Lobokij Loeak. This showcased a clear degree of racism even in Marshallese society as the reigns of money have taken over the conscience of the Marshallese people particularly in Kwajlein and in Majuro despite the Marshallese Constitution under the Equal Protection Clause, specifically Section 12.2 stating otherwise. This is especially true considering the Compact of Free Association between the United States and Marshall Islands as its preamble was built on the foundation of Human Rights. However, Loeak has been a staunch supporter of community-based organizations, such as the Women United Together of the Marshall Islands. In May 2011, Loeak and Kabua signed, along with president and fellow chief Jurelang Zedkaia, an agreement amending the terms to the United States' lease on the Reagan Test Site on Ebeye. The agreement, termed the Kwajalein Land Use Agreement, extended the lease until 2086 and raised the annual cost by US$3.7 million to US$15 million. The annual payments are divided among some 90 landowners; being one of the largest landowners in the country, Loeak receives 11.3% of this.

Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for improperly administering the anesthetic drug that led to Jackson's death and later served two years of a four-year prison sentence. Early life Murray was raised by his maternal grandparents, who were farmers in Grenada until he joined his mother, Milta, in Trinidad and Tobago when he was seven years old. He grew up poor in Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and Tobago. He did not meet his father, Rawle Andrew, also a physician until he was 25. Andrew, who died in 2001, was devoted to providing medical services to the poor. Murray finished high school and worked as a volunteer elementary school teacher in Trinidad for a while. After teaching, he worked to save up for college tuition as a customs clerk and insurance underwriter. Education In 1973, Murray moved to Houston, Texas, where his father worked, to attend Texas Southern University, and graduated magna cum laude with a degree in pre-med and biological sciences. Murray continued his education at Meharry Medical College, in Nashville, Tennessee, the same school his father attended, and the first school in the South for African Americans. He began his internal medicine residency at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Murray completed it at the Loma Linda University Medical Center in California. He then completed a cardiology fellowship at the University of Arizona. Career Murray worked at the Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego as an associate director of its cardiology fellowship training program. In 1990, he opened a private practice in Las Vegas. In 2006, he founded the Acres Homes Heart and Vascular Institute in Houston. Murray met Michael Jackson in 2006, in Las Vegas, and treated his daughter Paris when she fell ill. Jackson hired Murray to be his exclusive personal physician prior to his tour in July 2009. Jackson insisted that Murray be employed by his show promoter, AEG Live, for $150,000 monthly. However, AEG later claimed that there was never a contract with Murray. Murray and AEG agree that Murray was never paid. In 2018, Murray released a memoir, This Is It!, which detailed his experience as Michael Jackson's physician. The book was poorly received by critics. Personal life At the time that he began working for Jackson in May 2009 , Murray had reportedly fathered seven children by six different women. He was in arrears on the mortgage for the Las Vegas home occupied by his first wife and children and owed child support to the mothers of children outside of his marriage, which he could not pay due to the amount of money he owed to Michael Jackson's family. He was married to Blanche, his second wife, whom he met at medical school, and helped pay rent for another woman, Nicole Alvarez. Murray met Alvarez at a gentlemen's club in Las Vegas when she worked as a stripper, and Alvarez gave birth to their son Che Giovanni Murray in March 2009. Another relationship, with a cocktail waitress from Houston, was also reported. Murray was at risk of losing his California medical license due to unpaid child support to one of his children and owed $13,000 to a California woman, Nenita Malibiran. Murray was a defendant in numerous civil lawsuits (though none for medical malpractice). By 2008, he had accumulated over $600,000 in court judgments against him for medical equipment and unpaid rent for his practices in Texas and Nevada. He also owed $71,000 for student loans at Meharry Medical College. Murray filed for bankruptcy in 2002, in California. Murray expected to go back to jail in September. Michael Jackson's death On June 25, 2009, only weeks after hiring Murray, Michael Jackson died due to a lethal dose of propofol administered by Murray. Court documents released in August 2009 revealed that the coroner's preliminary conclusion indicated that Jackson overdosed on propofol. However, the coroner's office declined to comment on reports claiming that the death was ruled a homicide. Retrieved Feb 3, 2019 Several offices of doctors who were believed to have treated Jackson were searched. Based on the autopsy and toxicology findings, the cause of Jackson's death was determined to be acute propofol intoxication with a contributory benzodiazepine effect and the manner of death to be a homicide, eventually, so that the focus of the investigation shifted toward Murray. He admitted administering 25 mg of propofol intravenously, for insomnia, on the night of Jackson's death. He claimed that he tried treating him with other drugs and that he only administered the propofol after Jackson insisted, according to a police affidavit. Murray said he worried that Jackson had become dependent on the drug as a sleep aid, and was trying to wean him from it. Propofol is usually given in a hospital or a clinical setting with close monitoring, mostly used for general anesthesia during surgery, is not indicated or approved as a sleep aid and is administered only by anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists or anesthesia assistants who have extensive training in the use and monitoring of anesthetics. Murray had no such training at all. In February 2011, Murray was formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. On September 27, 2011, Murray went on trial in Los Angeles and was convicted of involuntary manslaughter on November 7, 2011. His bail was revoked and he was remanded to custody pending his November 29 sentencing date. He received the maximum penalty of four years in prison. His Texas medical license was revoked, and his California and Nevada licenses were suspended.Duke, Alan (November 30, 2011) Conrad Murray sentenced to four years behind bars, CNN, Retrieved June 24, 2016.

Both Balasubramanian and Ramachandra are respected mathematicians and accomplished a great deal in the field of mathematics. They both also focused their mathematical careers on number theory.

Before Ramachandra's death, the two would publish a new journal almost every year on Ramanujan's birthday, December 22. However, after that time a decision was made to continue the journal by a new team of editors. These editors consisted of people who shared the same passion as Ramachandra and Balasubramanian and contributed to the journal in the past. The goal of the journal remains the same. The last few volumes of the journal have provided new information on a wide array of topics, with an additional focus on one of the founders of the Hardy-Ramanujan journal, Ramachandra, who died in 2011. Most notably, an autobiography of Ramachandra is included in Volume 36. There are also obituaries from students and colleagues in Volumes 34 and 35, which are entitled \\"K.

Racing career  As a three-year- old, Dapper Dan finished second in three of his first four stakes races that spring. In March, he placed second in the Gotham Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack. He then ran fourth in the Wood Memorial Stakes. On the first Saturday of May in the 1965 Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, Dapper Dan faded to near the back of the pack early and closed to finish second to Lucky Debonair. He ran the last quarter mile in track record time of 23 1/5 seconds. That record stood until Secretariat's :23 flat in 1973. In the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the Preakness Stakes. Dapper Dan went off as fifth choice at 7:1 in a strong field of ten three year-old colts. He broke from post eight and settled in seventh place going into the clubhouse turn at Pimlico Race Course. Dapper Dan continued to make up ground after three furlongs and moved up to fourth at the top of the stretch. The leader, Tom Rolfe, veered into Dapper Dan's path after heavy right-handed whips by jockey Ron Turcotte. At about the sixteenth pole, the leaders brushed slightly. Tom Rolfe then held off Dapper Dan by a decreasing neck. Dapper Dan's jockey, Ismael Valenzuela, lodged an objection against Turcotte and Tom Rolfe for intimidation. However, the stewards upheld the finish with Tom Rolfe in first, Dapper Dan in second, and Hail to All in third, four lengths back. Three weeks later, Dapper Dan finished fourth to Hail To All in the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park in New York.  Four-year-old season  As a four-year-old, Dapper Dan finished third to Davis 2nd in April 1966 in the Carter Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack.

The advantages would be simpler guns and a wider range of tactical and logistic options. Better accuracy and tactical flexibility would theoretically come from standard shells with varying propellant loads, and logistic simplification by eliminating varying powder loads. In general, BLP guns have proven to be unsafe to operate, and they have never entered service. Gun fuels Several propellants were tried in various programs: One of the later (1991) successful gun fuels was a saturated solution of ammonium perchlorate in ammonia. This has a vapor pressure of one atmosphere at 20C, and generally forms a convenient liquid that is stable and possible to handle. The mixture is notable for its low burning temperature per impetus, with resulting lowered damage to expensive gun tubes and liners, or alternatively, increased firing rates. A typical impetus is 388,000 ft-lb/lb. The ammonia vapors are toxic, but the toxicity is readily apparent to ordinary people and can be handled with normal industrial precautions.U.S. Patent 5,060,551; 1991, Thomas L. Boggs; Jack L. Prentice; Donald F. Zurn; Claims; Patent assigned to U.S. Navy. In the 1950s through 1970s, a mixture of 63% hydrazine, 32% hydrazine nitrate and 5% water was used in experimental 37mm gun firings and later in 120mm gun firings. The 32% hydrazine nitrate mixture was selected by extensive experiments to have a notably flat pressure profile, increasing gun safety.Knapton, John; Stobie, Irvin Elmore, Les; ARl-TR-81 A review of the Bulk-Loaded Liquid Propellant Gun Program for Possible Relevance to the Electrothermal Chemical Propulsion Program, Army Research Laboratory, March 1993; Accessed 2011-7-23. Section 4.1 on the Detroit Controls Experiments, and 4.3 which both describe the hydrazine mixture as having a \\"notably flat pressure profile.\\" Otto Fuel II, a mixture of the low explosive propylene glycol dinitrate with a stabilizer, has also been tried in 37mm guns. In 1981, the Naval Weapons Center tried a 350 round/minute cyclic bipropellant gun, using 90% nitric acid and a proprietary hydrocarbon (probably a low molecular weight alkane, like propane). High or low breech pressures could be obtained by varying the surface to volume ratio of the injector. Varying the oxidizer ratio could change performance. Ullage, the injection pressure, affected the reliability of the gun, but not its safety or operation.U.S. Patent 5,060,551; Background. Another tested gun fuel is NOS-365. This is a mixture of hydroxylammonium nitrate, isopropyl ammonium nitrate and water. BLP gun ignition issues In general, hydrodynamic effects make the ignition process unpredictable. Bubbles can form in uncontrolled ways, causing varying surface areas and therefore varying pressure profiles. The result can be widely varying pressures in the breech and tube that cause unexpected gun stresses and safety problems. Most programs have reported failures, some spectacular, with each failure generally ending the program that had it. Variations of igniter venting, ignition energy and chamber configuration can make the ignition more reliable, and the pressure profile more predictable. However, as of the 1993 survey by Knapton et al., no designed, hydrodynamic models of BLP guns had actually been validated.Knapton, et al.;1993;Section 7 Tactically, there can be widely varying accuracies in range, exactly the opposite of one hoped-for tactical advantage. The best systems report 1 to 1.5% single standard deviation (i.e. large) variations in the throw. Over 40km ranges, this is a 150m irreducible error. The failure of the last firing of the Army Research Lab 120mm BLP gun, with the hydrazine mixture, was attributed to incomplete ignition. The post-firing review found that a failure of the foil in the ignition charge vented ignition gases via the igniter, as well as into the propellant. The poorly ignited charge moved the projectile partially down the tube, increasing the surface area of the propellant. The increased surface area of the propellant then ignited in the tube, raising pressures in parts of the gun not designed for them. The large overpressure caused \\"catastrophic tube failure\\" (an explosion destroying the gun tube).Knapton, et al.;1993;Section 5.1 In 1977, the Naval Weapons Center tested the 25mm bipropellant nitric-acid/hydrocarbon gun. At one point, \\"too fine\\" a mixture caused a catastrophic failure. In 1981, under a DARPA contract, Pulse Power Systems Inc. performed substantial development of a high-performance automatic 75mm BLP gun using NOS-365. Round 205 had an apparent high order detonation of the propellant, which was thought impossible. Metallurgic examination of the tube fragments determined that cumulative damage may have occurred from overpressures of earlier rounds. Examination of the pressure profile of Round 206, which had another catastrophic failure, showed anomalously low pressures followed by a pressure spike, which appeared to be the burning of a bubbly froth of monopropellant that transited to a detonation as the pressure increased. This was attributed to poor procedures to handle and pressurize the fuel.Knapton, et al.;1993;Section 5.3 References Further reading * Category:Artillery ","title":"Bulk loaded liquid propellants"},{"id":"32513673","text":"Kosti Manubi is a South Sudanese politician.

Companies H and I of the Eleventh Arkansas were combined with Company C while the remaining companies remained the same. The companies of the Seventeenth Arkansas were combined into 3 companies, H, I, and K of the new consolidated regiment. Almost immediately the Confederate War Department ordered the unit mounted, with plans for it to serve as a mounted infantry rather than as Cavalry. The \\"footsore\\" troops gladly accepted their mounts and spent long hours drilling in this new branch of service.  Battles  The men of the 11th/17th Infantry would spend the remainder of the war in Louisiana and Mississippi. The men still carried long muskets but were not issued sabers and when in battle still operated on foot but only traveled from place to place on horseback. This decreased travel time by a large margin. Although the two regiments were from different parts of the State (the 11th Arkansas was mostly from Saline County and a few other southern counties), with different battle histories, the merger clicked. The first duties of the 11th/17th Infantry was to travel to Southeast Louisiana to slow Union advance while preparations were made upstream to meet the enemy.Howerton, Bryan, \\"17th Arkansas Regiment, No. 1\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 10 February 2007, 1:37 pm, Accessed 2 August 2011, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=14724 The 11th & 17th Arkansas spent the rest of the war as the Confederate Army's 'fire brigade' in southern Mississippi.

These substructures are made of limestone blocks and rubble with column bases. Walls had stone foundations with adobe blocks. Columns along the structural bases supported thatched roofs. The columns are the most distinguishing part of the architecture of the site. The columns are made of stacked uneven cut stones arranged in a column in order to fill the column with rubble. The columns were about 3 m in height and were associated with both elite residences and temples. To access the adobe structures at the top of the platforms, stone stairways were used. Structures became more private and standardized. Household structures and their physical closeness to temples suggest the start of conjoined civic religious complexes seen later at Monte Alban. Elite housing was identifiable with more stone carvings and proximity to temples and plazas. Monte Negro temples vary in size and designs internally, but each is set on top of stone platforms with column supports and stairways. They have certain similarities to structures at Monte Alban. Example of a Deformed Skull Excavated tombs suggest the presence of elite members of society. Some of these elite members were buried in temple platforms with numerous ceramic offerings, spondyllus shell and jade ear ornaments. Skull deformations are seen in certain burials, which is a sign of elite membership. Some tombs were made of adobe blocks with stone or wood beams for roofing; other burials were simple pits. Agriculture Maize Example of Terraces Monte Negro used a terracing system called lama-bordo. This farming technology is similar to cross-channel terraces as a labor- intensive system that supported a strong centralized authority. The terrace walls are made of stone and rebuilt over time. The process of rebuilding left redeposit soil several meters deep good for crops. The terrace systems go along down the mountainside and down into the valley floor 500 m down. The main crop being grown on these terraces was predominately maize. The height of the terraces restricted growing season due to frost. Ceramics Cucharas or spoons Monte Negro has ceramics similar, based on clay composition, to Monte Alban. Recent radiocarbon dates suggest that Monte Negro could have predated Monte Alban. Tanware including jars, cucharas (spoons), comales (tortilla griddles), and bowls were found with red, and black-on-red paintings. Grayware also decorated with red and black paintings were found and are most likely imported from Oaxaca. Post-classic ceramics were also found throughout the terraces. These ceramics included ‚Äúcreamware‚Äù bowls and jars. The creamware has a distinct yellow to yellow-orange color.

He also served as a member of the Los Angeles, California, City Council from 1931 to 1939. Biography Hyde James M. Hyde was born June 25, 1873, in Mystic Bridge, Connecticut, the son of Rev. William Penn Hyde and Seraphine Smith Carr. His mother was a Mayflower descendant. When he was age eight, his father moved the Hyde family of eight children to Santa Cruz, California, and, later, to Palo Alto, California. As the youngest son, not expected to enter the ministry, James studied mining engineering and geology at Stanford University. He was active in the school's geology club, engineers' club, and was an assistant instructor in assaying before graduating in 1901. In 1903, he married Bessie Lorraine Ransom, born in California 1872. They had one daughter, Helen Elizabeth, born in California in 1908.Los Angeles Public Library reference file After Hyde resigned from Stanford in 1927, he moved to Los Angeles.\\"Stanford Professor Resigns,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 12, 1927, page 4 He died July 18, 1943, in his home at 1300-3/4 North Sycamore Avenue in Hollywood.Location of the Hyde residence on Mapping L.A. Early career After graduation, Hyde went to work for the California State Mining Bureau as curator of its museum and as field engineer. This was followed with three years, 1903 -1906, as professor and head of the University of Oregon, Eugene's mining department where he helped found the new department. Offered a job in industry, he left the university in the fall of 1906, and spent the next three years during a mining boom that went bust with the Panic of 1907: he was metallurgist for a silver mill in Guanajuato, Mexico, 1906-1907; then an assayer for the Charles Butters & Company's cyanide plant at Virginia City, Nevada, 1907; then, 1907-1908, superintendent of a small stamp mill and attached cyanide plant at the short-lived gold rush town of Manhattan, Nevada; and then managed a gold prospect in the California Mother Lode country. He returned to education in 1909 as director of the San Diego public school system's new agriculture and horticulture program. During this time, Hyde's reformer's zeal also manifested itself. At San Diego, he was a proponent of the City Beautiful movement; in Oregon he was president of the Good Roads Association in the state; and in Palo Alto he and brother William cheered on the Good Government League. An ongoing battle was with the California State Mining Bureau, which he resigned after making \\"charges of the most sensational character\\" against state Mineralogist Lewis E. Aubury over what was termed \\"Mismanagement, . . . public advertisement of private interests and a desire for personal aggrandizement.\\"\\"Scores State Mineralogist,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, November 15, 1902, page 5 He also claimed the bureau was under the control of \\"the Octopus,\\" the Southern Pacific Railroad and its minions. Aubrey countered that Hyde spent \\"too much time theorizing, with the result that nothing was getting accomplished in the museum\\" and was \\"a savant with his head swelled out of all proportion.\\" When Hyde asked for a two-week vacation, Aubrey said, \\"I gave [him] a vacation and a long one at that.\\" The state's board that governed the bureau met to discuss Hyde's claims and decided by unanimous vote, \\"That the matter . . . be ignored entirely.\\" \\"Will Not Hold Investigation,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, November 18, 1902, page 8 Hyde's reformer's zeal would arise throughout his life, often to his discredit. By 1910, according to Hyde, he was considering relocating to Mexico to aid in the government's planned education reforms, when the Mexican Revolution intervened. He instead took a job in London, which would bring him fame and notoriety. Flotation process In 1989 Hyde was posthumously inducted into the National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum in Leadville, Colorado, as a result of his installation of the first froth flotation process in the United States.National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum The museum states: > Without this process, there would be no mining industry as we know it today: > virtually the entire world of copper, lead, zinc and silver is first > collected in the froth of the flotation process. . . . Froth flotation has > permitted the mining of low-grade and complex ores that otherwise would have > been unprofitable, and thanks to James Hyde, many old \\"worthless\\" tailings > dumps have been converted into profitable mines. In January 1910, his Stanford classmate Theodore J. Hoover offered Hyde a job with the Minerals Separation, Limited, of which he was manager in the London Office. The firm had perfected an early froth flotation process in their labs and in the field, and introduced it with great financial success at the massive zinc-lead deposits of Broken Hill, Australia. Hyde accepted, moved to London, and was immersed in studying the revolutionary new process for working low grade ores. In what was a defining moment in his career, he left the company after a year to lead in the technology's transfer to America. He was following in the time honored tradition of technologists, who learned of new technology in England, and then stole all the information they could in order to introduce the technology to the United States, often over the cry of fraud and dishonor by the British owners of patents and the royalties they produced. (For an early example, see the life of Samuel Slater, builder of the first textile mill in America). Early in 1911, Hyde left Minerals Separation, Ltd, to introduce the flotation process at a zinc mine in Butte, Montana, being considered for purchase by mining specialist Herbert Hoover, later the President of the United States, with the help of his brother Theodore J. Hoover, who had also left the London company. Although Hoover backed out of the purchase, Hyde was hired by the owners of the Butte and Superior Copper Company and built a successful, small test plant in 1911. In 1912, he designed and the company built the Butte & Superior works, Butte, Montana, the first great froth flotation mill in the United States. Some would claim that Hyde demonstrated great intuition and genius in his \\"Hyde process.\\" The Minerals Separations, Ltd., company disagreed and declared an infringement of its flotation process patent and began a lawsuit that took five years and ended in the U. S. Supreme Court. Litigation Hyde had designed > a unit with two sections, one of rougher cells and the other of cleaner > cells. The rougher concentrate was cleaned in the cleaner cells and the > cleaner tailings were returned to the rougher cells. This was the first time > the \\"rougher-cleaner circuit\\" was employed and the procedure has never been > disputed. He was awarded a patent on the process in 1911. Unfortunately for Hyde, at issue in the court's eyes was not how a box was shaped or a cell was devised but about the \\"process\\" of introducing air and limited amounts of oil to make the metals in the finely ground ore \\"float.\\" Hyde lost his case in 1913, but a court of appeals decided in his favor in 1914, only to have the Supreme Court hold, in December 1916, that he had infringed on the Minerals Separation patent.242 Us 261 Minerals Separation v. James M Hyde, reported at OpenJurist.com In general, the American press and mining industry favored a decision for Hyde over the British patent holders. Mining engineer Daniel C. Jackling, who had purchased the Butte & Superior, funded Hyde's lawsuits while contesting the Minerals Separation company patents at the Jackling group of mines in Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, which introduced their own modified Hyde flotation process‚Äîand were sued by Minerals Separation as well. Thomas Arthur Rickard, editor of the Mining & Scientific Press, San Francisco, made Hyde's suit, and the others that followed against Minerals Separation, into a cause celeb, where the firm was described as evil incarnate. Hyde received professional accolades, probably the greatest being during the many talks on flotation, recognizing his primacy, presented at the American Institute of Mining Engineer's conference in Arizona, September 1916. But in the end the Minerals Separation, Ltd would prevail in its many suits until its patent expired in 1923, \\"and in so doing earned for itself the cordial detestation of many in the mining world.\\" Consultancy During the period between his 1914 court victory and the Supreme Court's negative decision, Hyde's consultant business flourished with work primarily undertaken by him in the silver-lead-zinc mines of Colorado, with a test lab in Denver and in southern Colorado. In 1916-1917, his biggest personal financial failure was on the lease of the Genesee- Vanderbilt group of mines above Silverton, Colorado, and the construction of a flotation mill that failed because of complex ores. (The Butte & Superior ores had been simpler in their composition, fortunate for Hyde's first, 1911-1912, success). Over the next decade, other metallurgists and chemists would solve the problems with new differential flotation, addition of xanthates and other reagents, and additional steps to a continually evolving process that would take more technical skill while exceeding everyone's expectations of utility. By 1917, Hyde had relocated back to Palo Alto and was hired as a consulting metallurgist for the U. S. Bureau of Mines experiment station at Stanford. In 1919, Stanford hired Hyde and his old friend Theodore J. Hoover as faculty in the mining department. Over the next seven years he would teach metallurgy, work in his metallurgical lab, and do a limited consulting business with the Hoover brothers. More and more, his interests leaned to reform and political activities. In 1927, he resigned from Stanford to, officially, return to his consultant work in Mexico and Southern California, but, unofficially, to become more active in Republican politics. As before, some of his mining ventures were suspect, including an attempt in 1935 to reopen the Good Hope Mine in Riverside County.\\"Paving Lobbyists Cash Patrons of Hyde's ?Gold Mine,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 16, 1935, page 1 A state inquiry was held in 1935 on the financing of this mine.\\"Hyde Mine Quiz Opens,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 30, 1935, page A-1 But by then, his name had secured its place in the mining history books. Politics Federal By March 1920, Hyde was active in Republican politics, working as an engineer for Herbert Hoover, who was being mentioned as a candidate for president. Concerning Hoover's campaign intentions, Hyde was \\"believed by political observers to speak with more authority than any other San Franciscan.\\"\\"Delegation for Hoover to Have Expenses Paid,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, March 9, 1920, page 3 In 1925 Hyde became a candidate himself‚Äîfor the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate,\\"Candidate for Senate Speaks at Club Lunch,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 24, 1925, page A-3 but Republican Senator Samuel M.

Synopsis Chip and Dale's curiosity leads them into Donald's house after they see him chop down their home to use as a Christmas tree. They follow Donald and their tree and they see nuts and candy through a window and decide to try to take them. They slip in through the mail slot and load the nuts into a toy truck. But Donald sees them stealing the nuts and uses the toys to foil them. When Chip and Dale catch on, Donald next dresses as Santa Claus and gives Chip a much larger present than Dale making him jealous and start fighting with Chip. The plan initially works and Donald traps them with a handgun and then crashes them in a toy paddy wagon. Donald then loads a pop gun with nuts and the chipmunks retaliate. At last, the confrontation escalates into full-out combat. Donald sets up a fort of presents on one side of the living room while Chip and Dale bombard him from across the room with a toy cannon. Dale covertly sneaks a Candlestick telephone into Donald's fort which Chip uses to transmit direct cannon fire. After the chipmunks have neutralized Donald's means to resist, they march back to their tree, and in a scene reminiscent of The Spirit of '76, employ the help of the mechanical toys to transport the hoard of nuts.

In 1794, the complex of the memorial only had a temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, which was built by Mahadji Shinde himself. He died the same year and his last rites were performed in the premises. In 1965, a samadhi (memorial) was constructed outside the sanctum of the Shiva temple, in memory of Mahadji Shinde, exactly where he was cremated. Madhavrao Shinde was responsible for the building of the complex, along with the memorial of Mahadji Shinde. The Scindia of Gwalior are the descendants of Daulat Rao Sindhia, adopted son of Mahadji Shinde. It is maintained by Shinde Devasthan Trust, Gwalior.http://www.virtualpune.com/html/localguide/attractions/html/shinde_chatri.shtml Architecturing at Shinde Chattri The major attraction of the Shinde Chhatri of Pune is its exquisite architecture, reflecting the style used in Rajasthan, India. The Anglo-Rajasthani style of construction exhibits a fine blending of two different cultures. The architectural grandeur of the building is appreciable with beautiful carvings and the building is the lively specimen of a structure constructed following the Vaastu Hara rules. The memorial retains its architectural design and beauty till date. The fine carvings and idols of saints on the steeple of the Shiva temple are made of yellow stone and the base and the sanctum sanctorum are constructed in black stone. The Chhatri (hall) not only has carvings and painting, but also houses a gallery in it. Coloured window-panes used for the windows are of English style. The hall is beautifully adorned with paintings and photographs of members of Shinde family. Renovations Renovated Window Detail at Shinde Chattri Unfortunately, this memorial was overlooked for several years and was in a bad condition. The structure had gathered moss on the hall, due to the seepage of rain water. Rain and moisture had damaged the upper storey of the building, constructed in yellow stone, which had acquired a grayish look. The roof was also damaged, allowing the rain water to seep into the hall, damaging the carvings. The beautiful structure is now getting restored to its original looks. The moss from the delicate and porous yellow stones was cleaned using pressure machines. The building's supporting terrace is completely restored now. A water repellent roof was reconstructed to ensure that water does not seep inside, in future. The first phase of the restoration is over. In second phase, it has been planned to replace the old English styled window panes, with newer ones. Second phase will resume after the monsoon season. Future Plans There is also a tentative plan by the Shinde Devasthan Trust to come up with a small museum in the gallery of the hall at Shinde Chatri, after the restoration work is completed. Etiquette Chhatri means umbrella in Marathi. As a sign of respect to the great warrior, visitors are required to close their umbrellas inside the premises, even if it is raining..........

Professional career  Joseph Ukel was born in January 1939 in Achot, a village close to the town bau in Bahr el Ghazal, when the Southern part of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was still isolated from the North due to the Closed District Ordinance. Ukel went to the catholic Elementary School between 1950 and 1954 in Mbili, southeast of Wau. When Sudan gained independence from the Condominium colonial rule in 1956, Ukel was attending the government Intermediate School in the Equatorian town of Maridi, where he graduated in 1958. Staying in Maridi, he qualified as a teacher after completing a training course at the government-run Institute of Education between 1959 and 1962. The same year he started his first teaching-post in the Equatorian town of Kapoeta. When the Anyanya rebellion escalated in Equatoria, Ukel moved to Northern Sudan, where he first worked as a schoolteacher in the Gezira area and then continued his studies at the University of Khartoum. He received a BA in English in 1972 from there. When the Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972 ended the Anyanya rebellion and granted Southern Sudan autonomy, Ukel moved back to Bahr el Ghazal, where he taught English at Rumbek Secondary School. In 1975 he took up further studies at the University of Edinburgh, receiving a postgraduate diploma in teaching English as a foreign language a year later. From 1976 to 1977 he returned to his home area to teach at Mbili Girls Secondary School, holding the posts of deputy headmaster and headmaster, respectively.  Political career  In 1978 Ukel joined politics by contesting and winning his home constituency of Wau East in the elections to the Second People‚Äôs Regional Assembly in Juba. He was re-elected in 1980 as a political ally of the Southern Front leader Abel Alier and appointed regional Minister of Culture and Information as Alier assumed the President of the High Executive Council. When Alier lost this office in October 1981, Ukel became the secretary for the publicity committee of the ‚ÄúCouncil for the Unity of the Southern Sudan‚Äù (CUSS) which advocated against the redivision of the South. After the fall of Gaafar Nimeyri‚Äôs regime in April 1985, Ukel was a founding member of the ‚ÄúSouthern Sudan Political Association‚Äôs‚Äù (SSPA) political party and in 1986 became its Parliamentary group leader in the national Constituent Assembly of Omdurman. In 1988, the SSPA joined other Southern and Nuba parties in a coalition called the United Sudan African Parties (USAP) that took the lead in organising dialogues with the rebel Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation Movement (SPLM). Ukel became a minister of local government in the final coalition government of prime-minister Sadiq al Mahdi (25 April ‚Äì 30 June 1989). After the June 1989 coup, USAP was banned like all other parties and went underground. Ukel helped to form the domestic arm of the exiled National Democratic Alliance (NDA), an umbrella of parties and forces opposed to the ‚ÄúNational Salvation Revolution‚Äù rule of General Omar al-Bashir, and was appointed its secretary general in 1992, while still working as a teacher of English language. When USAP chairman Hilary Logali passed away in 1998, Ukel became his successor. During this period, he was repeatedly detained by al- Bashir‚Äôs government, the last time between December 2000 and October 2001 on charges of treason and sedition. Ukel and Alier participated and mediated in the peace talks between the SPLM and al-Bashir's government in Naivasha, Kenya, which led to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005. Under its power-sharing agreement, USAP was allocated ten seats in the National Assembly and Ukel was appointed Minister of Parliamentary Affairs in the Government of National Unity. In its campaign for the 2010 general elections, USAP defined as one of its main goals ‚Äúunity in diversity‚Äù as opposed to separation, which it emphasized by the choice of Khartoum as its headquarters. It failed to win any parliamentary seats, complaining about illicit actions against its campaigning. Nevertheless, Ukel was appointed the Minister for Higher Education in the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS). After the independence of South Sudan in July 2011, Ukel was appointed Minister of General Education and served in this office until President Salva Kiir dismissed the whole cabinet in August 2013. In the 2014 IGAD-led peace talks with the rebel SPLM- IO, Ukel was part of the government delegation, representing smaller opposition parties. In April 2017, Ukel as USAP chairman was one of nine candidates picked by the government to represent South Sudan at the East African Legislative Assembly. The same month, he was selected by Kiir as a member of the steering committee for the National Dialogue. However, he was not elected by the Transitional National Legislative Assembly in Juba in August 2017. In early 2018, a power struggle between Ukel and Elia Lomuro over control of the political parties alliance was reported. On 12 September 2018, the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) was signed in Addis, Ukel was one of the six signatories representing the Umbrella Coalition of Political Parties. However, when the National Dialogue Steering Committee held a regional conference in Wau at the end of February 2019, Ukel reportedly walked out after not been given the chance to address the gathering and resigned from the National Dialogue. In August of 2019, Ukel was reportedly arrested in Wau on allegations of supporting the rebel SPLM-IO and put under house arrest in Juba by the National Security Service (NSS). Two months later, in Mid-October, he was released from his confinements and arrived in Khartoum \\"to seek medical treatment\\".

As of March 2012 India only possesses two functional uranium mines, including this Jaduguda Mine.Daunting road ahead for nuclear power M. SOMASEKHAR The Hindu Business Line 2 November 2011 A new mine, Tummalapalle uranium mine is discovered and mining is going to start from it. Mining activities were suspended in 2014 following an inquiry into the lease renewal of the mine. Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) expects mining activity to resume at Jaduguda in 2017. The Jaduguda mine produces up to 25% of the raw materials needed to fuel India's nuclear reactors. Geography The Jaduguda uranium mine is an underground mining mine located in the Purbi Singhbhum district of Jharkhand. The mine is located at least 640 meters below the earth's surface and is accessible by a 5-meter diameter vertical shaft. Uranium purification plant A uranium purification plant is usually located closely to the mine as uranium ore is converted here to yellow cake. According to Department of Atomic Energy, the ore extracted from this mine is of 0,065 grade, which means that the plant needs to process 1000 kg of ore to extract 65 grams of usable uranium.The $14m haze over India‚Äôs mega uranium discovery Arpit Parashar - Tehelka.com The plant processes 2190 tonnes uranium ore per day.Mill to process natural uranium ore commissioned T.S.

According to media reports the uranium was smuggled out of the Jaduguda mines and the smugglers were trying to sell it to Nepal. The market value of the seized uranium was estimated at on the international market.India police seize 8 lbs of uranium from smugglers Reuters 19 February 2008.Delhi's non-compliance The News, 4 October 2008  Pollution  When uranium ore is extracted from the ground, 99.28% of the mined ore is treated as waste as the uranium isotopes used in nuclear power plants mainly is uranium-235 leaving behind the major portion of the ore which constitutes of uranium-236 and uranium-238 as well as some other components. This waste (also referred to as tailings) is then neutralised with lime and carried through pipelines to a tailing pond. This transport is made possible through the provision of clean water (in the pipelines) out of decantation wells which is then taken through a closed channel to an effluent treatment plant for the removal of radium and manganese. The solid tailings are then retained in the ponds (tailing ponds). There were reports coming from the locals around the tailing ponds : In a report in CSE-Down to Earth Feature Service, entitled \\"A deformed existence\\" and dated 4 June 1999, Manish Tiwari quoted Biruli as saying, \\"Many women in the area complain of disrupted menstrual cycles. This area also has a high rate of either miscarriages or still-born babies... Biruli claims that nearly 30,000 people living in 15 villages in the five-km radius of the tailings ponds are exposed to radiation. 'Earlier, children were still-born. Now they die within few days of their birth,' he says . He also claims that nearly one- third of the women living in these areas are suffering from loss of fertility. Even animals such as cows and buffaloes are suffering from rare diseases. The BARC committee came to Jaduguda in November 1998 at the request of the State Government, due to these reports. The committee concluded: \\"The consensus of all the doctors was that the cases examined had congenital anomalies, diseases due to genetic abnormalities like thalassaemia major and retinitis pigmentosa, moderate to gross splenomegaly due to chronic malaria l infection (as this is hyperendemic area), malnutrition, post encephalitis, post head injury sequelae and certain habits (alcohol) and have no relation to radiation.\\" Its report adds: \\"The team was convinced and unanimously agreed that the diseases' pattern cannot be ascribed to radiation exposure in any of these cases.\\"  Controversies  The mine itself is still prone to some controversies as the introduction of the mine resulted in the loss of land for many villagers surrounding its location, as well as some issues regarding protective gear : \\"A population of around 35,000 people living within a 5-kilometer radius of the mines are adversely affected by radiation from the tailing ponds. Many villagers lost land and jobs when they were displaced by the mining operations, and many now work in the uranium mines as daily wage labourers. They often do not get proper protective gear to handle radioactive materials and work with bare hands, exposing themselves to heavy doses of radiation. UCIL, the company responsible for the health of its workers, on the other hand, always refutes any allegations of violations of labour laws and human rights. The company is outright defensive about its protective measures and refuses to acknowledge the problems faced by the labourers.\\"  References   External links  * Uranium Corporation of India‚Äì Official Website Category:Uranium mines in India Category:Mining in Jharkhand ","title":"Jaduguda uranium mine"},{"id":"32514523","text":"Bob and Mike Bryan were the defending champions and winners of six of the last ten tournaments, but chose not to compete in this year's competition.

In those books, he maintains an argument first brought forward by Johannes Heinrich August Ebrard, that Saint Boniface in his missionary work in Germany destroyed a viable church that had been founded by Irish/Scottish missionaries.

Based on the 16th-century Italian madrigal comedy genre, it consists of a prologue and 12 madrigals which tell a continuous story, interspersed with six musical interludes. The unicorn, gorgon, and manticore in the title are allegories for three stages in the life of the story's protagonist, a strange poet who keeps the mythical creatures as pets. The work premiered in Washington D.C. at the Library of Congress Coolidge Auditorium on October 19, 1956. Background and performance history A manticore in an illustration from the Rochester Bestiary The Unicorn, the Gorgon and the Manticore was commissioned in 1956 by the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation for the 12th Festival of Chamber Music in Washington, D.C. In constructing the libretto Menotti returned to an earlier script he had written after reading T. H. White's 1954 The Book of Beasts, a translation of a medieval Latin bestiary. The plot is a comic but ultimately melancholy attack on the \\"indifferent killers of the poet's dreams\\": slavish social conformity and the ease with which the \\"unfashionable\\" is discarded. More than one writer, including Menotti himself, has suggested that he strongly identified with the poet in his story.See for example, Teeters (1996); Ardoin (1985) pp. 111-112; Dyer (October 2, 1997); Time Magazine (November 5, 1956) The three creatures of the title are allegorical representations of stages in the poet's life, with The Unicorn representing the beauty and promise of youth, The Gorgon representing the success and haughtiness of middle age, and The Manticore representing the shy loneliness of old age. Despite its English language libretto, Menotti's work was modelled on the 16th-century Italian madrigal comedy or commedia harmonica, a precursor to the opera genre and typified by Orazio Vecchi's L'Amfiparnaso.Hixon (2000) p. 8 Unlike conventional operas, all the singing is choral with no solo voice roles. Although the dancers were intended to be an integral part of the work, Menotti resisted calling it a ballet and eventually settled on the description \\"madrigal fable\\".Teeters (1996) He composed it at virtually the last minute, sending madrigals to his choreographer as he finished them. The twelfth and last one was completed a week before the premiere with the first complete rehearsal held only four days before the opening night. The world premiere took place at the Library of Congress Coolidge Auditorium conducted by Paul Callaway (a last minute replacement for Thomas Schippers) and ran on October 19, 20 and 21, 1956 to both critical and popular success.Hixon (2000) p. 283. Its New York premiere was performed by the New York City Ballet on January 15, 1957, in a production conducted by Thomas Schippers and choreographed by John Butler who also choreographed the world premiere in Washington. The role of The Poet in the New York City production was danced by Nicholas Magallanes with the three mythical creatures in the story danced by Arthur Mitchell (The Unicorn), Eugene Tanner (The Gorgon), and Richard Thomas (The Manticore). It has been revived many times over the ensuing 40 years, both in its full ballet form and (more frequently) as a choral work. It received its Boston premiere in 1972 performed by the Boston Cecilia, who revived it again in 1996 with a performance at Sanders Theatre in preparation for their studio recording released the following year. Recent performances have included those in Reno, Nevada performed by Nevada Opera and the Sierra Nevada Ballet in 2007; Spoleto, Italy at the Festival dei Due Mondi also in 2007; and Washington, D.C. performed by the Cantate Chamber Singers and the Bowen McCauley Dance troupe in 2009.Banno (January 20, 2009) Menotti's centenary year, 2011, has seen performances in Seattle by The Esoterics vocal ensemble and in Ljubljana by the Slovenian National Theatre Opera and Ballet.The Esoterics: Gian Carlo Menotti centennial; Programme of The Ljubljana Festival 2011 (both accessed 25 July 2011) A unicorn pictured in a manuscript of De proprietatibus rerum by Bartholomeus Anglicus Structure and music The Unicorn, the Gorgon and the Manticore consists of a prologue and 12 madrigals which tell a continuous story. They are sung (most of them a cappella) by a 24-voice SATB chorus and are interspersed with six musical interludes. Lasting approximately 45 minutes, the work is orchestrated for a chamber ensemble consisting of winds (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, trumpet), lower strings (cello and double bass), harp, and percussion.Hixon (2000) p. 281 The music was described by the Time Magazine critic who attended the world premiere as \\"a singular and engaging combination of ancient contrapuntal harmonies and tart, modern, dramatic values.\\" The critic also singled out the melancholy beauty of the twelfth and last madrigal with the chorus singing \\"almost liturgically, as if each voice were a pipe in an organ.\\" Menotti said of the twelfth madrigal: \\"It is the most deeply and personally felt of anything I've written. It is something I would like for my own funeral.\\"Time Magazine (November 5, 1956) The madrigal was also sung in 1981 at the funeral of Samuel Barber, who had been Menotti's lover for many years.Heyman (1995) p. 496 Synopsis The prologue describes a strange man living in a castle above a seaside town who shuns the town's social life and the Contessa's parties and refuses to go to church on Sundays. The strange man is a poet who on three successive Sundays takes a different pet on a walk through the streets of the town. On the first Sunday, he parades his unicorn. The Contessa insists she must have a unicorn as well and persuades her husband to get one for her. The citizens of the town then buy unicorns as well. On the next Sunday, the poet is seen with a gorgon. The Contessa and townspeople assume he has killed his unicorn and promptly kill theirs to replace them with gorgons. On the third Sunday, he appears with a manticore. They once again follow suit by killing their gorgons and buying manticores. When the poet fails to appear on the fourth Sunday, the townspeople assume he has killed his manticore too. Scandalized, they march to his castle to attack him. When they arrive, they find the poet dying surrounded by his three pets, all of whom are alive. In the twelfth and final madrigal he berates the townspeople for slavishly following fashion. Unlike them, he had kept all his pets: \\"You, not I, are the indifferent killers of the poet's dreams. How could I destroy the pain wrought children of my fancy?\\" The poet then bids farewell to each of his creatures in turn and tells them \\"Not even death I fear as in your arms I die.\\"Menotti, Gian Carlo.

Havana. Cuba The Sal√≥n de Mayo (May Salon) was an art exhibition held in Havana, Cuba, in July 1967. It took its name from the Salon de Mai, an artists collective founded during the Nazi occupation of France. It was organized by Carlos Franqui with the assistance of such artists as Wifredo Lam, Ren√© Portocarrero, Alexander Calder, Joan Mir√≥, Pablo Picasso. The exhibition presented works by more than a hundred artists and represented rival schools of twentieth-century art: early modernists (Picasso, Miro, Magritte); the next generation (Lam, Calder, Jacques H√©rold, Stanley Hayter); and postwar (Asger Jorn, Antonio Saura, Jorge Soto). Lam wrote to Franqui in anticipation of the event of his hopes: Some artists were invited to create works in Cuba in the weeks preceding the exhibition, with those works donated to the Cuban government to form the nucleus of the collection of a contemporary art museum. The museum was never constructed. Collaborative engagement was a principle theme of the event. On 19 July 1967, more than eighty artists and writers contributed to a mural, Cuba colectiva, in front of the Cuba Pavilion in Havana, adding either images or text inside spiral bands that circled outward from a central image of \\"rhomboid heads\\" by Lam. A Paris newspaper described the event: In Franqui's words the enterprise represented: The Surrealists had dreamed of \\"a revolutionary imagination that could support social change\\" and this event, in the estimation of one art historian, \\"delivered the opportunity for Surrealist adherents to participate satisfactorily‚Äìif only briefly‚Äìin an act of solidarity with an actual revolutionary regime ... that accommodated both sensuality and revolutionary rectitude.\\" The radical poet Alain Jouffroy wrote: The Sal√≥n was a unique event under a regime that, in the words of a writer who was later imprisoned, \\"used every imaginable pretext to keep culture on a short leash\\". As a demonstration of vigorous self-expression, the Sal√≥n de Mayo has also been interpreted as a rejection of the Soviet Union's approach to artistic endeavor, an assertion on the part of Communist Cuba of its independence from the Soviet model. Within Cuba, the Sal√≥n de Mayo represented the high point of free artistic expression. Some in Cuba's cultural establishment resented the influence of foreigners and visiting intellectuals, and they took measures soon after it against writers identified as dissidents. The Cuban government released a series of commemorative stamps that depicted 25 of the works included in the show.

The bombing, which occurred during a concert at a night market, killed at least 10 people, including three children, and wounded 45 others The attack was the deadliest in Aceh since the start of hostilities between Indonesian troops and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) on 19 May 2003. The Indonesian military blamed GAM, but GAM denied responsibility for the bombing. The attack The bomb, thought to have been triggered by a timer mechanism, detonated around 9:00 PM at a night market in the eastern town of Peureulak. According to first responders, the device had been planted beneath a stage, where three local girls were performing. The New Year's Eve festival, attended by hundreds, was allegedly organised by the military. Of the victims, many were teenagers and children; the victims included a 1-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy who died at the scene, as well as a 4-year-old girl who died in the hospital. Other victims included the mother of two of the children, numerous teenagers, as well as a man later identified as member of GAM. The majority of casualties were treated in Langsa general hospital, which lacked enough surgeons to operate on injured victims; they requested more doctors be sent from the provincial capital Banda Aceh and the North Sumatran city of Medan to supplement them. Lt. Col. Ahmad Yani Basuki of the Indonesian military described the bomb as powerful and stated that no group but GAM could have staged such an attack, describing Peureulak as a \\"rebel stronghold\\". However, a spokesman for GAM denied responsibility, stating the separatist group had never staged an attack to kill Acehnese. Due to a victim being a member of GAM, local police investigated the possibility of a suicide attack; findings were inconclusive. At the time, the Free Aceh Movement separatists had no history of targeting civilians or public bombings.

Shelved Titles KIXEYE has developed multiple titles in its time that either made it to live and have since been shelved. This list includes the original tower defense game, Desktop Defender; a browser-based MOBA called TOME: Immortal Arena; and (most famously) the game Backyard Monsters, which inspired much of the base-building RTS genre that followed. Backyard Monsters Development of Backyard Monsters started in 2009, but the game was not released until January 2010 as Desktop Creatures before being renamed by fan vote to Backyard Monsters. Backyard Monsters was released as a real-time strategy game on Facebook with \\"destruction and gore and mayhem\\", unlike other Facebook games at the time. In Backyard Monsters, players build a yard for their monsters, designed so that essential buildings are protected by defensive towers. If the player's yard is designed correctly, the defenses stop invading monsters who try to damage the buildings and loot resources.Ashby, Alicia. Backyard Monsters Review GameZebo. May 7, 2010. Backyard Monsters: Unleashed was a port to iOS released in October 2013. Executive Producer David Scott said he designed the game to \\"be able to play a [real-time strategy] game in short sessions.\\"Gibbons, Pat. An Interview with Dave Scott, Backyard Monsters' Executive Producer . Gamers Daily News. March 18, 2012. An expansion for Backyard Monsters titled Inferno was released in January 2012 and in November 2012 a new world map was released. In addition to this, Backyard Monsters also had outposts in the new world map when the new world map update came. On February 18, 2013, the Kongregate version of Backyard Monsters was shut down. Backyard Monsters is no longer supported and player numbers have fallen significantly since its groundbreaking inception. Desktop Defender In Desktop Defender, players defended their desktop from creatures called \\"creeps.\\" Players deployed defensive turrets to attack anything in range. Each defeated creep rewarded players with coins, which players could use to unlock new towers that shot frost, ink, swarms of missiles and other defenses. Players could also purchase special bonus powers that slowed down enemies, sped up tower guns and caused damage. Desktop is no longer supported by KIXEYE, and, as of the end of August, 2016, no longer runs on Facebook. TOME: Immortal Arena TOME: Immortal Arena is a MOBA formerly developed by KIXEYE. Official development by KIXEYE ended February 5, 2015.  New Projects  As of 2020, KIXEYE has a number of projects in development, including opportunities with other Stillfront Group partners.

The three main methods of collecting human power are directly from the hands or feet, through the hands with oars, paddles, or poles, or through the feet with pedals and a crank or treadle. While most human-powered watercraft use buoyancy to maintain their position relative to the surface of the water, a few, such as human-powered hydrofoils and human-powered submarines, use hydrofoils, either alone or in addition to buoyancy.  Oared craft  Oars are held at one end, have a blade on the other end, and pivot in between in oarlocks. Oared craft include: * Racing shell A racing scull Using oars in pairs, with one hand on each oar, is two-oar sculling. The oars may also be called sculls. Two-oared sculled craft include: * Adirondack guideboat * Banks dory, Gloucester dory, and McKenzie River dory * Dinghy * Sampans rowed by foot in Ninh B√¨nh Province of northern Vietnam. * Scull, Single scull, Double scull, Quad scull, and Octuple scull * Skiff * Row boat Rowing a trainera Using oars individually, with both hands on a single oar, is sweep or sweep- oar rowing. In this case the rowers are usually paired so that there is an oar on each side of the boat. Sweep-oared craft include: * Coxless pair, Coxed pair, Coxless four, Coxed four, and Eight * Galley, Dromon, Trainera, and Trireme Sculling sampans Moving a single stern-mounted oar from side to side, while changing the angle of the blade so as to generate forward thrust on both strokes, is single-oar sculling.

Henry VIII of England made him Baron Eure by patent in 1544. The surname is often written as \\"Evers\\". William was Governor of Berwick upon Tweed in 1539, Commander in the North in 1542, Warden of the Eastern March, and High Sheriff of Durham. During the Anglo- Scottish war called the Rough Wooing, Eure and his sons Henry and Ralph made numerous raids against towns and farms in the Scottish Borders. Family William was the son of Ralph Eure and Muriel Hastings. He married Elizabeth Willoughby, a daughter of Christopher Willoughby, 10th Baron Willoughby de Eresby. Their children included Sir Ralph, Henry, who was Master of the Ordnance at Berwick, Margery, Muriel, and Anne. Sir Ralph Eure, who was also Warden of the Middle March, married Margery Bowes, daughter of Ralph Bowes of Streatlam Castle and was killed at the Battle of Ancrum Moor in 1545. Their son William Eure later inherited the title as 2nd Baron Eure.Lodge, Edmund, ed., Illustrations of British History, vol.1 (1791), pp.35-36 note, pp.267-268 note Ralph's daughter Frances married Robert Lambton of Lambton. Quiet on the border Ralph Eure defended Scarborough Castle against the Pilgrimage of Grace for 20 days in 1536 with a garrison comprising only his household servants. After the rebellion was crushed, Henry VIII assumed for himself the Wardenship of the Scottish Marches: William Eure was deputy Warden of the Eastern March. The Wardens were charged with keeping order on the border, dealing with encroachments from both sides and liaising with their opposite numbers. At first the border was quiet because James V of Scotland was in France seeking a bride. The situation did not deteriorate until at end of 1538, when James V was settled with Mary of Guise. In November 1538, James V came to Jedburgh and replaced his wardens of the East and Middle March. In December, Pope Paul III proclaimed his Bull of Excommunication against Henry VIII. William Eure and Thomas Wharton, deputy Warden of the West March had to complain to James V about the circulation of ballads against Henry which they said came from Scotland.Rae, Thomas I., The Administration of the Scottish Frontier, Edinburgh (1966), 173-177. Sir Christopher Morris, Master of the Ordnance, invested William as Keeper and Captain of the Castle and town of Berwick upon Tweed in January 1539, as the successor of Sir Thomas Clifford. Morris noted a great multitude of arms and munitions, all 'sore decayed'.State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5 part IV, cont., (1836) pp. 146-8, 150 Interlude at Linlithgow One of William's letters gives the earliest description of the play A Satire of the Three Estates by David Lindsay of the Mount. William spoke to Sir Thomas Bellenden, who described a performance at Linlithgow Palace before James, Mary of Guise and his bishops and council on the feast of the Epiphany. As the play turned on the Reformation of the church, William obtained a more detailed description from a Scottish contact for Thomas Cromwell. Eure enclosed in his letter of 26 January 1540 the synopsis of the performance compiled by his spy, which corresponds with the later text of Lindsay's play. Eure said he had talked with Bellenden, a member of the council of James V of Scotland about the possibility of a Reformation of the 'spirituality' in Scotland. The play at Linlithgow had shown the 'naughtiness' of the church. Bellenden said after the play the King spoke to the churchmen in the audience asking them to reform their factions and manner of living, otherwise he would send six of them into England to his uncle, Henry VIII.Pinkerton, John, The History Of Scotland From The Accession Of The House Of Stuart To That Of Mary, vol.2, (1791), pp.494-497 Survey of Northumberland, 1541 Beyond the regular duties of a border Warden, in 1541 William Eure was one of the commissioners appointed by Henry VIII to expel Scottish people from Northumberland following an Act of Parliament. In June he wrote to James V of Scotland complaining that his border subjects had begun to pasture sheep and sow grain in England.Hamilton Papers, vol.1 (1890), 80-81 In October they viewed the border along the river Tweed to the Ryden Burn's mouth and destroyed corn sown by Scots on English ground. The Scots drew away from the border thinking Eure's men were invaders. During this business, Eure held meetings at Alnwick and Etal. He hoped to induce men from Tynedale and Redesdale to avenge the murders of the Fenwick family by attacking the Scots in Liddesdale.Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol.16 (1898), nos. 1263, 1264. By 4 November, he had found that there were a great number of Scottish householders, occupied as herdsmen, labourers or artisans, mostly without land, and they were evicted. Those too who held land or mills were replaced by English tenants. Many of the empty housing was not adequate for new English settlers, even if two houses were joined together. Other Scots were servants or apprenticed to English craftsmen, these were allowed to stay. Nevertheless, the use of Scottish apprentices would be discouraged in future. William noted the valued service of a Scottish armourer called Troilus Taylor and a mountain guide, Gilbert Cocklands, who had been employed leading raids into Scotland. He requested that these useful people be made denizens of England and pointed out their repatriation would have an unhappy result. William's commission also included a survey of the border fortresses east to Harbottle Castle and the river Coquet. Many of the old Pele towers were in decay, and the owners lived in more convenient unfortified places (\\"that was a great pity to see\\"). He had commanded the owners to put the fortified houses in good order. He next planned to survey the strongholds of the Middle March. Generally, he found the border peaceable enough. Trouble came from the \\"traitorous Scottish thieves of Liddesdale\\" or Henry's \\"evil subjects of Tynedale and Redesdale\\" who seemed to combine together rather than respect the peace of Henry VIII or James V of Scotland. After showing an armed presence at Hexham, Willam planned to meet up with his colleagues at Newcastle upon Tyne on 17 November 1541 to finalise the survey. The historian Maureen Meikle finds that Eure had encouraged Scottish artisans to settle in the Middle March.Bain, Joseph, ed., Hamilton Papers, vol. 1 (1890), 120-3, 7 Nov. 1541: Meikle, Maureen M., A British Frontier?, Tuckwell (2004), 265 & n.71 additionally citing Mss. PRO SP59/20 fos. 196-7, WARD7/8/42. Rough Wooing Sir William and his sons Henry and Ralph were active during the war of the Rough Wooing and were stationed at Berwick upon Tweed. William Eure sent Lord Hertford news of rumours he had heard from Scotsmen that the Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, Regent Arran and Mary of Guise had held meeting at Stirling Castle and would reconcile their differences. If their factions were united the Scots would be able to resist English ambitions to force the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Prince Edward. The burning of Edinburgh Hertford organised a major assault by sea on Edinburgh for May 1544. William and Ralph Eure were to bring a diversionary force of March men to Haddington. Ralph asked Hertford for a re- inforcement of 1000 Yorkshire archers so that they could press forward from Haddington to be in sight of the landing place at Granton. In the event, it was agreed that Hertford would summon Eure when he had disembarked his troops in Edinburgh. (When Eure's men arrived in Edinburgh they would get their pay).HMC; Longleat, Seymour Papers vol.4 (1967), pp.64-5, Eure to Hertford, Alnwick Castle, 28 April 1544. Hertford landed on Sunday 4 May 1544, and sent for Eure. His letter reached Berwick on Monday at 2pm, and Eure's reply was received at Leith on Tuesday at 5pm.Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, vol.19 part 1 (1903), no. 464, 467. 4000 border horsemen arrived in Edinburgh on Wednesday 7 May.The Late Expedicion into Scotland, 1544, Reynold Wolf (1554) reprinted in Tudor Tracts (1903) p.43 & pp.48-51: Haynes (1740), see next ref. While the army was camped near Seton Palace, Lord Maxwell requested to speak to Ralph Eure but Hertford would not allow it. Instead, Maxwell was brought back to England.Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, vol.19 part 1 (1903), no.531. Assurances On 7 June 1544 a number of Scottish borderers gave their oath to be \\"full part takers\\" with England. Ralph Eure, as Warden of the Middle March, was given three \\"pledges\\" or hostages for the fulfillment of the oath by 24 members of the Oliver family and their kinsmen. These were Dandy Oliver, Rinyan (Ninian) Oliver and Patty Oliver who were kept at Warkworth Castle. On the same day Ralph took four Nixon hostages for the loyalty of 35 Nixons, and four Crosiers for 50 of their family, and 3 hostages for the Hall family.Hamilton Papers, vol.2 (1890) appendix pp.741-3. In October 1544, Ralph Eure gained the allegiance of Andrew Kerr of Ferniehurst and 40 followers of various names and the town of Jedburgh. Eure took 21 hostages, including a man for each family name. If the Scots failed to fulfill their contract of assurance the hostages could be executed.State Papers Henry VIII, vol.5 part IV cont., (1836), 399-400. Jedburgh On 9 June 1544, Sir William and his colleagues met at Milfield near Wooler and decided to march on Jedburgh. The final plan had been proposed by Lord Hertford on 27 May 1544 and endorsed by the English Privy Council and Henry VIII, after Hertford had discussed the pros and cons of a more modest attack in March with Ralph Eure. An assault on Jedburgh had also been proposed as part of the major raid in May.Haynes, Samuel, ed., A Collection of State Papers, vol. 1, London (1740) pp. 12‚Äì13, 22, 26‚Äì27, 31, 37, 39 Two days before the meeting at Milfield, Ralph Eure had written to Lord Hertford from Warkworth Castle, explaining that his father was ill (\\"somewhat crossed\\") and reassuring Hertford that he could lead his father's East March men. Ralph asked Hertford to send his trumpeter for the Jedburgh raid.Haynes, Samuel, ed., A Collection of State Papers, vol. 1, London (1740), p. 41 However, William seems to have led the raid. At Jedburgh, where he had heard there were seven cannon at the market-place, he divided his force into three. The Scottish defenders fled without engaging. Sir William burnt the Abbey, the Greyfriars and various bastle and fortified houses in the town. They captured 500 horses and seven cannon. On their way back to England, they burnt the Tower of Cailing Craig, Cessford Castle, Morebattle church, Otterburn, Cowboge and other places. Near to the English border, at Kirk Yetholm, they observed fires raised by a Scottish raiding party. Ralph Eure with Richard Bowes, Captain of Norham, and 500 men rode forward and captured or killed a number of Scots.The Late Expedicion into Scotland, 1544 Reynold Wolf (1544), epilogue; 'Other new and prosperous adventures of late against the Scots.' Coldingham Later in the month, Henry Eure and George Bowes captured Coldingham, where the Priory was defended by cannon, after a 5-hour battle. Subsequently, William Eure wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury that he had escorted the Italian military surveyor Archan (Archangelo Arcano) to Coldingham. The new Captain of Coldingham, George Bowes, said he could hold the place for 40 hours against the Scottish army if they brought two cannon. Ralph had reported to William that Regent Arran with other Scottish lords were gathering an invasion force at Dunbar. Ralph also sent this news to Shrewsbury. The Lords of the Privy Council had already found Ralph's intelligence gathering useful, and in January they had authorised Shrewsbury to cover the sums that Ralph laid out for \\"compassing sundry exploits and intelligence.\\" Arran's host did move towards Coldingham, but Arran halted this advance before Sir William's force could engage him.Lodge, Illustrations, vol. 1 (1791), p.48 no. XXII, p.67-68 no.XXX. Henry Eure, in July 1544, joined George Bowes and raided Edrom, Preston, Patrick Hume's Tower and Duns. On 3 July, William Eure organised the burning of the Castle of Greenlaw. Ralph burnt the Barmkin of Ormiston and the church tower at Eckford. Muirhouse and Ancrum Moor The Eure family continued these raids into November and again in 1545.Haynes, Samuel, ed., A Collection of State Papers vol. 1, London (1740), pp.43-50, 52-54 As a Scottish army mustered on the eastern border near Lauder, Ralph argued for an attack on Hawick. A raid to Melrose or Jedburgh led to Ralph Eure's death at the battle of Ancrum Moor in February 1545, his companions Basford and a Scotsman John Rutherford of Edgerston cut down beside him. Regent Arran was shown Ralph's body by a man called Vicar Ogle, and said; > God have mercy on him, for he was a fell cruel man and over cruel, which > many a man and fatherless bairn might rue; and, wellaway that ever such > slaughter and bloodshedding should be amongst Christian men. The defeat at Ancrum was blamed on Ralph's over-reliance on his wavering Scottish allies and his foolhardy courage. Robert Bowes was made Warden of the Middle March in his place.Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 20 part 1 (1905), nos. 253, 285, 301, 306, 355 To avenge Ralph, Henry Eure and George Bowes went to Bowmont in Teviotdale and demolished two towers and burnt farmsteads belonging to the Laird of Molle (Mow). In March 1548 Henry Eure reported his father's death to Lord Grey of Wilton. Henry's next duty was to make inquiries about a captured Lieutenant of Spanish mercenaries and an Italian who had escaped and fled to Scotland. Governance of Berwick The diplomat Ralph Sadler reported to Thomas Wriothesley in April 1545 that William was not suitable to be Captain of the town of Berwick. Eure and Sir Cuthbert Ratcliff, Captain of the castle of Berwick; were \\"men of honesty and meet to serve elsewhere,\\" but of no experience or knowledge for keeping a fortress.Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, vol.20 part 1, (1905), no.582. Eure had a long running dispute with Thomas Gower, the Marshall of Berwick (father of Sir Thomas Gower, 1st Baronet) Gower was summoned to attend the Privy Council in London and after failing to answer Eure's allegations, was sent to the Fleet Prison in June 1546.Dasent, John Roche, ed., Register of the Privy Council, 1542-1547, vol. 1 (1890), p.444. The council also arbitrated between Eure and Cuthbert Ratcliffe over the rights of Berwick Castle to tithes and fishing, Eure have previously been the Captain. In May 1547 he was placed in charge of stores at Lindisfarne and asked to assist the fortification of the place according to the designs of William Ridgeway and Richard Lee, without diminishing the garrison at Berwick.Dasent, John Roche, ed., Register of the Privy Council, 1547-1550, vol.2 (1890), pp.469-470, 499, 501-2. After William Eure's death, although Grey of Wilton wrote to Somerset on Henry Eure's behalf for his father's offices, the Wardenship of the East March and Governorship of Berwick were given to Grey of Wilton himself. However, Ralph's son, William Eure, 2nd Baron Eure was later made Warden of the Middle March and Governor of Berwick.Bain, Joseph, ed., Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.92 no.187, p.101 no.204, p.193 Another Ralph Eure, a brother of this William Eure, was killed in a duel fought with spears by William Kirkcaldy of Grange in 1557.Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland, vol. 8, HMSO, (1982), 66-67, no. 397:James Melville of Halhill, Memoirs, (1929), 225: Humfrey, Barwick, A breefe discourse, concerning the force and effect of all manuall weapons of fire, London (1592), p.21, describes how Kirkcaldy ran Euers or Ewrie through with a spear despite his armour: Holinshed, Chronicles: Scotland, vol.5 (1808), 585, Ralph Eure brother to Lord Eure.

Phya Anuman Rajadhon (; , also spelled Phaya Anuman Rajadhon or PhrayƒÅ Anuman Rajadhon; December 14, 1888 ‚Äì July 12, 1969), was one of modern Thailand's most remarkable scholars. He was a self-trained linguist, anthropologist and ethnographer who became an authority on the culture of Thailand. His name was Yong Sathiankoset (); Phraya Anuman Rajadhon was his noble title. He also took his family name, Sathiankoset, as a pen name by which he is well known. His prolific work and his interest in a multitude of culture-related fields, from folklore to sociology, set the foundations for a long-lasting cultural awareness among young Thai scholars.Mahidol University ‚Äì Literature Phraya Anuman Rajadhon was the first Thai scholar to conduct a serious study of Thai folkloristics, taking notes on the nocturnal village spirits of Thai folklore. He established that since such spirits were not represented in paintings or drawings, they were purely based on popular traditional oral stories. Thus most of the contemporary iconography of ghosts such as Nang Tani, Nang Ta-khian, Krasue, Krahang,Phi Krahang Phi Am, Phi Hua Kat, Phi Pop, Phi Phong, Phi Phraya, Phi Tai Hong and Mae Nak Phra KhanongSpirits has its origins in Thai films that have become classics.Movie poster showing Thai ghosts Krahang and Krasue with Count Dracula  Biography  Moved by an innate curiosity and having an eye for detail, Phya Anuman Rajadhon observed and took notes on Thai society at a crucial time when much of the traditional culture was being overwhelmed by modernity. As years went by he studied in depth the language,The Development of the Thai Language popular customs, oral tradition, social norms and the value system of the Thai people. He worked in different locations, including the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, during his youth and middle age. In the years when Phya Anuman Rajadhon worked as a clerk at the Thai Customs Department, he befriended a Mr. Norman Mackay, who helped him to polish his broken English. He had no academic titles and did all the training he needed for his research and compilation work on his own. Phya Anuman Rajadhon took a special interest in popular culture. Many of the ancient habits of Thais that he recorded and described would have died unnoticed if they had not been put down into writing by him. Often his descriptions were accompanied by illustrations.Phya Anuman Rajadhon, Essays on Thai Folklore, Editions Duang Kamol, As a writer he wrote novels under the pen name Sethyank≈çsƒìt, often spelled as Sathirakoses, (). He also wrote works on important Thai cultural figures, including a biography of Phra Saraprasoet '(Trƒ´ NƒÅkhaprathƒ´p)' (1889‚Äì1945), a likewise dedicated author and commentator in the field of Thai literature. He knew Phra Saraprasoet well, as they worked together as co-translators of many works.Phya Anuman Rajadhon, Chƒ´wit Phra SƒÅrapras≈ìt thƒ´ khƒÅphaƒçhao r≈´ƒçhak, KoÃúthoÃúmo.

The translation was admired for its beautiful Thai prose and was selected as one of the textbooks for the Thai secondary school curriculum. Recognition came to Phya Anuman Rajadhon only towards his later years, when he was invited to universities to give lectures and began travelling abroad. He was given the post of President of the Siam Society and ended up becoming one of Thailand's most respected intellectuals, both in the last years of his life and posthumously. The commemoration of the 100th year of his birth was staged in 1988 by UNESCO, where social activist Sulak Sivaraksa, founder of the Sathirakoses-Nagapradeepa Foundation, described Phya Anuman Rajadhon as a National Hero.

He attended New Mills Secondary School, but left at 16 to work in a garden nursery his father had started at Chapel-en-le-Frith. Nonetheless, he showed an early interest in physics. After a one-year course in horticulture, he went on to take a University of London external degree in the subject at the Midland Agricultural and Dairy College in Sutton Bonington, and briefly lectured there in 1935. In 1936 he married Mary Gretta Heath (1910‚Äì1989), a dairy chemist, daughter of William Nathaniel Heath, farmer. They had two sons, Colin and Richard. They lived in Plumpton, East Sussex for three years while Hudson worked as an East Sussex County Council horticultural adviser.Some obituaries give his place of birth as nearby Chapel en le Frith; The Independent obituary: Retrieved 24 July 2011. Bomb disposal Shortly before the Second World War, Hudson joined the Territorial Army. He immediately saw action in France and was evacuated from Dunkirk. He was then assigned to bomb disposal with the Royal Engineers, heading a group in Sheffield. There his scientific acumen stood him in good stead and he was summoned to work on new defusing methods in London, with the rank of major. Hudson's war career included several months in the United States liaising with bomb disposal experts there. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He was awarded a George Medal in 1943 for disabling the first anti-tamper Y bomb fuse on 24 January 1943, six days after an intact fuse had first been recovered. According to an obituarist: In 1944 he received a Bar to his George Medal for defusing the first V1 flying bomb or \\"doodlebug\\" to land intact. The nature of his war work remained unknown to friends until a Channel 4 television series on defusing was shown in 2001. Research career After the war, Hudson found work in the government agricultural department in Wellington, on the transportability of Actinidia deliciosa, then known as the Chinese gooseberry, now as the kiwifruit or kiwi. Seeds of the fruit had been introduced into New Zealand from China in the early 20th century. He was also involved in setting up a research station at Levin, New Zealand. In 1948 the Hudsons returned to England, where he became a lecturer in horticulture at Sutton Bonington, by then a faculty of the new University of Nottingham. After obtaining a PhD degree in 1954, he became the first occupant of the university's chair of horticulture in 1958 and then dean of the faculty of agriculture and horticulture in 1965. His research was in the field of plant propagation, notably environmental factors in plant growth. He showed almost military precision in his research and administrative work, which he shared in 1961‚Äì1963 with the department of horticulture at the University of Khartoum, where he was seconded for six months each year as a visiting professor. Hudson left Nottingham in 1967 to direct the Long Ashton Research Station, the job being coupled with a chair of horticultural science at the University of Bristol. There his administrative abilities were stretched further by government spending cuts and the need for full reorganisation. He was already editor (1965‚Äì1982) of the journal Experimental Agriculture and serving on other editorial boards. He was noted also for the precision and clarity of his teaching. Peter Waister, a former graduate student of Hudson's, stated at his funeral, \\"I was impressed by his ability to balance the three areas [of research, teaching and advisory work] and to be inspirational in them all, a rare achievement.\\" Hudson's honours included an associateship of honour of the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture in 1948, the presidency of the former Horticultural Educational Association, founder membership and an honorary fellowship of the UK Institute of Horticulture, appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to horticulture in 1975, and in 1976 the Victoria Medal of Honour from the Royal Horticultural Society.Son's website: Retrieved 24 July 2011.

Its purpose is to provide flood control and water for municipal use along with the irrigation of of land. Background Officials laying the dam's cornerstone Construction on the dam had originally begun in 1978. At that time, it was designed as a concrete gravity dam. Construction was halted soon after it began though. The dam was redesigned over the next few decades and after the new project was approved, preliminary construction for the dam began in late 2003. Principal construction began on March 24, 2009 and there was a groundbreaking ceremony on June 5, 2009. To divert the river, a cofferdam did not need to be constructed. The existing Kinmu Dam upstream was modified to divert the river on the left bank of the river. In May 2010, the river was diverted and by August of the same year, over of rock and stone had been excavated from the site. On February 26, 2011, a ceremony was held to bury the cornerstone of the dam prior to beginning the fill of the dam's body.

The cemented, sand and gravel (CSG) design is a mixture of a concrete gravity dam and an embankment dam. Essentially, it is a sand and gravel embankment coated in concrete. This design is cheaper because it uses less fill and concrete when compared to a gravity or embankment dam. Its wide base provides the required strength while the concrete coating seals the embankment and adds to its durability. The dam's crest lies at an elevation of and sits at the head of a catchment.
