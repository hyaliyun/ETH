The band was started in 1988 by the brothers D Thrilla and K9 the sonic Maximizer of the Queens Village neighborhood of New York City. Alcohol, marijuana and parties are major themes in the group's music. History The group was formed primarily to play a battle of the bands at the local Queens Village church Our Lady of Lourdes in 1988. Most songs were jokes and paid tribute to the legendary local bands Norman Bates and the Showerheads and Six and Violence. After a surprising turnout and mass appeal they decided to continue to play locally and record demo tapes and 7-inch records. At this point they acquired drummer Vinnie Value, second vocalist Mike Dixon and bassist Scott Cumbo to replace the members who left the original line-up. No Redeeming Social Value had a run on the local Queens Heavy Metal circuit in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Eventually, with the help of the Lower East Side band Warzone (band) and local punk DJ Johnny Stiff, they began to play many hardcore punk matinee shows in Manhattan. The band's first LP release Rocks the Party on SFT Records led to opportunities for national and international tours. No Redeeming Social Value currently plays shows sporadically throughout the year.

The battle was fought between Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway, and the Anglo-Norman earls Hugh of Montgomery and Hugh d'Avranches, and took place as part of Magnus Barefoot's expedition into the Irish Sea, which sought to assert Norwegian rule over the Kingdom of the Isles. Only a few days after the Normans had captured Anglesey from the Welsh, Magnus Barefoot appeared with some ships off the coast. Fighting soon began with arrows shot between the Norwegian ships and Norman forces on the shore, but as Hugh of Montgomery was hit with an arrow and killed, the Normans retreated back to England. The defeat of the Normans allowed for the return of the exiled Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd, who thereby regained control of his former lands. Background Following their invasion of England in 1066, and the subsequent conquest of large parts of Wales, the Normans proceeded towards North Wales in the late 11th century. While the Normans experienced a setback in 1094, the Norman earls Hugh of Montgomery and Hugh d'Avranches finally managed to conquer North Wales and Anglesey in 1098, forcing Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd, to flee to Ireland.Power (1986) p. 119. Early in 1098, the Norwegian king Magnus Barefoot went on an expedition with a large fleet into the Irish Sea, seeking to assert Norwegian rule over the Kingdom of the Isles. After he had subdued most of the Isles and set up his base on Mann, he went further south and appeared with six ships (according to the English chronicler Orderic Vitalis), off the coast of Anglesey, only a few days after the Norman capture. Battle According to Orderic Vitalis, Magnus entered the Menai Strait with a red shield on the mast, which was the usual sign to signal peace and trade.Munch (1874) NOTE 11, p. 58.- Ad Moiniam insulam, etc. While Magnus may have sought trade, or to get provisions for his ships, he may also have intended to take possession of the island as a base for further operations.Nicholas (2000) p. 12. When Magnus approached Anglesey in JuneAshley (1998) p. 452. or July,Hudson (2005) p. 192. the Normans did not permit him to land. The fighting started with the two sides shooting arrows at each other, the Norwegians while still on board their ships, and the Normans while standing on the shore. As the Normans prepared to attack the Norwegians, Hugh of Montgomery, who was fully armoured except for an opening for his eyes, was shot through one eye with an arrow and died instantly.Power (1986) p. 120. Contemporary non-Norse sources all agree that Magnus Barefoot himself was responsible for the shot, while the Norse sagas are somewhat less inclined to attribute the decisive shot to Magnus alone, noting that his shot hit Hugh almost simultaneously with that of another of his men. Since some sources indicates that Magnus regretted the deed when he realised who he had killed, Magnus may originally have been interested in alliances with the Normans.Power (2005) p. 14. The Normans retreated from Anglesey to England following the defeat.Maund (1991) p. 145. Aftermath Although the Welsh considered the Norwegians their liberators following the Norwegian victory against the Normans, Magnus regarded Anglesey as part of the Kingdom of the Isles and took the island as a Norwegian possession.Hudson (2005) pp. 192‚Äì193. Since the Norwegians never settled on the island, Anglesey reverted to Welsh control when Gruffudd ap Cynan returned from Ireland in 1099.Maund (1991) p. 169. The Norwegian control was at best nominal thereafter, but as Gruffudd awarded Magnus with great rewards and honour,F√∏rsund (2012) p. 69. and during Magnus' second expedition in 1102 allowed him to cut as much timber as he wanted, Magnus may possibly have reasserted the overlordship over Gruffudd formerly held by Godred Crovan, and thereby received the submission of Gwynedd.Oram (2011) p. 50.

It was founded in 1909 as International Agricultural Corporation. In 2004, IMC Global merged with Cargill, Inc.'s crop nutrition division to form The Mosaic Company, a crop nutrition company. History IMC Global was incorporated as International Agricultural Corporation on June 14, 1909 by Walderman Schmidten in the state of New York. A native German, Schmidten moved to secure entire capital in mines from his home country; he was successful in doing so with the Kaliwerke Sollstedt Gewerkschaft. Phosphate and potash production facilities were acquired in Tennessee and Florida. Capital stock of the International Agricultural Corporation was originally fixed at $15 million in July 1909, but increased to $36 million by April 1911. As World War I broke out, demand for fertilizer declined while that for sulfuric acid skyrocketed. International Agricultural Corporation was the largest owner and distributor of phosphate in the United States by the 1920s. International Agricultural Corporation changed its name to International Minerals and Chemical Corporation in late 1941, shortly before merging with United Potash and Chemical Corporation. Potash operations of IMC were greatly expanded due to the merger. Competition from other German mines disappeared in World War II, as all Germany imports were suspended during the war. This provided a record demand in potash for the years during and after the war. IMC later expanded production operations to other parts of the country, including California. For the next 30 years, IMC would continue its expansion by acquiring companies like E.J. Lavino and Company, Great Lakes Container Corporation, and Chemical Leaman Tank Lines. By 1975, IMC had procured operations in thirty-five states, Canada, and fifteen other countries. In 1986 International Minerals and Chemical Corporation acquired Mallinckrodt, a leading chemical company headquartered in St. Louis. In April 1990 the company name became Imcera, after a year-long marketing study, but only briefly. In 1994 the parent company took the Mallinckrodt name for itself, then subsequently spun off its original businesses to a new publicly traded company known as IMC. The remainder of this history relates to the new IMC, which had different shareholders and management from the former IMC but basically the same staff and businesses. =Further expansion= During the first quarter of 1996, IMC acquired Chicago-based fertilizer producer and distributor Vigoro Corp. for a $1.16 billion stock exchange. At this point, IMC Corporation was renamed to IMC Global and the potash operations became IMC Kalium. In 1997, a merger occurred between IMC and the previous parent company of Freeport-McMoRan, who retained their copper and gold mining ventures. The merger took place with an $800 million exchange in stock. Later in the year, it was announced IMC acquired Western Ag-Minerals Co., a subsidiary of Rayrock Yellowknife Resources, and its mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico for nearly $53 million. Before the acquisition was completed, the deal was vetted by the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, as the sale could allow IMC (now the owner of two mines in the area) to largely control the price of fertilizer. An independent study concluded that the deal would allow for the combination of resources in the region and substantially improve the efficiency of mining operations. Near the end of the year, IMC completed another acquisition, this time with Harris Chemical Group, Inc. for $450 million in cash and $950 million in assumed debt. The move further expanded its fertilizer and salt businesses. Merger with Cargill In January 2004, Cargill, Inc. announced a definitive agreement to merge its crop nutrition division with IMC. A naming competition was held for the new company and Mosaic was announced the winner in June. The Mosaic Company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 25, 2004 and became the newest Fortune 500-sized firm listed.

Each of the acetyl esters of oxymorphone has a hydromorphone analogue, and these were all developed around the same time (1915-1930) in Austria and Germany. As an ester of oxymorphone, it is presumably a Schedule II controlled substance as it and its relatives save acetylmorphone do not specifically appear in Schedule I. 3,14-Diacetyloxymorphone and its relatives including acetylmorphone do not, however, have annual production quotas published by the DEA in the Federal Register. Like all or most of the direct morphine derivatives, halogenated derivatives of these drugs and their hydromorphone and hydromorphinol analogues were synthesized in the 1930s when both the esters and the halogenated morphine derivatives were being developed, including one given as 1,2-iodo-3,6,14-triacetyl-6…ë-14Œ≤-hydroxydihydromorphinone in a footnote to a 1948 German medical journal article about the esters of morphine. It appears that this drug was used, labelled with Iodine 129, as a tracer in animal studies, was significantly stronger than morphine, and possibly has 1- and/or 2- fluoro, chloro, and bromo analogues. 3,6-Diacetyloxymorphone is a third acetylated oxymorphone derivative, the oxymorphone analogue of acetylmorphone and expected to be intermediate in strength betwixt the two aforementioned drugs. Another is 3-acetyloxymorphone. All of the above have been, owing to their somewhat sophisticated yet straightforward synthesis from pharmaceutical opioids, consistently if in vanishingly small quantities since at least the 1960s by law enforcement around the world as the results of clandestine synthesis, and acetylmorphone itself was banned by the League of Nations in 1930 to prevent its use as a legal heroin substitute. Therefore, all or most of this group and its hydromorphone analogues along with some others more closely related to heroin such as acetylpropionylmorphine were the first designer drugs in the 1920s.

He is known as a former member of the Washington State House of Representatives, elected in 1897 to represent the 3rd legislative district from Spokane, Washington. An attorney by trade, he served as Spokane's city attorney from 1905 to 1907, and again from 1916 to 1932. In 1933, he was appointed to the Washington State Supreme Court, by Governor Clarence D. Martin.  Personal background  James M. Geraghty was born on February 2, 1870, in County Mayo, Ireland. He is the son of Patrick and Bridget (n√©e Haley) Geraghty. In 1880, the family immigrated to the US, arriving in New York and establishing a farm in Indiana. He attended school in Rush County, Indiana. After relocating to Spokane in 1892, he initially worked as a teamster, before attending business school. In 1908, Geraghty married Nora Toolen. Together, they raised nine children in Spokane. They were members of the Catholic Church, known for supporting Catholic interests throughout the Pacific Northwest. In December 1939, Geraghty began experiencing symptoms from a recurring kidney disease and died on April 29, 1940, in Spokane.  Professional background  Following his graduation from business school, Geraghty joined the staff of the City of Spokane's Corporate Counsel, William H. Plummer, where he worked as a stenographer. During this time, he was drawn to the legal profession and began studying law, under the guidance of Plummer. In 1896, running as a Conservative, under the Fusion ticket, Geraghty was elected as the youngest member of the Washington House of Representatives. In 1897, he passed the state bar in Olympia and began practicing law. When the state legislature elected George Turner as US Senator, Geraghty joined him as his private secretary. While in Washington D.C., Geraghty attended classes at the Georgetown University Law Center. After three years, he returned to Spokane and joined the law practice of John P. Judson. After Turner's term in the senate ended, Geraghty joined a law practice with him in Spokane. In 1905, Geraghty was appointed under a Democratic administration to serve a two-year term as city attorney in Spokane in the same office where he previously worked as a stenographer. In 1916, under a nonpartisan city administration, he returned to the same office, serving until 1910, when he was selected to serve as a member of Governor Martin's cabinet. Family Geraghty is the grandfather of Jack Geraghty (b. 1934), who served as the 39th Mayor of Spokane, Washington. Ironically, while Geraghty served as Spokane's City Attorney during the first decade of the 20th century, his grandson served as the mayor of the city during the last decade.

She holds the title of Detective Inspector, and serves on the Swedish Police Authority's human trafficking unit, of which she is the head. Wahlberg estimated that the number of prostitutes in the country dropped 40% between 1998 and 2003 because of Sweden's passing of the 1999 Kvinnofrid law that made selling sex legal, but buying sex illegal. In 2005, she said that the effectiveness of the Kvinnofrid law is limited by the fact that not all of the country's police authorities make enforcing this particular law a priority, with many police authorities allocating more of their resources to combat the illegal drug trade. In 2008, she said that large numbers of foreign politicians and law enforcement officials were coming to Sweden looking to study the Kvinnofrid law. She also said, \\"We don't have a problem with prostitutes. We have a problem with men who buy sex.\\" In March of that year, Wahlberg served on a Swedish delegation of experts who travelled to Scotland as the start of a campaign to implement a law in Scotland analogous to the Kvinnofrid law in Sweden.

As a young man he purchased his own freedom for $800. He traveled to Indiana, and soon moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he sold groceries and then worked as a railroad porter. He quickly became a leader in the African-American community. He operated a local branch of the Underground Railroad, pushed Richard Allen (bishop) to open Wisconsin first African- American church, and also played a role in the Joshua Glover controversy. In 1865, at the insistence of Sherman Booth, Gillespie attempted to vote. He was denied a ballot, so he sued the Board of Elections. Gillespie v. Palmer went all the way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The justices of the court sided with Gillespie, in his argument that Wisconsin voters had voted in favor of male African American suffrage in an 1849 referendum. He was the first African-American voter in Wisconsin. Gillespie later moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he died on March 31, 1892.

It was inhabited intermittently from the beginning of the common era to late prehistoric times, but its most intensive inhabitation was by peoples of the Plum Bayou culture (650 to 1050 CE), in a time known as the Late Woodland period. Description The mound is a buildup of midden located on a terrace ridge to the northeast of the nearby Jacks Bay Site. Pottery sherds collected at the site have enabled archaeologists to determine the different succeeding cultures which have inhabited the site. The site was first occupied briefly about 1 CE by peoples of the Marksville culture. It was again occupied by the later peoples of the Baytown culture. This was the first intensive occupation of the site. Its largest and longest occupation was by peoples of the Plum Bayou/Coles Creek culture. It had one last light occupation during the prehistoric period by peoples of the Mississippian culture. The site was brought to the attention of archaeologists in 1965 when it was slated for use by the US Army Corps of Engineers as fill dirt for a nearby construction project.

The castle was renovated several times during the Middle Ages and the town of Ch√¢teaubriant developed at its side. During the Mad War, the castle was seized by the French after a siege. The keep and the halls, partially destroyed, were renovated in the flamboyant style. Eventually, during the 16th century, the ch√¢teau obtained its definitive appearance when the new Renaissance palace was built against the medieval enceinte. After the French Revolution, the ch√¢teau was sold and divided several times, and was finally transformed into an administrative centre, with the seat of the sous-pr√©fecture, a court and a police station. All these offices closed down after 1970, and nowadays the ch√¢teau is partly opened to visitors. Location The ch√¢teau is located between the Ch√¢teaubriant-Rennes railway on the east and the old town centre on the west. To the north, it is bordered by the river Ch√®re which forms a natural moat, and on the south by a wide square, the place Charles-de-Gaulle. The Ch√®re is retained by a medieval dam and forms a pond, the √©tang de la Torche. The dam serves as a bridge and it was originally an access to the walled town. A stream, the Rollard, also formed a moat on the western side of the castle. It was covered over during the 19th century and now flows under the town centre. The subsoil in Ch√¢teaubriant is made of sedimentary rocks (schist and sandstone) belonging to the Armorican massif. These rocks form folds and outcrops.L'histoire g√©ologique de la Bretagne , Emmanu√®le Savelli The ch√¢teau is built on a promontory which is steep on the north, where the Ch√®re flows, but slopes in terraces towards the south. History=Middle Ages= The 13th-century gatehouse of the upper ward. The castle is first mentioned between 1030 and 1042 but it was founded earlier, at the beginning of the 11th century. It was first built by Brient, an envoy of the count of Rennes, to create an outpost in the Pays de la M√©e. This region around Ch√¢teaubriant was then a buffer zone between the counties of Rennes, Nantes and Angers, but also a place for trading. The B√©r√© fair was for example founded in 1049 in a suburb of the town. Brient is also responsible for the construction of the B√©r√© church and priory, two major landmarks of medieval Ch√¢teaubriant. The first castle was a motte-and-bailey structure made of wood. It dominated the river Ch√®re and the Rollard and had two concentric moats. One was dry, the other filled with water. It also had a big square keep, rebuilt in stone around 1100. Two halls and a chapel were added during the 12th century, the latter being completed in the 13th century. In the same period, Ch√¢teaubriant emerged as a town on the banks of the Rollard. City walls were built between the 13th and the 15th centuries.Ministry of Culture: Fortification d'agglom√©ration The keep and its windows, opened after the Mad War. The upper-ward gatehouse, the curtain wall and most of the towers were built during the 13th century. The gatehouse still includes its two towers which were originally 25 meters high. The halls and the keep were rebuilt in the 14th century, and the lower-bailey gatehouse was completed before 1400. The early House of Ch√¢teaubriant, whose founder was Brient, became extinct in 1383. The barony of Ch√¢teaubriant was then inherited by the House of Dinan, another Breton noble family. The Dinans found themselves without male offspring in 1444. In 1486, the baroness of Ch√¢teaubriant, Fran√ßoise de Dinan, the last of her family, opposed Francis II of Brittany. She prepared the \\"Ch√¢teaubriant treaty\\" by which the barons of Brittany asked the King of France to settle a Breton internal dispute. The treaty, which betrayed the authority of Francis II, was one of the reasons for the Mad War and showed the weakness of the Duchy of Brittany as a political entity. Brittany and France went to war, Breton castles were taken one after the other by the French. Ch√¢teaubriant was besieged in 1488 and surrendered after one week. At the end of the war, Fran√ßoise de Dinan had the castle restored and improved. As the old walls did not fit the new military exigences, a bastion was built. The keep and the halls, which also lost their defensive capacity, were opened by large windows. Inside, the baroness ordered new fireplaces in the Flamboyant style. =Renaissance= The Renaissance palace. From the left to the right: the B√¢timent des Gardes, the Jean de Laval wing and the gallery. The improvements on the keep and the halls were not sufficient for Fran√ßoise de Dinan who wanted a fashionable residence. She ordered a new palace, built in the lower bailey. This palace has been called B√¢timent des Gardes (\\"guards' building\\") since the French Revolution, because it was then used by the National Guard. The new residence was completed at the beginning of the 16th century, after the death of Fran√ßoise. At that time, Ch√¢teaubriant belonged to Jean de Laval, her grandson and a member of the House of Laval. However, Jean de Laval was not satisfied with the new palace, a stark building typical of the First Renaissance. He ordered a new wing, built around 1530 in an Italian style, and characteristic of the Second Renaissance. Jean de Laval is also responsible for the long gallery which forms an angle with the palace. Jean de Laval died heirless in 1543 and gave his possessions and titles to the Constable of France Anne de Montmorency, one of the most powerful Frenchmen of the time. The constable completed the works begun by Jean de Laval but established his residence at the Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen, close to Paris. =Modern period= The 17th-century Chambre dor√©e. Ch√¢teaubriant belonged to the House of Montmorency until 1632 when Henri II de Montmorency was dispossessed and beheaded for felony. The barony was given to the Princes of Cond√© who kept it until the French Revolution. The Cond√©s slightly improved the ch√¢teau, for example in redesigning some rooms, such as the Chambre dor√©e in the Jean de Laval wing, decorated after 1632. However, the princes did not live in Ch√¢teaubriant, but at the Ch√¢teau de Chantilly and in their h√¥tel particulier in Paris. The distance of the Dukes of Montmorency and later the Princes of Cond√© permitted the town council to gain some independence, but the lords still maintained local officers in the ch√¢teau. The roof of the keep collapsed after a storm around 1720. The building was not restored afterwards and slowly fell into ruin. =Since the Revolution= The prince Louis V de Bourbon-Cond√© was one of the first nobles to go into exile during the French Revolution. He left France for England in 1789. The National Guard of the town settled in the ch√¢teau, which was also used to house various storehouses and a police station. Several parts of the buildings and courtyards were sold or rented to locals and the moat was partially filled in. During the Bourbon Restoration, the estate was progressively returned to the Prince of Cond√©. However, he eventually decided to sell it. The town council, in need of buildings for its jail, court and services, wanted to buy the ch√¢teau, but the prince did not wish to deal with the administration, and the mayor bought the property personally. He left the lower bailey gatehouse to the d√©partement, which transformed it into a jail, and sold the rest to the town council. The mayor, Martin Connesson, also kept a part of the estate and built a new house on it in 1822. The Jean de Laval wing, which served as a court of justice between 1855 and 2009. In 1839, the council considered pulling down the keep to use its stones to build a school and a bridge. This project met strong opposition and the ch√¢teau was included on the first list of monuments historiques in 1840. The town could not maintain the ch√¢teau in good repair and sold it to the Duke of Aumale in 1845. The Duke settled in the house built by the mayor Martin Connesson and refurbished it. Being a son of Louis-Philippe I, he followed his father to England after the Revolution of 1848 and sold the ch√¢teau to the Loire-Atlantique d√©partement in 1853. The sous-pr√©fecture moved there in 1854, and the 1822 house became the residence of the sous-pr√©fet. The police station, the court and the jail, which were relocated somewhere else after the Duke of Aumale acquired the estate, came back in 1855. In 1887, the d√©partement asked for the removal of the ch√¢teau from the monument historique list because it could not afford the repairs required by the authorities. However, several restoration campaigns were mounted after 1909, especially on the keep. The ch√¢teau was eventually reintegrated into the list in 1921. In 1944, the southern end of the Renaissance palace was destroyed during an American bombing raid. Major restoration campaigns were carried out in the 1960s and after 2000. Nonetheless, the ch√¢teau has never been fully opened to visitors, who can only access the wards and some rooms, such as the Chambre dor√©e and the B√¢timent des Gardes which hosts exhibitions. However, all the administration services progressively closed after 1970. For instance, the police station moved out in 1971, the public library followed in 2006, the sous-pr√©fecture in 2012, and the court was closed in 2009. The house built by Martin Connesson remains the residence of the sous-pr√©fet. Architecture Map of the ch√¢teau, with the various elements and their period of completion. =The castle= The upper ward and the chapel. The castle is divided between an upper ward and a lower bailey. The bailey, on the south, is opened by a 14th-century gatehouse, the Pavillon des Champs, which is the main entrance for the whole castle. The upper ward is accessible from the bailey through a second gatehouse. It is located on the highest point, dominating the Ch√®re, and it is bordered by the seigniorial buildings: the two halls and the chapel. The keep is built on both the upper and lower ward and also dominates the Ch√®re. It was built in stone around 1100 on the site of the primitive motte. Later rebuilt in the 14th century, it felt into ruins during the 18th century. It forms an irregular square, its walls are 18 m long and 3.5 m thick. Remains of machicolation are visible on the top. The two halls form an angle with the keep. They were rebuilt in the 14th century and the opening of new windows after the Mad War did not alter their austere look. The small hall, partially destroyed, has a peculiar roof, similar to a flat onion dome, made around 1562. The result is somewhat clumsy and is only an experimental attempt. The Pavillon des Champs. Located close to the small hall, the chapel was built around 1142 and refurbished in the 13th century. Some hundred years later, it was divided in two and the western part was turned into the chaplain's house. The monument is romanesque but gothic windows were added in the 16th century. The windows on the chaplain's house form a single bay culminating with a gothic dormer. Mural paintings and 15th-century floor tiles were discovered during archeological excavations. The gatehouse is partly ruined but it still has its two towers. It is built in sandstone with alternating lines of schist. Parts of the enceinte and the chemin de ronde are preserved. The Pavillon des Champs (\\"fields pavilion\\"), which opens the lower bailey, originally had a drawbridge. Its rear half was built in the 14th century and the front dates from the 16th century.

File:Chateaub2.jpg|The chapel seen from outside the castle. File:Ch√¢teaubriant - Ch√¢teau - Chapelle - D√©tail 3.jpg|The door of the chaplain's house. =The Renaissance palace= The Renaissance residence is located in the lower ward. It consist of an alignment of buildings built on the enceinte, with a gallery forming an angle. B√¢timent des Gardes The B√¢timent des Gardes and the enceinte seen from the upper ward. The B√¢timent des Gardes is the oldest Renaissance building and also the less decorated. It was built around 1500. Its slate roof is steep and as tall as the facade itself, which gives a massive look to the whole. The facade is opened by large regularly positioned windows on the first floor and small irregular doors and windows on the ground floor. The facade on the moat is framed by two medieval towers which were opened by new large windows. The walls are very thick and inside, the rooms are usually big. On the ground floor, the Salle verte (\\"green room\\"), which is the main hall, is 30 meters long and 10 meters large. It is also 10 meters high and its monumental fireplace is two meters wide. The local blue schist was largely used as an ornamental material; it is particularly visible on ceilings, fireplaces and around the windows. Jean de Laval wing The Jean de Laval wing seen from the moat. The Fran√ßoise de Foix tower is on the right. The Jean de Laval wing was designed by Jean Delespine, a local architect, and built after 1532. At that time, French architecture had changed a lot: medieval features still in use at the beginning of the 16th century were totally rejected for Italian designs. Thus the Jean de Laval wing is fully different from the B√¢timent des Gardes. It is opened on the bailey by large windows bordered by tuff pilasters and small niches and it has Italian sculpted dormers. On the external facade, the architect reemployed the medieval walls and towers and opened them with large windows and dormers. Although very Italian in design, the building retained some French typical features, such as a steep slate roof and high chimneys. The design is also messy on several details, for example, the windows are not perfectly regular and some of them are too close to each other. Tuff, extremely common on the ch√¢teaux in the Loire Valley, because it is easily found there, had to be imported to Ch√¢teaubriant and was only used for ornamental purpose. Instead, the walls were built with local sandstone and the facade on the bailey was covered by a white coating. Local blue schist was also used for the niches and the chimneys alternate tuff and bricks. A monumental staircase was built at the junction between the Jean de Laval wing and the B√¢timent des Gardes. It served as the main entrance and its first floor is opened by a loggia. The staircase was built with tuff and its vaults are decorated with little schist coffers. The Chambre dor√©e (\\"golden room\\"), the only room opened to visitors, is located on the first floor. It was decorated in the 1630s with red tapestry and baroque sculptures. The overmantel of the fireplace is particularly rich, with an oil on canvas and golden cornucopias.

File:Porte chateau chateaubriant.jpg|A door in the staircase. The great gallery The great gallery and its pavilion. The great gallery was originally closing the garden in front of the Jean de Laval wing and it was connecting it to the keep. Only one wing has been preserved, but several remains such as columns are still visible in the garden. The remaining part comprises two levels and the walls are made of red bricks whereas the decorative details are made of blue schist. The combination of these two materials is rare and creates a quaint look. The ground floor is a loggia opened by 21 arches with doric columns. The first floor is opened by large windows with small pediments. This floor is accessible through a stair located in an adjoining pavilion. File:Galerie chateau chateaubriant 02.jpg|The gallery. File:013. Ch√¢teau de Ch√¢teaubriand.JPG|View from the pavilion. Legends Two legends are linked with the ch√¢teau. The first one involves Sybille, the wife of Geoffroy IV of Ch√¢teaubriant, who went on Crusade in 1252. He was jailed in Egypt in 1250 and the French army was destroyed there by the plague. The same year, the death of Geoffroy was announced in Ch√¢teaubriant, and Sybille started to mourn him. However, he would have come back several months later. Because of the shock, Sybille would have succumbed in his arms. The second legend involves Jean de Laval and his wife, Fran√ßoise de Foix. They were engaged in 1505 with the support of Anne de Bretagne, duchess of Brittany and Queen of France. After the death of Anne and her husband Louis XII of France, the new King, Francis I, asked Jean de Laval to come to his Court to help him settle the French annexation of Brittany. Fran√ßoise de Foix followed her husband and became the lady in waiting to the Queen Claude de France as well as the mistress of Francis I. Jean fought in the Italian Wars and became Governor of Brittany in 1531. Fran√ßoise de Foix was on her side rejected from the Court in 1525. She died on 16 October 1537, during the night, and assassination rumors quickly spread. According to them, Fran√ßoise would have been killed by her husband, jealous of her relationship with the King. According to some rumors, Jean de Laval would also have locked up his wife in a room, and later poisoned her or bled her to death. Since then, every 16 October at midnight, a ghost procession would walk in the ch√¢teau. The Chambre dor√©e has often been presented as the place where Fran√ßoise died, but its present layout dates from only the 17th century.

He was also the Chief of the Turtle Clan, one of the most religious orders of the tribe. Biography Straight Tail was born in 1630 in present-day Ohio, to the Chief of the Pekowi and an unnamed Pekowi Woman *** added by 9x granddaughter*** her name was Nimeeth (Bromley Eakin)Pekowi. Nothing is yet known of his childhood or teenage years, but what is known is that he succeeded his father at the age of 40 in 1670, as both Pekowi Chief and Chief of the Turtle Clan. Each division of the Shawnee had control over different aspects of the whole tribe's lifestyle, and the Pekowi managed the Shawnee's state of order, duty and celebration of religion. As Chief, Straight Tail was in charge of these important aspects of tribal life. Meaurroway was a strong leader, leading his people on massive migrations: 1677: Leads his people to present-day Illinois and Ohio to join up with other bands of Shawnee and various tribes. 1680‚Äì1693: Leads his tribe to the area around present-day Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina, frequently moving throughout that area over the course of 13 years. 1697: Straight Tail settles down with his tribe in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Straight Tail eventually gave up his rank of Chief of the Pekowi and the Turtle Clan to his son, Opessa, in 1697. Opessa would later sign a peace treaty with William Penn in 1701, and have good relations with Pennsylvania governor John Evans. Straight Tail's grandson Peter Chartier became chief of the Pekowi in 1737. Straight Tail Meaurroway Opessa died in Pennsylvania in either 1709. Children Straight Tail married a Pekowi woman in 1650, having the following children: * Wolf Straight Tail: born about 1654. * Sewatha Straight Tail: born about 1660 in Ohio, USA. Married to Martin Chartier about 1693. Mother of Peter Chartier. Died in 1759 in Illinois. * Cakundawanna Straight Tail: born about 1662. * Opessa Straight Tail: born about 1664. Great-grandfather of Tecumseh, famed Shawnee leader during the War of 1812. * Snow White Straight Tail: born about 1666 in Ohio, USA. * Minitha Straight Tail: born about 1668 in Ohio, USA * John White Straight Tail: born about 1670 in Ohio, USA. * Daughter Straight Tail: born about 1680 in Illinois, USA. Legacy and intermarriages Unlike other Native American Chiefs before him, Straight Tail did not discourage interracial marriage. He encouraged a good relationship with the Europeans. His daughter, Sewatha, married a prominent French trader, Martin Chartier, who explored the Great Lakes region of America with Rene-Robert de la Salle. Other children and their descendants also married whites. His grandson was Peter Chartier, who was active in opposition to the British in the French and Indian War. Because of these marriages, many of his modern-day descendants include people that have Caucasian features.

In the UK the only older cosmetic company is Yardley. History The Cyclax Company was founded in 1896 by Mrs Hemming (real name Frances (Fanny) Forsythe n√©e Hamilton [1872-1934]) in a converted front room of a house at 58 South Molton Street, London, to provide beauty treatments. In 1902, Cyclax began to sell cosmetics generally and by 1910 there were over 40 preparations in the Cyclax range including skin care products, hair care products, face powders, eye lotions, lip lotions and soap. In the period before the First World War, Cyclax products went on sale in Europe and across parts of the British Empire. = Expansion = In 1919 Frances Forsythe's son, Gery Hamilton Forsythe [1896-1964], returned from the United States to help with the business and he eventually assumed control of the company. He established separate companies and local manufacturing in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States in the 1930s. Cyclax salons were also established in various parts of the world maintained by Cyclax trained staff some of whom travelled to London to become international Cyclax representatives. = Wartime = The Second World War presented some problems for Cyclax. Although the business at South Molton Street survived, the factory at Tottenham Court Road was destroyed during the London Blitz and temporary facilities had to be used until the new factory was established in Harlow New Town, Essex in 1953. Cyclax made a number of contributions to the war effort including a burn treatment and a camouflage cream. In 1939 they also released a lipstick shade named 'Auxiliary Red' that was specifically designed for service women. It has been suggested that this lipstick started the trend for the use of bright red lipsticks during the war. = Postwar period = This was a difficult time for Cyclax, as it was for many British cosmetic companies who faced heavy taxation and increased competition from American firms like Max Factor and Revlon. One prominent supporter of Cyclax during this period was Princess Elizabeth. She used a Cyclax consultant, Thelma Besant, as her Cosmetician and Beauty Adviser both before and after she was crowned. Thelma advised the Queen on skin care and cosmetics for the coronation and the numerous royal tours in the early part of her reign. A Royal Warrant of Appointment was issued to Cyclax in 1961. = Acquisition = Cyclax was a family owned business until it was bought by the American merchant bankers Lehman Brothers, Inc. in 1970 on behalf of a group of private investors. They closed the salon in South Molton Street, streamlined the product line and repackaged it. Through the 1970s and 1980s the company passed through numerous owners including British American Tobacco and SmithKIine Beecham. It was sold by Richards & Appleby Ltd. in October 2018 to Three Pears Ltd who plan to rejuvenate the brand. The current product range is largely based on the use of natural ingredients and will be 100% manufactured in the UK.

Coming a day after the larger Battle of Marianna, this conflict involved a company of Home Guard troops from Vernon who were going to the aid of their Confederate compatriots in that city. Unbeknownst to the Southerners, their route had taken them straight toward the withdrawing Federal column under Brigadier General Alexander Asboth, which was returning to their main base at Pensacola after their victory at Marianna. The two forces met on a wooden bridge across Hard Labor Creek in Washington County; refusing to heed Union demands to disperse, the badly-outnumnered Floridians chose to resist and were quickly defeated, with most of them being taken prisoner.Battle of Vernon Overview. Prelude In the summer of 1864, Florida Governor John Milton ordered the creation of Home Guard units in the state's counties. Located in the Florida Panhandle, Washington County had few men of military age who were not already in Confederate service, invalids or too old or young to fight. Additionally, some country residents had already defected to the Federals, including the county Sheriff With barely thirty available men, the local Home Guard company chose Second Lieutenant W.B. Jones, a veteran of the 6th Florida Infantry who had been discharged for wounds received in Tennessee, to lead them. Upon learning of the approach of Federal forces, Confederate commanders in Mariana had sent out messengers to nearby towns and villages, asking them to come to their aid with all possible speed. Though the message sent to Jones did not arrive until after the Battle of Marianna had concluded, Jones was still determined to do what he could to help his brothers in arms. Assembling his company, he went through Vernon and forced every man there to join him, regardless of age--men \\"considerably older than sixty\\" were forced to shoulder their rifles and accompany his column. By the time he set out on the morning of the 28th, Jones had managed to assemble about fifty mounted men. Meanwhile, the Federal column--over 700 strong-- had left Marianna to return to Pensacola in the early morning hours of April 28, driving a large herd of confiscated cattle, horses and mules, and accompanied by over 600 liberated slaves.Battle of Vernon Summary By noon, they had reached Orange Hill in Washington County, where they burned the barns and outbuildings of the Everett Plantation, then stopped for lunch. Resuming their march shortly thereafter, they reached a wooden bridge spanning Hard Labor Creek, about five miles northeast of Vernon. The battle The Confederate and Federal columns met unexpectedly as they each approached the bridge from opposite sides of the creek. Uncertain of what to do, each side waited for the other to start something. After a few minutes Federals of the lead element, from the 1st Florida Cavalry (US), demanded that Captain Jones and his men surrender. According to local legend, a Confederate named Stephen Pierce (a veteran of the 4th Florida Infantry, invalided home from Tennessee) cursed and taunted the Union soldiers, who responded by firing a volley into the Southerners and then charging across the bridge. Legend says Pierce was dragged behind a gallberry bush by enraged Federal soldiers and murdered, but recent research suggests he was killed during the initial exchange of fire, instead. Outnumbered more than ten to one, the Southerners scattered and rushed pell-mell back toward Vernon, with many being taken prisoner by pursuing Federals. A few managed to escape, reporting that the Union troopers chased them all the way back to Vernon, shooting at them the whole time. Amazingly, only one man had been killed and one wounded--both from Jones' Home Guard unit. Aftermath The captured prisoners were sent first to Ship Island, Mississippi, then on to the Federal prison camp at Elmira, New York where five of them died. Captain Jones survived his imprisonment, but came home \\"badly enfeebled\\" while managing to survive another thirty years. The Federals stopped briefly in Vernon to rest after the brief engagement, then resumed their march toward Pensacola later in the day. Although Confederate troops from Florida and nearby Georgia pursued Asboth's retiring column, they were unable to catch it before they reached the Union lines. Today, the Battle of Vernon--like many similar skirmishes throughout the nation during the Civil War--has largely been forgotten, save by local residents.

The game was released in November 2013 and in Japan in February 2014, where it was available as a bundle with the console. The player navigates the titular character Knack through a series of levels viewed in a fixed camera, third- person-style view. Knack is a living humanoid organism that consists of Relics; a large central Relic is always surrounded by a varying number of smaller Relics. Knack utilizes jumping, dodging, punching, and using enhanced energy-based powers, in order to progress through the colourful environments, which are populated with enemies. The story follows Knack and his creator on a journey to save humankind from a species known as the Goblins. However, one of Knack's creator's former friends goes rogue, and Knack and his allies must stop the antagonist's evil plans. Upon release, Knack was met with a mixed critical response; reviewers praised the game's original concept and ideas, but criticized the gameplay, level of difficulty, and story. A sequel, Knack II, was announced at the 2016 PlayStation Experience, and was released on September 5, 2017.  Gameplay  A gameplay screenshot of Knack, displaying the health bar and level of Sunstone energy acquired in the upper left corner. Knack is a platforming beat 'em up game in which players control the title character, Knack. Game director Mark Cerny describes the gameplay as \\"a little bit like Crash Bandicoot, and a little bit like Katamari Damacy\\", with \\"a touch of God of War in there\\". Players control Knack through a series of long, linear levels, journeying from start to finish, while battling enemies, such as humans, robots, and vehicles, finding secret hidden objects that give Knack upgrades, climbing, destroying objects, and completing jumping and switch- based puzzles. The perspective in which the game is played is similar to that in the God of War games. Players only control Knack and do not control the camera. The camera follows Knack in a combination of third-person and 2.5D angles. Players guide Knack through many levels in many different locations. Each location is different and players follow the objectives played out in the story. The environments are brightly coloured, consisting of bright and vibrant greens, oranges, blues, and greys. Locations visited in the game include mineshafts, forests, factories, mansions, gardens, mountains, cities, laboratories, castles, rock formations, and caves. Gameplay is focused on brawling fighting combat and platforming. Knack is essentially a large Relic which attracts many small Relics to itself to create a living organism. Knack varies in size; he can be the size of a human child when only a few Relics are incorporated around the big Relic, the size of a gorilla when a moderate number of Relics are incorporated, or the size of small skyscrapers when a very large number of Relics are used. Knack has different abilities for each of his states, even though the player primarily utilizes punching, jumping, and dodging abilities; a small Knack jumps higher, moves faster, and is weak, breaking in a small number of hits, while a large Knack can walk over enemies to defeat them, and pick up or break large objects, such as vehicles and buildings. Apart from the Relics, Knack can surround the large central Relic with ice, metal, wood, and other substances. Knack may use the energy absorbed from Sunstones to unleash powerful tornado attacks, shockwaves, and projectiles. Knack gains new abilities from level to level; for example he can lift up and throw cars in his large form, and use specific objects involved in the story. Knack's voice also changes with his size; Knack's voice is nonexistent when in his smallest form, while in his largest form, his voice is deep, loud, and intimidating.  Plot  In a futuristic and somewhat fantasy society, humanity has progressed in technological advances by harvesting the perpetual energy from Relics, physical remnants of a lost civilization, as well as crystals such as Sunstones. Humans are reviled by the primitive Goblin species, who years prior had waged war upon them but ended up being driven from their cities and forced to live in the wilds. After a force of Goblins commandeering tanks overrun a human outpost, the city of Newhaven organizes an expedition to discover how the advanced weaponry was acquired. Explorer Ryder volunteers, joining billionaire industrialist Viktor, and his head of security, Katrina. Doctor Vargas demonstrates his creation, Knack, a being consisting solely of Relics, able to control his size by collecting them and harnessing Sunstone energy. Knack, Vargas, and his assistant and Ryder's nephew, Lucas, consequently partake. The group trace the weapons to a goblin fortress. Knack defeats its chief Morgack, who reveals that a goblin named Gundahar gave him the weapons. Viktor double-crosses the others by kidnapping Lucas, forcing Vargas and Knack to follow, while Ryder questions Morgack. Gundahar later arrives, forcing Ryder to escape. Returning to his palace in Newhaven, Viktor unveils one of many giant relics to Vargas, Knack, and Lucas, intending to use them to usher the world into a new technological revolution, but requires Knack in order to do so. The trio flee Viktor and discover a map of Trogdo Mine that the relics had been unearthed from, illustrating a locked area which contains even larger relics that Viktor believes Knack can access. Upon arriving the mine, Knack fails to open the door. Viktor and Katrina corner them and have Knack shot, where he falls down a shaft. Knack enters an ancient cavern where he is ejected by creatures known as Guardians and reaches a nearby castle owned by Viktor. Vargas and Lucas are imprisoned in the castle. Ryder tracks and rescues Vargas and Lucas with the help of Knack. A Goblin army led by Gundahar invades Ryder's hometown of Monte Verde to steal relics. Vargas, Ryder, and Lucas fashion trackers, made to look as relics, to find the Goblins' main base. Knack forces Gundahar to leave; tracking the goblins, they reach a factory manufacturing weapons. Vargas is met by Charlotte, his former lover whom he had presumed dead 20 years ago when she had fallen into a chasm. She had been found by Gundahar and nursed back to health; in return, she created arms for him to combat rival goblin factions. After Gundahar turned to attacking human settlements, Charlotte stopped production. Ashamed, she refuses to leave. Knack destroys the weapon stores, but Gundahar flees and forces Charlotte to repair the armaments or be cast out. Charlotte sends a message to Vargas, begging him to save her. In the Barren Wastes, following Ryder's prior discovery, the group enter a temple containing a mural of the door within Trogdo Mine; it depicts the key, which resides beneath Obelisk Mountain, but warns of danger beyond the door. Inside Obelisk Mountain, the group are caught by Viktor and Katrina, having bugged Lucas, but Knack blocks them off with a cave-in. Lucas reminds them of the warnings and persuades them to destroy the key, but Katrina takes it using a mech, triggering a volcanic eruption. Knack defeats Katrina, where she inadvertently falls towards the lava. Viktor prepares to leave with the key on his airship. Ryder sights Katrina lying on some rubble, and stays behind to save her. Vargas, Knack, and Lucas board the airship. The three presume Ryder dead following an explosion in the mountain. Vargas receives Charlotte's message and sets the airship to fly to the factory. Viktor finds and ejects them, though Knack saves Vargas and Lucas. They reunite with Charlotte and leave in her aircraft. Viktor succeeds in opening the door in Trogdo Mine, revealing an ancient chamber containing an orb, which disintegrates him. Immediately, the area and Guardians emerge from out of the ground. Charlotte's ship is damaged, forcing the group to land, and Knack leaves to confront the orb. It attaches itself to a Guardian, which Knack battles, destroying the orb. The source eradicated, the expanse of stonework recedes underground. A parade is held for them in Newhaven, where Knack, Vargas, and Lucas receive medals. As Vargas leads a eulogy for Ryder, Ryder walks through a desert carrying Katrina towards the city.  Development and release  Knack was envisioned as the PlayStation 4 equivalent of a Crash Bandicoot title. Knack was the first PS4 game shown to the public. Sony Computer Entertainment decided to do this because they wanted to prove that the PS4's launch lineup did not exclusively consist of big-budget first-person shooters. Because of Knacks intentional similarities to the successful Crash Bandicoot series, Sony Computer Entertainment felt it would be a smart business decision to heavily market Knack as an essential PS4 title. However, some critics questioned this decision, mainly because this business tactic has been employed by Sony before. The initial idea for Knack was that of a character that could find items and add them to his body thus causing him to grow with Cerney explaining \\"Our initial concept was that Knack would maybe break down a building or a wall, and he‚Äôd incorporate the resulting bricks into his body,\\" This, in practice, however did not work well resulting in \\" a giant amorphous blob of a character.\\" After a year and a half the team realized that the character had to be designed \\"more intensively.\\" Instead of incorporating random elements into him he would now instead be made of relics which allowed the developers to make a functioning character. Cerney attempted to target a dual audience with the game attempting to appeal to both core gamers as well as players who \\"never picked up a controller before in their life,\\" Cerney would later admit that this \\"may have taken us off in a bit of a wrong direction\\" noting that in addition to catering to both set of players the game also had to be a launch title for the system. After interviewing Cerney about the sequel Polygon reporter, Colin Campbell came away with the impression that the original was \\"created under less-than-ideal conditions\\" In wanting to make a \\"21st Century Crash Bandicoot\\" Cerney wanted the game to be smaller in scope than other contemporary games at the time. Despite this Cerney realized that audience expectations were different from when the Crash games were developed and that Knack had to be more \\"complex\\" adding \\" Even if the vision is to be in that sort of genre, to try to speak to the nostalgia that people have for the experiences of years gone by, it turns out you need to do five or 10 times as much today.\\" In addition to Crash Bandicoot, other influences for the game include Katamari Damacy and God of War. Despite years of experience in the indusrty Knack marks the first game which Cereny directed, explaining to website Gamasutra \\"We didn't have directors back in the day, because if you have a three-person project you don't worry about calling somebody a 'director.'\\" Cerney initially envisioned himself as taking a more hands off approach intending himself to merely be a producer but as the game grew he found himself becoming more involved eventually becoming the director. To promote the launch of the game, Sony Computer Entertainment and Japan Studio released a free mobile game called Knack's Quest on November 6, 2013. The game is a tile-matching puzzle game for iOS and Android devices. The game allows connectivity with players' PlayStation Network accounts to unlock special Relics within the main game. Knack was released in China as Knack's Adventure at the PlayStation 4's launch on March 20, 2015.  Reception  Knack received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Steve Butts of IGN praised the concept and the hero but criticized the gameplay and the story by saying \\"Knacks shifting size is a great idea that never really grows into anything substantial\\". Tom McShea of GameSpot praised some elements of the game, such as the environments, but also criticized the story, gameplay, and \\"surprisingly high\\" difficulty. McShea said, \\"There's not one element of Knack to rally around, to excite you. And without that special something, Knack crumbles just like its piecemeal protagonist.\\" Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer criticized the lack of depth in the gameplay and the checkpoint balancing. Bramwell stated that \\"Knack isn't the kind of game you'll want to take home with your PlayStation 4. I'm all in favour of games that transport us back to the good old days of vibrant originality, but Knack simply doesn't.\\" On the other hand, Game Informers Matt Helgeson said that it's \\"not the most innovative or the most visually dazzling game. This won't be the one you put in to show off your new console to your friends. However, when you're done with the prettied-up versions of the big franchises, you'll find yourself wanting to return to Knack. It's got charm and heart, and offers a whole lot of good gameplay. Ultimately, that's still what's important - no matter which generation we're in.\\" Destructoids Dale North called the game \\"A fun romp, and definitely worth a play. It's easy to pick up, a joy to look at, and some of the boss battles are pretty great. My recommendation is that you take it in smaller doses, or try out the drop- in/drop-out cooperative play, which will definitely help when the going gets tough.\\" VentureBeat's McKinley Noble called the game \\"a solid adventure with some surprising care put into a lot of elements that most games take for granted\\", but lamented the game's limited combat, linear gameplay, and shallow technical polish. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one six, one seven, one eight, and one seven for a total of 28 out of 40 in its PlayStation 4 launch issue in February 2014. 411Mania's Gavin Napier gave it a score of 8 out of 10 and called it \\"An easily accessible, throwback game that's appropriate for family enjoyment.\\" The National Posts Chad Sapieha gave it a score of 7.5 out of 10 and said that \\"even with its not-quite-fully-delivered-upon promise ‚Äì [Knack] may still be worth picking up.\\" GameZone's Lance Liebl also gave it a score of 7.5 out of 10 and said that the multiplayer \\"makes Knack the best game for kids and the family to enjoy on the PlayStation 4 at the moment. There's still the lack of a well thought-out story, and the game disengages the player far too often with cutscenes to simply show Knack jump, but it's a game that will both offer a challenge and introduce kids to a simple brawler- platformer.\\" Peter Nowak of The Globe and Mail gave it an average review and called it \\"a solid initial effort, despite it being a little long and rather hard.\\" Scott Nichols of Digital Spy gave it three stars out of five and said the game \\"has its moments, and PlayStation 4 owners starved for something to play on their shiny new console will appreciate that the game actually becomes more fun to play the second time around, allowing it to keep players busy during the several month drought that seems to follow every system launch.\\" Paul Goodman of The Escapist similarly gave it three stars out of five and said it was \\"a colorful, but mediocre platformer that has issues with repetitive gameplay on top of being frustratingly difficult at times.\\" Steve Boxer of The Guardian likewise gave it three stars out of five and said, \\"Knack isn't a bad game: there is satisfaction to be derived from it, some of the gameplay is genuinely good fun (at its best moments, it does begin to acquire an air reminiscent of a more ponderous Crash Bandicoot), and it's one of the longer games to emerge in recent years, so will at least keep youngsters occupied for decent periods of time. But neither is it a particularly good game, which is hugely disappointing given that it's supposed to be one of the flagship reasons for buying a PlayStation 4.\\" However, Dave Riley of Anime News Network gave the game a C and said, \\"There's very little in Knack that inspires passion. What we have here may be a technical marvel, but only the engineers will know for sure. From the outside looking in, if they'd spent half as much time on any other part of the game as they did animating the bits and bobs, maybe Knack would've contained something worth caring about.\\" James Marshall of The Digital Fix likewise gave it 5 out of 10 and said it was \\"something constructed of relics ‚Äì from the basic gameplay to the poor characterisation, nearly everything feels like something from two console generations ago.\\" David Jenkins of Metro gave it 3 out of 10 and called it \\"A poor quality video game by any measure, but what this joyless throwback is doing being a key launch title for the PlayStation 4 Sony only knows.\\" Knack sold 322,083 copies on its first two days on sale in Japan as a pack-in game. Sony's Shuhei Yoshida expressed disappointment at Knacks critical reception, hoping the game would receive scores in the mid-70s. However, he emphasised that Knack was \\"not the type of game reviewers would score high for the launch of a next-gen system\\" and instead, the game was a message that the PlayStation 4 was \\"not just trying to cater only to the hardcore\\". Sequel In December 2016, Sony announced Knack II at the PlayStation Experience event. It was released in September 2017 and received more positive reviews.

When a system contains constraints that cannot be written in this form, it is said to be nonholonomic. In simpler terms, a holonomic system is when the number of controllable degrees of freedom is equal to the total degrees of freedom. e.g. A holonomic robot can drive straight to a goal that is not in-line with its orientation, where as a non-holonomic robot must either rotate to the desired orientation before moving forward or rotate as it moves.  Example  URANUS - this mobile robot is holonomic thanks to its omnidirectional Mecanum wheels Consider a three-wheeled mobile robot, moving in the two-dimensional plane. Imagine that three omnidirectional wheels (similar to the robot on the right's wheels) are mounted on the frame of the robot. Each wheel W_i is described by its coordinates (x_i, y_i), so that a configuration of the robot can be given by the six scalars (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3). Also, each wheel W_i can impulse a velocity \\\\mathbf{v}_i = (v_{x,i}, v_{y,i}) to the robot. However, because all three wheels are connected by the rigid robot frame, their relative velocities are zero (unless the frame breaks): These velocity constraints integrate into positional constraints where D_1, D_2, D_3 are scalar constants. The system is thus holonomic. Let us finally look at the degree of freedom of the robot. We initially used six coordinates (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3) to describe a configuration of the robot. Yet, each of the positional constraints \\"consumes\\" a degree of freedom. For instance, d(W_1, W_2) = D_1 implies that (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = D_1, i.e., x_2^2 - 2 x_1 x_2 + x_1^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 - D_1 = 0. The coordinate x_2 can then be replaced by the appropriate root of this quadratic polynomial. Repeating the process thrice leaves us with three irreducible coordinates, corresponding to the three degrees of freedom of the system. Note that the simplest generalized coordinates for this system are (x, y, \\\\theta), where x and y denote translation along the plane axes, and \\\\theta is the orientation of the robot.  Counterexample  The tricycle may look like a similar robotic system; however, it is nonholonomic due to the parallel parking problem.

However, there are several documented variants of Moravian flags used in the past. The first recorded version dates from the mid-13th century. The oldest history There is a description of a Moravian flag in the chronicle of Ottokar aus der Gaal (also known as Otacher ouz der Geul or Ottokar von Steiermark; born about 1265, died between 1318 and 1322): Die Steirische Reimchronik. Jobst of Moravia, Gelnhausen Codex, 15th century The history of the Moravian flag is very varied and begins in the 13th century in the context of the relations between Bohemia and Moravia organized within the construction of a centralized monarchy by the last kings of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. The colouring of the flag (or banner) was according to vexillological rules derived from the colours of heraldic coats of arms since the Middle Ages. Krems From the reign of Ottokar II of Bohemia, Moravia's coat of arms features a silver-red checquered eagle with a golden crown and claws, which looks to the right and is placed on a blue field. The oldest surviving full- colour depiction of the coat of arms of Moravia is in a fresco in the hall of Gozzoburg Castle in Krems an der Donau, dating to the early 1270s. The checquered eagle is documented in a depiction from 1286 and later in the late 13th and early 14th century. The colours of the chequered eagle were derived from the colours of the Bohemian lion (a silver lion on a red shield) and express the connection with the Bohemian king of Moravia and Bohemian monarchy, as, for example, historian Vladim√≠r R≈Ø≈æek recalls. One of the first documented illustrations of the banner of Moravia is the view in the 1407 Gelnhausen Codex, which depicts the Moravian Margrave Jobst of Moravia with a blue banner on which the Moravian white and red eagle is placed with a yellow crown and yellow armor without a shield.  Modern age  Historical Moravian flag in the work of Jacob K√∂bel: Wapen des heyligen R√∂mischen Reichs Teutscher nation (1545) The heraldic flag of Moravia (the flag of Moravia in the form of the flag with coat of arms) is described and drawn for example in the work of Jacob Koebel: Wapen des heyligen r√∂mischen Reichs teutscher Nation from 1545. Historically, there were several versions of the widely used and documented Moravian flags, which were mainly used during the 19th century in parallel to bicolours and tricolours derived from tinctures of provincial coat of arms.Ke st√°tn√≠ a zemsk√© symbolice ƒçesk√©ho st√°tu v obdob√≠ 1526‚Äì1918, p. 167th According to some authors, therefore, the Moravian flag consists of three horizontal strips of red, white, and blue. This color combination was the flag of the Moravian patriots in the 19th century. A delegation of the Moravians to the Slavonic Congress in Prague in 1848 allegedly marched under a tricolour with the top horizontal stripe white, the middle red and the bottom blue. White, red and blue colors are referred to as Moravia in the Nov√Ω proston√°rodn√≠ popis ƒåech, Moravy a Slezska from 1854 and in some textbooks from the 19th century. According to Ivan ≈†tarha, the Moravian colours in 1915 were white, red and blue, and between the years 1915 and 1918 yellow, red and blue.Moravsk√© barvy a moravsk√° zemsk√° vlajka, p. 170. The Czechoslovak Republic restored the white or silver color to the Moravian coat of arms, but the color is not defined in the provincial status flags / banners Act No. 252/1920. Today, a yellow-red bicolour is sometimes used as the flag of Moravia, especially by some Moravian parties, associations and other organizations.Moravsk√© barvy a moravsk√° zemsk√° vlajka, p. 165. The yellow-red bicolour has been used along with other bicolours and tricolours since the second half of 19th century, according to certain authors (L. E. Havl√≠k, M. Hlinomaz). Hereinafter referred to as Morava: k st√°topr√°vn√≠mu postaven√≠ zemƒõ v pr≈Øbƒõhu vƒõk≈Ø.Ke st√°tn√≠ a zemsk√© symbolice ƒçesk√©ho st√°tu v obdob√≠ 1526‚Äì1918, p. 168 As stated by M. Hlinomaz: The historian Ivan ≈†tarha argues that Moravia was never awarded the flag. To today's yellow-red bicolour is sometimes added the provincial coat of arms with a red-gold checquered eagle. The red-gold checquered eagle variant was introduced in 2007, and was recommended by some members and supporters of the Moravian National Community to avoid a possible misidentification with other flags, for example the flag of the capital city Prague, which also consists of yellow and red horizontal stripes. This option is criticized by some Bohemian (Czech) nationalist experts. Both of these versions, however, have been criticized by certain experts approached by the media (specifically historian M. ≈òepa, vexillologist K. M√ºller, and heraldist Ji≈ô√≠ Louda). The appearance of the flag has been a subject of discussion for more than 100 years. One variant consists of two bars, a yellow bar in the upper half, and a red bar in the lower half.

He studied sculpture and engraving under his father. His brother was professor of eloquence at university and of history of art at academy and for the military academy. On March 19, 1796, Boucheron was approved as architect by university of Turin. In the following years, he had made his way to Rome, but the times were turbulent. Boucheron had stayed in Rome during the brief French-sponsored Republic (1798‚Äì99) and even joined its military corps. Canova had fled from Rome during this time. He returns to Turin by the turn of the century. By 1811, he had been named professor of design at the school of Monte (dei Cappuccini) of Turin. His main productions at the time were busts, for example, of Homer and of Giovanni Battista Beccaria. He also made copies and engravings of artworks, and pen-drawn portraits colored in acquaforte. In 1812 he exhibited a series of drawings to the exhibition of arts and manufactures in Italy, and two years later, a portrait of King Vittorio Emanuele in addition to the Return of the King in Turin, which was then engraved by Faustino Anderloni. In 1816 he was appointed professor of drawing the Military Academy in Turin. In 1817 he married Margaret Adelaide Bernero, daughter of the court painter Luigi Bernero. In 1820 he exhibited his drawings at the exhibition held at the building of the University of Turin. The April 4, 1823 Carlo Felice granted him the title of designer of the Royal Gallery, with the annual pension of 600 Lire. He was later appointed director of the Accademia Albertina, a member of the Board of Fine Arts, and in 1830, and tutor to the princes Vittorio Emanuele and Ferdinand. In 1839 he was retired from the Military Academy, with pension equal to the salary.Entry in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani -Treccani - Volume 13 (1971) by Rosalba Amerio Tardito.

Behind the songs In various interviews White explains the meaning of songs on the album: * \\"What Rocks Will Never Know\\": is a song about how difficult it is to be a human being, about celebrating the mess of the human experience. The idea came when White drove by a Christmas tree farm with several trees cut down. This made him think about how trees don't know when to run. * \\"Sunday's Refrain\\": is a song to relate that sermons are meaningless sounds. Not a word of them makes sense; it's just noise. \\"The point where words fail you.\\" * \\"Epilogue to a Marriage\\": \\"I thought I was writing it about somebody else, but I wasn't. I was writing it about me and didn't know it. Sometimes something is in the air and you intuitively sense it, but you don‚Äôt really want to know. So you find conduits for the worry in surrogate material or surrogate human beings or situations. I didn't call it \\"Epilogue to a Marriage\\" until after my wife left. Then it sort of made sense.

The album itself focuses on historical figures and events, just as its predecessor Death & Legacy had done, keeping true to Serenity's historical concept. Characters stories, such as Beethoven, Napoleon, and others have their tales told through Serenity's words and melodic tone. History War of Ages is the first Serenity album with an additional singer. Cl√©mentine Delauney, who joined the band officially on January 21, 2013. makes here Serenity debut with soaring vocals, adding a very melodic counterpart to longtime Serenity front man Georg Neuhauser.

Some languages are viewed as more suited for a particular social group, setting, or topic more so than others. Social factors like class, religion, gender, and age influence the pattern of language that is used and switched between.  Development  There are three different types of code switching which include: situational, metaphorical, and unmarked discourse code- switching. Situational and metaphorical code-switching were first described by John J. Gumperz and Jan-Petter Bloom. In the paper, \\"Social meaning in linguistic structures,\\"Gumper and Bloom are the first to suggest the division between situational and metaphorical code-switching. Gumperz and Dell Hymes describe this difference between situational and metaphorical code- switching. :An important distinction is made from situational and metaphorical code-switching. Situational switching is where alternation between varieties redefines a situation, being a change in governing norms. Metaphorical switching is when alternation enriches a situation, allowing for allusion to more than one social relationship within the situation. In metaphorical code switching, the context of the conversation is undisturbed but rather the changes adhere to the social context including the roles of those involved in the conversation. Unmarked discourse code switching serves as \\"markers\\" for a change in the context of the conversation such as the topic or quoting something. In his book Beyond Culture, anthropologist Edward T. Hall argues that face-to-face interaction within a given culture is governed by thousands of culturally and institutionally coded situational frames, each associated with a linguistically restricted means of speaking known as the Situational Dialect (SD). A SD facilitates concise communication through the reliance on high-context messages. Hall refutes the notion of a universally applicable basic form of a language, stating that \\"the classroom is the only place where the classroom form of the language will be found\\". Hall describes situational frames as: :Compiled of situational dialects, material appurtenances, situational personalities, and behavior patterns that occur in recognized settings and are appropriate to specific situations. Some common settings and situations are: greeting, working, eating, bargaining, fighting, governing, making love, going to school, cooking and serving meals, hanging out, and the like. The situational frame is the smallest viable unit of a culture that can be analyzed, taught, transmitted, and handed down as a complete entity. Frames contain linguistic, kinesic, proxemic, temporal, social, material, personality and other components. Hall gives an example of an SD: :The language used between pilots and the control-tower personnel is an excellent example of a very high-context SD, developed in response to the need for a language of great parsimony and low ambiguity. (...) Situational dialects of these types frequently make use of restricted codes‚Äìand remember, restricted codes are for the insider. Everything is condensed: grammar, vocabulary, intonation. All the rules that are so carefully learned in the classroom go right out the window. In the decades since Blom & Gumperz's and Hall's work first appeared, significant advances have been made in the analysis of code-switching.  Factors that affect code-switching = Functions = Situational code- switching usually occurs when information is being exchanged, replicated, emphasized or the speaker wants an intended reaction. Situational code- switching has a wide set of functions whether it is to clarify, elaborate, bring focus to a subject or switch topics overall. It can also be used when something is being quoted in its original language, the speaker wants to address a specific individual, directly address or bring attention to a particular context within the conversation.Situational code-switching relies on adapting to the speakers within a conversation in order to accentuate, explain or change the context. = Psycholinguistic aspects = Code switching frequently occurs due to the psycholinguistic state of the speakers ability or inability to select words from their mental vocabulary. Language in the bilingual brain is not completely separate, which is why code switching can and does occur. Code switching occurs due to the mechanisms responsible for processes, decoding, storage, retrieval, and production of linguistic material. There are four main types of factors involved in the process of the selection of a language: (1) deselection of the undesired language, (2) the effect of proficiency, (3) the factors that trigger a switch and (4) the monitoring capacity which allows the selected language to be maintained. This process is largely sub-conscious as speakers are not very aware of their code- switching behavior. = Social aspects = Depending on the situation, speakers use code switching which convey aspects of their identity. The motivation to code switch relies on three different types of factors which contribute to the form of code-switching in a particular situation. The three sets of factors are: (1) Factors independent of the speaker and the situation in which the switch is used. (2) Factors attaching to the speaker, as individuals and as members of a variety of sub-groups. For example, their competence in each language, their social networks, their attitudes and ideologies, and their self-perception and perception of others. (3) Factors within the conversation where code-switching takes place. Code switching provides speakers with additional tools and ways to structure their dialogue beyond what is available to monolinguals. A notable example of code-switching that has dialect-specific connotations, or in diglossia, occurs in the Arabic language, which embodies multiple variations that are used either predominantly in speaking in personal or informal settings, such as ones home dialect in the Arab League, predominantly in writing or reading strictly formal literature, such as Classical Arabic, and a standardized version of both that can be spoken and written in professional or high educational settings (such as in university), Modern Standard Arabic. Many countries in the arab league have a long history in the effects of code-switching not only between different forms of Arabic, but between Arabic and another language as well. For instance, in Egypt, as well as in many other arab countries, proficiency in a language besides Arabic is only achievable through private, formalized education that is often only affordable to the wealthy upper class., Kosoff, Zo√´. ‚ÄúCode-Switching in Egyptian Arabic: A SOCIOLINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF TWITTER.‚Äù Al-'Arabiyya, vol. 47, 2014, pp. 83‚Äì99. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/24635374. Code-switching between their native dialect to English or another foreign language is thus an index of their socioeconomic status and educational background., Ibid. Within the history of the arab world, Arab Nationalism has played a large part on the perception of code- switching in certain Arabic-speaking communities; switching from a foreign, particularly European, language was historically frowned upon in society, as it was a linguistic symbol of the occupying country's influence over a nation and so, during the wave of arab nationalism, there was a social preference to only speak Arabic and promote 'arab ideals'., Bassiouney, Reem. ‚ÄúCode‚ÄìSwitching.‚Äù Arabic Sociolinguistics, Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh, 2009, pp. 28‚Äì87. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r29z0.9. Examples An example of situational code-switching can be seen in this telephone conversation between two friends. The speaker is talking about recent political events, and the language she uses is Standard Italian. When she decides to change topics, though, she marks this change by switching to Sicilian. (Standard Italian is shown in ordinary type. Sicilian is in italics.) :Io mai l'ho vista una campagna elettorale cos√¨. Neppure nel quarantotto, che era il dopoguerra, che c'erano... che c'erano proprio umori tremendi. Mai si era verificato. N'autra cosa t'ai'a cchi√®dirti, Giovanna. ::(I've never seen an electoral campaign like this. Not even in 1948, in the post-war period, when there were... when there were tremendous emotions. It never happened. I've got something else to ask you, Giovanna.) A change in topic is an example of a changed situation that may be marked by code- switching. The speaker in this example switches from Standard Italian to the local language, marking the new situation with a different language. In the medical field situational code-switching occurs when patients do not speak the standard language spoken within a hospital and the staff then need to code switch in order to be able to communicate with them. > Physicians and nurses working on the general medicine hospital floor of UCSF > Moffitt-Long Hospital will code switch from English to Spanish when needing > to present information to patients, obtain information, conduct difficult > conversations, and educate patients. > At Riverview Hospital situational code-switching occurred with an > interpreter rather than the physician. In this situation the interpreter is > in a position of co-interviewer where the interpreter speaks with the > patient in order to find out their concerns and then relay them to the > physician when they arrived. \\"[To Patient] Anda, a ver que dice el doctor; > Well, let's see what the doctor says.[To Physician] Doctor, I was looking > for something to put over there because he wants to show you his...foot.\\" > Here the interpreter code-switches in order to be able to effectively > communicate to the doctor the concerns of the patient, foot pains. A four-year-old child named Benjamin, is an English-French bilingual speaker. He constantly code switches between his parents, with the father only being able speak English where as the mother was bilingual, but only spoke French to him. > Growing up in an prominent English-speaking community, Benjamin preferred > English over French, hence him speaking English when talking about everyday > activities.

He served as chief abbot of the Manjusri Monastery and later was the last acting prime minister of Outer Mongolia during Baron Ungern von Sternberg's occupation of Ikh Kh≈≠ree from May to July 1921. Later accused of counterrevolution, he was executed in 1937 at the start of the Stalinist purges in Mongolia (1937‚Äì1939). Early life Tserendorj, born in 1872, was recognized as the 6th reincarnate of the Donkor- Manjushri Gegen at the age of five and in 1880 took his place as Abbot of Manjusri Monastery. In 1911, Tserendorj was a strong supporter of Mongolia's struggle for independence, but withdrew from public life once the proclamation of independence was made. Acting prime minister In February 1921, Tserendorj safeguarded the Bogd Khan at Manjusri Monastery as forces loyal to the Baron Ungern von Sternberg drove occupying Chinese troops from Ikh Kh≈≠ree. With the restoration of autonomous Mongolian government in March 1921, the Bogd Khan once again became monarch of state. Prime Minister Damdinbazar was reassigned to minister of interior and sent west to fight White Russians alongside Khatanbaatar Magsarjav. Tserendorj became acting prime minister until July 1921 when Mongolian partisans commanded by Damdin Sukhbaatar and Red Army units defeated Baron Ungern von Sternberg's troops and occupied Ikh Khuree in what later became known as the Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921. Later years and death The Mongolian revolutionary government removed Tserendorj from his post. He once again took up his duties as chief abbot of Manjushri Monastery and maintained contact with a severely weakened (both physically and politically) Bogd Khan. In 1922 Tserendorj and the Bogd Khan supported a secret mission to contact the Japanese Emperor to request help against the increasing persecution of the Buddhist Church by the new government. In 1930, Tserendorj's personal property was seized as part of the government's rapid implementation of socialist policies. Tserendorj was arrested on charges of anti-government conspiracy and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Appearance  Ronquilus jordani are small, cylindrical ichthyoplankton with brown to gray head, and two yellow bands on cheek. The body is gray with dark spots near pale or pale- yellow fins. This species can be distinguished from other members of the Bathymaster family by its cheek scales and the absence of some features in the cephalic lateralis system.  Habitat Preference  Adult Ronquilus jordani are primarily benthic (bottom-dwelling) along rocky continental shelf and upper slope waters of the north-eastern Pacific Ocean. However, larvae and juveniles are considered neustonic, and occupy waters closer to the surface. This is thought to be beneficial due to increased growth in the warmer surface water and reduced predation at shallower depth.

It consists of plains covered in grasses, low shrubs, and few widely scattered trees. It was originally found on the plains near the Kissimmee River and Fisheating Creek connected to Lake Okeechobee, but its range has been reduced by conversion to agriculture and pasture. Frequent fires are necessary to maintain this system.  Geographic range  Dry prairie was once the dominant grassland endemic to central Florida, from the western shore of Lake Okeechobee and extending northeast into Osceola County. Historically, it is thought that Florida‚Äôs dry prairie covered approximately 1,931 square miles. Pre-settlement dry prairie could be separated into three regions: the ‚ÄúKissimmee River Prairie,‚Äù ‚Äúthe Big Prairie‚Äù across central Florida, and the ‚ÄúMyakka Prairie‚Äù.These three regions are not geographically isolated.  Flora and fauna  There are 658 known vascular flora species, 115 families, and 317 genera found in Florida‚Äôs dry prairie, with 94% of species native to central Florida. There are no plants known to be endemic to the dry prairie environment, but there are a number of species endemic to the Florida peninsula. The shrub layer is dominated by saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). Occasional trees include slash pine (Pinus elliottii) and cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto). Wiregrass (Aristidia beyrichiana), toothache grass (Ctenium aromaticum), and beak rush (Rhynchospora spp.) are dominant grasses and sedges. Where slash pine is more abundant, this system grades into south Florida pine flatwoods. There are a number of species that are listed as ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù that can be found in the Florida dry prairie. The grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus), sandhill crane (Antigone canadensis pratensis), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia floidana), and the Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) are a few that are at risk, with the grasshopper sparrow and panther listed as ‚Äúendangered‚Äù according to the U.S. Endangered Species Act.  Human influence = Agriculture = The increased settlement and growing population of Florida in the early 20th century came with expanded agriculture and the conversion of dry prairie to farmland. Extensive dairy and citrus farms have very little dry prairie vegetation and result in landscape fragmentation, subsequently reducing habitat for dry prairie wildlife. There may also exist a correlation between wetland development and encroachment of the pineland/prairie border. = Fire suppression = Historically, this system experienced fire intervals of 1-4 years, allowing fire-adapting vegetation to grow and maintaining the treeless landscape. Many vegetative species are found in greater abundance at sites with frequent fire . As the settlement of Florida expanded, fire suppression became common practice to prevent damage to homes and agriculture. Because the dry prairie system requires fire for maintenance, suppression has reduced the geographic coverage of this system. With regular prescribed burning, a resurgence in dry prairie vegetation and wildlife can be seen.

The phrase is used with the area to specify the scope, such as world's medicine chest or nation's medicine cabinet. Rainforests In nature, tropical rainforests are considered the world's medicine chest or world's largest pharmacy as 25% of Western pharmaceuticals are derived from ingredients found in tropical rainforests. Additionally, more than 2,000 plants from the tropical rainforests have been identified as having anti-cancer properties with 70% of those are found only in rainforests. There are additional potential to this medicine chest. Currently, only less than 1% of all species in rainforests have been analysed for their medicinal value. Pharmaceutical industry=Germany and Europe= In pharmaceutical industry, Germany was considered the world's medicine cabinet in late 20th century after German firms invented the pharmaceutical industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and recovered from the World War II. During the 1970s, the major pharmaceutical companies were concentrated in France, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with 55% of world's medicine production by major nation came from those countries. That gave the European pharmaceutical industry the world's medicine chest title until the 1990s. In 1990, the pharmaceutical companies in Europe outspent the upcoming American companies in research and development by 8 billion Euros to 5 billion Euros. However, in the period of 10 years, American companies had reversed the trend by investing more in research and development of medicines which outspent European companies by 24 billion Euros to 17 billion Euros in 2000. As a result, some major companies started to relocate operation, research and other divisions including headquarters to the United States. =New Jersey= As the pharmaceutical industry in the United States expanded in the 21st century, New Jersey has become the state with more pharmaceutical companies than any other U.S. state, and known to be the world's medicine chest. In 2006, three of top ten pharmaceutical companies in the world were headquartered in New Jersey. In 2011, New Jersey was home to world or North American headquarters for 17 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The state was ranked 6th in the nation in biotech, 3rd in bioscience venture capital investments and 4th in the number of bioscience patents. The growth of biotechnology companies in the state between 2008 and 2011 were increased more than 50% to have more than 300 biotech companies. As of 2012, two of the top ten companies are based in New Jersey after Wyeth was acquired by New York-based firm, Pfizer in 2009. Stockpiling In emergency management, when government entities stockpile essential medicines to be used in case of major emergencies, it can be said to be restocking the nation's emergency medicine chest. An example of such stockpiles is Strategic National Stockpile in the United States.

Eventually Burggraf decided to create and paint full-time, and quit his job in order to enroll in the Cleveland Institute of Art. As a student, Burggraf embraced traditional studio practice and was inspired by the German Bauhaus of the 1930s, as well as the Op Art movement of the 1960s. After graduation in 1968, Burggraf moved to CA and began graduate studies in the Fine Arts at the University of California at Berkeley. Burggraf graduated from UC Berkeley in 1970, and immediately moved to Tallahassee, FL to join the faculty at Florida State University. While at FSU, he spent the next 37 years teaching, painting and sculpting. In 2007, Burggraf retired from teaching and turned his focus to studio work. Today, Burggraf continues to paint and sculpt at the Ray Burggraf Studio, and teaches visiting college students in his capacity as Emeritus Professor of Fine Arts at FSU.FSU Department of Art, News and Opportunities, FSU Art Students Visit Ray Burggraf's Studio,(http://news.art.fsu.edu/2012/09/fsu-art-students-visit-ray-burggrafs- studio/)  About his work  \\"Jungle Arc\\" by Burggraf. Acrylic paint on wood. (1998)The precise color gradations in Ray Burggraf's paintings are frequently mistaken as having been created by airbrush. In fact, Burggraf creates the distinctive coloring by brushing acrylic paints by hand,The Auburn Plainsman, Visiting artists lecture on different artistic styles, Du Fossat, Chris; Feb. 3, 2000; (http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/plainsman/archives/020300/020300ivisiting.html) using a specialized technique of Burggraf's invention. According to Ray Burggraf: Retrospective, by Roald Naasgard (2006), Burggraf describes the process of creating his color constructions as \\"a combination of an act of meditation and physically exacting exercise.\\" The paintwork must be completed quickly, and precisely, because acrylics can dry in minutes. Burggraf's earliest professional works, beginning around 1970, were primarily constructed on canvas. In the early 1980s, Burggraf transitioned to hand-crafted clusters of wood panels for the foundation of his color constructions. The panels allow Burggraf to add the dimension of time: moments in a day or week, and changes in light as it reveals or obscures land or seascapes. Burggraf modulates colors, contrasts soft and sharp edges, and experiments with interlocking forms that bulge or recede. Each color construction is designed to evoke multiple times and places; Burggraf uses blocks of color to take viewers on a visual journey through conventional atmosphere, and then bring them to Earth with a horizontal line, or horizon line, that re-asserts the landscape. One of the best examples of Burggraf's innovative technique may be The W, on display in 2008 at The Mary Brogan Museum of Art and Science as part of Smithsonian magazine's Museum Day presentation.Exhibits, Tallahassee Democrat, (Tallahassee.com), Sep 25, 2008, (http://www.tallahassee.com/article/20080926/ENT/809260317/Exhibits) While Burggraf's work is abstract, distinctive environmental themes are evident in his paintings and color constructions:FSU Institute for Energy Systems, Economics, and Sustainability Newsletter, FSU Artists Care About the Environment: In the world and in the IESES lobby, November 2009, Accessed March 2013, (http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs080/1102608159425/archive/1104082749610.html#LETTER.BLOCK13) \\"My abstract paintings and color constructions highlight Earth's light and atmosphere. With glowing, jewel-like colors, smooth gradations emerge to evoke the grandeur of breathtaking vistas. Thoughts of oceans and the blazes of sunsets burst into creation from paintings on thin, sinuously-shaped panels of wood. They are a succession of linked landscape scenes remembered. Florida coastal environs and perhaps even beach-culture airbrush art are strongly reflected in my work. Precise color gradations are my signature; they are hand brushed rather than sprayed. Visual excitement flows like music and builds like progressive architectural morphology. Here, technique and theory work together to bring the language of modernist abstraction into the realm of contemporary landscape.\\" (Ray Burggraf, 2010)  Public collections  In Search of Fresh Air.

It is known to have at least three planets orbiting around it. The outermost planet has a mass similar to Jupiter but orbits within the habitable zone. High resolution imaging observations of Kepler-68 carried out with the lucky imaging instrument AstraLux on the 2.2m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory detected a wide companion candidate approximately 11 arcseconds away. Comparing these observations to the Two Micron All-Sky Survey positions shows that the companions proper motion is consistent with it being bound to the Kepler-68 system, but further observations are needed to confirm this conclusion. Eleven arcseconds at the distance of Kepler-68 leads to a sky projected separation of approximately 1600 Astronomical units. A circular orbit at that distance would have a period of roughly 50,000 years. Planetary system Currently, three planets have been discovered to orbit around Kepler-68. Two of the innermost planets were discovered by the planetary transit method. Follow-up Doppler measurements helped to determine the mass of Kepler-68b and helped to discover Kepler-68d. There is an additional signal present in the radial velocity measurements indicating another body in the system at a period of greater than 10 years. The mass of this object is unknown and it could be either another planet or a stellar companion.

He became a division commander in the First French Empire under Napoleon and led troops in Italy and Spain. Seras is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe on Column 25. Italy 1799 Seras led a brigade in Louis Lemoine's division at the Battle of Novi on 15 August 1799. His brigade included two battalions each of the 20th and 34th Line Infantry Demi-Brigades and 3 squadrons of the 1st Hussar Regiment. In this sanguinary combat, the French suffered losses of 1,500 killed, 5,500 wounded, and 4,500 captured, along with 37 cannons and eight colors. The victorious Austro-Russian army lost 900 killed and 4,200 wounded, plus three guns and 1,400 men captured. Spain 1810 Seras was sent to Spain with a new 8,000-man division from France in spring 1810. The division consisted of the French 113th Line Infantry Regiment, two battalions of the Polish 4th Vistula Legion, the 4th Battalions of the French 12th Light, 32nd Line, and 58th Line Infantry Regiments, and four provisional battalions. Though the unit was nominally French, the 113th Line was recruited from Italians when the Grand Duchy of Tuscany was annexed to the French Empire. Seras joined Fran√ßois √âtienne de Kellermann's command in the Province of Le√≥n. Italy 1813 When Eug√®ne de Beauharnais reorganized the Army of Italy in the summer of 1813, Seras was appointed to command the Reserve Division. In August, the division consisted of three brigades and one battery of 6-pound field pieces. The 1st Brigade was made up of one battalion of the 14th French Light Infantry Regiment, two battalions of the 4th Provisional Croatian Regiment, and four battalions of the 1st Foreign Regiment. The 2nd Brigade comprised two battalions of the 2nd Foreign Regiment and one battalion each of the 6th French Line, 2nd Italian Light, 1st Italian Line, and 6th Italian Line. The 3rd Brigade had one battalion each of the 35th and 36th French Light, and the 131st, 132nd, and 133rd French Line. Seras was named governor of Venice in late 1813. He reported that he used French troops to repair the field works and make counterattacks because his Italian soldiers were prone to desertion as soon as they got outside the fortifications. Venice's powerful garrison was allotted enough provisions and supplies to hold out for six months. There were four zones of defense under Generals of Brigade Ren√© Joseph Dupeyroux, Dup√©r√®, Jean Jacques Schilt, and Charles Daurier. Dupeyroux held the coast from the Adige to the Malamocco River, Dup√©r√® defended the mouth of the Malamocco and several nearby villages, Daurier was responsible for the Venice itself, and Schilt patrolled the city's outskirts.

Advantages and disadvantages The sensor of the D7100 uses Nikon's DX format, resulting in a crop factor of 1.5x. Additionally the software enables an additional crop of 1.3x (resulting in approximately 1.95x compared to 35mm). Selecting this additional crop mode allows faster focusing in video mode and also enables interlaced video recording modes. This additional crop feature gives D7100 an advantage in using tele angle lens for shooting wildlife or things at a distance. The 51-area AF system sensors covers a bigger proportion of the extra 1.3 crop factor image area, which is important for capturing high-speed moving subjects during shooting.

He is the Grainger Distinguished Chair in Bioengineering, and Dean of the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Work in industry Prior to embarking on a highly successful academic career, he spend six years at National Semiconductor Corporation where he and his group developed and deployed three semiconductor analog process technologies (VIP3, VIP3H, and VIP4H) into manufacturing, and laid the foundations of two other RF BiCMOS technologies. His impactful contributions were acknowledged by multiple patents and achievement awards at National Semiconductor Corporation. Academia and research Prof. Bashir and his group has made pioneering contributions in the application of micro and nanotechnologies to biology and medicine. His most significant contributions have been in the development of electrically based biochip sensors, development of micro-mechanical sensors for biological detection, and development of 3D printing technologies for soft and biological materials. His work has had wide spread impact on utilization of BioMEMS technologies for diagnostic applications and micro-scale mechanical technologies for cellular characterization. He has had over 190 journal publications, over 200 conference presentations, posters, and abstracts, 37 patents, and over 115 invited talks. Specifically, his group is credited with the following accomplishments; (i) Prof. Bashir and his group has developed microscale devices with integrated dielectrophoretic filters for capture of bacteria and label free electrical sensing methods for subsequent detection of bacterial growth. These approaches can have important implications in clinical and pharmaceutical applications where determination of live and dead bacteria is the rate limiting step, and have significant applications in food safety and water testing (technology licensed to BioVitesse, Inc.). His group has developed a new lysate based impedance spectroscopy method where captured cells are lysed and the lysate is characterized electrically to determine the captured cell count. This method is more sensitive than ELISA but not requiring any labeling steps which are needed for ELISA. The work is the basis of a startup (Daktari, Inc.) and is being applied to detection of CD4+ white blood cells for the global health and detection of AIDS/HIV infection. Since then Prof. Bashir has improved the technique to perform counting of multiple cell types in microfluidic biochips from a drop of blood, and licensed to Prenosis, Inc. aiming to developing point of care cell counters. Also, his group contributed significantly to development of nanopore sensors for electrical detection of DNA molecules. They developed functionalized nanopore sensors to show selective detection of ssDNA molecules, and stacked graphene- dielectric nanopore sensors for detection of DNA and DNA-protein complexes. (ii) Prof. Bashir has also made pioneering contributions towards development of micro-mechanical sensors for biological applications. His group first demonstrated the development of nanometer scale thick cantilevers for detection of viruses and also demonstrated that attachment of proteins on these structures can affect their stiffness, which can affect their resonant frequencies. These studies also revealed fundamental insight into the adsorption of proteins on these structures is function of the area of the sensors, and these findings have significant impact on the design of nanoscale mechanical sensors. He extended this work to study physical properties of mammalian cell such their mass and stiffness. His group most recently developed micromechanical resonant mass sensors for the detection of cell mass versus time for single adherent cell mass and found that the cell growth rate increases with cell mass. (iii) Most recently, Prof. Bashir's group has had a series of articles (many of them as journal covers) that use 3D stereolithography and printing of hydrogel and polymer structures for applications in tissue engineering and biological machines. They demonstrated the cells remain viable and that these can be used to generate new blood vessels in-vivo with precise spatial control. They have also recently demonstrated printing of mm scale biological robots driven by cardiac cells and skeletal muscle cells and showed controlled directional motion. Work was highlighted in Popular Mechanics, The New York Times, Popular Science, CNN, and many other news venues. Research leadership Prof. Bashir has demonstrated his leadership skills by assembling and leading large national grants. He was PI on NSF IGERT on Cellular and Molecular Mechanics and Bionanotechnology at UIUC and PI on NIH Training Grant on Cancer Nanotechnology at UIUC. He is Campus Lead on NSF Science and Technology Center on Emergent Behavior of Integrated Cellular Systems (headquartered at MIT, with partners at Georgia Tech and UIUC) and a Member of the Executive Committee of the NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Engineering at Ohio State University. He also served on the external advisory board of the NIH- funded BioMEMS Resource Center at Harvard/MGH and the NIH-funded Center for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence at Stanford University. He is also co-thrust lead in a recently funded MERSEC at UIUC and Co-PI of an NSF Training Grant on Building Miniature Brain Machinery.

She is the daughter of former Vice President Jejomar Binay. Without any prior experience, Binay placed a bid for a seat in the Senate in the 2013 general elections and won placing fifth overall. After being elected, Binay chaired both the Cultural Communities and the Tourism Committees of the Senate in the 17th Congress. Binay was re-elected in the 2019 general election for a second consecutive term. Education Binay pursued her elementary and secondary education at St. Scholastica's College, Manila. She entered the University of the Philippines in June 1991 initially studying culinary arts and later earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Tourism from the University of the Philippines Diliman seven years later graduating in 1997. Political career Nancy Binay is the eldest daughter of the former Vice President of the Philippines, Jejomar C. Binay and Dr. Elenita Binay. Nancy Binay is also the older sister of Abigail Binay, the current mayor of Makati, and Jejomar Binay, Jr.e, former mayor of Makati. Between 1998 and 2001, she performed administrative duties as a personal assistant to her mother, liaising between the Mayor's office and other governmental departments and offices as well as with the private sector. From 2010 she has been functioning as personal assistant to her father, who is the Vice President at the time. In this role, she liaises between the Office of the Vice President and the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council, as well as with other local government offices. In 2012, she was listed as one of the top 20 potential senatorial candidates for the UNA. =Senate= On October 5, 2012 Binay replaced Joey de Venecia to run for senator for the 2013 elections. De Venecia had earlier withdrawn his candidacy from the UNA's ticket. Binay is a member of the same party as her father's coalition, the United Nationalist Alliance for which she was the Deputy Secretary General. Leading up to her selection as a senatorial candidate for the alliance, Binay consistently ranked in the top 12 in the Pulse Asia November 2012 survey which ranked the popularity of potential candidates. Binay is a child advocate. The charitable foundations with which she has been involved are geared towards caring for abandoned children and providing educational opportunities for the less fortunate. Her platform for the 2013 Senate elections is on improving the outlook for pregnant women, particularly those of poor economic status, as means of improving infant mortality and health. Binay has not attended any of the public debates for senatorial candidates, according to Prospero De Vera, \\"preferring to engage in debate when she's already in the Senate.\\" She was selected as the 12th senatorial nominee for the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA), and later won in the 2013 senatorial race and became a senatorial on the 16th Congress. 16th Congress Binay won in the 2013 senatorial elections, placing 5th place. She has been criticized for her silence on controversial issues regarding her father from 2013 to 2016, when her father Jejomar Binay, was the vice president of the Philippines, and her opposition to the anti-political dynasty bill as she is part of a political dynasty in Makati City, where her father, mother, and brother have become mayors. During the 16th Congress, she filed 119 bills and 151 resolutions advocating the interests of women and children, the youth, the elderly, and housing for the poor. Among her bills that passed into law were An Act Repealing the Crime of Premature Marriage under Article 251 of the Revised Penal Code (R.A. 10655), Sugarcane Industry Development Act of 2015 (R.A. 10659), and An Act Expanding the Benefits and Privileges of Persons with Disability (R.A. 10754). She also sponsored the passage of the Centenarians Act of 2016 (R.A. 10868). She aided in the presidential bid of her father during the 2016 Philippine presidential race. Her father, who initially placed 1st, eventually lost and placed 4th on election day. Binay has been cyber-bullied by numerous Filipino social media comedic accounts due to her fashion sense during the annual SONA and her natural Filipino skin color, to a point that she has been compared with the Black Nazarene. She retaliated stating, 'I was born this way. We should just accept who we are'. 17th Congress In the 17th Congress, Binay supported the Anti-discrimination bill based on SOGIE which protected the rights of Filipino LGBT citizens, the Mental Health Act which establishes a nationwide mental health campaign and inputting of mental health education in the Filipino educational system, the Department of Culture bill which aims to establish a holistic culture department, and the Free Higher Education Law which provides free education in all public colleges and universities in the Philippines. She was co-sponsor of the Expanded Maternity Leave Law of 2017 (SB No. 1305) which grants 120-day maternity leave to female workers regardless of civil status, and The Filipino Sign Language Act (SB No. 1455), which declares the Filipino Sign Language as the national sign language of the Filipino deaf and the official sign language of the government in all transactions with the deaf. She also advocated for the Expanded NIPAS Act of 2017 (SB No. 1444) which enlarged the cover of protected areas in the Philippines, the First 1000 Days of Life Bill (SB 1145), and the amendment to the Local Government Act providing for permanent positions to tourism officers (SB 1565). She was against the re-imposition of the death penalty, the 1,000 peso budget of the Commission on Human Rights, and amending of the 1987 Constitution via a constitutional assembly. Binay favors a constitutional convention over a constitutional assembly. During the Burial of Ferdinand Marcos controversy, Binay abstained. She has criticized the government for its deadly Philippine Drug War which has killed more than 14,000 Filipinos, government's Presidential Communications Operations Office and government- hired bloggers which have caused the surge in Filipino fake news, government's biased diplomacy with China, and the entrance of Chinese foreign ships in the Philippine Rise which was allowed by the President and his foreign affairs secretary. The House Speaker threatened senators who were not in favor of a constitutional assembly, nonetheless, Binay stood her ground and urged politicians to implement the Local Government Code effectively first before a constitutional change via constitutional convention can begin. In February, she urged government again to end contractualization, especially within government agencies. In March, Binay criticized the management of Boracay, and presidential palace for false alarming statements that caused public panic. She also supported the proposed anti-dynasty bill in the Senate, surprising many as she was against it during her first three years as senator. After the Quo warranto petition against Maria Lourdes Sereno that ousted the Chief Justice, Binay chose to not sign the resolution challenging Sereno's ouster, citing that she 'respect the separation of powers between the legislative and judiciary'. Binay backed the declaration of martial law in Mindanao in 2017 but left the Senate floor during the 2018 voting of the extension of martial law in the region, where majority voted in favor of extension. She was one of the senators who voted in favor of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act (TRAIN Law). Personal life Nancy Binay is married to Jose Benjamin Angeles, a construction and real estate businessman with whom she has four children. They reside in Barangay San Antonio, Makati City.

It is based in San Francisco. The company rates virtually every member of the National Association of Realtors in the United States, based on transaction and listing history. NeighborCity analyzes agents‚Äô performance based on closing rate, number of closings, number of active listings, geographic specialization, number of days on market, rate of dual agency, sales price per square foot, and the difference between ask and sale price, for the homes they sell. NeighborCity provides an evaluation of the quality of service delivered by agents, with respect to their clients‚Äô interests and relative to competing real-estate agents. The company also maintains a national database of real-estate listings. The site recommends corresponding independent buy-side real estate agents next to each for-sale listing along with a performance score and a link to a detailed professional profile for each recommended agent. History Jonathan Cardella founded NeighborCity in 2007, and he served as the company‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer. Ali Vahabzadeh was the President and Chief Operating Officer. The company is owned and operated by American Home Realty Network, Inc. (AHRN), a licensed California real estate brokerage. Business Model NeighborCity uses real-estate transaction and listing database information from national sources to construct its rankings. The company developed and uses AgentMatch, a system for matching private home buyers and sellers with agents based on the characteristics of the property for sale, including its location, price, and property type, and how they relate to the past experience and performance of the licensed real estate agents in that area. NeighborCity receives a portion of the commission earned by brokers on closed transactions that result from referrals.  Lawsuits over IP rights to listing data = NAR and MLS suits = In March 2012, shortly after NeighborCity provided the public performance rankings of National Association of Realtors members, Metropolitan Regional Information Systems filed a civil lawsuit against AHRN/NeighborCity claiming copyright violations by using MLS real estate listing information to craft its realtor-rating database. Northstar MLS of St. Paul, Minnesota, followed suit with similar litigation in April 2012. NeighborCity alleged that the suit was brought to prevent buyers and sellers from getting accurate information about the performance of individual brokers., and asserted that the lawsuits had no merit, stating that because the plaintiffs had failed to comply with requirements of the Copyright Act for copyright registration and that information for which the plaintiffs claimed ownership was not subject to copyright. Initial judicial opinions in both cases addressed the issue of what is subject to copyright protection. The court upheld NeighborCity‚Äôs claim in determining that the MLS listing data does not qualify for copyright protection because facts, including property features such as ‚Äúmain floor full bath‚Äù and ‚Äúwhirlpool,‚Äù are not protectable works to which the MRIS and Northstar MLS can claim ownership; however, the court found that photographs and property descriptive texts are likely to be copyrightable. In November 2013, a Maryland Federal District court found that NeighborCity ‚Äúadequately alleged‚Äù a conspiracy among multiple MLSs and the National Association of Realtors. = Berkshire Hathaway suit = In May 2013, Berkshire Hathaway filed a similar lawsuit against NeighborCity.com for reuse of photos from its (subsidiaries') listings without express permission. NeighborCity filed a countersuit claiming anti-competitive practices. AgentMatch dispute In November 2013, NeighborCity sent to realtor.com, operator of Move, Inc., a cease-and-desist letter alleging that Move‚Äôs AgentMatch tool infringed on NeighborCity‚Äôs trademark of the term ‚ÄúAgent Match‚Äù and that the tool potentially infringes on a 2010 patent application filed by NeighborCity.

As Richard Coates states in his review of the book, the book argues that 'language shift is essentially a symbolic change correlated with the changing relative status of the value-systems which each language symbolizes, and not a simple function of industrialization, urbanization or some other large-scale social change.' Gal co-wrote the book The Politics of Gender After Socialism (2000) with Gail Kligman, which won the 2001 Heldt Prize (awarded by the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies), and co-edited the anthology Reproducing Gender: Politics, Publics, and Everyday Life after Socialism with Kligman. These books examine the complex relationship between ideas and practices of gender and political economic change, taking the post- Soviet transition across a number of East Central European countries as case studies.

The surviving text covers only up to the end of sura 18, 'The Cave'; more material is quoted by later Imami scholars, for instance Tabrisi., 190 #390 on Q. 26:224. As of the 18th century, al-Majlisi and Al-Hurr al-Aamili were not aware of the complete text of Ayyashi's work. Similar to Tafsir Furat Kufi and Tafsir Qomi, this work is a collection of commentaries upon selected verses, not a unified commentary of the entire text. Many of its single-verse commentaries also exist, independently of  øAyyashi, in al-Kulayni's al-kafi and al-Hakim al-Hasakani's Shawahid al-tanzil. Many of these hadiths were taken from al-Sayyari's Kitab al-Qiraat; others, from the lost tafasir of Jabir ibn Yazid al-Ju øfi and Abu'l-Jarud Ziyad ibn al-Mundhir (technically a Zaydi, founder of the Jarudiyya). Correlation with the Shawahid hints at Sunni material as well.  øAyyashi avoids inclusion of his own point of view explicitly, but instead quotes related hadiths from the Imams and the past Shia scholars. p. 306. This commentary can be considered as the representative of Shia literature in the pre-Buyids era, when Shiite commentators \\"did not feel entitled to emit opinions or judgement of their own without support from hadiths going back to the Imams or other recognized Shia scholars\\". vol.4, part 2 p. 108  øAyyashi accepted hadiths that held that there had been alteration (tahrif) in the  øUthmanic mushaf of the Qur'an. He also was interested in apocalyptic material, which he brought to Q. 2:148, 155 (but not 243); 3:83; 6:158 (not 65); 8:39; 9:33; 11:8; 16:1; 17:4‚Äì8., 296.

His poetry combines themes of Creek folklore with an examination of intellectualism in the context of the Creek nation.. Oliver was born on April 9, 1904, in Coweta, Oklahoma, which at the time was still part of the Indian Territories; his parents died when he was young and he was raised by relatives in Okfuskee. He studied at the Euchee Indian School and then Bacone College;. unlike many of his contemporaries, he earned a high school diploma in 1926, an accomplishment that alienated some other Muscogee who accused him of \\"capitulating to the White Man's ways\\". While living among the Cherokee in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, in the early 1980s, Oliver joined a writing group that included several published authors, and moved away from the more classical European forms of poetry that he had been practicing until then. He became the author of two books of poetry, Caught in a willow net: poems and stories (Greenfield Review Press, 1983) and Chasers of the sun: Creek Indian thoughts (Greenfield Review Press, 1990).

Beginning \\"The Early Days 1980s\\"  At the beginning of the 1980s, West Berlin was still surrounded by the Berlin Wall. American hiphop had hardly been seen on the streets of Europe. But it changed suddenly. Nearly at the same time. And all over Europe's main cities like Berlin, Paris, London and Amsterdam. In Berlin The Denots Crew started with breakdance shows in a popular tourist place called Kudamm. And they painted the first street art on the Berlin Wall in 1983 which became the original East Side Gallery later on. In 1986 Denots Crew met up with Keith Haring while he had painted a 100 m section of the Berlin Wall. Denots Crew continued experimentally and started the integration of American HipHop culture into Berlin's youth. Just like other pioneers of Europe's hiphop culture like Mode2 in London, Niels Shoe Meulman in Amsterdam and Ash (artist) from the Bad Boys Crew in Paris.  Denots Crew Today  Since the early 1990s most of the Denots Crew members are involved in various social or commercial projects worldwide. Many of the original denots Crew artworks are still extant, inside and outside Berlin. For example: A segment of the Berlin Wall on display at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, 2004 Art by Kaos. A Berlin Wall art relic in Bedok Reservoir Park in Singapore. 2010 Artist: Kaos. Today the Denots Crew is named and known as the pioneers of the Berlin hiphop scene.

It was published by Houghton-Mifflin. Plot From the Kirkus reviewKirkus review. of the book: \\"Raymond Kaiser, his wife Jewel, and her daughter from a previous marriage, RV, all quietly enjoy life in Biloxi, Miss., a \\"simple, easy, cheap\\" town on the Gulf Coast. With work as an architect drying up, Ray finds himself increasingly interested in the glitzy world of offshore gambling, especially at the Paradise, where Jewel wins over $1,000 on their first trip. In their daily life, \\"everything's dull\\", so it is no wonder that Jewel and Ray enjoy the visceral excitement of gambling. They soon graduate from slots to the blackjack table, and slowly find themselves down by over $4,000. Meanwhile, back home, RV seems headed into a downward spiral of teen rebellion--boy trouble, substance experimenting, and body piercings. It doesn't help that her parents are largely absent, spending their nights at Paradise. When Ray's father dies, it sends him further into a midlife crisis. He comes to see himself no longer as \\"an ordinary guy\\", but as a full-time gambler. The problem is--he's not very good at it. Spending 18 hours at a time in the casino does nothing but increase his debts. Maxing out a handful of credit cards, he finds himself over $35,000 in the hole, but still juiced by \\"the losses, the excitement, the hopes, the desperation, the high\\". Quitting architecture altogether, Ray and Jewel decide to downsize, selling their belongings and moving in with Ray's mother. In their new simplicity, this besieged family finally finds that happiness is not in middle-class stability, nor in the quick fix of gambling's artificial Paradise, but in their everyday Edenic lives.

The company operates in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York City, Washington, D.C., Iowa, and New Hampshire. The firm was founded in October 2012 by Adam Swart. Services The firm sells services that allow clients to simulate a celebrity lifestyle. Its \\"Celebrity Shopping Experience\\" is a trip through town in a luxury car, with cheering fans and paparazzi at every stop. The service was the subject of a Good Morning America piece in which a correspondent pretended to be the King of Liechtenstein while he went through a shopping mall with a paid entourage. The company also carries out publicity stunts for companies and public relations firms using actors. Swart claims that he has the most \\"crowd actors\\" in cities where real actors tend to try to make it‚ÄîNew York and L.A.‚Äîbut has actors available in political hotspots such as Iowa and New Hampshire as well. Just before the November 2012 election, company founder Swart said that the company was considering a request by a candidate for a staged political protest. According to an article in the New York Post, Anthony Weiner paid Crowds on Demand actors to attend campaign rallies during his 2013 campaign for mayor of New York City. Criticism Crowds on Demand has come under criticism for selling the pretense of fame and popularity. Elizabeth Currid- Halkett, an associate professor at the University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy, criticized the company for deceiving the public. A Washington Post columnist mentioned an e-mail he received advertising the company's \\"Celebrity Arrival Service\\" offered to politicians: The service has been characterized as astroturfing. Dan Schneider, writing for The Atlantic, said \\"There might be some gray area between offering a small token of appreciation to otherwise voluntary supporters and full-blown astroturfing, but spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars to prop up a struggling cause seems to fit more squarely in the latter category.\\" Schneider also noted that Swart admitted \\"a revelation that a campaign is paying for supporters is deeply embarrassing, and he takes great pains to keep his clients‚Äô identities a secret.\\" According to a February 2016 report for NBC Los Angeles, a paid protester claimed to be \\"a concerned citizen\\" when speaking out against a planned development in a city council meeting for Camarillo, California in 2015. He later stated to reporters that his role \\"was scripted, they told me what to say.\\" Swart claimed the company has \\"worked with dozens of campaigns for state officials, and 2016 presidential candidates\\" but declined to identify his clients for fear of losing future business. Public records identified only one campaign, for the Six Californias, had paid Crowds on Demand. In May 2018, the outfit made New Orleans news as word got out that energy firm Entergy had used \\"astroturfing\\" tactics - paid actors - to speak at a March city council hearing in support of a proposed controversial natural gas power plant, and in opposition to solar and wind power. In August 2018 Crowds on Demand was included in an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver about astroturfing. In October 2018, Zdenƒõk Bakala filed suit in federal court in South Carolina, alleging Crowds on Demand attempted to extort millions of dollars from him.

Four members of the Ding familyProfessor Jifeng \\"Jeff\\" Ding, his wife Helen Chui and their daughters Xing and Alicewere found murdered at their home in Wootton at 6:00 pm on Sunday, 1 May 2011. They were thought to have been murdered two days earlier between about 3:00 pm and 4:00 pm on Friday, 29 April 2011the day of the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton which was an additional Public Holiday in the United Kingdom. Northamptonshire Police named Anxiang Du, a businessman from Coventry who had been involved in a legal dispute with the Ding family, as the prime suspect in the case. Du fled the murder scene in the Ding's rented car; he drove to London and travelled to Paris by coach. He continued through France, Spain and finally to Morocco, prompting a worldwide manhunt. He lived in a partly built block of flats for 14 months before he was arrested and extradited to the UK. Du was tried at Northampton Crown Court in November 2013. He was found guilty of the murders and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 40 years. Background The Ding family were of Chinese descent: Professor Jifeng \\"Jeff\\" Ding, his wife Helen Chui and their two daughters Xing (aged 18) and Alice (aged 12). Alice and Xing were talented musicians. Xing had excelled in school and 'has now been awarded four posthumous A* grades [at A-level] in Chemistry, Classic Latin, Mathematics and Biology, after the exams boards used her existing work to predict the grades she would have achieved'. She had already accepted an offer from the University of Nottingham to study Medicine in the autumn. They were all stabbed to death at their home in Pioneer Close, part of the re-developed Royal Pioneer Corps' Simpson Barracks in Wootton, a modern suburb of Northampton just over south of the town centre. Anxiang Du was a businessman who had run a Chinese herbal remedy shop in Birmingham with the Dings. Since 1999, he and his wife had been engaged in a ten-year legal dispute with the Dings after their partnership failed. He faced a legal bill of around ¬£88,000 after losing his final appeals. On 28 April 2011, Du was served with a court order preventing him from disposing of his assets. Timeline At 10:44 am on 29 April 2011, Anxiang Du boarded a train from Coventry to Birmingham, carrying a knife and his passport, after leaving his family a farewell note. He boarded another train in Birmingham and travelled to Northampton. From Northampton town centre, Du travelled by bus to Wootton, arriving there at around 1:35 pm. Du killed the Ding family around two hours later at around 3:30 pm. The murders took place at the Dings' house in Pioneer Close, Wootton Fields. Du stabbed Jeff and Helen Ding to death in their kitchen before going upstairs to find the two girls, Xing and Alice, in a bedroom. Du stabbed Jeff 23 times, Helen 13 times, Xing 11 times and Alice 4 times. During the attacks a 999 call, during which the screams of both girls could be heard, was made from Alice Ding's mobile telephone at 3:32 pm. The call was mishandled by Northamptonshire Police, which sent officers to a different address. The call was considered closed when nothing was found there. Du stole the family's car; at 09:43 pm that evening he stopped at junction 15a services on the M1 motorway where he bought a map of Northamptonshire. He tried to call upon another former business partner who lived in the county, but he was not at home. From there, Du drove to London. As the car entered the capital, automatic number plate recognition cameras failed to detect the car. He abandoned the Dings' car in St. John's Wood, where it remained for eleven days and accrued nine parking tickets. On 30 April, Du bought a one-way coach ticket to Paris using his own passport. Sometime that day, his wife reported him missing. On 1 May, at 8:00 am, police called at the Dings' house looking for Du, but left when nobody answered the door. The Dings' bodies were discovered by a neighbour later that day. Du travelled through France and Spain, and took a ferry from Algeciras to Tangier in Morocco. He travelled onwards to Oujda near the border with Algeria, where he was arrested as a suspected illegal immigrant. Moroccan police released him because they could not determine his identity and were unaware that he was wanted in the UK. Du remained in Morocco for a further 14 months; in mid-2012, Northamptonshire Police announced they believed he was in that country. A photograph of Du was printed in a local newspaper and a construction worker recognised him. A man believed to be Du was found living in a partly built block of flats where he slept on a makeshift bed and cooked food on a small gas-powered stove. He was arrested on 7 July 2012. Police officers visited Madrid and believe their inquiries there \\"played a significant part in the suspect's apprehension\\". Officers made a formal application for extradition with the Home Office, although there was no formal extradition arrangement with Morocco. On 10 July 2012, it was confirmed that the arrested man was chief suspect Anxiang Du. On 19 July 2012, a 54-year-old woman in Coventry, a woman aged 39 in Gloucester, a 22-year-old woman in Southend and a man aged 25 in London were arrested. They were all held on suspicion of conspiracy to assist an offender and were bailed until a later date. =Extradition and trial= On 20 February 2013, Anxiang Du was extradited to the UK with the approval of the Moroccan Ministry of Justice working with the British Home Office. Du appeared in the Magistrates' court at Northampton on 21 February 2013 and was charged with the murders of the Ding family. He was remanded in custody and appeared at Northampton Crown Court the following day. A provisional trial date was set for 5 August 2013 and was expected to last 10 days. Du was next due to appear in Northampton Crown Court on 7 May 2013 for a plea and case management hearing. This was moved to Nottingham on 10 May 2013.Northampton Chronicle & Echo: Ding murders accused back in court 27 February 2013 ‚Äì accessed 28 February 2013 It was later reported that the trial date could be changed to 29 July 2013 following information on the availability of experts.Northampton Chronicle & Echo: Du trial could be brought forward ‚Äì 7 March 2013 However, when Du made his plea and case management hearing on 10 May 2013, a Mandarin interpreter failed to arrive at the court. The plea and case management hearing was then re-set for July with a trial due to begin on 12 November 2013. On 18 July 2013 Du appeared at Northampton Crown Court but only spoke to confirm his name. No plea could be heard at the hearing as tests were still being conducted. He was expected to appear before the court again on 17 October to enter a plea but this was postponed until 4 November when Du denied four counts of murder.Northampton Chronicle & Echo, 17 October 2013 The trial started on 12 November 2013.Northampton Chronicle & Echo, 25 July 2013 The jury was sent out to consider its verdict on 26 November and returned to court around midday on 27 November finding Du guilty of the murder of the four members of the Ding family. On 28 November 2013 Du, aged 54 at the time, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 40 years. In June 2014 it was reported that Du was to appeal his minimum 40-year term. The appeal was rejected with the statement that the trial judge's approach could not be faulted and that even more draconian whole-life tariffs had been upheld in other cases of whole families being murdered ‚Äì including that of Jeremy Bamber.

The purpose of the exercise was to reclaim land for farming, mainly in Nanyang, Luoyang, Shangqiu and Zhoukou. The government of Henan Province announced that it had levelled more than two million graves to create fields covering 30,000 mu (~18.43 km2). After media reports caused great controversy, supporters commented that it was a worthwhile project, while opponents said it was \\"a foul action.\\"  Cultural background  According to Chinese tradition, dead ancestors are honored each year during the Qingming festival as a display of Confucian \\"filial piety\\". The destruction of ancestral graves is therefore viewed as abhorrent by the majority of Chinese people.  Implementation  In the spring of 2012, while inspecting the city of Nanyang, Henan Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Lu Zhangong observed many graves scattered across farmland. As a result, he issued instructions that launched a project to remove the graves. Zhao Keluo put forth a motion at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) objecting to the digging up of graves and demanded the work be stopped. However, the secretary of Henan province Shi Jichun criticized him as this \\"caused serious negative impact\\". On July31, Lu Zhangong issued documented instructions: Grave levelling activity began, and spread from Zhoukou city to the rest of Henan province. In Shangshui County, Fugou County, Xiangcheng City and other locations, school hours were curtailed in support of the project and a speech contest held. Ancestral graves of government officials were designated protected by cemetery and cultural relics protection units. Villagers were instructed to dig out graves and received 200 yuan per site while village officials were instructed to take the lead or be removed.

It is within the locality of Madura and the Eyre Highway runs along the boundary of the station. Description The station occupies an area of approximately or 1.75 million acres ‚Äì making it larger than the nation of Brunei ‚Äì in the remote south east of Western Australia. It is the second largest sheep station in Australia, after Rawlinna and is currently owned by CC Cooper & Co. In 1927, the extent of the Madura Station was reported as two million acres. The station has a carrying capacity of 58,000 sheep, which are merinos raised for their wool. The company employed eight staff in 2012 working under the supervision of the station manager, Matt Haines. The land is mostly gently undulating calcareous plains with eucalypt‚Äìmelaleuca‚Äìmyall woodlands and chenopod shrubland interspersed with saltbush shrubland and bindii grassland. Many caves can be found amongst the limestone bedrock of the Nullarbor Plain. History The traditional owners of the area are the Mirning people, whose territory stretched across the Nullarbor and into South Australia. Europeans settled the area in 1876 to breed horses, which were sent to India to be used by the British Army. The first recorded lease encompassing the old homestead was by G.Heinzmann for a period of one year; the lease was not renewed for 1878. The station underwent significant improvements through 1884, including the addition of fencing and water tanks. Bores were sunk and brackish water was found and then drilled through in the hope of finding permanent freshwater. In 1888 the Madura Squatting and Investment Company was floated to raise ¬£100,000 capital to take over the leasehold, and many surrounding blocks to have a total usable area of over 4 million acres or . The property included a good homestead and a well provisioned store. The property had been recently depastured and was only carrying 800 merino ewes and a few horses. The Ponton brothers and John Sharp were the next to take up the lease in 1898, when the property was known as Clifton Downs Station. A rabbit plague swept through the area and continued westward in 1901. William Ponton reported that millions of rabbits were already between Eucla and Nullarbor. Shortly afterward Mr A. J. Talbot took over the property, along with Mundrabilla Station. Talbot was also raising mostly cattle along with horses as well as a small herd of camels at Madura. The artesian bores were pumping per day from a depth of to water stock. Cattle from Madura were routinely being overlanded to the Kalgoorlie saleyards. In 1927 the Madura Pastoral and Settlement Company successfully acquired 5 million acres around Madura Station with the intention of developing it for settlement. The company wanted the federal government to spend ¬£100,000 on dog-proof fencing and water boring to make over 15 million acres of land able to carry an additional one million sheep that would be able to produce an additional 30,000 bales of wool. The station changed hands at some point around the same time and was owned by Mr Charles Bowen from 1927 to 1932 when he became ill and was no longer able to operate the rationing depot for the department of Aboriginal Protection. Several hundred brumbies were roaming Madura station in 1933 along with a substantial herd of wild cattle. The station owners erected trap and stockyards at an artesian bore that had been flowing continuously for 28 years. Other men from the district had come and had caught over 300 of the horses which were taken and sold. The bore was also a stopping place for overlanders with the warm water making it a popular bathing place. The area experienced heavy rains in 1934 resulting in boggy roads under of water. The station manager, Mr W O'Donovan had to be evacuated by an emergency flight by Goldfields Airways using a new Fox Moth airplane when he was dangerously ill in 1935. A doctor was on board and O'Donovan was flown to Kalgoorlie for treatment. O'Donovan died the following day as a result of an internal haemorrhage. The acting manager and former stockman, Michael O'Brien, was charged with cattle stealing in 1937. O'Brien had taken 102 cattle to Loongana and put another brand on them before selling them, he defended himself saying that the Melbourne based company had not paid him any wages since the death of O'Donovan. In 1939 flooding occurred in areas around the station and Madura recorded of rain filling dams and weirs. Strong winds blew down many trees causing problems on roads in the area. The station had been the target of thieves and vandals in 1940 prompting the station owners wife to carry a revolver whenever her husband was away. Sign-posts and water tanks had been damaged, articles had been stolen and even the homestead had been burnt down by a party of overlanders. The manager at the time, Robert Mackie, was often away overlanding himself and often reported on the road conditions in the area, particularly the Madura Pass. 1941 saw heavy rains in the area with of rain being recorded at the homestead. Mackie reported that of the pass being washed away making it impossible for even camels to traverse. Four young men were arrested at Madura in 1947 after they stole a car in Norseman, some to the west of Madura, and made for the South Australian border before their car broke down near the homestead. They fled into the bush but were found by Aboriginal trackers and apprehended by police. The station was gripped by drought in 1948 with 400 cattle dying as a result of lack of feed. The remaining herd of about 500 was to be driven to Loongana to look for feed and water. Rumours were rife in the press that the station had been abandoned in 1949, after several travellers found dead crows and rabbits around the homestead. Mackie denied the claims saying he was in Kalgoorlie for an extended business trip. Later the same year the Reverend Sopher, his wife and five children arrived at Madura to set up a home and school for Aboriginal children under the auspices of the Australian Aborigines Evangelistal Mission. A few months later Mrs Sopher was badly burnt when a spark from the oven set her dress alight, she then had to endure the long trip to Norseman hospital for treatment. In 1950 the mission was issued a writ claiming damages for breach of contract on behalf of Madura Ltd. concerning the sale of the station to the mission. Later the same year Mackie began to convert the homestead into a stopping place following six years of drought. Although some heavy rains had fallen they were too far apart to be of any use and the station had virtually no stock left on it. Petrol pumps were installed and the homestead was converted to a motel-hotel, with a liquor licence granted later the same year. Mackie was taken to hospital in 1951 with heart troubles and the station was sold later the same year to a group of developers who were to turn the area into a tourist resort. In the 1960s the Birmingham family (Charlie Carter's grocery chain) held the lease, and the station manager was Brian O'Connor - brother of the politician Ray O'Connor. The Jumbuck Pastoral Company acquired Madura in 1987, adding it to the neighbouring Moonera and began sub-dividing large paddocks and installing extra windmills and water points. Matt Haines was appointed manager in 2011; in the same year 30,000 sheep were shorn producing 850 bales of wool. This followed a good season where the property received of rain, nearly double the annual average. In 2012 a fire burned for three days near Madura covering the Eyre Highway in smoke. Over of bushland was consumed by the blaze. Madura Plains Station was purchased by CC Cooper & Co, Jamestown, South Australia from Jumbuck Pastoral in February 2016 for 10 million.

Its temperature is ‚àí0.49 ¬∞C, below 0 ¬∞C because of the high pressure. Lake Whillans, like the Whillans Ice Stream, is named for Ohio State University glaciologist Dr. Ian Whillans. Discovery The lake was first described in 2007 by Helen Fricker, a glaciologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Satellite laser altimeter data from NASA's ICESat had revealed the ice at that location rising and falling, leading her team to conclude the presence of the lake. Research On 28 January 2013, the Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) team announced that they had reached the lake surface having drilled through the ice above. Drilling was accomplished using a hot-water drill to create a borehole in diameter. Over the following days the team collected water samples and also sediment cores from the lake bottom. Initial analysis of water and sediment has revealed that they contain more than 3,900 kinds of microbial life. Bacteria are surviving in this environment without photosynthesis. The ecosystem is apparently based on the oxidation of ammonia and methane from sediments laid down at least 120,000 years ago. According to WISSARD, the project ‚Äúmarks the first successful retrieval of clean whole samples from an Antarctic subglacial lake‚Äù. Similar efforts have been undertaken at Lake Vostok, where samples have yet to yield any discoveries, and at Lake Ellsworth, where drilling had to be abandoned. These projects may yield insights into the search for life elsewhere in the Solar System. In particular, the moons Europa (Jupiter) and Enceladus (Saturn) have large amounts of liquid water beneath icy crusts. In January 2015, drilling near the grounding line (transition point from fresh water to sea water) revealed a colony of fish, crustaceans, and jellyfish inhabiting the dark, frigid waters below the ice shelf.

It aired on Fox in the United States on March 10, 2013, and is written by Wellesley Wild and directed by John Holmquist. In the episode, when Peter loses everything in a lawsuit, Lois gets a job. She starts working on a phone sex line, and ends up with Peter as a client. Plot Chris builds a birdhouse he built based on an episode of Benson and Peter becomes interested in attracting birds. Chris wants the birds to reenact the Benson episode \\"Conflict of Interest.\\" A falcon sweeps in and snatches the smaller birds. Peter decides to become a falconer. He acquires a falcon, which he names Xerxes and trains to fetch him things. As Peter sets off to take Xerxes to the park, they spot a couple on a motorcycle with a sidecar, and uses Xerxes to hijack the motorcycle and steal it. He ends up losing everything, including Xerxes, when the motorcycle owner files a lawsuit against him. Lois berates him for losing everything, and is forced to get a job. Waiting at the employment agency, a man named Randy offers her voice work. She believes she will be appearing on television and in movies, but when she gets to the office, she finds it is a phone sex operation. Despite her reservations, she is lured by the money and decides to give it a try. She finds herself answering calls for most of the men in town and returns home exhausted and not in the mood for sex. At the Drunken Clam, Peter complains to Joe and Quagmire about not having sex. Quagmire gives him the number for his favorite phone sex service. Later at home, Peter calls the line. Lois answers and quickly figures out that it is Peter. She entertains him, and he becomes attracted to her voice without realizing who it is. Later, Lois asks about his day and tries to get some thoughts out of him about his experience. Peter calls the sex line again later and asks for a date. Lois objects because he is married, but begrudgingly agrees, and later confides in her friend Bonnie. At the Drunken Clam, Peter tells Joe and Quagmire about wanting to meet his phone sex woman, and the guys warn him against it. Peter wants to go through with it regardless. Lois sees Peter dressed up to go out. He makes up a story about going out of town, leaving Lois depressed and angry. She dresses up too, but disguised, and goes out to meet Peter. Peter opens up to her, not knowing it is Lois, and goes ahead and has sex with her, still unaware of who she is. Eight hours later, an angry Lois reveals the truth. Despite being shocked and appalled that Lois was doing phone sex, Peter admits that he somehow did know it was Lois on the phone, which proves to him that they were true soul-mates and he really did love her. He admits he ran up a phone bill of $7,000. Peter and Lois completely gross out Chris and Meg with their show of affection. However, Stewie watches Peter and Lois having sex and asks if they can have a threesome. Reception The episode received a 2.7 rating in the 18-49 demographic and was watched by a total of 5.27 million viewers. This made it the most watched show on Fox's Animation Domination line-up that night, beating The Simpsons, American Dad!, Bob's Burgers and The Cleveland Show. The episode was met with polarized reviews from critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C‚Äì, saying \\"'Call Girl' is all the more disappointing because every wrong step with the phone sex plot underscores that there‚Äôs a potentially great episode somewhere in there, but it requires changing most of the main plot and the unearned thematic resolution.

It is a Gram-negative, rod- shaped bacterium (bacillus), which causes a gastrointestinal disease called salmonellosis, characterized by cramping and diarrhoea. It is typically considered a microbe of cold-blooded animals, unlike other members of the genus, and is most frequently associated with reptiles. It was discovered in 1966 from a lizard in the city of Bongor, Chad, from which the specific name bongori was derived. After decades of controversy in Salmonella nomenclature, it gained the species status in 2005. Pathogenicity and epidemiology S. bongori is classically regarded as the Salmonella of lizards. However, discrete investigations contradict the notion of strict host-specificity, as reports emerged of occurrence in dogs and birds. In animals, unlike those of other Salmonella, infection is generally asymptomatic and does not cause discernible effects. However, infection of pet animals is associated with diarrhea. Further, human infections have been substantiated, with conclusive reports from Italy. The majority of these cases are among children less than 3 years old, who are more prone to oral contact with animal droppings. Symptoms are typified by diarrhoea with fever and acute enteritis. The first observations, from Messina and Palermo, starting from late 1984, were followed by other cities in Sicily. Origin and evolution Originally S. bongori was considered to be a subspecies within the genus Salmonella. However, based on DNA similarity, all members of Salmonella are now grouped into only two species, namely S. bongori and S. enterica. Species of Salmonella are closely related to E. coli and they are estimated to have diverged from a common ancestor about 100 million years ago; their genomes still display significant similarity, hence many functional identities. Many of the genes which are unique to Salmonella serovars, compared to E. coli, are found on large discrete genomic islands such as Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs). These Salmonella-specific functions include many genes for their virulence and characterize the divergence of S. enterica from S. bongori. For instance, the SPI-2 gene which encodes type III secretion systems present in S. enterica is absent in S. bongori. Also, the virulence determinants, specifically effector proteins, are indicated to be more closely related to enteropathogenic E. coli because some of the gene are missing in S. enterica.

But this has not stopped him from pursuing his dream: to travel around the world, and to do it his way: without money, without companions, without luggage. He sets off from home armed with nothing but his imagination and his courage. Little World takes us along on his greatest challenge yet: to reach the exact opposite side of the planet. Is it possible to cross the earth in these conditions? Mixing home video techniques and traditional documentary methods, we get to know this young man, his love story, his philosophy of life and his parents' approach to raising him. We will see how Albert and his girlfriend, Anna, go from Barcelona to a remote lighthouse in New Zealand, or how they fail in the attempt. The journey (and the film) can be considered sheer madness, an endearing romance or an epic adventure, or perhaps a little of everything. The director of the film is Marcel Barrena and is produced by Umbilical Produccions with TV3, TVE, ICAA, ICEC, and Corte y Confecci√≥n de Pel√≠culas.  Awards and reviews  Little World has won on IDFA from Amsterdam (DOC U Award), one of the most prestigious documentary festival, where also got the third place on the audience award among 300 films participating.

Background As of December 31, 2004, the International Maritime Organization established a regulation requiring automatic identification system (AIS) transponders to be installed onboard seagoing vessels. Concept Even though the AIS gives every ship the means to track other ships, they are not able to deduce the intentions of other vessels given only information from the AIS. STM seeks to create an organized traffic management entity called Sea Traffic Coordination Center(STCC) that will act as a central hub maintaining a record of all vessels at sea using the AIS and/or radar, enabling the distribution of vessel routes between ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore. The STCC together with the AIS and/or radar allows: * route plans with regards to weather and geospatial limitations or vessel-related requirements can be readily generated. * planned routes to be automatically monitored, allowing appropriate actions to be executed should the vessel stray off-course. * collisions to be prevented as sharing of vessel coordinates allow routes to be modified with ease. * ships can be offered pilot assistance in difficult-to-maneuver areas or whenever requested by the captain. * captains are able to make educated navigation decisions in highly trafficked areas as data of the surrounding environment is readily distributed throughout the network. Definition # The aggregation of the seaborne and shore-based functions (sea traffic services, maritime space management, and sea traffic flow management) required to ensure the safe and efficient movement of vessels during all phases of operation. # The dynamic, integrated management of sea traffic and maritime space (including sea traffic services, management of the maritime space and sea traffic flow management)‚Äîsafely, economically and efficiently‚Äîthrough the provision of facilities and seamless services in collaboration with all parties and involving seaborne and shore-based functions. Integration of the whole maritime logistics chain  STM seeks to create safe, efficient and environmentally friendly sea voyages. In order to utilize the full potential of STM, it must be developed to take into consideration the operations carried out at ports and beyond. Ports operations and the efficiency of which, are important factors in the performance of the transportation system as a whole. STM can contribute greatly to this area as it was conceived with an emphasis on efficient collaboration between operations at sea and on land. Ports must smoothly coordinate ships reaching port, departing from the port as well as the loading and discharging of ships in relation to inbound and outbound transportation. This means that sea voyages must be in synchronization with port operations such that ship arrivals can be accurately predicted and prepared for. In STM the ambition is to enable this level of operation coordination by improving situational awareness through information sharing. The information needed may be included in the standardized route exchange protocol developed.

Native to the Lebombo Mountains of South Africa, the species was first described in 1949 by the South African botanist Inez Verdoorn. It is commonly known as the Lebombo cycad, although the name is also used for Encephalartos senticosus which also occurs in the same locality. Description Encephalartos lebomboensis has a trunk that is up to tall and thick; though the trunk is usually unbranched, suckers often form at the base and it sometimes bears offsets part way up. Often a number of stems form a clump. The crown of pinnate leaves are stiff, each having a mid to dark green glossy upper surface and paler under side. They are densely hairy at first but soon become hairless. They are long and wide, straight or slightly arched, either flat or with a slight keel. The leaflets are lanceolate and have serrated edges. They are up to long and wide, held at right angles to the rachis and slightly overlapping. Near the base of the leaves, the leaflets are reduced to prickles. E. lebomboensis is a dioecious species, that is, with separate male and female plants. Male specimens have one, or rarely two, short-stalked yellowish-orange cylindrical cones long and wide. Female specimens have one or rarely two barrel-shaped cones, long and wide, which are yellowish-green in colour. The seed coats are glossy red. Distribution Encephalartos lebomboensis has two separate populations, one in the vicinity of Mananga in Mpumalanga province in South Africa and a southern population centred on Piet Retiefion in the upper Pongola River Valley. It is a very rare and endangered species and grows in sunny positions on cliffs and steep, rocky slopes among sparse vegetation. This region has hot, fairly wet summers and cool, dry winters with frequent mists. It is also native to Mozambique and Eswatini. Taxonomy The form of this cycad found in the southern locality differs in certain characteristics from that growing in its northern enclave and it is considered to be a separate species, Encephalartos senticosus. In 1996 E. senticosus was split from E. lebomboensis.Threatened Plant Conservation Unit (2004) A Management Plan For Cycads In Kwazulu-Natal. Biodiversity Conservation Advice Division, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. Available at: http://www.cycadsg.org/pages/publications.htm The Cycad Pages (January, 2010) The main differences between the two are in the number, size and form of the male and female cones. Status There are believed to be about 5,000 specimens of Encephalartos lebomboensis growing in the wild. It is a popular species with plant collectors and the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists it as being \\"Endangered\\" because of its over-exploitation and the degradation of its habitat due to the encroachment of agricultural land. It is listed in Appendix I of the CITES Appendices. It is widely available as a cultivated plant.

She was a sister of polar researcher Gunnar Isachsen. After attending Ragna Nielsen's School from 1891 to 1893 she took her examen artium at Gjertsen School. She enrolled in medicine studies at the Royal Frederick University, at a time when this was still highly unusual for women, and graduated with the cand.med. degree in 1900. She was a medical candidate at Rikshospitalet and Kristiania Municipal Hospital from 1901 to 1902 (together with fellow pioneer Kristine Munch), became interested in women's diseases and studied gynecology in Edinburgh in 1902. Munch accompanied her, but studied different subjects. From 1903 Munch and Isachsen were running their own clinic in Kristiania. From 1908 to 1911 Isachsen was an assistant of Norway's first gynecologist Emil Rode, and studied gynecology abroad again in 1909, this time in Giessen and Berlin. From 1910 to 1927 she was an assistant of birth doctor Christian Kielland in Kristiania, running the clinic during his numerous stays abroad.

Their authors included Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel and Immanuel Kant. In 1867 they purchased Verlagsbuchhandlung from Edward Eggers, moved to Berlin and shifted the emphasis to natural sciences. Carl Robert Thost, one of the 34 founding members of the German Palaeontological Society (\\"Pal√§ontologische Gesellschaft\\"), strengthened the publisher's board in 1895. The publisher is notable before WWII for its monographs, e.g. K√∂ppen and Wegeners seminal work about the Climates of the past (1923), which is still relevant to climate science today. After World War II, they relocated to Nikolassee. In 1968 the owners of E. Schweizerbart took over the publisher, and moved to Stuttgart where they cooperate with sister publisher but the publishers, whilst affiliated, remain formally independent. In 1986, the company acquired the botanical publisher J. Cramer (whose titles include Dissertationes Botanicae and Bibliotheca Phycologica), which continues to operate as an imprint in the Gebr.

She was among the first female physicians in Norway. She was born in Horten as a daughter of priest Johan Storm Munch (1827‚Äì1908) and Kaja Michaeline Falch (1830‚Äì1898). She had seven siblings, and was a granddaughter of poet Johan Storm Munch, Sr. and a niece of poet and playwright Andreas Munch. She was a second cousin of painter Edvard Munch, and historian Peter Andreas Munch was a cousin of her father. She took her examen artium in 1893, enrolled in medicine studies at the Royal Frederick University at a time when this was uncommon for women, and graduated with the cand.med. degree in 1900. She was a medical candidate at Kristiania Municipal Hospital from 1901 to 1902 (together with fellow pioneer Louise Isachsen). They both travelled to Edinburgh in 1902; Munch to study pediatrics and internal medicine. From 1903 the two ran their own clinic in Kristiania, first located in M√∏llergaten and later at St. Olavs plass. From 1908 they were also assistants at Our Lady's Hospital. In the 1920s she had connections to various medical institutions, retiring in 1936. Between 1919 and 1928 Munch conducted several study trips to the United States, Germany, France, Austria and Italy. With their Christian attitude towards life, Munch and Isachsen worked together to limit abortus provocatus, in articles and public speeches. The two also founded three organizations for women; the Women Students' Choral Society (1895), the Women Students' Christian Association (1897) and the Medical Women's Association (1921). In these three organizations she was a board member until 1925, board member until 1912 and chairman until 1925 respectively.

It was founded in 1971 in the Bantustan created by the former Prime Minister of South Africa, Hendrik Verwoerd. Geography It is a flat land that is circumvented by the biggest river in Bolobedu called the Molototsi. The original inhabitants of this land belonged to the Ramafalo clan who resided on the flat land during the 18th century. This is one of the vital clans of the Lobedu (or Balobedu) tribe and are regarded as the clan of rain (Bakoto ba go fala ka naka la pula). They are believed to be able make rain through tribal rituals dating back to the 14th century during their migration from North-West of Africa, now called Zambia and Botswana. History In the early 19th century, Skhiming village was just a bush veld populated by wild animals which are now contained in the Northern Kruger National Park. The founders of this land, the Ramafalo clan were bordered by the Lekabe River on the west/north, Khesepe River on the east and Molototsi on the south/west and south/east. Skhiming village was then in 1971 put under the curatorship of Mmatsweu Mmamaila as the head man after the approval of the Ramafalo clan since the Modjadji Kraal decided to resolve the Mmamaila kingship conflict in the Bolobedu North. The Ramafalo clan agreed with the Modjadji kraal to let the Mmamailas be the head of the village. Local Government Since the death of the village head the late 1980s, Josias Ramafalo from the Ramafalo clan claimed his fatherland back. This was subsequently approved by all the villagers. Josias was working closely with the head-man Mmatsweu. Josias led the village for approximately five years till the only son of Mmatsweu (Pencil Mmamaila) abruptly assumed leadership. There is a misunderstanding among residents as to why he did so. They wanted the Ramafalo clan to have leadership of their land. Education and Hospitals In the late 1970s, Skhiming moved the Seilawa Primary School from the Khesepe region to the village. The name was then changed to the Maloba Primary School. The water borehole was discovered in 1984 and now serves the community with water. In the late 1990s Skhiming village started to develop and was seen as the center in the lower Bolobedu (Boroka). The high school, Makgopela High and the Skhiming Clinic were built. A small shopping complex was planned but failed due to the poor economic conditions.

The brand became \\"Player's Navy Cut\\". They were particularly popular in Britain and Germany in the late 19th century and early part of the 20th century, and were later produced in the United States. The packet has the distinctive logo of a sailor in a 'Navy Cut' cap. The phrase \\"Navy Cut\\" is according to Player's adverts to originate from the habit of sailors taking a mixture of tobacco leaves and binding them with string or twine. The tobacco would then mature under pressure and the sailor could then dispense the tobacco by slicing off a \\"cut\\". The product is also available in pipe tobacco form. Packaging The cigarettes were available in tins and the original cardboard container was a four sided tray of cigarettes that slid out from a covering like a classic matchbox. The next design had fold in ends so that the cigarettes could be seen or dispensed without sliding out the tray. In the 1950s the packaging moved to the flip top design like most brands. Marketing Enamelled metal box for 1 ounce of tobacco. Before this, smokers would have bought tobacco by weight from loose supplies and cigarette papers to roll them in The image of the sailor was known as \\"Hero\\" because of the name on his hat band. It was first used in 1883 and the lifebuoy was added five years later. The sailor images were an 1891 artists concept registered for Chester-based William Parkins and Co for their \\"Jack Glory\\" brand.\\"Navy Cut\\" cigarettes and HERO, navalmarinearchive.com, accessed February 2013 Behind the sailor are two ships. The one on the left is thought to be HMS Britannia and the one on the right HMS Dreadnought or HMS Hero. As time went by the image of the sailor changed as it sometimes had a beard and other times he was clean shaven. In 1927 \\"Hero\\" was standardised on a 1905 version.

Advertisements referred to \\"the appeal to Eve's fair daughters\\" and lines like \\"Men may come and Men may go\\". WWII cigarette packets exhibited at Monmouth Regimental Museum in 2012 Hero is thought to have originally meant to indicate traditional British values, but his masculinity appealed directly to men and as a potential uncle figure for younger women. One slogan written inside the packet was \\"It's the tobacco that counts\\" and another was \\"Player's Please\\"\\"It's the Tobacco that Counts\\", New York Public Library, Digital Images which was said to appeal to the perceived desire of the population to be included in the mass market. The slogan was so well known that it was sufficient in a shop to get a packet of this brand. Player's Medium Navy Cut was the most popular by far of the three Navy Cut brands (there was also Mild and Gold Leaf). Two thirds of all the cigarettes sold in Britain were Players and two thirds of these was branded as Players Medium Navy Cut. In January 1937, Players sold nearly 3.5 million cigarettes (which included 1.34 million in London). The popularity of the brand was mostly amongst the middle class and in the South of England.

Code is said to be monomorphised, with specific data types deduced and traced through the call graph, in order to instantiate specific versions of generic functions, and select specific function calls based on the supplied definitions.

They were caused by abnormally high electricity bills, but later turned into a mass non- partisan movement against the government and the political system. The events were marked by seven self-immolations (five of them fatal), spontaneous demonstrations and a strong sentiment against political parties. As a result of the demonstrations, the centre-right government of Boyko Borisov resigned and a caretaker cabinet led by Marin Raykov was appointed. The demands of protesters, however, were not addressed, and demonstrations continued throughout the country, calling for a change of the political model and nationalisation of strategic economic sectors. Background Electrical power distribution in Bulgaria was managed by a state-owned monopoly until 2005, when the government sold 67% of it to three foreign power companies - German E.ON, Austrian EVN Group and Czech ƒåEZ Group. In 2011, E.ON sold its Bulgarian branch to Energo-Pro, a private Czech power company, and on the next year the state sold its stakes in CEZ. EVN, ƒåEZ and Energo-Pro virtually operate as private regional monopolies whose activities are overseen by the State Commission for Energy and Water Regulation (SCEWR). The state also sold its power distribution infrastructure to these private distributors, thus losing control over the management of profits. The main energy companies are believed to have acquired debts in the four years preceding the demonstrations, which partly contributed to a rather unbalanced situation in the energy sphere. In addition, residents of Sofia have been voicing their concerns for years against the city's district heating provider ‚Äì Toplofikatsiya Sofia, which has a monopoly on heat distribution in the city. Discontent has been created by very high prices and the fact that the company only reviews readings from customers' calorimetres once a year and the rest of the time it forms bills using \\"estimates\\", the complex and allegedly illegal formulas the company uses for calculating the bills and the lack of accountability and the practices of the so-called \\"heating accountancy firms\\", which act as middle-men between Toplofikatsiya and its customers.Protest Against Toplofikatsiya's Monopoly (in Bulgarian), BNT, 4 Feb 2013.

Renewable sources satisfy 12 per cent of electricity needs in Bulgaria. At the same time, Bulgaria has a rapidly expanding renewable energy market. Growth in the sector has surpassed forecasts and has notably increased prices and strain on the electrical grid in the past few years. Investment in wind and solar power installations between 2008 and 2012 in Bulgaria is estimated at more than 4 billion euros, which needs to be repaid by surcharges on electricity prices over the next years. Since 2005, electricity prices for industrial consumers, along with other utilities, have doubled or tripled. In 2011, SCEWR rejected demands by regional monopolies to increase power prices, but a string of severe price spikes occurred in 2012 as a consequence of renewable energy charges. In response, the government drastically cut preferential feed-in tariffs for solar power with 50%, and with 22% for wind power. SCEWR also increased power transmission fees by 50 per cent in an attempt to curb green energy production. These measures led to a drop in electricity exports and withdrawal of investment projects, but prices continued to rise slowly in the following months. Subsequent inflation caused by higher production costs was recorded as the highest for the past four years. Electricity costs are one of the main expenditures for Bulgarian citizens. Local analysts estimated that with rising living costs, almost 100 per cent of the average Bulgarian household's monthly income would be spent on utilities, food, transportation, healthcare and education. Currently 85 per cent of household monthly incomes are spent on basic necessities. Prices in Bulgaria amount to 49 per cent of the European Union average, At the same time average salaries are the lowest among European Union members at 768 leva (393 euro) for September 2012. The minimum wage is ten times lower than that of some member states, amounting to 310 leva (159 euro), or about 1 euro per hour. Twenty-two per cent of the labour force are employed on a minimum wage. For the past three years, incomes have marked almost no change, while prices have increased significantly. Austerity measures encouraged by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund during the recession have resulted in \\"catastrophic\\" social consequences according to the International Trade Union Confederation. The government of Boyko Borisov strictly imposed austerity measures and sustained fiscal stability, but also delayed government payments to private companies, and was criticised for worsening corruption and media freedom indicators, political authoritarianism and general economic stagnation. As a consequence, the support for Borisov and his centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party has been steadily declining since 2010. A major blow to GERB's popularity came after their decision to cancel the Belene Nuclear Power Plant project, which was believed to be a way to reduce electricity costs and create jobs. Mass protests for political or social causes are relatively uncommon in Bulgaria, but have become more frequent since 2007, when the issue of the preservation of Strandzha Mountain nature areas came to the forefront. Escalation=Initial phase= In late January 2013, protests occurred in Blagoevgrad after consumers received electricity bills that were two times higher than those for the previous month. Protesters symbolically burned their bills. A protester explained that her bill amounted to 310 leva, of which only 128 leva were for electricity consumption and the remainder were various tariffs and taxes. Some of the earliest protests also took place in Sandanski. On 10 February, demonstrations occurred in Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas, Ruse, Veliko Tarnovo, Shumen, Blagoevgrad, Sandanski, Silistra, Yambol, Gotse Delchev, Belene, Montana, Pazardjik, Dobrich and Kardzhali. The same day, two EVN utility vehicles were set ablaze in Plovdiv. Demonstrators in Sofia gathered in front of the Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism and threw snowballs at minister Delyan Dobrev. One protester was stabbed in Varna on 13 February 2013. The authorities of Kranevo also voiced discontent at the electricity prices, after communal services costs almost doubled in comparison to the same period of the previous year. The mayor of Kranevo said that his village was not an exception, and most localities in the municipality had the same issues. By mid-February tens of thousands of people were on the streets, demanding nationalisation of the private regional monopolies, removal of subcontractors, assigning traffic and distribution to NEK EAD (the state-owned power distribution company), declassifying all contracts between the state and energy companies and more liberal combined heat and power usage laws, among others. On 17 February, a fictitious declaration supposedly written by the three foreign power companies and dismissing the protester demands while calling on them to accept their own responsibility for the situation that had transpired, was circulated in the social media and caused further anger against the energy providers. According to analysts, in the initial phase of the demonstrations, more than 50% of the discontent was fuelled by the supposed abuses of the monopol companies, with only 15% traceable to anti- government feelings. =Anti-government movement= Protesters in front of the Presidential Palace carrying flags and a portrait of Vasil Levski Riot police in front of the National Assembly, shields down in a sign of solidarity with the protests On 17 February, a national demonstration against monopolies gathered 10,000 people in Plovdiv, 8,000 (up to 30,000 by other estimates) in Varna and a smaller number in other cities. In total, 100,000 people protested all over the country in 35 cities and towns. Key motorways and transport routes in the country were blocked; rocks, bottles and eggs were thrown against Gendarmerie units, the Ministry of Economy and the National Assembly in the capital. People chanted \\"mafia\\" and \\"resignation\\", and carried slogans such as \\"This is not a protest, it's a process - the struggle for a new Bulgaria\\", \\"Down with GERB\\" and \\"Janissaries, the end is coming\\". They gave the government one more week to respond to their demands. Clashes occurred near ƒåEZ's headquarters in Sofia. Map of protest activity peaks by oblast. Regions in red saw the largest number of people on the streets, lighter colours show smaller demonstrations. Some media sources and protesters have used the term \\"Bulgarian Spring\\" as a moniker for the demonstrations. On 18 February mass demonstrations continued all over the country. In Sofia, they escalated into civil resistance and protesters attempted to attack the National Assembly. The crowds were pushed back to Eagles' Bridge (the starting point of the protest), and after their demands to begin immediate talks with government representatives remained unanswered, they moved towards the National Palace of Culture. Clashes with police and Gendarmerie units on Hristo Botev boulevard left two police officers injured and six patrol vehicles were damaged. Eleven people were arrested. In Veliko Tarnovo, one man set himself on fire and later died in a hospital. The same day Boyko Borisov dismissed finance minister Simeon Dyankov, although this did not reduce public tensions. Dyankov was unpopular among the population because of his abrupt manners and strong insistence on austerity. According to some commentators, football fans gradually started to dominate the demonstrations and contributed to their escalation by steering them in a chaotic and violent direction. On the same date, around 30 people led by members of the \\"No to the EU\\" coalition (Bulgarian: –ö–æ–∞–ª–∏—Ü–∏—è ‚Äû–ù–µ –Ω–∞ –ï–°\\") gathered in Sofia and burned a European Union flag, protesting against the EU's supposed discriminatory treatment of Bulgarians and its \\"toleration of the ethnic minorities in the country\\", expressing the sentiment that the country needs to exit the economic and political union. On 19 February, which marked 140 years of national hero Vasil Levski's execution, violent clashes between protesters and police occurred in Sofia. Seven people, including two Gendarmerie officers, were injured during a police charge on protesters at Eagles' Bridge. 25 people were arrested, with the four minors among them quickly released. According to eyewitness accounts, a group of around 20 hooded provocateurs inflamed the situation by throwing firecrackers and rocks at police officers. In the ensuing commotion, the police is alleged to have retaliated against peaceful protest participants. Some pundits have made claims that the agent provocateurs were actually doing GERB's bidding, with the heads of police and the Interior Ministry deliberately attempting to spark a confrontation. President Rosen Plevneliev was booed at during his speech at the Levski Monument. For the first time in history civilians were not allowed to lay flowers at the site. The number of demonstrators in Varna was around 8,000. On 20 February, on the 11th day of the protests, Boyko Borisov announced that his cabinet would resign, expressing shock due to the violent scenes between protesters and police that he had witnessed and stating that he would never feel comfortable remaining in charge when there is such tension between regular citizens and police. The resignation was put to a vote in Parliament on the next morning, with 209 MPs voting \\"for\\" and 5 \\"against\\". A rally gathered in front of the Parliament building in support of Borisov and his government during the debates. Information surfaced in the media that the rally was staged, although GERB's press centre denied the allegations. Borisov expressed gratitude to his sympathizers, but also requested them to discontinue further demonstrations, so that social harmony is not compromised. According to analysis conducted by the information agency BGNES, Borisov is the first Bulgarian prime minister (since Zhan Videnov in 1997) to step down due to hunger fuelled discontent and protests related to the general state of the economy. The assessments of political scientists and sociologists regarding Borisov's choice to relinquish power have been mixed. Evgeniy Daynov was critical, maintaining that the timing and the way in which Borisov went about his decision were ill-chosen, creating the impression of a weak and indecisive leader in addition to allowing him to refrain from addressing potentially valid demands. Others such as Kantcho Stoychev characterized it as the only correct and wise move given the difficult circumstances and were optimistic regarding Borisov's chances to retain his influence in politics and continue to work for the betterment of the country. Boriana Dimitrova and other analysts emphasized that Borisov's resignation was reflective of a good intuitive reading of the situation and caught analysts, political parties and even the protesters themselves by surprise, with the forces in opposition suffering from their own legitimacy issues which would make them ill-equipped to provide quick solutions to the systemic crisis. In Nikolov's contention, the stepping down of Borisov essentially turned the social crisis into a political one. Klisarov has ascribed more cynical motives to Borisov's quick resignation, viewing it largely as a matter of preserving GERB's power base and the particized status quo. Throughout the crisis Borisov retained the support of the European People's Party and he was endorsed by them for the 2013 parliamentary elections. =Post-resignation actions= Initiative committees by citizens form around the country. On 23 February coordinators of demonstrations gathered in Sliven to discuss further actions after the resignation of the government. Several members of different political parties who were present at the gathering were expelled. Demands for a change of the political system, a ban on all political parties in power, abolishment of value added tax on electricity production and state ownership of natural resources and strategic sectors were added to the original calls for nationalisation of the power companies. TIM, a semi-legal company, was reported to have organised a crackdown on an initiative committee gathering in Varna. Protesters holding banners against TIM are alleged to have been beaten, with the police choosing not to intervene. The \\"Rakovski Legion\\", an organisation of military officers and supporters of the Bulgarian Army, have joined the protests. International demonstrations occurred 24 February in all major Bulgarian cities, as well as in Vienna, Munich, Paris, London, Barcelona, D√ºsseldorf, Frankfurt, Athens, Berlin, Madrid, Dublin and many other major cities all over the world, where the Bulgarian diaspora gathered in front of the Bulgarian embassies and consulates. IMRO leaders organized a march in the capital on that day and joined the demonstrations. President Rosen Plevneliev met with some of the protesters in Sofia and was presented with a list of demands. Non-mainstream nationalist organizations such as the Bulgarian National Front (Bulgarian: –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–µ–Ω –§—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç) and Bulgarian National Union (Bulgarian: –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–µ–Ω —Å—ä—é–∑) have also been supportive of the demonstrations, while sharply distancing themselves from what they view as anti-patriotic entities such as the Open Institute and the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee. The protest wave subsequently continued, albeit with a lower intensity. Gatherings of citizen committees were scheduled to move to Plovdiv in response to Interior Minister in resignation Tsvetan Tsvetanov's accusations that protest leaders belong to organised crime and drug smuggling circles. Yanko Petrov, a protest coordinator, explained in an interview that members of the committees expect to be framed for drug distribution by the authorities. Borisov has been critical of the role played by BSP and MRF during the protests, believing them to have made use of the discontent among the poor in order to topple his government. He has also expressed disappointment with some of the media, who had allegedly been overly praiseworthy of him (in order to be able to discredit him with the European Union by creating the false impression that they were under his control) before changing their tune. Borisov also revealed that the protests against his government may have been a factor in the postponement of Bulgaria's entry into the Schengen Area. In late February 2013, doctors and medical personnel also voiced dissatisfaction, demanding an urgent meeting with Rosen Plevneliev, due to the limits on their freedom to practice their occupation and see patients that had been imposed by the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). In March 2013, Sergei Stanishev accused the Borisov government of monitoring the e-mail accounts and text messages of the protest leaders. On 4 March, a protest tent city was erected in front of the National Parliament by some of the Eagles' Bridge protesters. The early elections did not bring about political stability or increased trust in the political institutions of the country. By the end of July 2013, anti- government protesters but this time against the new government of Plamen Oresharski were still out in force, protesting peacefully in Sofia, with Reuters recording the 24 July 2013 as the 41st straight day of peaceful protests. The protesters were demanding the resignation of the Socialist-led government of Oresharski and more than 100 lawmakers, ministers and journalists spent the night besieged inside parliament before police evacuated them. Boyko Borisov returned to power as Prime Minister in November 2014 after his party won the 2014 Bulgarian parliamentary election, forming a coalition government. Public reactions to the protests While the anti-monopoly and anti-austerity protests enjoyed a high degree of popular support (with over 90% of Bulgarian citizens expressing approval of them in a Gallup poll prior to Borisov's resignation and 77% lauding them in a summer 2013 poll administered by the same company), there was less of a consensus regarding the exact culpability of the Borisov cabinet, with 47% demanding that Boyko Borisov stepped down and 39% believing that he did not need to tender his resignation. Alpha Research provided figures suggesting an even greater parity in viewpoints, with 50% approving of Borisov's resignation and 47% disagreeing with the Prime Minister's decision. As a result of this, public enthusiasm for continued demonstrations remained high (around 70%) in the aftermath of Borisov's announcement that he did not intend to stay on. Alpha Research (in its regular survey administered in the period between 22 March and 27 March), confirmed that over 90% of Bulgarians declare support for economically- oriented demands (though only about 20% would be inclined to back up manifestly political ones). Accordingly, a higher proportion of respondents - 67% - credited the protests for bringing about economic changes (like the reduction in electricity prices), with the number of those well-disposed towards the political transformations as a result of the demonstrations (such as the preliminary elections) a lower one - 47%. 55% expressed full approval for the \\"voice of the street\\", while 38% were partially supportive of street protests. 14% of Bulgarian citizens affirmed that they would cast their vote for a \\"protest party\\". Surveys generally indicated a higher support for the anti-monopoly protests among younger people in the smaller cities, as opposed to those in Sofia or Plovdiv. Varna constituted the major exception, with the protests labeled by Anna Krasteva as the Varna Spring. Young people as well as the age cohorts between 30-44 and 45-59 constituted a substantial percentage of those who took part in the protest marches. Elderly people were much more visible in the ranks of the protesters in comparison to previous demonstrations for environmental causes. People with primary or no education were almost absent during the protest activities. Self-identified BSP and MRF sympathizers did not have a significant presence at the demonstrations, with 3.5% and 3.3% respectively declaring to have participated in them. 7.45% of self-described GERB supporters were at some point in the streets during the protest activities (presumably only in the initial anti-monopoly phase of the demonstrations). Members of the nationalist Attack had an active involvement in the demonstrations. Even though the February crisis has been described as \\"an element in the political strategy of BSP\\", in the immediate aftermath of the protests, electoral support for GERB actually went up (in part due to increased consolidation within the party and mobilization of its voters), with the most recent party in governance increasing its lead over BSP in comparison to the standings in January. The Attack benefited the most as a result of the accumulated protest potential, raising its electoral appeal from 1.9% to 5.5%. Political events The Prime Minister Boyko Borisov resigned in response to the protests. On 6 March 2013, mayor of Varna, Kiril Yordanov, also announced his resignation, triggered by the anti-government protest wave in general and the self-immolation of Plamen Goranov in particular. The government (while still formally in charge of the country) declared 6 March to be a day of national mourning. President Rosen Plevneliev was tasked with giving a mandate to one of the major political parties to form a caretaker government. GERB, the Socialist Party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms returned the mandate. Early elections became scheduled to take place on 12 May 2013. The caretaker government under Marin Raykov assumed power on 13 March, on the same day in which the date for the early elections was set. It attracted criticism from the Attack party, which questioned its impartiality, regarding it as an instrument of GERB that could help hide any evidence of the former governing party's alleged abuses of power. Businessman and direct democracy proponent Petar Klisarov labeled the Raykov government as \\"GERB's \\"B\\" team\\". In March 2013, Rosen Plevneliev approached protest organizers to form a public advisory body that would operate together with the caretaker government, but there was a breakdown in the talks. Plevneliev and the main political parties have been blamed by some sources for allegedly only feigning interest in the protesters' concerns and not acting to change the electoral rules prior to the Parliament's dissolution. On 16 March, a number of the protesters established the political movement \\"Liberation\\" (Bulgarian: –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ ‚Äû–û—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ‚Äù) with the intention of taking part in the upcoming elections. In the Parliamentary election in May, all major parties, especially the ruling GERB, received a severe blow (despite obtaining the highest number of popular votes and seats in the National Assembly), with the notable exception of the Socialist Party, which got a major boost in both votes and seats. Due to GERB's political isolation and what Borisov characterized as \\"his unwillingness to take part in unprincipled coalitions\\", the party did not attempt to form a government by subjecting its chosen cabinet to a vote in the National Assembly and the president passed on the baton to BSP. The citizen energy generated as a result of the February protests did not lead to a high voter turnout and the election campaign is evaluated as having remained largely insulated from the protests, with no political movement incorporating a significant number of protester demands emerging as an electoral challenger. Leading figures of the party Bulgaria Without Censorship (Bulgarian: \\"–ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è –±–µ–∑ —Ü–µ–Ω–∑—É—Ä–∞\\"), which was officially established on 25 January 2014, have made statements suggesting that the majority of the February protesters eventually flocked to them. Angel Slavchev, dubbed as one of the \\"faces of the February demonstrations\\", started his own show on the News7 channel, which was regarded as closely affiliated with Barekov's party. Slavchev also took part in the 2014 European elections on the ticket of Barekov's party, though he is no longer affiliated with BWS after criticizing the party leader and being expelled in July 2014. Repercussions in the energy sector On the day before its resignation, the government announced that it would revoke ƒåEZ's licence.Prosecutor's office suggests that CEZ's licence be revoked, Dnevnik, 19 Feb 2013. Retrieved Oct 2013. Following the statement, the Bulgarian Stock Exchange suspended trading in the shares of ƒåEZ and its subordinate companies. The company's shares declined for several consecutive days on the Prague Stock Exchange. In early March 2013, mayor Rositsa Yanakieva revealed that 288 separate lawsuits against ƒåEZ (pertaining to disputes surrounding the ownership of power substations) had been filed by the Pernik municipality. Two weeks after the government announced its resignation (but before it had taken effect), the Electricity Systems Operator announced that the total energy production in the country was estimated at well below 50% of the full capacity, with the country's second-largest power station, the Varna TPP, having been completely shut down. This was surprising for people who had been paying high bills.ESO shutting down blocks at all three stations at Maritza East, BTV News, 3 March 2013. Retrieved Oct 2013.The energy system turns out to be on the verge of collapse, Sega, 4 Mar 2013. Retrieved Oct 2013. A week later, the energy minister Delyan Dobrev revealed that energy contracts signed by previous governments in 2002 and 2005 contained secret clauses about the construction and exploitation of the Maritza East 1 and Maritza East 3 power stations, totalling over 13 billion BGN (nearly 7 billion euro).

On 14 November 2013, the Commission for Energy and Water Regulation (Bulgarian: –ö–æ–º–∏—Å–∏—è –∑–∞ –µ–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–∏–π–Ω–æ –∏ –≤–æ–¥–Ω–æ —Ä–µ–≥—É–ª–∏—Ä–∞–Ω–µ) discontinued the procedure of revoking the license of ƒåEZ Electro Bulgaria. Many of the problems in the energy sector that triggered the protests remain unsolved as of September 2014. National Electric Company continues to accumulate deficits, demanding further rises in the consumer prices of electricity. A large part of the NEC deficit comes from the long-term contracts of renewable energy producers and AES Maritza East 1. Effects on political protests outside of Bulgaria The wave of government change from Bulgaria went as far as Slovenia, where the government was forced to resign as a result of similar protests by the Slovenian people affected by the Slovenian government austerity measures. At the end of February demonstrations against high electricity prices occurred in Estonia, following the Bulgarian example. Analysis and political commentary The demonstrations have been characterized as an authentic expression of the desperation of the less affluent Bulgarians, to a large extent motivated by feelings of absolute and relative deprivation and as being dominated by socially oriented demands, associated with the traditional left. While some analysts have labeled them a \\"revolt of the poor\\", others have regarded the people from the middle class social stratum (specifically the now defunct citizen movement \\"Power\\" (Bulgarian: –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –°–ò–õ–ê), members of which had organized demonstrations in Sandanski and Blagoevgrad, as the driving force behind the early unrest. Politician Edvin Sugarev has criticized a number of media sources, especially Bivol, for publishing unproven information about Borisov's alleged links with the Ministry of the Interior's CSBOP (Bulgarian: –¶–°–ë–û–ü), where the Prime Minister is purported to have worked as an informer (his file was supposedly called the \\"Buda dossier\\"), which he sees as having played a pivotal role in the radicalization of the protest by turning the anger away from the monopolism of energy companies and against Borisov. He compared the situation to the atmosphere in January 1997 (but this time with BSP reaping dividends from it), an opinion shared by Daynov who also drew parallels with the 1990 protests in terms of the volatility of the situation. According to the French ambassador to Bulgaria, Philippe Auti√©, the protests stemmed from a lack of sufficient trust in the political class and Bulgarian elites as in general as well as the ability of \\"private and non-transparent stakeholders\\" to frequently hijack and negatively affect the post-1989 transition processes. Political scientist Vasil Garnizov similarly regards the protests as reflective of the widespread societal sentiment that there is something wrong when it comes to the political and economic structuring of society (as well as the links between the political and economic spheres) - this attitude is thought to have been pervasive since the early 1990s. The need for increased citizen control over political decision-making has also been identified as a key (but sometimes forgotten) demand of the protest movement. Parvan Simeonov sees the fall-out from the February protests as in indication that the second Bulgarian party system after 1989 (the charismatic one that followed the bipolar model of the 1990s), which began with Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and continued with Borisov, has now come to an end. In the view of political anthropologist and journalist Dostena Lavern, the February demonstrations were an indication that \\"Bulgaria is fully on track to reach an equalization of its social and political realities with those of the other EU countries\\", with the protest motivations linked to EU-wide negative trends such as the threat posed by financial neoliberalism to the democratic fundamentals of countries (in both Eastern and Western Europe). Economist Georgi Angelov from the Sofia Open Society Institute, commenting on the situation one day prior to Borisov's resignation, explained that the country's stability on the global financial markets and bankruptcy indicators have not been seriously affected due to the protests. In addition to the lack of unity issues among the protest leaders (believed to have played a part in discrediting them with citizens), in part exemplified by the split between the \\"green\\" and the \\"other\\" protesters, as well as their limited familiarity with politics, some commentators have criticized the supposed prominence in the media of leftist spokespeople for the demonstrators and the demand for the creation of a system without political parties, viewing it as unrealistic and non-constructive as well as likely to encourage the promotion of non-democratic ideas, akin to the councils that had been implemented in the Soviet Union. According to Daniel Smilov and Toni Nikolov, in the aftermath of Borisov's resignation, a political power vacuum and an escalation of anti-party sentiments persisted for a short while, with party leaders largely removing themselves from the public sphere. In that moment in time the think tanks, non-governmental organizations and their networks are gauged to have been the only actors willing to speak up in defense of the constitutional system of governance and party democracy. Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov insists that both the February demonstrations and the subsequent anti-Oresharski ones remained relatively ineffective due to the lacking political leadership in their ranks. Also, from a utilitarian standpoint, a very limited number of the protester demands are believed to have been achieved seven months after Borisov's resignation - 17 out of 20 issues raised by the protesters are thought not to have been tackled in full or in part by the relevant political actors. Antoniy Galabov maintains that while the initial demonstrations were against high utility bills, with the implicit hope that Borisov could rectify the situation, the protests were subsequently taken over by new participants with a different profile, often driven by corporate interests. The demonstrators' demands are believed to have become overly abstract, with the finger being pointed at the whole political system and the nature of the democratic transition; this is thought to have essentially forced all the mainstream parties to incorporate populism into their platforms in order to portray themselves as allies of the people on the streets. Political scientist Deyan Kyuranov regards the initial preeminence of economic grievances as a particular strength of the protest, but believes that the protesters were ill- advised to attempt change the focal point in the direction of a political demonstration and thus caused the collapse of what started off as a promising popular movement. A number of analysts have also subscribed to the viewpoint that the accusations levelled against GERB (for its supposed authoritarianism and violation of democratic norms) have been without sufficient merit and the party was not even close to creating a state within a state during Borisov's time in power. According to a report generated by the \\"Media Democracy\\" foundation, the general coverage of the demonstrations by the major media outlets (even those previously considered to be favourable to the Borisov administration) was almost universally pro-protest, with the main media's nature of reporting turning markedly against the government on 17 February. Despite the calls for greater accountability in politics during the course of the protests, leadership hierarchies and inner party consensus within BSP and GERB are believed to have become more entrenched in the months following the end of the demonstrations, with the status quo parties never facing a serious challenge as a result of the demonstrations. The Internet is believed to have played an important role when it comes to many aspects of the protest movement and its effectiveness is believed to have been bolstered by the \\"media revolution\\" in Bulgaria, as evidenced by the increased prominence of online newspapers, on-site reporting by protest leaders as well as a tendency to treat platforms such as Facebook news as primary sources of information. Conspiracy theories A minority of anti-protest commentators have taken the stance that the demonstrations were orchestrated by pro-Russian circles in order to bring down the Borisov government (seen as unfavourable to Russian energy interests and Russian lobbies in Bulgaria as a whole) and from the very beginning had an explicitly political dimension. They note that the most intense protests largely subsided after Borisov's resignation even though the economic demands remained mostly unaddressed. The role of the Bulgarian Socialist Party in hijacking the protests has also been emphasized. Such pundits tend to characterize the February demonstrations as a coup attempt with the alleged heavy involvement of pro-communist activists, because of the Russophilic sentiments of some of the informal leaders of the protests. In subsequent interviews, some of the leading figures behind the February demonstrations such as Yanko Petrov, Doncho Dudev and Yoanna Ivanova countered the allegations of a major shift in the direction of the protest in an anti- Borisov fashion by claiming that the largest protest –∞ctivities actually occurred in the aftermath of Borisov's resignation (with the anti-monopoly sentiments remaining key) and emphasizing that the three of them were also active in demonstrating against Delyan Peevski's short-lived DANS appointment by the Oresharski government.

Askham was born at Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, on 25 July 1825. His father, John Askham, a native of Raunds in Northamptonshire, was a shoemaker, and his mother a native of Kimbolton. John Askham the younger was the youngest of seven children. Askham attended the Wellingborough Free School for about one year.

In 1871, Askham was elected a member of the first town school board. In 1874 he became school attendance officer and sanitary inspector of the local board of health. Despite his heavy workload, Askham educated himself and started writing poetry. He composed his first verses at the age of twenty-five, and later contributed poems to local newspapers. Askham was especially fond of the sonnet. The fidelity of his nature poetry was remarkable when it is considered that, unlike his predecessor, John Clare (1793-1864) [q. v.], Askham had few opportunities at enjoying country life.

Kubwa is a residential district in Bwari, one of the area councils in the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria. It is one of the major suburbs within the metropolitan area of Abuja. The Kubwa Community has been in existence since 1990 and is considered to be the largest satellite town in West Africa. The distance from Wuse Market to Kubwa is approximately 26 Kilometres. The Gbagi people were the original residents, but Kubwa community became an entirely new and heterogeneous community as a result of government policy on the relocation of the Gwagi people, having the three major ethnic groups Hausa, Yorubas, Igbos and other ethnic minorities as the main inhabitants of the community; they are mainly civil servants, businessmen and women, commercial motorcycle riders, artisans and entrepreneurs. Sustainable Actions of Kubwa Community Generally, the Kubwa community has grown and developed sustainably; however, it has been observed to be slow compared to other fast-growing cities in the world. Residents attribute that their new diversity of ethnicity and professions coupled to their new infrastructure of roads, markets, and supermarkets has created a durable base for their new community as well (remarkably) as doing so at a relatively affordable cost. Specific drivers of financial sustainability are attributed to the various types of businesses ranging from operating supermarkets, shops, general markets (such as Kubwa Market, site 2-phase 1 Market, etc.) engaged by community members. Other drivers include the fact that above 60 percent of the residents are civil servants who work with the federal and capital territory government organizations/institutions. The remaining are entrepreneurs, private security agents, low-cost housing builders, truck pushers, commercial motorcycle riders and real estate practitioners. Also, the establishment of cooperative societies and huge investments by community members have had a huge influence on Kubwa financial sustainability. The community-friendly investment flexibilities of the cooperative societies are main reasons for huge financial investment by community members which include monthly and weekly cash deposits, higher interest on investment as compared to other financial institutions, etc.Unpublished survey by Future Generations Graduate School, Uchenna Onyeizu, Franklin, WV, January 2013 Environmental Management and Conservation Sustainability Kubwa community is known as a modestly clean community by visitors and neighbouring communities, and by residents. Some of the actions that have facilitated sustainable environmental management include: adhering to the monthly sanitation exercise as mandated by the government, the Thursday market sanitation, voluntary sanitation and cleaning activities by some individuals, and the truck pushers who circulate the community packing and disposing of household waste at very low cost. Also noteworthy is the fine on deforestation. Deforestation is discouraged in Nigeria by the government and supervised voluntarily by community members -- particularly for economically sensitive crops such as mangoes, cashew trees - see Deforestation in Nigeria There are also conscious efforts by individuals who live in the estates and neighbourhoods within Kubwa to organize themselves in ensuring environmental management and conservation. Kubwa cultural identity Due to the fact that the original occupants of Kubwa community were relocated by government policy, the cultural identity of the present community was found to be highly dispersed. Therefore, the major occupants are immigrants and Nigerians from either the three major ethnic nationalities (the Igbos, Hausas and Yorubas ) or the minority ethnicities, which have influenced the cultural identity and practice in the community. Some important events are organized to sustain these cultural identities, such the New yam festival of the Igbos New yam festival, The Shea-butter festival, The Igbo day celebration, Bwari day celebration, Yoruba Day celebration, The August meeting of the Igbos, encouragement to wear cultural/native outfits on cultural days and church days (Sundays). Some religious organizations - see Religion in Nigeria are also very active in this instance, such as the churches organize cultural days such as ST. Theresa Imo-Abia day. These events encourage cultural dancing competitions, dressings, native language speaking and practices. Also, unplanned spending culture, inadequate basic infrastructure ( such as electricity, water, etc.) that are supposed to be provided by the government, which are mostly provided with personal income, the high prostitution/sex work activities observed at high spot areas, inadequate capacity of most individuals to undertake a feasibility study and develop business plan before engaging in businesses, high level of spending at night clubs, drinking bars and joints, the influence of neighbouring communities on the housing and living costs, community members who indulge in professionals business activities without appropriate trainings and exposures are unsustainable lifestyles practised by Kubwa Community members. Other unsustainable lifestyles of Kubwa community include indiscriminate disposal of waste, dumping of waste along or into the canals, sewerage systems that are channels for water flows. This has also made the rivers unsafe for domestic uses. The community has witnessed regular deforestation and cutting down of trees for the purpose of buildings, infrastructural development, and burial grounds without plans to afforest or plant trees. The government and non- governmental organizations are not doing enough to sensitize and also enlighten community members on sustainable environmental management. Another unsustainable act is illegal construction of buildings and structures, which are not in line with the government-approved development plan. The cultural identities of Kubwa community have been affected by members who most of the times dress in foreign attires, the majority of the community members speak in the English language or pidgin English language. The increased attention to western education was also identified as a major force to unsustainable cultural conservation. Further Representative Cultural Features Religion is the main factor driving sustainable livelihood of the community. Above 90 percent of Kubwa population belong to one religion or the other, and there are two major religions (Christian and Islam). This has brought the community together with several community development activities, such as donation of relief materials by some unions in the churches, organization of cultural/ethnic celebration days, regular meeting with popular slogan ‚Äòbe your brothers‚Äô keeper‚Äô. These engagements at these religious platforms have encouraged sustainable community development. Also, the Islamic religion in the community has founded schools, relief centres that are primarily involved in educating and providing relief materials to their members and society at large. However, there have been few community conflicts resulting from inter and intra religious relationships and living within the same community. Football Viewing Centres is another feature that has brought Kubwa community members together. Many youths find themselves in most of these centres viewing football matches. Just as an average Kubwa resident will always mention 'Football matches such as the English Premiership has brought real unity and friendliness in this community'. You will see young, old and even children come out to watch these matches. Community youths who come from different geopolitical regions in Nigeria, come together to form clubs; discuss businesses and career opportunities at the centres. These associations or coming together have started yielding developmental goals within the community, engaging the youths meaningfully is for the very important especially in reducing crimes. People drink a lot of alcohol at these centres which affect both personal and collective interest of the State. Hanging Out Centres at Recreation Places is a rising phenomena in the community. And almost all of the relaxation gardens that were originally built for community members‚Äô relaxation have now been converted to hangout centres, where alcohol and other forms of drinks are served. This activity brings together all grades and manner of individuals from the community who after their daily work, retire in these centres for relaxation and business discussions. Other things served are foods, roasted fish etc. These issues/factors are some overarching issues driving the sustainable and unsustainable development of the community.

It is an Anglican chapel in the deanery of Ludlow, the archdeaconry of Ludlow, and the diocese of Hereford. The chapel is served by the Ludlow Team Ministry. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. The authors of the Buildings of England series describe it as \\"the perfect example of a rich little Norman chapel\\". The citation in the National Heritage List for England states that it \\"is nationally very remarkable as it has remained substantially unaltered in use, status, size and style\\". History Heath Chapel was built in the middle of the 12th century. The roof of the nave was renewed in the 16th or 17th century. At about this time a flat plaster ceiling was added to the chancel, the walls were whitewashed, covering the medieval wall paintings, and texts were painted on the walls which were later also covered in whitewash. During the 17th century a communion rail was built on three sides of the altar, and pews were introduced in chancel and the nave. In 1870 the chapel was floored with flagstones. In 1912 the chancel ceiling was removed and a new roof built. At the same time some of the medieval wall paintings were exposed. Architecture Heath Chapel doorway, Shropshire The chapel is Norman in style. It is constructed in grey siltstone rubble with yellowish sandstone ashlar dressings. It has a rectangular plan, and consists of a two- bay nave with a south doorway and a two-bay chancel. There is no bellcote. The chapel is supported by full-height buttresses, and there is a string course around it at mid-height. The windows are small. The doorway has two orders of shafts with decayed capitals. It is decorated with chevrons, but has a plain tympanum. Inside the chapel, the chancel arch has two orders of shafts and scalloped capitals. The tub-shaped font is Norman. There are five box pews and a two-decker pulpit, all dating from the 17th century. There is another pew in the chancel that has been constructed from reused medieval material. The communion rail is on three sides of the altar, and contains turned balusters. The identified subjects of the wall paintings include Saint George on the south wall, and the Last Judgement above the chancel arch. The 17th-century texts are present but faded.

Function  TPR domain-containing proteins, such as TTC7A, have diverse functions in cell cycle control, protein transport, phosphate turnover, and protein trafficking or secretion, and they can act as chaperones or scaffolding proteins.  Clinical significance  TTC7A deficiency disrupts epithelial cell differentiation and polarization in the intestinal tract, thymus, and lungs. TTC7A deficiency is very rare with less than 80 cases described in the literature to date. Mutations in this gene are known to cause intestinal atresia, severe infantile or very early onset inflammatory bowel disease, extensive enteropathy, combined immunodeficiencies, thyroid dysfunction, alopecia, and lung disease. There is a broad spectrum of severity and variety of symptoms, although quality of life is generally very poor for these children with few surviving beyond the first year or two of life. Treatment There is no standard treatment for TTC7A Deficiency at this time. Management of TTC7A deficiency currently entails bowel resection for any atresias, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to correct the immunodeficiencies and immunosuppression to help alleviate bowel disease and immune disregulation. However, Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is ineffective for resolving the intestinal disease http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/early/2016/07/14/blood-2016-01-696385?sso- checked=true Small bowel transplant has proven successful in at least one case. =Rho Kinase Inhibitors= Research indicates that TTC7A deficiency results in \\"increased Rho kinase activity which disrupts polarity, growth, and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, and which impairs immune cell homeostasis, thereby promoting MIA-CID development.\\" Based on this research, it has been proposed that Rho kinase inhibitors may be a therapeutic option, although no specific rho kinase inhibitors are currently available for patient use with the exception of Fasudil which is only available in Japan. It has been shown that statins such as Lipitor are useful as Rho kinase inhibitors. Therefore, statins may be helpful for the treatment of TTC7A deficiency, although this has yet to be proven. Recent research suggests that rho kinase inhibitors may be ineffective in treating TTC7A Deficiency. =Leflunomide As Potential Treatment= Recent research shows that Leflunomide reduces intestinal tract narrowing, restores gut motility, and increases intestinal cell survival in Zebrafish with TTC7A Deficiency. The researchers concluded that Leflunomide \\"might be repurposed for treatment of TTC7A deficiency.\\"  References  External links  * Human proteins ","title":"TTC7A"},{"id":"38594467","text":"Vitaly Zdorovetskiy ( ; ; born March 8, 1992), better known by his YouTube username VitalyzdTv, is a Russian-American YouTube personality, content creator and website owner. Zdorovetskiy's YouTube videos, as of November 2019, have reached over 1.7 billion views and over 10 million subscribers, while his vlog channel has more than 270 million views and 2.0 million subscribers. Early life and education Zdorovetskiy was born in a Russian-Jewish family in Murmansk in 1992. As a child, he lived in the Ukrainian city of Odessa. Zdorovetskiy grew up in Boca Raton, Florida. Zdorovetskiy attempted to become a professional skateboarder at an early age but quit due to injuries. In the video titled \\"Why I Did Porn!\\", Zdorovetskiy tells his audience he got his first job at age 15 as a garbage collector making $5.00 an hour. His second job was a sign-spinner dressed as Uncle Sam making $20 for 3 hours of work. After that, Vitaly picked up a job as a bus boy at a restaurant in Miami, Florida. Shortly after turning 18, Zdorovetskiy took part in an adult film scene with pornographic actress Diamond Kitty for the adult entertainment company Bang Bros in 2011. Career In 2012, Zdorovetskiy received his first significant success, with the video \\"Miami Zombie Attack Prank!\\" Inspired by the cannibal attack of a homeless man in Miami in May 2012, Zdorovetskiy dressed up as a zombie and traveled to some of the poorest neighborhoods in Miami to scare random bystanders. By January 2015, the \\"Miami Zombie Attack Prank!\\" had been viewed more than 30 million times. A sequel video prank was produced in Columbus, Ohio. On June 16, 2012, Zdorovetskiy and cameraman Jonathan Vanegas filmed the \\"Russian Hitman Prank\\". As part of the prank, Zdorovetskiy approached a Boca Raton Resort man and informed him they had 60 seconds to get away from a briefcase he placed on the ground. After Zdorovetskiy revealed the whole thing to be a prank and that there was a hidden camera nearby, the man started attacking him and his partner and called the police. Zdorovetskiy was arrested by Boca Raton police department, facing a maximum of 15 years in prison on charges of threatening to detonate a bomb. At the time of the prank, Zdorovetskiy's YouTube channel had only about 100,000 subscribers, but after the incident his channel grew to over four million subscribers within just over a year. On July 20, 2013, Zdorovetskiy released the video \\"Extreme Homeless Man Makeover\\", in which he befriends a homeless man named Martin and provides him with new clothes and a hotel room. The video posting resulted in a job offer that Martin accepted. He was also reunited with his wife. The project also included an attempt to raise money to have Martin's teeth fixed, for which Zdorovetskiy was able to raise about $10,000 online. The fundraising campaign was canceled before it was completed, because of Zdorovetskiy's criminal history. However, Zdorovetskiy received several offers from surgeons to do the dental work for free. The surgery and the video story was featured on television news casts including the Good Day LA Fox morning show. His \\"Gold Digger Prank\\", featuring a woman who rejects his advances until she believes he drives a Lamborghini Gallardo sports car, generated more than 18 million views in its first week of posting, making VitalyzdTV the third most watched YouTube channel in the world during that week with over 45 million views. On October 15, 2014, Zdorovetskiy pulled a prank which involved himself dressing up as Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, pretending to saw off the legs of Hanhart syndrome patient Nick Santonastasso with a chainsaw in front of unsuspecting witnesses. The prank went viral, receiving over 30 million views in 3 weeks. While being in Croatia in 2015, he pranked former Croatian prime minister Ivo Sanader, while Sanader was leaving Remetinec prison where he was serving his sentence for corruption charges by jumping on Sanader's car while he and his lawyers were inside. Criminal record In 2014, Zdorovetskiy was arrested for invading the field during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final between Germany and Argentina in Brazil. On May 25, 2016, Zdorovetskiy was arrested for trespassing after climbing the Hollywood Sign, as part of a video stunt. On June 10, Zdorovetskiy was again arrested for streaking during Game 4 of the NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors with authorities quickly apprehending and arresting the YouTuber. During the bottom of the 7th inning in Game 5 of the 2017 World Series, he was arrested for running onto the field at Minute Maid Park shortly after Carlos Correa of the Houston Astros hit a home run. On December 31, 2017, Zdorovetskiy and his girlfriend were escorted off Boca Raton Resort because online posts were discovered about a potential New Year's Eve prank, but Zdorovetskiy said he had no intention of making any prank videos at the resort. During the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final, his girlfriend Kinsey Wolanski ran on to the pitch wearing a swimsuit emblazoned with the \\"Vitaly Uncensored\\" logo. Zdorovetskiy is currently facing a ban from attending major sporting events for his antics and Wolanski is likely to get a similar ban. However, during the 2019 Cricket World Cup Final between England and New Zealand, Zdorovetskiy's mother, Elena Vulitsky attempted to emulate her son's girlfriend's success at the Champions League final. Vulitsky was pictured wearing clothing with the \\"Vitaly Uncensored\\" logo on it, but was stopped by stewards from streaking. In January 2020, Zdorovetskiy was arrested and spent five days in an Egyptian jail after climbing the Pyramids of Giza. In April 2020, Zdorovetskiy was arrested and later charged for aggravated battery by Miami Beach Police. Zdorovetskiy allegedly tackled a female jogger and struck her multiple times in the head and chest. He was released from custody after posting a $7,500 bond.  Personal life  Zdorovetskiy currently lives in Los Angeles, California. In November 2015, Lionsgate officially acquired worldwide distribution rights for a film in which he starred, Natural Born Pranksters. Upon its debut, Natural Born Pranksters was panned by viewers, with an average user rating of 3.6 out of 10 on IMDb, and a 3.3 out of 10 on Metacritic.

They are members of the Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs, which is not associated with Major League Baseball. In 2017, the Admirals won the Pacific Association championship.  History  The Admirals began play as a charter member of the four-team Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs, along with the Hawaii Stars, Na Koa Ikaika Maui, and San Rafael Pacifics, former members of the now- defunct North American League. The Admirals started play at Wilson Park in Vallejo in the spring of 2013. They club was originally owned by Redwood Sports and Entertainment, which also owns the San Rafael Pacifics.It's official: Vallejo Admirals in Pacific Association for 2013, Ballpark Digest, February 18, 2013Vallejo in, Sonoma County out in Pacific Association, Ballpark Digest, February 4, 2013Vallejo thrilled to be the home of the Admirals, Rich Freedman, Times-Herald, February 17, 2013 The Admirals were subsequently sold to Joe Fontana, who named ex-big leaguer Pedro Guerrero field manager in April 2013. In July 2013, the league suspended the team for failure to pay players, employees, and rent, among other financial problems. Under new ownership and a new manager in Tito Fuentes Jr., the team returned to play on July 31, 2013, with an 11‚Äì2 win over the East Bay Lumberjacks.Lito Roman leads Vallejo Admirals past Lumberjacks, Vallejo Times-Herald, August 1, 2013 The team finished the season in third place overall, winning all of its playoff games at Wilson Park, but falling to Maui, 8‚Äì3, in the semifinals in San Rafael. Shortstop Jesse Olivar out of Cosumnes River College was named team MVP. First baseman Nathan Tomaszewski became the first Admirals player to be signed by an affiliated club. He was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates following the 2013 season and played one year with Pittsburgh's rookie affiliate, the Bristol Pirates. Robert Young, former owner of the two now- defunct Hawaii franchises, purchased the team prior to the 2014 season. With a new manager, Garry Templeton II, the Admirals went 44‚Äì34 and finished in second place in the Pacific Association. The team had an opportunity to win the second half, assuring them a second consecutive postseason appearance, but fell to San Rafael on the final day of the regular season, 11‚Äì8. Templeton II was named the Pacific Association Manager of the Year for the 18-win turnaround compared to the 2013 season. Right fielder Jordan Hinshaw earned the league's Rookie of the Year Award while also being named a top defender at his position. Along with Hinshaw, Tillman Pugh (center field), Elvin Rodriguez (shortstop),, and Michael Cerda (third base) all received the league's top defensive award at their positions. During the 2015 offseason, general manager Kathy Beistel purchased the team from Young and located Kevin Reilly, a local realtor, as a silent partner to provide operating funds. Despite the large cash infusion, player salaries were halved for the last month of the season, and the Admirals finished the season 25‚Äì53 overall in last place. At the end of 2015, Beistel announced she had sold her remaining shares to Reilly, who became the sole share owner. In 2016, team operations solidified in every aspect. Attendance was up almost 50%, and the game-day experience was greatly improved by adding stadium seating, a picnic/dining area behind first base, pre-game and between-inning entertainment, and improved cost and selection in food and merchandise. Gone were the days of ownership instability, and the team had become a civic asset and a vehicle for local business to be seen in the community. The Admirals hired Mike Samuels as manager. Samuels' staff consisted of former big leaguer Warren Brusstar and a pair of major league draft picks Tim Wallace (Chicago Cubs) and Lonnie Jackson (Los Angeles Dodgers). Samuels and his staff were replaced one month into the season with manager PJ Phillips, who became the first player-manager for the Admirals. Phillips spent seven seasons in the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim organization after being a 2nd-round pick in the 2005 Major League Baseball draft, and two with the Cincinnati Reds organization before starting his independent baseball career with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League in 2013. Phillips hit exactly .300 with 32 RBI in 52 games with the Admirals in 2014. In 2015, Phillips hit .302 with nine home runs, and a single-season record for doubles in the Pacific Association with 27. His minor league resume and influence over the clubhouse made him the front office's choice for player-manager. Kenneth Owen was hired as Phillips' assistant coach, while Roman Gomez was hired as pitching coach. The Admirals went 32‚Äì46 during the 2016 season. The Admirals did, however, experience a large attendance increase and improved on-field performance. Highlights of the season included a Pacific Association record shattering 99 stolen bases by Darian Sandford, and several players earning awards, including the Pacific Association Rookie of the Year Marquis Hutchinson. Joining Hutchinson were first baseman Lydell Moseby, third baseman Gerald Bautista and right fielder Tim Williams, all who were deemed the best defenders at their positions by the Pacific Association. Just nine games into the 2016 season, closer Tim Holmes became the second Admirals player to advance into affiliated baseball when his contract was purchased by the New York Yankees. In 14 appearances with the Gulf Coast League Yankees, Holmes boasted a 0.59 ERA and 15 strikeouts in 15.1 innings. During the offseason, a pair of Admirals players were signed by affiliated clubs, including second baseman Alian Silva with the Washington Nationals and starter Kida De La Cruz with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In the 2019 offseason, the team was sold to Dave Phinney, a Napa Valley winemaker and one of the partners of the Nimitz Group.  2017 Championship  The Admirals opened their fifth season of Pacific Association play in 2017 by hosting the San Rafael Pacifics on June 2 at Wilson Park. The franchise had two major signings in spring training in their first former big leaguer in reliever Sammy Gervacio, and their first ever former first-round draft pick in outfielder Chevy Clarke. The Admirals drafted Vallejo native and Benicia High product Peter Reyes first overall at the 2017 Pacific Association Tryout. It was the first full season as manager for PJ Phillips, and the team stumbled out to a first-half record of 12‚Äì27. Phillips had to re-tool a roster that had finished at the bottom of the standings in two-straight seasons, and weed out the leftovers from the previous regime that had not bought into his program. Phillips revamped his infield by bringing in Pacific Association veteran David Kiriakos to play shortstop, De La Salle High and Pepperdine University product Chris Fornaci to play third, and University of Texas at Arlington grad Quintin Rohrbaugh to play second base. Infielder Graylin Derke settled in at first base and Phillips brought in new arms to pair with his much-improved infield defense, including UC Bakersfield rookie Mahlik Jones, former Cubs farm hand Andin Diaz, and Iona College's Alex Fishberg. This bolstered a core of returners and new talent who specifically came to Vallejo to play for Phillips, including the returns of outfielder Tillman Pugh and pitchers Tim Holmes and Demetrius Banks. Even though the team began the second half just 1‚Äì6, improvement in their play and energy was visible. The team then went on a 20‚Äì7 run through the month of August, and won the head-to-head match up with the first-half champion Sonoma Stompers 7‚Äì5. That gave the Admirals the tie-breaker for the second-half championship as both teams finished the second half with 24‚Äì15 records. Reyes got the victory to clinch the second-half title by pitching six innings and allowing three runs with just one walk and seven strikeouts in a 12‚Äì5 victory over San Rafael. This put the Admirals in their first ever Pacific Association championship game on September 1, 2017, in Sonoma. Vallejo jumped out to an early lead and were up 9‚Äì1 in the fourth inning. The defending champion Stompers stormed back though and cut it to 9‚Äì8 before the Admirals reclaimed a three-run lead with runs in the eight and ninth inning, and held on to win 11‚Äì8.http://pointstreak.com/baseball/boxscore.html?gameid=431707 It was the first Pacific Association championship for the Vallejo Admirals, and completed a 25-game turnaround from worst to first in one season. Gervacio set the single-season record for saves in the Pacific Association with 18, Banks became the Admirals' single-season leader for strikeouts with 86, and Pugh set the single season record for home runs with 18 and also became the franchise's all-time leader in hits and RBI.

His parents removed during his childhood to Lancashire. Educated at Warrington Grammar School, he entered in his teens the counting-house of Ralli Brothers in Manchester, and continued there till 1886. He completed his education by attending evening classes at Owens College, Manchester, learned Pitman's shorthand, and contributed articles to short-hand manuscript or lithographed magazines. He interested himself in Thomas Fuller, delivered a lecture on him to the Manchester Phonographic Union, which was printed in Henry Pitman's Popular Lecturer, and devoted his holidays to visiting Fuller's various places of residence. In 1881 Bailey started a monthly antiquarian magazine, the Palatine Note-Book, which ran for just over four years and ceased with the forty-ninth number in 1885. He was a Member of the Chetham Society, and served as a Member of Council from 1876 and as Secretary from 1882. Bailey collected works on stenography with a view to writing its history, and built up a valuable library of antiquarian and general literature. In 1886 illness put an end to his studies and projects. He died at Manchester on 23 August 1888, and was buried at Stretford church on 27 August Works In 1874, as the fruit of his researches, Bailey published a life of Thomas Fuller, which gained him admission to the Society of Antiquaries of London, and he was a contributor to the earliest volumes of the Dictionary of National Biography. His collection of Fuller's sermons, completed and edited by W. E. A. Axon, was published in 1891. His other works included: * Life of a Lancashire Rector during the Civil War, 1877. * The Grammar School of Leigh, 1879. * John Whitaker, 1879. * John Dee and the Steganographia of Trithemius, 1879.

In a period of increasing solidification of communist power in Poland but with the political system retaining some formal adherence to multiparty democracy principles, the PSL was a centrist non-communist party that was not allied with the communists. The PSL was defeated by the communist-based bloc in the rigged legislative elections of 1947. Polish People's Party in post-World War II politics A provisional government, declared as the Polish Committee of National Liberation, was established by Polish communists and allied politicians in July 1944 in Lublin, when Poland was being liberated from the Nazi German occupation by the Soviet and Polish armies. The communists were pressured by the United States and Britain, as discussed by their leaders with Joseph Stalin at the Yalta Conference, to admit into the Polish government participants of the democratic opposition, including members of the London- based Polish government-in-exile. Former prime minister of that government, Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk, returned to Poland in June 1945 and became deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture in the so-called Provisional Government of National Unity, dominated by the communists and their allied faction of the Polish Socialist Party. Miko≈Çajczyk revived the prewar agrarian People's Party, led by Wincenty Witos, as his power base. Under Miko≈Çajczyk, the party became the Polish People's Party. The party's goal was to prevent the communists from monopolizing power in Poland, establish a parliamentary system with market economy and to win free elections, which were promised by the Yalta agreements. The hopes of the PSL were based on the party's ability to function legally, run its own network of offices, hold public meetings and publish in its own press. However, such accomplishments were threatened by the often intense harassment and repression, including newspaper censorship, forcible breaking up of party's meetings, and members' arrests, assaults and police intimidation. The armed right-wing underground declared war on all who \\"collaborated\\" with the communists, including Miko≈Çajczyk and his party. Tens of PSL-connected people were killed. The communist attacks and provocations were sometimes presented as actions of the underground; the opposite charge, of PSL cooperation with the armed subversion was also made and led in some instances to banning of PSL activities. In actuality, the PSL press condemned the nationalistic and other armed underground, calling them reactionaries, fascists or bandits and considering the murders and other violent actions committed by them to be criminal acts. The violence and the trials of the underground members were often covered in detail by the PSL newspapers. Miko≈Çajczyk, who issued his own condemnations, feared that a civil war could lead to the Polish state being liquidated. In February 1946, the PSL congress passed the party's general program. It confirmed a neighborly alliance with the Soviet Union and the ongoing reconstruction of the socioeconomic system. The document stated \\"Neither land will return to the great land owners, nor industry to the industrialists or banks to the bankers\\". Miko≈Çajczyk approved the fundamental aspects of the communist-led reform and hoped for the system's democratic evolution, but kept his distance from the communist politics of power. The government in exile, no longer internationally recognized, but holding onto its claim of exclusive legitimacy, renounced Miko≈Çajczyk, its former chief, and declared him a traitor. However, the most important and numerous anti-communist underground organization Freedom and Independence (WiN), which originated from the wartime Home Army, practically supported the PSL and its election effort. Freedom and Independence helped with distribution of printed election materials where obstructed by communist officials and appealed for voting for the PSL. The parliamentary elections took place in January 1947 and were falsified in a number of ways, to defeat the People's Party and ensure the victory of the communists Polish Workers' Party and its allied partners in the so-called Democratic Bloc, which included a rival breakaway peasant party. The PSL for the time being remained legal, but was subjected to still increased suppression. Communist accusations of the PSL's cooperation with the armed underground intensified and culminated in the show \\"Krak√≥w trial\\" of the late summer 1947. Two PSL leaders were tried together with several activists of the WiN underground formation, but unlike the WiN people, they were spared the death sentences. In early October 1947, the PSL's Executive Committee declared that state authorities were preventing PSL's further functioning as a party. Miko≈Çajczyk himself fled to the West on 20 October with American help, to avoid imprisonment and possible execution. The PSL lingered on for another year and a half before its remains were cajoled into merging with the communist-controlled peasant party to form the United People's Party (only a few of Miko≈Çajczyk's people remained within the new structure), a formal participant of the communist-led ruling coalition. Historical context, People's Party's role For the Polish peasant or agrarian movement, the developments following World War II were a continuation of their struggle from the period preceding the war. The movement's leaders, including Miko≈Çajczyk, were deeply opposed to the Polish prewar Sanation regime and saw the communist restrictions on freedom as no different from the Sanation persecution of the peasant movement. In contrast to the period's glorification in post-1989 Poland, after the war the peasant activists' recollections and sentiments were strongly unfavorable. They themselves announced a \\"People's Poland\\" program already before the war. Such factors made the post-war peasant leaders, more than the representatives of other segments of Polish society, inclined to consider compromise political solutions. On the other hand, by the communists organized around the Polish Workers' Party, the Polish People's Party was seen as the greatest threat to the power they held from 1944. The state security apparatus (NKVD terror was also very active and Red Army garrisons were common in the country) concentrated its attacks and other hostile activities on the PSL and in particular on Miko≈Çajczyk, considered the chief enemy from 1945 until the time of the 1947 elections and afterwards. In 1945 the communists pressured Miko≈Çajczyk to join their election bloc, which he refused as an attempt to preempt the elections. In post-1989 Poland, the efforts of the post-war armed underground have been apotheosized by the Institute of National Remembrance and other circles. But Polish society back in the 1940s supported mostly the difficult decision and political fight of Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk. He was received by cheering crowds when in 1945 he flew in from Moscow, where he had participated in the provisional government negotiations. Poland's population was 75% rural and the PSL knew it was capable of electoral victory. Their tactics were resented and considered treasonous by some √©migr√© circles and some had doubts in Poland as well. Miko≈Çajczyk's political compromises went as far as voting together with the communists, as a government member in 1946, for taking away the Polish citizenship from the upper rank military officers who failed to return to Poland from the West after the war. Approving the whole political deal between the Polish communists and Miko≈Çajczyk's PSL (participation in the coalition, but still communist-dominated provisional government), Joseph Stalin had in mind a mission for Miko≈Çajczyk: his designated role was to give legitimacy to the communist rule. After Miko≈Çaczyk's rejection of the scheme had become clear, Stalin instructed Poland's president Boles≈Çaw Bierut to \\"allow\\" the PSL only 7% of the vote in the upcoming national parliamentary election. From the beginning, Miko≈Çajczyk opposed military fight against the communists; he felt that the Yalta and Potsdam agreements gave free elections a fighting chance in Poland and his political instincts required him to follow that route to its conclusion. He would either win or discredit the communists, depriving them in the eyes of the Polish and world opinion of the legitimacy they sought. Some in the PSL wanted confrontation with the communists and quietly supported the armed underground, for example Stefan Korbo≈Ñski. Others in the leadership, notably the prewar activists Czes≈Çaw Wycech and J√≥zef Nieƒáko, felt that in order for the movement to survive, the situation required a more pragmatic approach. After Miko≈Çajczyk's rejection of participation in the pro-communist bloc, they decided to ally their faction with the communist party. In that form the party (United People's Party) and the rural movement survived the decades of communist rule in Poland. Some activists purged from the PSL in the 1940s were able to return and play a constructive role following the Polish thaw of 1956. After 1989, in democratic Poland, the party reformed itself and was able to successfully enter competitive elections, as the Polish People's Party again. Despite Miko≈Çajczyk's political moderation and being the leader of the main compromise faction of his movement, for the communist party chief W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka, whose hatred he attracted, the peasant leader was a personification of a return to Poland's prewar reality. Harassed by Gomu≈Çka, Miko≈Çajczyk had to leave Poland, but even then he remained continuously observed by the communist intelligence. In the eyes of the US Ambassador Arthur Bliss Lane and Western leaders in general, the Polish events, characterized by Miko≈Çajczyk after his flight from Poland as rape, meant the denial of illusions of Soviet political trustworthiness. By forcing the communists to subject themselves to this test, Miko≈Çajczyk, a tragic hero, fulfilled his secondary mission. His primary one was to win democratic elections in Poland.

The bombs exploded in Dilsukhnagar, a crowded shopping area, within of each other. The first explosion occurred outside a roadside eatery named A1 Mirchi, next to the Anand Tiffin Centre and opposite the Konark movie hall, followed by the second one two minutes later near the Route 107 bus stand close to the Venkatadri theatre. Bombings Destroyed bus shelter due to the first blast The first bomb went off at Anand Tiffins, located opposite Konark Theatre at around 19:02 IST (UTC+05:30). The second bomb went off at 19:06 IST between Venkatadri Theatre and Dilsukhnagar Bus Stand. According to the Hyderabad Police, the bombs were placed on bicycles. Andhra Pradesh's Director General of Police noted that Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) had been used in the two blasts to cause maximum damage. The blasts killed 17 people, which included at least three college students and at least 119 injured.  Investigation  A team of forensic experts from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the National Security Guard (NSG) arrived in Hyderabad on a plane provided by the Border Security Force (BSF) for further investigation. Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde claimed that the Indian government had intelligence about possible blasts, but the information wasn't specific enough to pinpoint the location of the blast site. Shinde also said that authorities had received intelligence about possible attacks in the country but no specific information as to where or when they might occur. CNN- IBN reported that an Indian Mujahideen operative named Maqbool confessed to carrying out reconnaissance of Dilsukhnagar in 2012 during interrogation by Delhi Police. Initial reports also suggested the involvement of Indian Mujahideen in the blasts. On 22 February, two First Information Reports (FIR) were lodged probing the attack. One FIR was lodged at Cyberabads Saroor police station, while the second was lodged in Hyderabad. As the Hyderabad Police continued investigating in the serial blasts case, they detained six people for questioning. The NIA conducted raids at various places in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra, looking for alleged terror modules. Forensic investigation revealed that the two bombs used were packed with huge amounts of iron nails and bolts and ammonium nitrate, which were held together with a copper string. Closed-circuit television footage collected from the traffic signal near the blast site revealed movements of five men who allegedly had planted explosives at the blast sites. However, the faces of the suspects were not clearly seen. Police sources later said that a Sai Baba temple in the area was the initial target of the criminal activity. However, a visit by Hyderabad police commissioner Anurag Sharma eluded them and forced them to change their target. The Andhra Pradesh government claimed that it had obtained vital clues regarding the crime and would crack the case soon. Chief minister Reddy sent out 15 special teams of Andhra Pradesh police, consisting of 10‚Äì15 personnel each. People lodged in the Chanchalguda Central Jail were also questioned regarding the blasts.  Response  Major cities in India like Mumbai, New Delhi and Bangalore, Gujarat, Maharashtra and West Bengal were put on high alert after the blasts. The police of Andhra Pradesh were confronted with massive traffic jams when they tried to implement relief and rescue operations. Home secretary R. K. Singh stated that officials from the National Investigation Agency were shifted from Delhi to Hyderabad. Reactions= Domestic = President Pranab Mukherjee offered condolences to the bereaved families and condemned the blasts as \\"acts of cowardice\\". Prime Minister Manmohan Singh consoled the next of kin of those killed and seriously injured. The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Kiran Kumar Reddy, announced a compensation of to the next of kin of those killed in the blasts and promised to bear the medical expenses of the injured. Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde visited the blast site on the morning of 22 February and said that an investigation had been launched by a probe team appointed by the Andhra Pradesh government. On the next day, speaking in the Lok Sabha, Leader of the opposition and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushma Swaraj said political parties must fight non-state terror unitedly while calling out the central and Andhra Pradesh governments for their failure to prevent the twin explosions. \\"The nation needs to be united, the political parties need to get united.

The beach is long from Punta de la Pe√±a to Punta de Tarifa, with an average width of . It is usually differentiated into two zones: North Los Lances, an undeveloped beach away from main population center, and South Los Lances, very close to the town of Tarifa and with extensive human occupation. The R√≠o Jara separates the two areas of the beach. Los Lances' location on the Atlantic side of the Strait of Gibraltar creates unique wind conditions which have made it Europe's foremost destination for kitesurfing. The beach is also a favorite for windsurfing and similar sports, and has ample facilities for participants in these sports. Description The natural beach environment has been much degraded by human activity, despite being protected inside the Natural Park of the Los Lances beach, which is part of the Natural Park of the Strait (Parque Natural del Estrecho). The beach has less natural beauty than others in the area. The dune system is quite degraded by the continuous movement of people, and parking uses much of the secondary dunes. In the northern part, the dunes are separated from the road by a line of pine trees planted to prevent the encroachment of the sand onto the road. This barrier has led, however, to a steady deterioration in the system by reducing the capacity of the dunes to expand. The southern area is in even worse condition. The many urban developments and the discharges of these into nearby streams has caused the disappearance of numerous species and loss of dune dynamics. The Battle of R√≠o Salado, also known as the Battle of Tarifa (30 October 1340), took place near the beach and resulted in a decisive victory of the armies of King Afonso IV of Portugal and King Alfonso XI of Castile against those of the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman of Morocco and the Nasrid sultan Yusuf I of Granada.

Born in Landshut before 1450 (some sources state 1430 as the year of his birth), Ulrich F√ºetrer went to the Latin school in that city before becoming a pupil of the painter Dietrich Ziegler there. He then moved to Munich, where he is noted repeatedly between 1460 and 1494. He started working for the Court of Bavaria-Munich in the 1460s as a writer, working in the same circles as Jakob P√ºterich von Reichertshausen, Johannes Hartlieb and Hans Heselloher. F√ºetrer died, probably in Munich, at the end of the 15th century. Paintings F√ºetrer is named as working together with Gabriel M√§lesskircher on the newly built Gothic Tegernsee Abbey. A Crucifixion from 1457, now in the Alte Pinakothek, is attributed to him. He is also mentioned as having made paintings in the San Andreas Chapel in 1485, and especially for his work on the old Munich city hall between 1470 and 1478. Portrait of Alexander Mornauer, National Gallery, London He has been tentatively identified as the Master of the Mornauer Portrait (now in the National Gallery, London), who is also the painter of a portrait of Sigismund, Archduke of Austria (in the Alte Pinakothek); it is known that Sigismund visited F√ºetrer's household in Landshut in 1467.

He assumed the additional name of Bateman on succeeding to the estate of Halton Park, Lancashire, in 1872. Early life and education Champain was born in Gloucester Place, London, on 22 July 1835, the son of Colonel Agnew Champain (d.1876) of the 9th Regiment of Foot. He was educated at Cheltenham College, and for a short time in fortification and military drawing at the Edinburgh Military Academy under Lieutenant Henry Yule. From 1851 to 1853 he attended the East India Company's Military Seminary at Addiscombe, passing out at the head of his term and receiving the Pollock Medal.Vibart 1894, pp. 603, 695. He obtained a commission as second lieutenant in the Bengal Engineers on 11 June 1853. His later commissions were dated: Lieutenant, 13 July 1857; Captain, 1 September 1863; Major, 5 July 1872; Lieutenant-Colonel, 31 December 1878; and Colonel, 31 December 1882. Indian Rebellion Following a further course of professional instruction in military engineering at Chatham, Champain went to India in 1854. He was appointed assistant principal of the Thomason College of Civil Engineering at Roorkee, but while he was there the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out. He at once saw active service under Colonel Archdale Wilson, was adjutant of sappers and miners at the actions at Ghazi-ud-din-Nagar on the Hindun river on 30 and 31 May, at Badli-ki-Serai under Major-General Henry Barnard on 8 June, and at the capture of the ridge in front of Delhi. During the Siege of Delhi, Champain took his full share of general engineer work in addition to his duties as adjutant, and one of the siege batteries was named after him by order of the chief engineer (Col. Richard Baird Smith) in acknowledgement of his services.Vibart 1894, p. 603. He was wounded by grapeshot on 13 September, but, while still on the sick list, volunteered for duty on 20 September: although still very lame, he was present at the capture of the palace of Delhi. Champain commanded the headquarters detachment of Bengal sappers during the march to Agra, at the capture of Fathpur Sikri, and in numerous minor expeditions. He commanded a mixed force of nearly two thousand men on the march from Agra to Fatehgarh, where he joined the commander-in-chief in December 1857. He commanded the sappers during the march to Cawnpore and to the Alambagh, reverting to the adjutancy in March 1858, when he joined the force under Sir James Outram for the siege of Lucknow by Lord Clyde. During the siege he thrice acted as orderly officer to Sir Robert Napier, by whom he was especially thanked for holding with Captain Medley and one hundred sappers for a whole night the advanced post of Shah Najif, which had been abandoned. After the capture of Lucknow he erected some twenty fortified posts for outlying detachments. In April he was employed under Brigadier-General (afterwards Sir) John Douglas in the Ghazipur and Shahabad districts, was present in fourteen minor engagements, and was thanked in despatches for his services at the action of Ballia. He joined in the pursuit of the rebels, who, after incessant marching and fighting, were driven to the Kaimur Hills and finally defeated and broken up at Salia Dahar on 24 November 1858. He received the medal and clasps. Telegraph work When the rebellion was finally suppressed Champain became executive engineer in the public works department at Goudah, and afterwards at Lucknow. In February 1862 he was selected (at the invitation of the now Colonel Henry Yule) to go with Major (Sir) Patrick Stewart to Persia on government telegraph duty.Vibart 1894, p. 604. At that time there was no electric telegraph from Britain to India, and the lack of one had been urgently felt during the Rebellion. The attempt to construct one under a government guarantee had failed, and it was determined to make a line by the Persian Gulf route directly under government. Champain proceeded with Stewart to Bushehr, and thence in June to Teheran, where negotiations were carried on with the Persian government. In 1865 the line was practically completed, and on Stewart's death in that year Champain was appointed to assist Sir Frederic Goldsmid, the chief director of the Indo-European Government Telegraph department. He spent the greater part of 1866 in Turkey, putting the Baghdad part of the line into an efficient state, and in 1867 went to St. Petersburg to negotiate for a special wire through Russia to join the Persian system. This visit gave rise to close relations with General Alexander von L√ºders, director-general of Russian telegraphs, which proved of advantage to the service. On his way out from England in September 1869, to superintend the laying of a second telegraph cable from Bushehr to Jask, Champain was nearly drowned in the wreck of the SS Carnatic off the island of Shadwan in the Red Sea. After coming to the surface he assisted in saving lives and in securing help.Vibart 1894, pp. 606‚Äì7. In 1870 he succeeded Sir Frederic Goldsmid as chief director of the Indo-European Government Telegraph Department.Vibart 1894, p. 606. From 1870 to 1872 Persia suffered from a severe famine, and Champain took an active interest in the Mansion House relief fund, of which he was for some time secretary. He arranged for the distribution of aid in Persia by the telegraph staff, and had the satisfaction of finding the task very well done. His sound judgment and unfailing tact, together with a power of expressing his views clearly and concisely, enabled him to render important service at the periodical international telegraph conferences as the representative of the Indian government. Special questions frequently arose the settlement of which took him to many of the European capitals, and in the ordinary course of his duties he made repeated visits to India, Turkey, Persia, and the Persian Gulf. In 1884 the Shah of Persia presented him with a magnificent sword of honour. In October 1885 Champain went for the last time to the Persian Gulf to lay a third cable between Bushehr and Jask, afterwards visiting Calcutta to confer with government. On his way home he went to Delhi to see his old friend Sir Frederick Roberts, from whom he learned that he had been made a knight commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, in recognition of his \\"services, during many years, in connection with the telegraph in India\\".Vibart 1894, p. 607. Other activities Champain was a member of the council of the Royal Geographical Society, and of the Society of Telegraph Engineers, of which he was President in 1879. He was also an accomplished draughtsman. In the Albert Hall Exhibition of 1873 a gold medal was awarded to a Persian landscape which he had painted for his friend Sir Robert Murdoch Smith. Many of the illustrations to Sir Frederic Goldsmid's Telegraph and Travel are from original sketches in water-colour by Bateman-Champain. Death In later life, Bateman-Champain suffered from hay fever, asthma, and eventually bronchitis, and in January 1887 he was persuaded to leave England for the Mediterranean for the sake of his health. After spending three weeks at Cannes, France, he went to Sanremo, Italy, where he died on 1 February 1887.Vibart 1894, p. 608. The Shah of Persia sent a telegram to his family expressing his great regret for the loss of Bateman-Champain, \\"qui a laiss√© tant de souvenirs ineffa√ßables en Perse\\" (\\"who has left so many indelible memories in Persia\\"), a very unusual departure from the rigid etiquette of the court of Teheran. Personal life In 1865 Champain married Harriet Sophie Currie, eldest daughter of Sir Frederick Currie, 1st Baronet, who survived him. They had six sons Arthur, Hugh, Claude, Francis, Philip and John, and two daughters Mary Rosaline (wife of Major David John Jackson Hill) and Alice. Three of the sons entered the army; one the navy; and one, John, the church. Harriet Sophie survived her husband's death and died on 14 August 1905.

Biography Thomas Bates was descended from a family long settled in Northumberland. He was born at Matfen, Northumberland, on 21 June 1775, the younger of the two sons of George Bates of Aydon Castle and his wife Diana (d. 1822), daughter of Thomas Moore of Bishop's Castle, Shropshire.ODNB Bates was educated at the grammar school at Haydon Bridge, and afterwards at Witton-le-Wear school, where 'he never joined in his schoolfellows' games, but would sit for hours in the churchyard with a book'Thomas Bell, The history of improved shorthorn or Durham cattle, and the Kirklevington herd, from the notes of the late Thomas Bates, with a memoir, 1871, p.110. At the age of fifteen he was called home to assist in the management of his father's farms. Before he was eighteen he became tenant of his father's patrimony at Aydon White House. In 1795 his mother's first cousin, Arthur Blayney of Gregynog, Montgomeryshire, who had always been expected to leave his property to Thomas (his godson), died, bequeathing all his heritage to Lord Tracy, a stranger in blood ; and this was a great disappointment to Bates and his family. He now threw himself with 'quadrupled energy into an agricultural career,' and on attaining his majority became tenant of his father's small estate of Wark Eals, on North Tyne. Becoming intimate with Matthew and George Culley, through a family marriage. Bates was introduced to a large circle of agricultural acquaintances on the Tees, including Charles and Robert Colling. In 1800, at the age of twenty- five. Bates took a twenty-one years' lease of two large farms at Halton Castle, at a high rent, and with a view to stocking them 'purchased his first shorthorn cows from Charles Colling, giving him for one of them the first one hundred guineas the Collings ever sold a cow for'. He speedily achieved renown as a breeder of taste and judgment, and at Charles Colling's famous Ketton sale in 1810 he bought for 185 guineas a cow called Duchess, which was the foundress of a well-known tribe of shorthorns. He exhibited his cattle at the local shows from 1804 to 1812. Wishing to follow out the principles of George Culley in regard to experiments and trials, he embodied his views in 1807 in an elaborate letter, which he styled An Address to the Board of Agriculture and to the other Agricultural Societies of the Kingdom on the importance of an Institution for ascertaining the merits of different breeds of live stock, pointing out the advantages that will accrue therefrom to the landed interest and the kingdom in general. In 1809-10-11 he spent his winters at the university of Edinburgh to study chemistry, and took, after his fashion, copious notes of the lectures on various subjects he attended. In 1811 he was sufficiently well off to buy a moiety of the manor of Kirklevington, near Yarm, in Cleveland, for ¬£30,000, ¬£20,000 of which he paid in cash. About ten years later, when his lease of Halton ran out, he bought Ridley Hall on the South Tyne, and resided there till 1831. He then removed to Kirklevington, where he lived for the remainder of his life. He engaged in correspondence with most of the leading agriculturists of the day, and aired his own views very freely. Lord Althorp is said to have remarked to another guest when Bates paid him a visit at Wiseton Hall for the Doncaster meeting of 1820, 'Wonderful man! he might become anything, even prime minister, if he would not talk so much'.C. J. Bates, p.164. Bates was a man of remarkable force of character, but his love of argument, his combativeness, and his plain speaking did not make him a universal favourite. Owing to his dissatisfaction with the awards at the Tyneside Society's show in 1812, he gave up showing cattle at agricultural meetings for twenty-six years, and did not again exhibit until the first show of the Yorkshire Agricultural Society, held at York in 1838, when he won five prizes with seven animals. A year later he made a great sensation at the first show of the then newly established English Agricultural Society, held at Oxford in 1839, with his tour shorthorns, all of which won the prizes, and one of which, called 'Duke of Northumberland,' was said to be 'one of the finest bulls ever bred' (Farm. Mag. 1850, p. 2). Bates continued showing and winning prizes at subsequent meetings of the Royal Agricultural Society of England (under which name the English Agricultural Society was incorporated by charter in 1840) and had a great epistolary conflict with the executive after the York show of 1848, the last he attended. Up to 1849 he had enjoyed robust health, living almost in the open air, and very simply ; but a painful disease of the kidneys carried him off on 25 July 1849 at the age of seventy-four. An appreciative obituary in the Farmers' Magazine speaks of his liberality and hospitality, and describes his litigiousness as 'but a nice and discriminating view of public duty': The dispersal of Bates's herd of shorthorns on 9 May 1850 caused great excitement at the time, sixty-eight animals selling for ¬£4,558 1s.A full description is given in Farmers' Magazine 21 (1850), pp.532ff. Bates was never married. A portrait of him at the age of about fifty-five by Sir William Ross, R.A., was engraved for the Farmers' Magazine in 1850, and a reproduction of it appears as the frontispiece of the elaborate biography of 513 pages written by Mr. Cadwallader J. Bates (his great-nephew), and published at Newcastle in 1897 under the title Thomas Bates and the Kirklevington Shorthorns. From this work most of the above facts have been drawn.

She was the founder and director of the World Erotic Art Museum in Miami Beach, Florida, which contains her collection. Early years Wilzig was one of six children born to real estate developer H. Jerome Sisselman, known as the Hackensack Meadowlands czar, who amassed a large tract of land to build Berry‚Äôs Creek Center. Wilzig was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1934. Wilzig graduated from Weequahic High School in Newark, and attended New Jersey‚Äôs Montclair State Teachers College, currently Montclair State University. In the early 1950s she married Siggi Wilzig, an Auschwitz survivor and an early leader of the U.S. Holocaust Museum, as well as president of the Trust Company of New Jersey until his death in 2003. The Wilzigs lived most of their married life in Clifton, New Jersey, and had three children: Ivan, Alan, and Sherry. In 2005, following her husband's death in 2003, Wilzig moved to Miami Beach, Florida. The collector and the museum In 1983 Wilzig began collecting erotic art for herself. Between 2003 and 2005 she accumulated more than 4,000 pieces from around the world. Her personal collection became the base of the World Erotic Art Museum, which opened in 2005. The collection includes \\"Kama Sutra temple carvings from India, peek-a-boo Victorian figurines that flash their booties, and a prop from the sexual thriller 'A Clockwork Orange'\\". Civic activism Numerous organizations have benefited from the insight and service of Wilzig. She served at the helm of many of them: as Founder and a Lifetime Member of Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel; as a member of the Israel Bonds‚Äô President‚Äôs Club; as founder of the Wilzig Hospital Center in Jersey City, N.J.; and the Parents Association of Cardozo Law School of Yeshiva University. She was a Lifetime Member of the Congregation Adas Israel Synagogue in Passaic, N.J., and held the distinction of being the only woman ever honored as Woman of the Year by the Synagogue. Naomi was also a Lifetime Member of the Florida Holocaust Museum in Saint Petersburg.

After training as a house painter (1900‚Äì1904), he attended the Technical School in Aalborg (1903‚Äì1907) before studying art at Kristian Zahrtmann's Kunstnernes Studieskoler in Copenhagen (1907‚Äì1908). From 1908 to 1910, he was a student with Johan Rohde. He travelled to Paris in 1911 with William Scharff and Olaf Rude.Inge M√∏rch Jensen, \\"Axel P. Jensen\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Wilbachs kunstnerleksikon. Retrieved 21 February 2013. Career As a pupil of Zahrtmann and a friend of Olaf Rude, Jais Nielsen and William Scharff, he was one of a small group of Danish modernists who exhibited with De Tretten and later at the Gr√∏nningen. Despite numerous portraits in his early years, he was primarily a landscape painter, deeply attached to the countryside where he spent most of his life. He had an acute sense of the changing seasons, the wind and the weather. He spent most of his time in Blokhus in Vendsyssel in the north of Jutland, painting fields, marshes and sand dunes, sometimes with a few figures and perhaps houses, trees or telephone poles to enhance the composition. Like Fritz Syberg before him, he was one of the few Danes who not only painted summer scenes but also the ploughed fields of the autumn and the cold and wet of winter. Any sense of sadness was however usually dispelled by the bright, colourful texture of his works. In addition to his paintings, Jensen also carried out a series of decorative assignments at the Aarhus Central Post Office (1931) with scenes of the harbour and Jutland's countryside, the reception hall in Frederiksberg Town Hall (1950), and Aalborghallen (1953). He also designed postage stamps including a series celebrating the postal authority's 300th anniversary (1924), an airmail series (1925) and a karavel series (1925).\\"Jensen, Axel Peder\\", Weilbachs Kunsterleksikon J. Retrieved 21 February 2013. Style Despite Zahrtmann's influence, Jensen had a much freer approach to colour. His colourful brushstrokes, even in the shady areas of his paintings, are close to Impressionism. Unlike Rude and Scharff, he was not attracted to Cubism. Inspired by Van Gogh, he later developed tightly knit, rhythmical brushstrokes, producing a distinctly decorative effect. This can be seen above all in his work from 1916 to 1921.\\"Axel P.

Background He was the son of Thomas Baxendell and Mary his wife, n√©e Shepley, and was born at Manchester on 19 April 1815. He received his early education at Thomas Whalley's school in Cheetham Hill, Manchester. He left school at the age of fourteen, but not before his natural love of science had been noticed and fostered by his mother and by his schoolmaster. He made good use of his powers of observation during six years spent at sea from his fourteenth to his twentieth year. In the Pacific he witnessed the shower of meteors in November 1833. When he abandoned seafaring life in 1835 he returned to Manchester, and for a while assisted his father, who was a land steward. Sutton, 1901 Career Baxendall afterwards had a business of his own as an estate agent. From the time of his return to Manchester he pursued, in a quiet unobtrusive way, his studies in astronomy and meteorology, in the former of which pursuits he had the advantage of the use of the observatory of his friend Robert Worthington at Crumpsall Hall, near Manchester. His first contribution to the Royal Astronomical Society was made in 1849. He subsequently wrote for the Royal Society's Proceedings, the Liverpool Astronomical Society's Journal, and several other publications, but the greater and more important portion of his work was contributed to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, of which he became a member in January 1858. In the following year he became a Member of Council, and in 1861 became joint Secretary as well as Editor of the society's 'Proceedings.' The former post he retained until 1885, and the latter until his death. As colleagues in the secretaryship he had Henry Enfield Roscoe until 1873, and afterwards Osborne Reynolds. He was one of the founders of the physical and mathematical section of the society in 1859. He was enrolled as a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1858, but did not become a Fellow of the Royal Society until 1884. In February 1859 he succeeded Henry Halford Jones as astronomer to the Manchester corporation. Some years subsequently he superintended the erection of the Fernley meteorological observatory in Hesketh Park, Southport, and was appointed meteorologist to the corporation of Southport. From 1873 to 1877 he was a member of the Crumpsall local board. His scientific contributions, of which sixty-seven are enumerated in the Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers, have been ably summarised by Dr. J. Bottomley in the paper mentioned below. Of his astronomical observations, perhaps the most important are those embodied in various catalogues of variable stars. His meteorological and terrestrial-magnetical researches were of conspicuous importance, and he was one of the main pioneers in detecting the close connection between those sciences and solar physics. Among other valuable suggestions for the practical application of meteorology was that for the use of storm signals, concerning which he had a protracted controversy with the board of trade. He predicted the long drought of 1868, and helped enable the Manchester corporation to regulate the supply of water and so mitigate the inconvenience that ensued. On another occasion he predicted the outbreak of an epidemic at Southport. His later years were passed at Birkdale, near Southport, where he died on 7 October 1887. In religion he was a churchman and a staunch Anglo-Israelite. Family He married, in 1865, Mary Anne, sister of Norman Robert Pogson, the government astronomer for Madras, and left an only son, named after himself, who succeeded him as meteorologist to the corporation of Southport.

The riots occurred in the Canning subdivision, after a Muslim cleric was killed by unidentified assailants. Following this incident, Muslim mobs burned down over 200 Hindu homes in the villages of Naliakhali, Herobhanga, Gopalpur and Goladogra villages in the Canning police station area. 24 (Two dozen) Hindu-owned shops were looted in Jaynagar police station area under Baruipur subdivision. Incidents of violence were reported from Canning, Jaynagar, Kultali and Basanti police station areas.  Background  On 19 February 2013, shortly after midnight, Indian Standard Time, a Muslim Imam from Ghutiari Sharif in Canning subdivision was returning from a religious congregation at Jamtala in Jaynagar, in a motorcycle along with a colleague. When they reached Naliakhali around 2 a.m., they were intercepted by a gang of waylayers, who robbed the cleric and shot him. According to police sources the cleric was reportedly carrying 1,150,000 in cash that was looted by the unidentified gunmen. The altercation resulted in the death of the Imam, although his companion managed to flee after sustaining injuries. At dawn, the driver of the first bus from Golabari to Canning discovered the body and intimated the Canning police station. Several other bus drivers travelling on that route communicated their findings to the police station. The police initially took the incident casually and made no effort to visit Naliakhali. Police has so far not been able to trace the culprits or even the motive behind the murder and with the murder of another Muslim cleric with large followers in the same district emotionally charged the locals.  Violence  Naliakhali is a Hindu majority village in the Gopalpur panchayat that fell under the executive jurisdiction of the Canning police station. A crowd gathered at the site of the attack and rumors began to spread that the killers were from the village of Naliakhali. Thousands of people from neighbouring areas, such as Canning, Jibantala, Sarengabad, Jhorormore, Narayanpur and Dhoaghata gathered on the site and refused to part with the body of cleric. When the police tried to take away the body of the cleric for processing, the mob attacked the police with s. Anup Kumar Ghosh, the sub-inspector of the police station at Canning, was injured and be admitted to the Canning Sub-divisional Hospital. Seven policemen were injured in the attack. The mob also attacked and damaged police vehicles. In the meantime, neighbors of the killed cleric were transported to Canning from Kolkata in trucks. A local school principal reportedly incited the mob into violence. At around 10 a.m., a heavily armed mob of at least 10,000 began an attack upon Naliakhali. They ed and looted the homes of Bengali Hindus as the residents fled for their lives. The rioters hurled bombs, doused the houses with petrol and set them on fire. Violence and arson spread to nearby locations such as Dhopar More and Bangalpara. Hindu homes and places of business were ed in Gopalpur, Goladogra and Herobhanga. The crowd blocked the road at Bhangankhali, Priyor More, Hospital More and Natunhat. Protesters also staged a rail blocked at Ghutiari Sharif station in the Sonarpur-Canning section of the Sealdah South lines. At around 11 a.m., the South 24 Parganas District Superintendent of Police Praveen Kumar Tripathi, reached the spot along with a massive riot squad and Rapid Action Force battalions. They resorted to a lathi charge in order to pacify and disperse the mob. The body of the Imam was then sent for an autopsy. In the late afternoon reinforcements from the Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate and the Howrah Police Commissionerate reached with water cannons to douse the flames of the burning village. The police evoked Section-144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and established a curfew in the area.  Aftermath  In the violence, more than 200 houses were burnt in several villages that came under the jurisdictions of the Canning, Jaynagar, Kultali and Basanti police stations, displacing more than 2,000 people. Some of the displaced people took shelter in makeshift relief camps while others had to live on the road. The state government announced a compensation of 300,000 to the family of the murdered cleric and 10,000 to each of the 93 families displaced by the violence. 52 people were arrested by the police in connection with the violence. Some NGOs have provided food and medicine to the affected region in Naliakhali.

Locsin attended public school from Grades I to IV and later transferred to Ateneo de Manila where he stayed on until he completed his Associate in Arts degree. At the University of Santo Tomas, he took up law. After graduation, he immediately passed the bar and went into practice. Career Soon he joined the Philippines Free Press magazine as an editorial member in 1939. This marked the start of his 61-year career in journalism. During World War II, when the Free Press was shut down, Locsin fled to Negros Occidental to join the Philippine resistance against Japan. Upon resumption of Free Press‚Äô operations, he rejoined it and became its editor in 1963. Aside from his editorship of The Philippines Free Press, Locsin also penned The Heroic Confession, a novel about Jos√© Rizal, Fragments and Ruins, a collection of poems, Trial and Error, a collection of short stories, among others. When Locsin was editor of the Philippines Free Press, one of the oldest and most respected weekly magazines in the country, the magazine was among those that repeatedly warned of a plan by then-president Ferdinand Marcos to implement martial law to stay in power. Thus, when Marcos declared martial law in 1972 the magazine was closed. Marcos detained Locsin in a military camp, Fort Andres Bonifacio, for several months, along with a fellow journalist, publisher Joaquin Roces, and thousands of other opposition leaders. Locsin refused an offer by Marcos to return his printing press and publish his magazine again because he believed it would have been used by Marcos as a mouthpiece of the martial law government. The magazine resumed publication shortly after Marcos was ousted in a People Power Revolution in February 1986. Recognition Locsin‚Äôs notable awards are the TOFIL Award, the Philippine Legion of Honor, \\"Outstanding Newspaperman for 1956‚Äù by the Confederation of Filipino Veterans, and ‚ÄúRizal pro Patria Award‚Äù in 1961. Personal life He was married to his wife, Rosario, and had three sons, Henry, Ramon and Teodoro Jr., former publisher and editor of the newspaper The Philippines Today. Death Teodoro Locsin Sr. died from cancer on January 22, 2000 at Makati Medical Center, a suburb of Metro Manila.

It also comprised a response to perceptions that the law as it stood was giving rise to libel tourism and other inappropriate claims. The Act changed existing criteria for a successful claim, by requiring claimants to show actual or probable serious harm (which, in the case of for-profit bodies, is restricted to serious financial loss), before suing for defamation in England or Wales, setting limits on geographical relevance, removing the previous presumption in favour of a trial by jury, and curtailing sharply the scope for claims of continuing defamation (in which republication or continued visibility constitutes ongoing renewed defamation). It also enhanced existing defences, by introducing a defence for website operators hosting user-generated content (provided they comply with a procedure to enable the complainant to resolve disputes directly with the author of the material concerned or otherwise remove it), and introducing new statutory defences of truth, honest opinion, and \\"publication on a matter of public interest\\" or privileged publications (including peer reviewed scientific journals), to replace the common law defences of justification, fair comment, and the Reynolds defence respectively. However, it did not quite codify defamation law into a single statute. The Defamation Act 2013 applies to causes of action occurring after its commencement on 1 January 2014; old libel law will therefore still apply to many 2014‚Äì15 defamation cases where the events complained of took place before commencement. Changes and repeals The Act changed a number of defamation procedures. All defamation cases under the Senior Courts Act 1981 in the Queens Bench Division, and the County Courts Act 1984, which were \\"tried with a jury\\" unless the trial requires prolonged examination of documents, are now \\"tried without a jury\\", unless the court orders otherwise. Such cases are referred through a Defamation Recognition Commission (DRC) to a new Independent Regulatory Board (IRB), to provide arbitration services. The courts should take into account, when awarding costs and damages, whether either party in a dispute has chosen not to use the arbitration service. A successful party is required to pay all of the proceedings costs, if such a party unreasonably refused to use the arbitration service. Judgment awards of exemplary damages, where a defendant is guilty of breach of a defendant's rights, can take into account whether either party refused to use, or join the arbitration service. Courts should take into account whether defendant first sought advice from the IRB before publication. * The common law defence of justification is abolished, as such section 5 of the Defamation Act 1952 (justification) is repealed. * The common law defence of fair comment is abolished, as such, section 6 of the Defamation Act 1952 (fair comment) is repealed. * The common law defence known as the Reynolds defence is abolished. * Section 8 of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (defamation actions) is amended. * The Slander of Women Act 1891 is repealed. * The publication of a statement that conveys the imputation that a person has a contagious or infectious disease does not give rise to a cause of action for slander unless the publication causes the person special damage. Defences *Requirement of serious harm: \\"A statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant\\". *Truth: It is a defence for defamation to show the imputation in the statement complained of is substantially true. If one or more of the imputations is not true, the defence does not fail if the imputations not shown to be true do not seriously harm the claimant's reputation. The common law defence of justification is abolished, as such section 5 of the Defamation Act 1952 is repealed. *Honest opinion: It is a defence for defamation, to show the statement complained of was a statement of opinion; that it indicated, in general or specific terms, the basis of the opinion; that an honest person could have held the opinion on any fact which existed when the statement was published, including any fact in a privileged statement that was pre- published. The defence is defeated if the claimant shows the defendant did not hold the opinion. Opinion does not apply where the statement was published by the defendant, but made by another person (the author), and in such a case the defence is defeated if the defendant knew, or ought to have known, the author did not hold the opinion. A statement is a \\"privileged statement\\" if the person responsible for its publication could prove it was a publication on matter of public interest, or was a peer-reviewed statement in scientific or academic journal, Defamation Act 1996 reports of court proceedings protected by absolute privilege, or under other reports protected by qualified privilege. The common law defence of fair comment is abolished; as such, section 6 of the Defamation Act 1952 is repealed. *Public interest: It is a defence to show the statement complained of was, or formed part of, a matter of public interest, and a publication was reasonably believed to be in the public interest. If the statement was a part of a dispute to which the claimant was a party, the court determines whether it was in the public interest, and must disregard the defendant's omissions to verify the truth of the imputation. In determining a reasonable belief of public interest, the court must make allowance for editorial judgment. For the avoidance of doubt, the defence may be relied upon irrespective of whether it is a statement of fact or a statement of opinion. The common law defence known as the Reynolds defence is abolished. *Peer-reviewed statement in a scientific or academic journal: The publication of a statement in a scientific or academic journal (whether published in electronic form or otherwise) is privileged if the statement relates to a scientific or academic matter, and, before it was published, an independent review of the statement's merit was carried out by the journal's editor and persons with expertise in the matter concerned. Where the statement is privileged, any assessment, extract or summary of the statement's merit is also privileged. A publication is not privileged if it is shown to be made with malice. This defence is not to be construed as protecting the publication of matter prohibited by law. =Websites= *Operators of websites: In an action against a website operator, on a statement posted on the website, it is a defence to show that it was not the operator who posted the statement on the website. The defence is defeated if it was not possible for the claimant to identify the person who posted the statement, or the claimant gave the operator a notice of complaint and the operator failed to respond in accordance with regulations. A claimant can \\"identify\\" a person only if they have sufficient information to bring proceedings against the person. Regulations (made by the Secretary of State) may determine the action to be taken in response to a notice of complaint, such as identity, contact details and time limits for removals, subject to the court's discretion. A notice of complaint must specify the complainant's name, the statement concerned and explain why it is defamatory, and specify where on the website it was posted. Where a court gives judgment for the claimant in an action the court may order the defendant to publish a summary of the judgment.

Non-natural persons performing a public function do not have an action in defamation against any statement concerning that function. *Action against a person not domiciled in the UK or a Member State of the European Union: This section applies to an action for defamation against a person who is not domiciled in the United Kingdom, in another member state, or in a state being a contracting party to the Brussels Regulations of the Lugano Convention which was the Convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Kingdom of Denmark signed on behalf of the European Community on 30 October 2007. A court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action, unless the court is satisfied that, of all the places in which the statement complained of has been published, England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate. A person is domiciled in the United Kingdom or in another member state if the person is domiciled there for the purposes of the Brussels Regulation. Northern Ireland At the behest of Finance Minister Sammy Wilson, the Northern Ireland Assembly refused to approve the new Defamation Act, meaning the old UK laws still apply there. Proponents of the law and Irish authors have warned that Belfast might replace London as the new capital for \\"libel tourism\\". Additionally, there are worries that UK newspapers would either need to end Northern Ireland editions, or else be forced to comply by the old guidelines in their stories.

He is a distant relative of the Stratford and Taylor families. In the 1760s, with Humphrey Porter, a doctor at Aylesford, Kent, Perfect conducted an extensive programme of inoculation against smallpox, in Kent and further afield.Black, p.44 Also in the 1760s, he began to accommodate mentally ill people in his home, a practice that continued until his death in 1809, when his son George took over until 1815.Black, pp. 50ff The West Malling Asylum, which soon after moved to Malling Place, West Malling, continued to function through the 20th century as a principal private mental hospital in the county.

He was convinced of the role of heredity, and recognized the involvement of the brain, its vessels, and its membranes. In one case report, he noted how \\"gentle treatment contributed much to the case and should always be adopted in preference to rigorous measures (where possible)‚Ä¶ The proper management ‚Ä¶ is more to be depended upon than medicine, but when both are judicially and humanely blended, the patient has always the best chance of recovery.\\" Perfect joined the Freemasons in 1765, following the early death of his first wife Elizabeth Shrimpton (1735-1763), and became Provincial Grand Master of Kent from 1795 until his death.Black, pp. 35ff In 1795, the Freemasons' magazine published his memoirs.

While some of these fires harmed the village by destroying important businesses, including a major factory on South Main, others ultimately benefited the community by destroying ramshackle buildings and forcing the construction of better structures. Following the Civil War, Mechanicsburg entered into a boom period, and the Village Hobby Shop was one of numerous commercial buildings erected during the period. Mechanicsburg had always served as the commercial center for farmers in the nearby countryside, but the boom of the late nineteenth century saw its commerce expand substantially; by 1890, one could buy drugs and jewelry downtown, as well as groceries and dry goods.Recchie, Nancy.

Numerous architectural elements combine to make it a clear example of the Italianate style of architecture, including the massive arches over the large display windows, a small cornice over the entrance and windows, and the imitation arcade situated underneath the bracketed upper cornice. Preservation In 1985, the Village Hobby Shop was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of its place in Ohio's history. It was part of a multiple property submission of approximately twenty buildings, scattered throughout the village in such a low concentration that a historic district designation was not practical. Many of the twenty buildings were residences or churches, but the Hobby Shop was one of several commercial buildings in the group, along with Hamer's General Store, the Magruder Building, the 1830 Lawler's Tavern, and the four buildings of the Mechanicsburg Commercial Historic District.

It sits at the intersection of Highway 588 and Highway 593. Now operated as a restaurant, it was constructed in 1907 as a major station along the Port Arthur, Duluth and Western Railway. It is also currently home to the Silver Mountain and Area Historical Society. History The history of the Silver Mountain area dates back to 1881 when prospector Oliver Daunais discovered silver southwest of Thunder Bay.Keith Denis ‚ÄúOliver Daunais-The Silver King‚Äù in Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society Paper & Records Vol. II, 1974 This discovery became the Rabbit Mountain Mine in 1882, and quickly a number of other mines were opened in the same vicinity. In 1884 Daunais would locate silver further west of the Rabbit Mine around an 1800-foot hill that would eventually bear the name ‚ÄúSilver Mountain.‚Äù Two mines were constructed on either side of the mountain; Silver Mountain East End and Silver Mountain West End.Report of the Proceedings of the Association of Dominion Land Surveyors Ottawa: A.S. Woodburn, 1891 In 1889 the Port Arthur, Duluth and Western Railway (PAD&W;) was constructed into the area to exploit these mines, as well as iron deposits closer to the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border at Gunflint Lake. To serve the workings at Silver Mountain, a station was established on the railway several kilometres north of the mines and 39 miles from the town of Port Arthur, Ontario. This station was a crude log structure that measured 10 x 20 feet. In 1899 the PAD&W; was sold to William Mackenzie and Donald Mann and later became part of Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR). Responding to an increase in business in the area, CNoR decided to construct a larger station at Silver Mountain. Plans were announced in March 1907 and the building was completed shortly thereafter. The new station was a two-storey structure with an attached freight shed that measured 50 x 25. It was a typical Canadian Northern Railway 3rd Class Station built according to Plan 100-3 and designed by Ralph Benjamin Pratt. Silver Mountain Station c.1910. In 1910 the station became home to its most colourful and interesting resident. Dorothea Mitchell, affectionately known as the ‚ÄúLady Lumberjack,‚Äù arrived at Silver Mountain just as the silver mines were closing. She convinced Canadian Northern to allow her to stay on as manager and postmistress at the station. When the general store she ran out the station proved less than profitable, Dorothea purchased a sawmill and waded into the lumber business. Thus was born the legend of the Lady Lumberjack. In 1919 the bankrupt CNoR was nationalized into the Canadian National Railways (CNR) and the line became known as the CNR-North Lake Sub-Division. The station remained open, but business on the ‚ÄúPD‚Äù line continued to decline. In March 1938, the last rain ran on the line. After years of operating losses and deteriorating infrastructure, CNR decided to abandon the line and the rails were removed the following year. For over 25 years the station served as a private residence. Beginning in the early 1970s, four successive owners would alter the existing structure. A basement was added, along with a stone fireplace, and additions to the front, rear and second storey. The renovations transformed the station into a bar, and later a restaurant. Today In June 2010 the station property was purchased by current owner David Chevalier and operation of the restaurant was turned over to his sister-in-law, Shelley Simon. Restaurant no longer operating. North Lake Station When Canadian Northern constructed the station at Silver Mountain in 1907, they also erected an exact copy at North Lake, 31 miles to the west. It served as the terminus of the railway until 1923 when trains stopped running past Mackies (mile 46) on Whitefish Lake. Silver Mountain and Area Historical Society Operating out of the historic building is the newly created Silver Mountain and Area Historical Society. Formed in October 2012, the SMHS is a group dedicated to preserving and promoting the history of the area around Silver Mountain southwest to the Boundary Waters between Canada and the United States. A non-profit organization, the society's mandate includes the Port Arthur, Duluth and Western Railway, the Station and the cultural and economic history of the area, such as settlements, mining and logging. The society is governed by an elected board of directors and is affiliated with the Ontario Historical Society.

It was first aired on 27 February 2013 and went off-air on 10 July 2013. The serial was directed by Fahim Burney and written by Sarwat Nazeer. It was produced by Syed Afzal Ali and Momina Duraid, starring Sohai Ali Abro, Goher Mumtaz, Azfar Rehman, Ayesha Omar and Saba Hameed. It also aired in India on Zindagi under the same name.  Plot  The story starts with a flashback. Faiz (Goher Mumtaz) was married to Arzoo (Ayesha Omer) and loved her a lot. They had two children, but Arzoo wanted to be a working woman, not a mother. She meets Mohsin (Azfar Rehman) and he promises to give her everything she wants, so she leaves Faiz and marries Mohsin. Faiz is living a broken-hearted and bitter life, when his mother (Saba Hameed) makes him marry for the second time, against his will. His mother chooses a young woman from a lower-middle-class family named Jia (Sohai Ali Abro). Jia does not agree to this as she wants to marry her cousin. She goes to Faiz's office and rejects him, where Faiz realizes that he cannot be defeated by any woman again. Using his contacts he get Jia's cousin transferred to Dubai. Jia's cousin tells her to wait for their marriage, and Jia realizes that he is a selfish man, so she decides to marry Faiz. On the first night of their marriage, Jia finds out that Faiz has two children and is in shock. Faiz tells her that he only married her for the sake of his mother and his children. She asks her brother why he hid this truth from her, to which he replies that he only did it for her secure future. Jia's mother (Farah Nadeem) eventually finds out the truth and is devastated. In the first few days, the children hate her but eventually the children and Faiz get closer to her. Slowly, Jia's family start to accept her step-children as well. Arzoo learns about this and tries to meet with her kids more often, as she doesn't want them to forget her. She becomes jealous of Faiz and Jia's relationship, as she feels that Faiz had truly loved none other than her. She brings her children to her and Mohsin's house, to which Mohsin disagrees. He screams and misbehaves with the children causing them to leave. She tries to apologize to her children, but they still don't talk to her. Arzoo starts regretting leaving Faiz for some time and calls him with the excuse of talking to the children, to which he says that he is going on honeymoon to Bangkok and the children are gone. Arzoo gets jealous and asks Mohsin to take her to Bangkok as well. Throughout this time, Mohsin is shown to be having an affair with Arzoo's friend and that both of them are using Arzoo for her money. Faiz and Jia are followed by Arzoo to Bangkok. Mohsin helps Jia as she was chased by a few robbers. Meanwhile, Faiz and Arzoo meet as Arzoo calls Faiz as she exchanges the phones purposely. When Jia finds out that Mohsin and Arzoo are in Bangkok she freaks out fearing that she will lose Faiz to Arzoo. Faiz tells Jia that he loves her. Meanwhile, Arzoo continues to stalk Faiz and Jia. Faiz and Jia go back to Pakistan after Jia's brother has an accident. Around that time Zubair returns to Pakistan. Arzoo hires him for her own gain to make Faiz, believe that Jia is cheating on him with Zubair. He believes it when he sees Zubair and Jia at the beach talking to each other not knowing that Jia is asking him to leave her alone. Faiz kicks Jia out, and she is sent back home. Jia is devastated so her brother goes to talk to Faiz and sees that he has invited Arzoo back into his home. Arzoo and Mohsin are also in cahoots as he wants everything from her including properties and money. Arzoo refuses and tries to sue him. Zubair is told that Arzoo is Faiz's ex- wife so he quits his job. The children return to find out that Arzoo is living there; they are not happy because they want Jia back. They go the next day and ask Jia to come back home. Since Jia loves them she agrees. Faiz asks what Jia is doing there and tells her to leave, he gives her the divorce papers to sign. Mohsin divorces Arzoo, and she tells him to be happy. Faiz meets with Mohsin and finds out that Arzoo lied to him when she said she didn't want anything. Faiz apologizes to Jia as does Zubair about their behavior towards her. Arzoo is shocked by the turn of events when she sees Jia, Faiz and the kids going out for dinner and the kids tell her that she isn't their mother. Then Arzoo goes to Mohsin there she finds him with her friend: Mohsin tells her he's leaving her for her friend, Anum. The end shows an angry Arzoo going back to her home alone crying. She goes into her room and starts saying that she has everything then why is she crying. Then she is drawing on the floor with her finger and starts laughing.

He was the first physician and superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane, renamed in 1823 to McLean Hospital, part of the Massachusetts General Hospital system, and the first mental hospital in the state. Early life Wyman was born into a middle- class family in Woburn, Massachusetts, whose forebears had arrived in the state in the mid-seventeenth century. He received his early education at the local school, and then graduated from Westford Academy. He entered Harvard College in 1795 and graduated with from its medical school in 1799. He spent a year teaching school before starting his medical training with Samuel Brown and John Jeffries. He practiced with Jeffries for one year then moved to Chelmsford, Massachusetts where he established his practice. He was appointed a justice of the peace and came to be known as a compassionate and intelligent physician. He married in 1810 and the family grew to four sons and one daughter. Wyman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1812. Career at asylum In Boston, a group of prominent citizens planned to establish a hospital to include an asylum for the insane since only one almshouse provided care. A corporation was formed, a charter was received from the State legislature, and fund raising was undertaken. An estate was purchased in Charleston to house the asylum. The mansion became the superintendents‚Äô residence. The Trustees appointed Wyman as the first superintendent and physician of the asylum. Before taking office, the Trustees sent Wyman to New York and Philadelphia to inspect the existing asylums at New York Hospital and the Pennsylvania Hospital. Wyman and his family moved to his new post in 1818. Wyman was the only physician at the asylum for 17 years. An assistant physician was appointed who helped in the apothecary to distribute medicine, maintained medical records, and visited patients daily. In 1823, the Trustees appointed a steward to take over the business duties of the asylum which allowed Wyman to carry on as physician. Wyman had become acquainted with moral reformers‚Äô treatment instituted at the Retreat at York, an asylum run by the Quaker community and William Tuke. Wyman instituted Tuke‚Äôs treatment at the Asylum for the Insane. He added occupation and recreation therapies for patients, and limited or removed the use of restraints. At times, patients shared meals with Wyman‚Äôs family in the mansion. The number of patients to the Asylum for the Insane gradually increased. By 1821, 146 patients had been admitted. The growing need for more patient space led the Trustees to build additions and new houses. The opening of the Worcester State Hospital in 1833 directed indigent patients there, thus allowing McLean to admit more affluent patients which improved its finances. Publications Wyman wrote several professional papers, other than his annual reports for the hospital‚Äôs Trustees. In 1816, he anonymously published a pamphlet titled ‚ÄúRemarks on the Observations of the Lord‚Äôs Day.‚Äù In 1830, he gave the annual address to the Massachusetts Medical Society titled ‚ÄúA Discourse on Mental Philosophy as Connected to Mental Disease.‚Äù In 1832, Wyman suffered from poor health and tendered his resignation from the hospital. He returned to McLean for three more years, and in 1835, retired to Roxbury with his family. He died in 1842 of a lung affection. Wyman‚Äôs legacy was to leave an institution that became a leader in the treatment of mental illness in the United States during the nineteenth century. He was succeeded by his assistant, who served for only a year, then Dr. Luther V. Bell, who served as superintendent to the McLean Asylum from 1837 to 1855, and became a leader in psychiatry. Personal life Wyman married Elizabeth \\"Nancy\\" Morrill (1784-1843), daughter of a prosperous merchant. Their sons Morrill (1812-1903) and Jeffries (1814-1874) both trained as doctors; Morrill was a prominent physician who was active in his community, while Jeffries became a naturalist and the first curator of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.

Some dashcams include a camera to record the interior of the car in 360 degrees inside camera, usually in a ball form and can automatically send pictures and video using 4G. EDRs and some dashcams also record acceleration/deceleration g-force, speed, steering angle, GPS data, etc. A wide-angle 130, 170¬∞ or more front camera may be attached to the interior windscreen, to the rear-view mirror (clip on), or to the top of the dashboard, by suction cup or adhesive-tape mount. A rear camera is usually mounted in the rear window or in the registration plate, with a RCA video output to the display monitor/screen. The resolution will determine the overall quality of the video. Full HD or 1080p (1920√ó1080) is standard for dash HD cams. Dash cameras may have 1080p, 1296p, 1440p, or higher definition for a front camera and 720p for a back camera and include f/1.8 aperture and night vision mode. Dashcams can provide video evidence in the event of a road accident. When parked, dashcams can capture video and picture evidence if vandalism is detected by 360¬∞ parking monitor and send it to the owner usually employing 4G. Types Fisheye camera image. By targeted field of view: *exterior view such as for recording the front view only, the back view, etc. *cabin or inside viewing mode sometimes also called a taxicam and Uber/Lyft cam. Some cabin cams include a screen also known as a rear view mirror dash cam) that can be attached to the rear-view mirror employing usually rubble rings or straps or as a direct replacement of the rear view mirror itself. Others attach to the windshield, dash, or other suitable interior surfaces Many dashcams include rechargeable batteries not needed when connected to car battery wire or capacitors. Functions To ensure that recorded video files are not tampered with once they have been recorded, videos can be timestamped in a tamper-proof manner, a procedure termed trusted timestamping. To ensure a reliable 24/7 parking surveillance when capacity is an issue, a motion detector may be used to record only when an approaching human/vehicle is detected, in order to save power and storage media. Advanced driver assistance system ADAS and park location save can be included. G-sensor Dashcams with a G-sensor ensure that recordings of a collision are not overwritten by new data usually by storing them in a separate folder and/or making them read- only. The G-sensor ensures that the dashcam makes separate recordings.  Radar detector  The integrated radar detector responds to police radars and warns the driver about approaching them, as a rule, with a sound signal.  Screen Some dashcams include touch screens, which vary in size the wider ones are usually mounted on the rearview mirror. SD, satellite and wireless Dashcams usually use class 10 or above MicroSDHC or MicroSDXC cards usually 16 GB or higher or internal memory to save videos. The port to connect the GPS antenna can use a micro USB or 3.5 mm jack connection. The antenna is usually 1575 to 1568 MHz and 3.0 to 5.0 V. GPS coordinate stamping capability is included in most dashcams (some need an external GPS antenna, but other dashcam systems have built-in GPS), and others include GPS (online and offline) navigation. Some dashcams include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 4G connectivity. For Bluetooth and voice commands and recording, a built-in microphone is included. 4G triple-cam (also called triple-lens and three-way- cams) sets on rearview mirror are becoming more available (2 front cameras - one 170¬∞ to mainly record road, one 360¬∞ for sides and doors and a rear camera). 4G is used to send messages, calls, pictures, and videos in parking surveillance mode. Usually a second 360¬∞ camera is employed to record the car's sides front doors and windows and inside. Also, 4G is used to send message when car battery is low. Hardwire Dashcam units usually operate via the vehicle electrical system, converting the 13.8V to a 5V USB connector. Dashcams can be plugged in via the cigarette lighter socket, or may be hardwired directly into the electrical system, freeing up the power outlet for other uses. Culture Dashcam recording of the Chelyabinsk meteor Dashcams are widespread in Russia as a guard against police corruption and insurance fraud, where they provide additional evidence. They have been called \\"ubiquitous\\" and \\"an on-line obsession,\\" and are so prevalent that dashcam footage was the most common footage of the February 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, which was documented from at least a dozen angles. Thousands of videos showing automobile and aircraft crashes, close calls, and attempts at insurance fraud have been uploaded to social sharing websites such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Yandex, and other websites. In the United Kingdom, sales of dashcams rocketed in 2015, which was the fastest growing consumer electronic, with sales increasing by 395%. In China, dashcams were well known by a dramatic event of a road rage. Dashcams have also captured numerous aviation accidents, such as National Airlines Flight 102 in 2013, TransAsia Airways Flight 235 in 2015 and the Shoreham Airshow crash in 2015. Dashboard cameras have become the top feature wanted by future vehicle buyers and more car manufacturers are incorporating built-in camera systems. Legality While dashcams are gaining in popularity as a way of protection against distortion of facts, they also attract negative attitudes for privacy concerns. This is also reflected in the laws of different countries in different and conflicting ways: *They are popular in many parts of Asia, Europe particularly the United Kingdom, France, and Russia, where they are explicitly allowed by regulations issued in 2009 by the Ministry of the Interior, Australia, and the United States. *Austria prohibits their use if the main purpose is surveillance, which may carry fines of up to ‚Ç¨ 10,000. Other uses are legal, although the distinction can be difficult to make. *In Switzerland, their use is strongly discouraged in public space as they may contravene data protection principles. *In Germany, while small cameras for personal use in vehicles are allowed, posting footage from them on social-media sites is considered a violation of privacy and thus forbidden, if personal data is not blurred in the footage. Recently, the Federal Court of Justice ruled that although the permanent recording of traffic events is inadmissible under national data protection law, the recordings made may nevertheless be used as evidence in civil proceedings after careful consideration of the interests involved. It can be assumed that this case law will also apply under the new basic European Data Protection Regulation. *In Luxembourg, it is not illegal to possess a dashcam but it is illegal to use one to capture videos or still images in a public place which includes in a vehicle on a public road. Recording using a dashcam may result in a fine or imprisonment. *In Australia, recording on public roadways is allowed as long as the recording does not infringe upon one's personal privacy in a way that may be deemed inappropriate in a court of law. *In the United States, at the federal level, the video taping of public events is protected under the First Amendment right.Opinion granting motion to dismiss. Maryland v. Graber. Retrieved 15 March 2016. Videotaping of non-public events and videotaping-related issues, including sound recording and matters related to time of the day, venue, manner of recording, privacy concerns, implications on motor vehicle moving violation issues such as whether the windshield view is being blocked, are dealt with at the state level. ** In the state of Maryland, for example, it is illegal to record anybody's voice without their consent, but it is legal to record without the other party's consent if the non- consenting party does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the conversation that is being recorded. ** In other states, including Illinois and Massachusetts, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy clause, and in such states, the person doing the recording would always be in violation of the law. ** In Illinois, a law was passed that made it illegal to record law enforcement officers even while in the performance of their public official duties. This was struck down when, in December 2014, then-governor Pat Quinn signed into law an amendment that limits the statute to the surreptitious recording of private conversations and electronic communications. *In Russia, there is no law allowing or prohibiting recorders; courts almost always use the video recorder attached to the analysis of the accident as evidence of guilt or innocence of the driver. Police use Police departments use dashcams in police vehicles to gather evidence during traffic stops and car chases. Some dashcam systems can be automatically activated when a police car's emergency lights or siren are turned on. Freedom of information laws mean that the footage can be released under some circumstances, and this can be an important tool in reporting on police actions. TV shows like World's Wildest Police Videos have frequently featured car chase videos shot from dashcams. Some police officers accused of police brutality tamper with their cameras to disable audio or video recording. A report in 2016 showed that in Chicago, 80% of the police dashcams did not work properly. Among the causes were that officers destroyed antennas, hid microphones, and removed batteries.Time: Chicago Police Officers Sabotaged Dashcams to Block Audio, Report Says 2016-01-28, time.com, accessed 2020-09-03 See also * Android Auto * Anthony Graber * Glik v.

Clayoquot Sound. Historica Dominion. Retrieved on: November 8, 2012. The timber resources of Clayoquot Sound attracted growing numbers of foreigners, limiting access of indigenous peoples to land and creating increasing displeasure among the local population. In the 1980s and 1990s, government support of private company resource extraction allowed for the growth of this industry over time, resulting in the presence of logging companies in Clayoquot Sound The differing opinions between these groups led the First Nations to develop lobbying organizations and a series of negotiations over logging practices. In the late 1980s, the situation escalated when MacMillan Bloedel secured a permit to log Meares Island. From 1980 to 1994 several peaceful protests and blockades of logging roads occurred, with the largest in the mid-1993, when over 800 protesters were arrested and many put on trial. Protesters included local residents of the Sound, the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation and Ahousaht First Nation, and environmentalist groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of Clayoquot Sound. The logging protests and blockades received worldwide mass media attention, creating national support for the environmental movement in British Columbia and fostering strong advocacy for anti-logging campaigns. Media focused on the mass arrests of people engaging in peaceful protests and blockades, aggression and intimidation from law enforcement, which served to strengthen public support for nonviolent protests. Background The region had been populated by Indigenous communities for millennia before the arrival of colonial European explorers in the 18th century. In 1774, the first European to arrive in Tofino was Spaniard Juan Jos√© P√©rez Hern√°ndez. Hern√°ndez and his crew recognized the potential wealth of the region's resources, such as fish and timber. Afterwards, several trading posts were erected and operated for a little over a century. In 1899, the first Catholic mission was built. Over time, the region's prosperity fluctuated similarly to many other frontier settlements, due to difficulty accessing the region from a lack of roads. In 1959, a logging road was built to Tofino, marking the beginning of the region's commercial exploitation of resources. This allowed the fishing industry to take off and by 1964, four hundred boats were tied up at the Tofino Harbor at once. On May 4, 1971 an official dedication ceremony created Pacific Rim National Park in Clayoquot Sound. As a result, the 1959 logging road was paved in order to access Tofino. Prior to this, logging companies had been investing into the region: with easier access, natural resources could now be exploited on a larger scale. As timber supply in the small operations in the Kennedy Lake and Ucluelet area began to diminish the logging companies' presence near Tofino increased. Nuu-chah-nulth logging road blockade site Beginning in the 1980s, what was considered 'unrestricted logging' provoked significant public protests. It began when MacMillan Bloedel announced to begin logging on Meares Island. Leaders of the Nuu-chah-nulth tribe rejected this proposal. In 1984, MacMillan Bloedel workers arrived at Meares Island where they were met by the Nuu-chah-nulth, local environmentalists and other supporters blockading the road. To prevent logging operations from continuing, protesters declared the island a Tribal Park. MacMillan Bloedel attempted to override this with a court injunction, succeeding in their aims. However, in 1985 the Ahousaht and Tia-o-qui-aht First Nations acquired their own injunction to halt logging on the island, at least until the Nuu-chah-nulth's concerns had been addressed in the form of a treaty. Similar protests continued to run into the late 1980s and throughout Clayoquot Sound. These protests posed difficulties for locals who worked in the lumber industry. The blockades prevented these workers from completing their jobs, which meant they would not be paid. In 1988, the Tin Wis Coalition was created allowing workers, environmentalists, and aboriginals to discuss mutually beneficial changes. In October 1990 the coalition ceased shortly after a conference. In 1989 a new forum of eleven-members formed, which meant to produce more results and resolutions by finding compromises for land use in Clayoquot Sound to satisfy all stakeholders. It was formed by the Social Credit government in BC, but in October 1989 it disbanded similarly to the prior coalition. In 1990, the Clayoquot Sound Development Steering Committee, with representatives from the logging industry, environmentalists, tourist operators, and First Nations groups formed and talked for over a year and a half until environmentalists and tourism representatives walked out, unimpressed that logging operations had continued while the groups met, and disbanded in May 1991. The government and a separate panel of Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Forests representatives met to decide where logging could and could not occur, while the Steering Committee was gathering. In May 1991 environmentalists left for the second time failed to reach an agreement. In 1991, the British Columbia New Democratic Party (NDP) took up government and utilized all the information compiled from both the committee and the task force to create their Clayoquot Sound Land Use Plan, which they announced in 1993. The plan divided the forests of Clayoquot Sound into numerous regions, setting parts aside for preservation, logging, and other various activities including recreation, wildlife, and scenery. The plan permitted logging in two-thirds of the old growth forest in Clayoquot.UVIC: VI-Wilds: Clayoquot Sound; Vulnerable Ecosystems, http://icor.uvic.ca/viwilds/ve-clayoquot.html Blockades and protests In 1984, the first opposition to logging companies in the Sound occurred, when members of Friends of Clayoquot Sound and First Nations groups set up blockades on the logging roads leading to Meares Island. The island was important to First Nations communities because it was the main source of drinking water for the area. Environmental groups like Friends of Clayoquot Sound and the First Nations communities were concerned with the logging companies' approach to resource management. The First Nations did not completely oppose all logging in the Sound; in fact, they acknowledged that their people had depended on the land's resources for centuries. Rather, they opposed the fact that the companies were pursuing short-term profits by extracting resources at maximum efficiency rates, with little interference from the British Columbia government. When Macmillan-Bloedel workers arrived at Meares Island in 1984, they encountered a bigger blockade that included members of the Nuu-chah-nulth tribe, local environmental groups, and other supporters of their cause. Throughout the 1980s animosity continued between these groups due to each side's respective injunctions, which were in contradiction with one another over the use of the land. In 1992, Friends of Clayoquot Sound set up another blockade. In mid-1993, the most significant protests occurred. Introduction of the Clayoquot Sound Land Use Plan sparked outrage among environmentalists and the Nuu-chah-nulth people alike. Environmental groups debated the amount and type of land that had been divided, but the First Nations, who composed almost the entire population of the Sound, were concerned that the plan did not consider their spatial, environmental, or economic practices. During the mid-1993, nearly 11,000 people came to Clayoquot Sound to take part in the protests. Activists eventually gained the support of major organizations such as Greenpeace and the Sierra Club.Great Wilds Spaces: Clayoquot Sound; Flores and Vargas Island Provincial Parks, http://www.greatwildspaces.org/clayoquot.html Every day for three months, protesters would gather and blockade a remote logging road, preventing vehicles carrying workers from reaching their sites. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police would then read a court injunction and carry or drag protesters into a bus, which would transport them to the police station in Ucluelet to be charged and released. By the middle of the year, the sheer number of people that had been arrested made it one of the largest acts of civil disobedience in Canadian history. The court injunction being read to protesters, August 1993 Many residents of Tofino and Ucluelet worked in the logging industry and felt that the 1993 protests threatened their livelihood. In response, they organized a counter-protest called the \\"Ucluelet Rendezvous '93.\\" More than 5,000 people came to support the workers and logging community, culminating in of human excrement being poured near the environmentalists' information site . Loggers stated that they did not want to wipe out the forests, but that carrying on the industry was economically important for future generations. =Media and protest attention= Through local, national, and international news coverage, the demonstrations in the Clayoquot Sound became recognized by the public as having the potential to make significant changes to environmental policy. The logging protests and blockades received worldwide mass media attention, creating national support for environmental movements facing British Columbia and fostering a strong advocacy for anti-logging campaigns. Mass media attention began by relaying highly controversial, and at times, violent coverage of the protest events, showcasing dramatic outcomes that would lead to higher viewing and readership rates. Reporters believed that this sort of coverage was necessary to bring attention to the cause (given the outcome of certain protests) and offered more appeal to a public that sought entertainment value in the media. Females were portrayed more often than men as being 'radical activists' and members of extremist groups, which encouraged the formation of social stigmas being attached to female protesters. The media's creation of stereotypes led to controversy surrounding the potential economic benefits for media outlets publishing sensational news. Accusations began to surround the mass media's use of language as being biased and one-sided when referring to relevant multi-stakeholder groups. Over time, the media began to detract attention from 'radical activists' towards reports on individuals who were indirectly involved in the protests. The opinions of 'mild activists' were covered more frequently over time due to their moderation. Considering the ongoing nature of the protests, a shift was made in the media in hopes of resolving the underlying issues surrounding Clayoquot Sound. News articles began to steer reports away from extremists who, in the past, were the focus of dramatic and uniquely portrayed events. Reporters indicated that they chose to interview more moderate groups and 'mild activists' because they were believed to offer more credible and sensible information. The drive to produce more reliable information surpassed the media's need to provide entertainment, which encouraged the public to understand the seriousness behind the issue taking place. Media attention began to focus on the perceived unfairness of the mass arrests after individuals joined in peaceful protests and blockades, violating a court injunction that forbid the occurrence of such events. News sources focused on activists as having encountered on-site aggression and intimidation, which eventually helped strengthen public support for non- violent actions. Eventually the media did not emphasize the significance of any few particular environmental leaders as central actors in the protection of Clayoquot Sound. Instead, protesters, environmental NGOs and local First Nations were portrayed together as being deeply committed to the effort of preserving Clayoquot Sound, becoming a symbol for international environmental efforts and awareness. These lobby groups, advocating for the boycott of large-scale logging corporations, successfully urged the public to join in and support the cause as activists themselves. Trials In August 1994, the trials began and continued for five weeks in front of the BC Provincial court, with BC Supreme Court Justice John Bouck overseeing the first round of prosecutions. Numerous people from a variety of backgrounds and ages were arrested daily. Those arrested for participating in the protests were charged with criminal contempt of court for defying an injunction banning demonstrations on company work sites. The injunction was obtained by Macmillan Bloedel Ltd.'s logging operations at the Kennedy Lake Bridge, near Clayoquot Sound, stating that no public interference was to be allowed in the areas they were logging. Of the 932 people arrested, 860 were prosecuted in eight trials. All those prosecuted for criminal intent were found guilty. The outcomes of the trials varied tremendously depending on the ways in which individuals were involved and if people were first-time offenders. Penalties included fines, probation and jail sentences. The range of jail terms was suspended sentences to up to six months in jail, while fines ranged from $250 to $3,000. The judges included Justice Bouck, Low, Murphy, and Oliver. The lightest sentences were given out by Justice Drake in December, which gave those found guilty no jail time and $250 fines. The first 44 people to be put on trial in front of John Bouck received jail time ranging from 45 to 60 days, and fines of $1,000 to $3,000. Justice Low judged the second group with penalties of 21 days in jail or home arrest with a security bracelet for electric monitoring during probation, in some cases allowing a choice between home arrest or jail. Many who had the choice decided to do their sentences in jail as an added protest to the issue. Aftermath The intact forests that stand in Clayoquot Sound today represent the outcome of numerous protests that occurred at the end of the 20th Century, having established a solid protection plan for forests. Greenpeace played a significant role in these protests, instigating a boycott of BC forest products in order to apply pressure on the industry. The boycott was called off once the scientific panel's recommendations were accepted by the government, deferring logging until an inventory of pristine areas was completed. The Annual Allowable Cut and clear-cuts in the area were reduced to a maximum of four hectares. In addition, Eco-Based Planning was to occur once biological and cultural inventories were completed. In July 1995, the first significant change in government policies occurred, when all 127 unanimous recommendations made by the scientific panel on Clayoquot Sound were accepted by the Forests Minister of British Columbia, Andrew Petter, and the Environment Minister, Elizabeth Cull on behalf of the NDP government. In 1996, the provincial government financed the compromise, extending $9.3 million over three years to MacMillan Bloedel \\"to log the territory in an ecologically sound way\\".Kim Nursall Twenty years later, the ‚ÄúWar in the Woods‚Äù at Clayoquot Sound still reverberates across B.C. Canadian Press, August 11, 2013 As the protests had a negative impact on the reputation and sales of large-scale logging companies in Clayoquot Sound, they removed their operations from the area, and First Nations residents in the Sound were then able to purchase 50% of ownership in the region's logging rights. Iisaak Forest Resources Ltd. formed on behalf of the First Nations, allowing them to take charge over logging operations with their private company. In 1993 environmental lawyer Robert Kennedy Jr. had suggested that aboriginal people should be given full control of forest resources. In 1999, Iisaak Forest Resources Ltd. signed an agreement known as a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), ensuring that logging would not occur outside areas which had obviously been logged before and which were outside the intact ancient forests of Clayoquot Sound. In 2000, the entire Sound was designated as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, further emphasizing its ecological importance; however, this was not legally binding in preventing companies from logging in the future. The designation created world recognition of Clayoquot Sound's biological diversity, and a $12M monetary fund to \\"support research, education and training in the Biosphere region\\".British Columbia; Ministry of Forests and Range, http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/dsi/Clayoquot/clayoquot_sound.htm At the end of July 2006, a new set of Watershed Plans was approved in Clayoquot Sound, opening the door for logging to proceed a further 90,000 hectares in the forest, including pristine old-growth valleys As of 2007, both logging tenures within Clayoquot Sound are controlled by first nation logging companies.Wilderness Committee: Clayoquot Sound, http://wc- zope.emergence.com:8080/WildernessCommittee_Org/campaigns/wildlands/clayoquot Iisaak Forest Resources controls Timber Forest License (TFL) 57 in Clayoquot Sound.Iisaak Forest Resources: http://www.iisaak.com/operations.html MaMook Natural Resources Ltd, in conjunction with Coulson Forest Products, manages TFL54 in Clayoquot Sound. In 2013, the War in the Woods was said to have set the stage for the protests around the two big pipeline proposals in BC. On April 20, 2014 Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation commemorated 30 years since the beginning of the Clayoquot Protests in an event at Tofino Community Hall. The event saw members of the Tribal community engage in traditional song and dance while also celebrating the successful attempts at opposing logging on Meares Island Tribal Park.

Murder Dr. Darryl Sutorius, a prominent heart surgeon in Cincinnati, married Dante Britteon in 1995. Dr. Sutorius was found dead in the basement of the house he shared with his wife in Symmes Township, Ohio on February 19, 1996. Though it was clear that a gunshot to the head had been the cause of death, authorities were initially unsure whether his death was homicide or suicide. Dante was arrested the same day when investigating police found a supply of cocaine. Though released on bail the next day, Mrs. Sutorius was re-arrested on February 27 when it was determined that she had purchased the weapon that had killed her husband and gunshot residue tests and autopsy results indicated that she had been the one who fired the weapon on the day of Sutorius's death. This time the charge was aggravated murder with prior calculation. Investigation and trial Investigation into the background of Dante Sutorius revealed that her real name was Della; she had begun using the name \\"Dante\\" sometime in her 20s, feeling that \\"Della\\" sounded too African- American. It also showed it was not the first time she had been associated with violence. Her third husband alleged that she had repeatedly threatened to kill him during their marriage; after the couple divorced, she was charged with threatening another man, this time a boyfriend, with a gun. One husband had found knives hidden around the house he shared with her and had been surprised when she told him she \\"could kill you\\", while her fourth husband told investigators that she was mentally abusive and he feared her to the point of hiding the bullets to his gun to prevent her from being able to use them. Dr. Sutorius had discovered that virtually everything Della/Dante had told him about her background was false. She claimed to have graduated from UCLA, but in truth had never finished high school. She claimed to have owned a day care business, but had never held a steady job in her life. When he learned about these lies and her violent history, he cut Della out of his will and began divorce proceedings. A week before his death, he was planning to formally serve her with papers and have her thrown out of their house. Hamilton County, Ohio prosecutor Joe Deters theorized that Della Sutorius had \\"a serious problem with rejection\\" after colleagues of her husband reported that he had been considering divorce. According to her sister Donna Hall, Sutorius's approach to men had long been colored by monetary gain: \\"She said you find a wealthy man and, when they die, you'd get their money\\". Sutorius declined to take the stand in her own defense at her trial. Though her lawyers argued that police had failed to prove that Darryl Sutorius's death was anything but suicide and their client's statements to police had not been preceded by a Miranda warning, she was convicted on June 7, 1996, with the jury deliberating for fewer than five hours before finding her guilty of aggravated murder, use of a gun in a crime of violence, and drug possession. Later the same month, she was sentenced to 23 years to life in prison, the maximum penalty allowed. Judge Richard Niehaus said that contrary to her media portrayal as a \\"black widow,\\" she was more akin to a lionfish, who attracts prey with its brilliant stripes before using its poisonous spines to kill them. After conviction Della Sutorius appealed her conviction in the spring of 1997, claiming that the trial jury having been allowed to hear hearsay evidence of statements her dead husband had made and that prosecutors had made improper comments to the jury. The appeal was declined in June of the same year and Sutorius returned to serving her sentence at the Ohio Reformatory for Women. In order to defray the costs of prosecuting Sutorius, the Hamilton County Sheriff's department seized and auctioned off Sutorius's 11-piece jewelry collection. Despite the coverage the press devoted to the auction, bidders failed to meet the minimum necessary total for the pieces to sell separately and the lot was sold for a $5,100 lump sum. Death According to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, Della Sutorius died of natural causes at the Ohio Reformatory for Women on November 20, 2010, where Sutorius had been serving her life sentence since her conviction. She was 60 years old. Sutorius would have been eligible for parole in 2014. In media Della Sutorius's dramatic history with her husbands and the public perception of her as being a \\"black widow\\" attracted high levels of coverage from the press; her lawyer, ex-husbands, and ex-boyfriends were all reportedly approached by talk show hosts and news broadcasts such as Geraldo and Hard Copy. A spokeswoman for the Sally Jessy Raphael talk show Sally, which also pursued the story, explained that the case was \\"highly dramatic\\" and would appeal to daytime television watchers. Despite jury selection being slowed down by already widespread news coverage of the case, CourtTV was permitted to televise coverage of the May 1996 trial. A 2010 episode of Dateline NBC covered the case in detail, interviewing Sutorius's family and friends as well as people who had been involved in her legal cases. Crime reporter Aphrodite Jones covered Sutorius's case in her 2002 book Della's Web. Her case is one of the thirteen famous murders reported on in the book The Cincinnati Crime Book (1998), by George Stimson. The Sutorius case was featured in 2005 on the Oxygen Network series Snapped, and the Investigation Discovery series Deadly Women and Fatal Vows. It was also in the Forensic Files episode \\"Second Shot at Love\\".

Retrieved 21 February 2013. Biography A natural talent, J√∏rgensen attended Frede Aamodt's private art school (1905‚Äì06) where he met Carl Jensen and Vilhelm Wils. He exhibited with De Tretten in 1909, presenting his preferred subjects of prostitutes and the destitute living in condemned buildings in the poorest quarters of Copenhagen, attracting the attention of the press. He was also noted for his engravings, characterized by large areas of light and shade and by his use of the grain of the wood, as in his portrait of the writer Jens Pedersen (1908).Eva de la Fuente Pedersen, \\"Aksel J√∏rgensen\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon.

From 1909 to 1914, J√∏rgensen worked on a large series of works illustrating Holger Drachmann's life and poetry for the Drachmann Inn in Frederiksberg. He produced no less than 29 woodcuts during the period, some with multilayered colouring. The art collector Christian Tetzen-Lund commissioned a large group of his works, now characterized by both Rembrandt and, increasingly, Impressionism, inspired by his experience of C√©zanne's. work during his travels in 1910. From 1920, he concentrated on composition and perspective, developing the use of colour for still-lifes and figure paintings. Important series included works for the student dormitory Studenterg√•rden (1921‚Äì23), the cinema Vesterbros Bio (1942) and Arbejdermuseet (1955). His most extensive project consisted of some 50 illustrations for Adam Oehlenschl√§ger's Nordens Guder, published in 1929. It took him many years to engrave the woodcuts and several of his pupils were involved in the technical work. The work had a mixed reception but he was complemented by the French pointillist Paul Signac. He also completed a wide range of portraits including that of the politician Frederik Borgbjerg (1949). In 1935, he became a member of Den Frie Udstilling, an alternative exhibition forum. Teaching career Aksel J√∏rgensen's talents as a teacher were unknown when he was offered a post as professor at the Academy in 1920 which he retained until 1953. He encouraged his students to take account of trends across Europe, insisting on the importance of lines and geometrical figures.Gertrud K√∏bke Sutton, \\"Grundig og saglig\\", Information.dk, 10 December 2002.

Assessment J√∏rgensen played an important role in developing the status of graphical work in Denmark. It was he who took the initiative to integrate the graphics school as part of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and it was his work there which attracted important illustrators such as Henry Heerup, Richard Mortensen, Ib Spang Olsen, and many others. His graphical work is notable both technically and artistically.

Set on the front line of China ºs foray into Africa, it follows the lives of a Chinese farmer, a road builder, and the Zambian trade minister. When China Met Africa was an international co-production involving BBC Storyville, Arte France, VPRO, the Sundance Institute, CNC and the Media Fund, and produced by Speakit Films and Zeta Productions. The film played at international film festivals including Rotterdam Film Festival, Munich, Goteburg and at the Margaret Mead Film Festival in New York, where it won best film. It was released in cinemas in the UK in 2011 and was seen on television around the world. When China Met Africa was characterised by The Guardian as 'An eye-opening documentary that puts into concrete images that truism of the geo-political commentariat: that China is a new economic superpower' and The Times summarised it as 'A rare, grass-roots view into one of the most important economic developments of the age'. The film was also covered by media outlets including CNN, The Economist and The Atlantic. Storyline A historic gathering of over 50 African heads of state in Beijing reverberates in Zambia where the lives of three characters unfold. Mr Liu is one of thousands of Chinese entrepreneurs who have settled across the continent in search of new opportunities. He has just bought his fourth farm and business is booming. In northern Zambia, Mr Li, a project manager for a multinational Chinese company is upgrading Zambia's longest road. Pressure to complete the road on time intensifies when funds from the Zambian government start running out. Meanwhile, Zambia's Trade Minister is en route to China to secure millions of dollars of investment. Through the intimate portrayal of these characters, the expanding footprint of a rising global power is laid bare - pointing to a radically different future, not just for Africa, but also for the world. Production During the production of Black Gold, Marc Francis and Nick Francis encountered a group of Chinese workers building a road in southern Ethiopia. This meeting sparked questions about China's role as a growing rising superpower. A few years later, the crew arrived in Zambia in the midst of Presidential elections, where the Zambian opposition leader was campaigning on an anti-Chinese platform. Filming became increasingly difficult during this time, but over the next few months, the film crew had extensive meetings with more than a hundred Chinese people living and working in Zambia including construction managers, restaurant owners, farmers, travel agents, labourers, CEO‚Äôs and government officials. From these interviews three main characters were chosen to be in the film. One of the main difficulties that was raised during the production was the multitude of dialects spoken by people appearing in the film, which made understanding problematic. The crew often did not know what their characters were saying until reading the transcripts upon their return to the UK. It was pitched at Sheffield Doc/Fest's 2007 MeetMarket.

She is the maternal half-sister of series protagonist Oliver Queen / Green Arrow. Although an original creation to the series, she adopts elements from the DC Comics superhero Mia Dearden / Speedy, created by writer Kevin Smith and artist Phil Hester. Holland was a main cast member on Arrow from its first season until its sixth, and also crossed over to the spin-off Arrowverse series The Flash. Although Thea Queen is loosely inspired by the existing comics character Mia Dearden, a sidekick of Green Arrow, the idea of Green Arrow working alongside his archer half- sister was later incorporated back into the comics in the form of Emiko Queen.  Fictional character biography = Early life = Thea Queen was born on January 21, 1995, in Starling City to Robert and Moira Queen, (although it is later revealed that Thea is Malcolm Merlyn's biological daughter) and the younger half-sister of Oliver Queen. Though Malcolm was unaware that Thea was his daughter, and Thea was likewise in the dark, Robert was aware but still loved Thea like his own. When her father and brother were both presumed dead, Thea felt alone and disconnected from the world. She fell into a life of drugs and partying to fill the void left by her father and brother. = Season 1 = Thea is introduced as a senior in high school who is grateful to have her big brother back, but his disappointment in her lifestyle and the secrets he keeps from her about his five years away cause her to slip even further into drug use. On her 18th birthday, she is involved in a car crash while on the narcotic Vertigo and is subsequently arrested and sentenced to community service for 500 hours at CNRI (City Necessary Resources Initiative) under the supervision of Laurel Lance. Her addiction to Vertigo causes an animosity between her returned brother's alter-ego the Arrow and the drug's creator the Count. Later that year, Thea falls in love with Roy Harper, a lifelong street criminal whom she meets when he steals her purse. Though he initially has no romantic interest in Thea despite an obvious physical attraction to her, mainly out of resentment because of her wealth, Roy later begins to genuinely fall in love with her. = Season 2 = After the Undertaking and Oliver's disappearance, Thea takes over his club, Verdant, while maintaining her relationship with Roy. That year, after learning of her true paternity from Slade Wilson, losing her club to Isabel Rochev (who had taken Queen Consolidated out from under Oliver), breaking up with Roy (now a member of Oliver's team and under the influence of Mirakuru), and the death of her mother, Thea decides to leave town. While waiting for her train, she is attacked by a Mirakuru-enhanced soldier and rescued by Malcolm, who reveals himself to still be alive. After discovering that Roy worked with the Arrow, Thea, betrayed once again, decides to go with her father and leaves Starling City and her family behind, with no intentions of coming back. = Season 3 = Thea begins the season in Corto Maltese receiving combat training from Malcolm, though she soon decides to return to Starling with Oliver. She also reopens her nightclub after Malcolm secretly buys the foundry from Queen Consolidated for her. She learns Oliver's secret identity as the Arrow when he shows her his hideout under the nightclub and begins to distrust Malcolm after learning that he already knows about Oliver's secret. After Thea is told that her father used her as a pawn against both Oliver and Ra's al Ghul by drugging and manipulating her into killing Sara Lance, she arranges for him to be captured by the League in retaliation. She reconciles with Roy but is nearly killed by Ra's and is brought back to life in the Lazarus Pit in exchange for Oliver joining the League of Assassins. Thea blames herself for letting her brother join the League. Roy breaks up with her when he leaves Starling City after faking his death, hoping that Thea can make a life of her own without him. He also leaves her his red costume which she wears to become a vigilante herself as his successor. = Season 4 = Thea works with Oliver and his friends in the fight against the terrorist organization H.I.V.E. By Oliver's request, the team refers to her in the field as \\"Speedy\\" (over her insistence to be called \\"Red Arrow\\"). Despite the enjoyment of being a vigilante, Thea's behaviour has become increasingly volatile and reckless when in the field, which Oliver realizes is a side effect of being in the Lazarus Pit. In addition, Thea helps Laurel to bring Sara back from the death in hopes of making amends towards the Lance family. Because of this, Thea is telepathically linked with Sara after her resurrection upon the Lazarus Pit. It is also revealed that Thea's Lazarus Pit side effect is able to counterattack Damien Darhk's life force drain in addition relieving her bloodlust temporarily. Thea is dying as the result of the Pit's restorative effect waning. With Tatsu Yamashiro's help, Nyssa al Ghul gives Oliver the 'Lotus', an elixir used by the Crescent Order that permanently reverses the effects of the Lazarus Pit, saving her life. She helps Oliver to become a new candidate for mayor and meets a new boyfriend Alex Davis. Damien Darhk's wife, Ruv√© Adams, eventually brainwashes her boyfriend into kidnapping her to a miniaturized H.I.V.E. facility built from stolen technology belonging to Oliver's ally Ray Palmer. After she fell under Malcolm's influence again and threatened to kill Darhk's daughter after being released (including the death of her boyfriend at the hands of Lonnie Machin), and following Darhk's defeat, Thea decided to leave the team as she didn't like what she was becoming. = Season 5 = Having retired from life as a vigilante, Thea continues to help Oliver in a civilian capacity as his Chief of Staff (Oliver having been appointed Mayor after the death of Ruv√© Darhk) and has proven herself to be an able politician, often picking up the slack for Oliver, who simultaneously worked as the Green Arrow. She hires Quentin Lance, who had been fired from the SCPD after revealing that he had previously collaborated with Damien Darhk, as the city's Deputy Mayor, having some daughter-father figure relationship and helping him to beat his alcoholism. Thea temporarily comes out of retirement as Speedy to save Oliver from Tobias Church's thugs and when the Dominators attack Earth. After Oliver's near-impeachment, Thea decides to resign as his Chief of Staff, fearing that she was relying too heavily on dirty politics, including tarnishing reporter Susan Williams' reputation and considering blackmailing a city council member for his vote. Thea, along with the rest of Team Arrow, is captured by Adrian Chase and taken to Lian Yu. After stepping on a landmine, Thea is pushed off of it by her father, who had joined forces with Oliver to rescue her; he later detonates the landmine to take out Digger Harkness and some of Chase's henchmen, leaving Thea devastated over the loss of a man whom she hates. Chase later destroys the C4-rigged Lian Yu by shooting himself dead, with Thea still on the island. = Season 6 = Five months after the destruction of Lian Yu, Thea is alive but has been left comatose since the incident. In the episode \\"Thanksgiving\\", she awakens, and returns to vigilantism in the episode \\"Doppelganger\\". In the episode \\"The Thanatos Guild\\", Thea decides to leave Team Arrow to travel the world to destroy Ra's al Ghul's remaining Lazarus Pits alongside Nyssa and Roy. = Season 7 = When Roy returns to Star City, he claims that he, Thea and Nyssa had discovered and destroyed two new Lazarus Pits. He also reveals to have been killed by the Thanatos Guild and then revived by Thea and Nyssa with one of the Lazarus Pits. = Season 8 = When Oliver heads to Nanda Parbat to gain more information on the Monitor from Talia al Ghul, he reunites with Thea and fills her in on his impending death. Oliver, Thea, and Talia plan to retrieve an ancient textbook, but are ambushed by Athena and the League of Assassins. The trio narrowly manage to escape and eventually find the book; learning that the Monitor may actually be causing the oncoming crisis rather than preventing it. With Athena and her League allies now dead, Thea, as the new Ra's al Ghul, suggests to Talia that they should rebrand the League to become heroes instead of assassins. She then offers Talia the opportunity to build this new League alongside her. Talia initially refuses Thea's proposal due to her several betrayals but Thea dismisses those as mistakes, making Talia accept her offer. Following the events of the crisis, which saw Oliver sacrifice himself to stop the Anti-Monitor, a new reality is formed in which Thea accepts Roy's marriage proposal.  Other versions  In an alternate reality created by the Legion of Doom with the Spear of Destiny, Thea adores her father instead of hating him. In the season eight episode \\"Starling City\\", it is revealed that Thea's Earth-2 counterpart died upon overdosing on the Vertigo drug. Consumed by Thea's loss, this Earth's Tommy Merlyn becomes Dark Archer and plans revenge on the Glades, where Thea was found dead, by destroying it until Oliver talks him out of it.  Creation and development  In February 2012, it was announced that Willa Holland was joining Arrow as Oliver Queen's \\"bratty younger sister Thea\\", beating Melissa Benoist for the part. Although Thea is an original creation for the series, Oliver's nickname for her and later hero persona (\\"Speedy\\"), her middle name of Dearden and the alias \\"Mia\\" she used during her time at Corto Maltese, are easter egg connections to one of Green Arrow's sidekicks in the comics, Mia Dearden. Thea was significantly absent during the fifth season, and showrunner Marc Guggenheim explained that Holland was only contracted to appear in 14 of the 23 episodes for the season. He later revealed that Holland signed a similar contract for the sixth season, but declined to reveal how many episodes of the season she was contracted to appear in. Holland left the series in 2018 after her contract expired, her final appearance being \\"The Thanatos Guild\\". She returned for a guest appearance on the 150th episode \\"Emerald Archer\\" in season seven, and as a recurring character for the eighth and final season.  Reception  In 2016, Jason Berman of Screen Rant included Holland in his list of \\"20 Best Actors in the Arrowverse\\".

For most of its existence, it linked the Netherlands with Switzerland, via Belgium, Luxembourg and France. Introduced in 1928, it was named after a mountain flower, the Edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum), which is associated with alpinism and the Alps, and regarded as a symbol of Switzerland. From its introduction until it was suspended in 1939 upon the outbreak of World War II, the Edelweiss was a luxury train operated by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL), and ran between Amsterdam CS in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Luzern station in Lucerne, Switzerland. After the war, the Edelweiss was revived, initially as an ordinary express train between Brussels, Belgium, and Basel SBB in Basel, Switzerland. In 1957, it became one of the first of the first-class- only Trans Europ Express (TEE) trains, with its southern terminus moved from Basel further southeast, to Z√ºrich HB in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1974, the northern terminus of the Edelweiss was moved south, from Amsterdam to Brussels.\\"Summer services, 1974\\" (changes due to take effect).

Around the First World War, he was considered a remarkable importer of saltpetre from his own mines in Chile, and was listed as the richest person in Hamburg. Life Henry B. Sloman was born in Kingston upon Hull, England, on 28 August 1848 to parents John and Alaine Sloman. His granduncle Robert Miles Sloman was a shipbuilder and ship owner in Hamburg. When his father had lost all his assets in the Crimean War, he sent Henry and his sister Harriet to wealthy relatives in Hamburg. After absolving an apprenticeship as a locksmith in Hamburg, Henry was encouraged by his friend Hermann F√∂lsch to emigrate to Chile, with F√∂lsch's father loaning the journey's costs to Sloman. It was also Hermann F√∂lsch who arranged for Sloman getting work in Iquique where he later acted as director of the F√∂lsch & Martin company. After 22 years of working for F√∂lsch & Martin, Sloman established his own saltpetre business in Tocopilla and returned to Hamburg in 1889 as a wealthy man. In 1912, Sloman was recorded as leading a list of the richest citizens of Hamburg with a net worth of Goldmark 60 million and an annual income of 3 million. In 1924, he founded the bank Finanzbank AG which developed into Sloman Bank KG. In 1976, it was merged with Bankhaus Hardy & Co. GmbH to become Hardy-Sloman Bank GmbH. In 1981, the latter was absorbed by Deutsche L√§nderbank which is now a part of UBS Germany. In 1922, Sloman commissioned the Chilehaus (Chile House), a ten-story office building in Hamburg that is notable for its architecture. Henry Sloman died on 24 October 1931 in Hamburg. =Personal life= Henry B.

The Green player has additionally its own distinctive symbols for its elephants (Âêë xiang ), cannons (Á§Æ pao ), and soldiers (Âãá yong ). The bannermen pieces (if used) start on the upper corner points of the players' 3√ó3 palaces. Game of the Three Kingdoms (Chinese: , p SƒÅn-gu√≥-q√≠ ; also called Sanguo Qi, Three Kingdoms Chess, or Three-Handed Xiangqi) is a three-player variant of the game xiangqi (\\"Chinese chess\\"). The game symbolizes the Three Kingdoms period war (221‚Äì264) between the rival states Wei, Shu, and Wu, each vying for control of China after the fall of the Han Dynasty. History The period of origination of Sanguo Qi is disputed and either belongs to the Southern Song Dynasty (1127‚Äì1279) or the Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1911). The two original Chinese texts which described the game are lost. O. von M√∂llendorff reported on the game in [German] \\"Schachspiel der Chinesen\\" (English: \\"The Game of Chess of the Chinese\\") in the publication Mittheilungen der deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Natur- und V√∂lkerkunde Ostasiens (English: \\"Journal of the German Society for Natural and Cultural Science of East Asia\\"), Leipzig, 1876. M√∂llendorff depicts a hexagonal gameboard comprising three xiangqi half-boards ( intersection points each). The board displays the traditional xiangqi \\"river\\", but with three arms separating the three opponent confrontations. Subsequent to Game of the Three Kingdoms, similar three-player xiangqi variants emerged utilizing half-boards but with different center connecting geometries and corresponding rules. One of these is Game of the Three Friends (Chinese: , p SƒÅn-y«íu-q√≠ ; also called Sanyou Qi or Three Friends Chess) invented by Zheng Jinde (Chinese: , Zh√®ng J√¨nd√©) during the Qing Dynasty (1661‚Äì1722). Game overview The diagram shows colored kingdoms for clarity (Wei/Blue, Shu/Red, and Wu/Green). This play setup is without the bannermen pieces, which are optional. The three kingdoms W√®i (È≠è), Sh«î (ËúÄ), and W√∫ (Âê≥) are represented by colors blue, red, and green, respectively. Each player controls all the standard xiangqi pieces, with each general represented by the letter of its respective kingdom. In addition, each player controls two bannermen pieces: \\"flag\\" for Wei/Blue, \\"fire\\" for Shu/Red, and \\"wind\\" for Wu/Green. The use of bannermen is optional‚ÄîGame of the Three Kingdoms is also played without them. A bannerman moves like an extended xiangqi horse: two steps orthogonally, then one step diagonally outward, with no jumping. Checkmate and other conventions are the same as in xiangqi, except that after a checkmate occurs, the mated general is removed from the game, and the player who delivered the checkmate appropriates the mated player's remaining pieces for his own use. The last surviving kingdom (general) is the winner. =Play conventions= It may be necessary or desirable to add further play conventions for completeness: * Shu/Red moves first. Then turns alternate counterclockwise around the board. * A chariot or cannon that reaches a central triangle point when travelling along a file, may cross the river in either of two directions and continue along the file of another kingdom. * After a checkmate, removal of the mated general and army appropriation are done in a separate turn. The piece delivering mate replaces the enemy general on its square. * Stalemate results in the same army appropriation as described for checkmate. If two players' pieces cooperate in stalemating the third player, the player making the move that completed the stalemate condition is the player who appropriates the stalemated player's army.

For a detailed background on the causes of the crisis and the parties that contributed please reference:Causes of the 2007-2012 global financial crisis and ‚ÄúHistory of Fair Value Issues‚Äùhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/money-power-wall-street/#a, ‚ÄúHistory of Fair Value Issues‚Äù The purpose of this article is to expand on the role that accountants specifically played within the late 2000s financial crisis. Fair Value Accounting and its Role in the Financial Crisis=Financial Accounting Standard 157= In 2006 the Financial Accounting Standards (FASB) implemented FAS 157 in order to establish a generally accepted accounting definition of fair value, methods for measuring fair value, and to expand disclosures about fair value measurements in financial statements.http://www.fasb.org/summary/stsum157.shtml, ‚ÄúSummary of Statement No. 157‚Äù - FASB Pre-Codification Standards. The statement aimed to increase consistency, comparability and transparency among statements that incorporated fair-value measurements.http://www.honors.ufl.edu/apps/Thesis.aspx/Download/980 , \\"The Role of Auditors in the Current Financial Crisis\\" FAS 157 defines a hierarchy of three levels of inputs to obtain the fair value of an asset or liability. These levels are classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3. These levels differ in that Level 1 inputs have active markets, Level 2 inputs use models for similar assets, and Level 3 inputs are unobservable, relying on model assumptions. Since Level 2 and Level 3 inputs do not have active markets with identical assets, the discretion of management is required when determining the fair value of these assets. This provides room for managerial manipulation. =The Link between Fair Value and Crises= As mentioned in the article written by Laux and Leuz, linking banking capital regulation and fair value accounting is the most plausible way fair value accounting could have contributed to the crisis. The explanation that links the two subjects is that asset values deviate from their fundamental market prices, which causes a bank to write down its assets and, in turn, deplete its capital. Consequently, the asset write-downs may force the bank to sell such assets at fire sale prices and start a downward spiral. This causes a contagion problem and forces other banks to take similar write-downs. However, according to Laux and Leuz, this is not what typically happens in banks‚Äô practices. =Fair Value Accounting in Practice= In practice, Banks‚Äô asset categories include loans and leases, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, and trading assets. Loans and leases, however, comprise the biggest and most important category for banks. These assets are classified as either ‚Äúheld-for-investment,‚Äù which is typically a small percent of the loans, or ‚Äúheld-for-sale‚Äù, accounted for at the lower of historical cost or fair value. The loans and leases in the held- for-sale classification are tested for impairment and, if impaired, written down to the present value of future cash flows. Loans are usually impaired because creditors will be unable to collect all amounts due. This was a reoccurring problem in the current financial crisis. Since the crisis unfolded, fair value assets held by banks increasingly became Level 3 inputs (unobservable). Ultimately, most of the assets held by financial institutions were either not subject to fair value, or did not impact the income statement or balance sheet accounts. =Fair value as a Contributor= There has been debate on whether fair value accounting contributed to the crisis or simply was the messenger of the crisis. The opponents of fair value believe it is the contributor to the crisis. Opponents, such as FDIC chairman William Isaac and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, lobbied and urged for the suspension of mark-to- market accounting. Clearly, the lobbying has been an issue of debate as well ‚Äì one that proponents are not pleased with, as lobbying the FASB presents an issue of its independence. These people believe fair value accounting is not the most relevant method of measuring financial instruments.https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/19/mark-market-accounting- leadership-governance-directorship.html, Cindy Fornelli, ‚ÄúThe Great Fair-Value Debate‚Äù Steve Forbes is another opponent who believes fair value accounting was the ‚Äúprincipal reason‚Äù for the crisis in 2008. One argument is that a majority of structured debt, corporate bonds and mortgages were still performing, but their prices had fallen below their true value due to frozen markets (contagion explained above). Opponents also state that fair value accounting undermines critical foundations of financial reporting, including verifiability, reliability and conservatism. It is argued that fair value accounting lacks all three attributes. Some opponents may even suggest that historical cost accounting is more accurate by arguing that financial institutions are forced to record any permanent impairment in the market value of their assets. =Fair Value as a Messenger= On the other hand, proponents for fair value accounting believe that fair value was not the cause of the crisis. Instead, they suggest fair value only communicated the effects of poor decisions, such as subprime loans. Proponents also believe that fair value accounting provides investors with critical transparency of companies. There are empirical foundations that prove fair value accounting to be the better indicator of value when compared to historical cost. The lack of transparency by using historical cost accounting may make matter worse. It is possible the market reacts more extremely if the fair-value or current market prices are not disclosed. There is no empirical evidence that using historical cost accounting will calm the investors. As with any standard setting body, the FASB was faced with tradeoffs when it made the decision to implement this new standard. Since this is an imperfect world with information problems, it is difficult to know what the absolute best option is. This is why it is important that the FASB, along with all other participants in the financial environment, become knowledgeable in their fields, and assess how their decisions and performance may affect others. This stands true for auditors and their role in the financial markets and crisis. Auditors‚Äô Role in the Financial Crisis=Demand for Audits= The primary driver of audit demand is the desire to enhance credibility of the information that companies make available to their potential investors. Without an independent party verifying and providing an opinion on a company's financial statements, it is significantly more difficult for firms to attract the investment of the uninformed public. It is, therefore, in a company's best interest to have an individual outside of the firm perform an audit in order to provide assurance on the reliability of the information made available to the public. This principle of value derived from an audit is evidenced by the fact that 82 percent of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange were being audited by CPA's even before it became mandatory with the Securities Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. =Information Asymmetry= The concept of information asymmetry demonstrates the need for auditors as it shows how the gap in information can cause market inefficiencies. Information asymmetry occurs when one party in a transaction has either more or superior information than the other party involved has.http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asymmetricinformation.asp#axzz2LUl47dL7, ‚ÄúDefinition of 'Asymmetric Information‚Äù This becomes a problem because it doesn't allow for the uninformed party to make sound decisions. The result often leaves the party without the information ending up on the loser's side of the deal. When information asymmetry is pertinent, a situation known as a ‚ÄúMarket for Lemons‚Äù may occur. This theory states that when a seller is more informed than a buyer, the buyer should assume that the quality of the product is average at best due to the lack of information. Therefore, sellers of high quality products will not be able to get the value that they want from buyers and have no choice but to withdraw from the market unless they are willing to receive an unfair price. This leaves only lower quality items left for sale. The result is that trading occurs only at low levels of quality, leaving out both those who want to buy and sell high quality products. =Information Gap during the Financial Crisis= The financial crisis showed evidence of this theory as investors couldn't decipher between securities that were backed by high quality or sub-prime home loans. It is likely that had better information been made available to investors, they would have stayed away from the investments backed by these bad mortgages, or at minimum would have demanded higher yield rates.http://knowwpcarey.com/article.cfm?aid=167,‚ÄúThe Market for Lemons: How Information Contributes to Efficiency.‚Äù January 05, 2010. Information asymmetry can lead to extremely inefficient markets, and the need for credible information brings rise to someone who can help bridge the gap between buyers and sellers. =Effect of Audit Quality on Information= Factors such as independence, expertise, and extent of testing, among others, influence the quality of an audit. A high-quality audit is more desirable than a low-quality audit because it provides more assurance of detecting material misstatements that could mislead investors. Studies show that audits that are high in quality also lead to higher quality information in the capital markets and less information asymmetry between traders. Experienced audit staff and the use of industry specialists are listed as contributors of audit quality, which results in an increased quality in the transfer of information. Conversely, as audit quality begins to decrease it is more likely that material information that should be disclosed will be excluded because it was not detected. A common catalyst of audit quality suffering is when firms focus on checking off the procedures performed during an audit without giving adequate attention to the underlying forces driving the figures. In an effort to increase audit efficiency auditors may be tempted to perform the minimum amount of work necessary to follow the legal or firm-wide requirements of an audit. Even if an audit is performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards, it is possible that an audit will fail to discover potentially misleading information. For this reason, it is crucial for auditors to plan the audit engagement in such a way that they can obtain a great understanding of the client's business, and in particular, areas that are susceptible to high levels of risk. =Auditor Shortcomings in the Crisis= In light of the information available, it is clear that several different groups played a major role in either causing or exacerbating the crisis. Although auditors may not have been a primary culprit in causing the crisis, it seems that more could have been done to prevent these events from occurring. Before assigning any blame to auditors, it is important to remember the role they play in the financial markets. Auditors provide assurance on whether the information included in a company's financial statements is free of material misstatement, disclosed properly, and is in conformance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. It is not an auditor's duty to stop companies from making unwise business decisions that put their stakeholders at risk.http://www.theatlanticwire.com/business/2010/12/should-auditors-shoulder- blame-for-the-financial-crisis/21762/, ‚ÄúShould Auditors Shoulder Blame for the Financial Crisis?‚Äù However, auditors have drawn criticism for overlooking whether the information disclosed was adequate in accurately reflecting company strength. One area that auditors may have failed to perform their duty during the crisis was in understanding how management was valuing their assets. It is an auditor's responsibility to assess these valuations, and had auditors fulfilled this duty to an adequate level it seems extremely likely that the shaky foundation of the mortgage-backed securities would have been uncovered. Auditors clearly serve a very important role in maintaining the proper functioning of the market. Because of their high levels of skill and expertise, an auditor's opinion carries significant weight in helping mitigate the risk of information gaps in the market. For this reason, the public has every right to believe that an unqualified opinion from an auditor really does stand for something.http://www.directorship.com/anton-r-valukas-on-the-audit- role-in-preventing-financial-crises/ , ‚ÄúAnton R. Valukas on the Audit Role in Preventing Financial Crises‚Äù In the case of the recent financial crisis, one can argue that this broader purpose of the audit took a back seat to satisfying the legal requirements of an audit as efficiently as possible. =Moving Forward= As auditors move towards continual improvement in audit quality, the chance of audit failure significantly decreases. The ability to learn from mistakes made during the financial crisis could help auditors plan future engagements in a way that minimizes the likelihood of overlooking key factors in the audit. This could result in a significant reduction of problems at the magnitude we observed over the last few years in the crisis. In order to accomplish this goal, auditors should go further than simply adhering to auditing standards. This may be achieved by implementing practices that attempt to satisfy the full intent of the standards in place.http://www.cpab- ccrc.ca/en/content/Public_Report_2010_Economic_Club_Speech.pdf Although it is unlikely that audit failures will ever be eliminated, if firms adopt this type of approach it is realistic to think that crises in the future will not leave such drastic results.

The village is 31.2 km from its district main sub-division Chatrapur and is 149 km from its State capital Bhubaneswar . KKD is more often considered as a part of the city Berhampur Some of the villages around KKD with distance are Ramachandrapur (Baunsiapalli 1.2 km), Masiakhali (3.2 km), Dayapalli (3.7 km), Saradhapur (4 km), Badakhandi (4.3 km), and Dakhinapur (5.6 km). Nearest Towns are Kukudakhandi (0 km), Hinjilicut (10.2 km), Sanakhemundi (12.7 km), Rangeilunda (16.6 km).

The farmers no longer limit their agricultural activities but strive to get profit out of their labor. =Industry= The emergence of industrial kukudakhandi began in the late twenty-first century, with granite industries arriving. Kukudakhandi's proximity to Berhampur, good climate, and availability of talent made it a destination for good firms. Culture Kukudakhandi is a home to Hindu religion, The village is streamlined with peace. A great exchange of wishes in the occasions like Ganesh Puja. Diwali, Dushera, Makar Sankranti, & Christmas are very special to see in the village. About 99% people are Hindus.

Thakurani Yatra 10-day-long the festival of kukudakhandi Thakurani, popularly known as 'Thakurani Yatra' comes once in every five year. Initially the famous Thakurani yatra was started in Berhampur. According to some eminent historians, the cult of Buddhi Thakurani originated along with the emergence of Berhampur town in and around 1672 AD. Telugu Lengayat Dera (weaver) community, who came to Mahuri on the invitation of Raja Saheb of Mahuri to take up their profession of weaving, started their ‚ÄòGhata Yatra‚Äô (Pot Festival) for highlighting the divinity of Mahamayee Thakurani of his capital town Berhampur. The Chief of the Dera community, Kota Chandramani Kubera Senapati, led his community people to migrate to Mahuri and Berhampur who settle down into their hereditary profession of weaving tussar silken products or ‚Äòpatta matha‚Äô. The ‚ÄòGhata Yatra‚Äô was initiated for the purpose of highlighting the tradition of worshiping Thakurani. This later considered as Thakurani Yatra. Now this festival is not only celebrated in Berhampur but also in different parts across the district of Ganjam. Apart from Berhampur, people of kukudakhandi, Boirani(Kabisurya Nagar), BhanjaNagar, Asika, Chhatrapur also celebrate this festival as Thakurani Yatra. Kukudakhandi yatra committee decides the date of the yatra. Recently it was held from 3 May 2018 to 13 May 2018.

History=Colonial period= The Atjeh Museum during the early 20th century of colonial Koetaradja City The original building of the Aceh Museum was in the form of a traditional Acehnese stage house (Acehnese Rumoh Aceh). This building was originally used as the Aceh Pavilion in the ground of De Koloniale Tentoonsteling (The Colonial Exhibition) in Semarang from August 13 to November 15, 1914. The original intention was that the stage house would be dismantled and moved to the Netherlands. The pavilion showcased Acehnese artefacts, most of them are private collection of the ethnographer , which in 1915 became the first curator of the Museum of Aceh. During this exhibition, Aceh Pavilion managed to become the best pavilion. Because of this success, Stammeshaus proposed the Civic and Military Governor of Aceh, , to bring the pavilion back to Aceh and used it as a museum. Friedrich Stammeshaus, the first curator of the Aceh Museum, seen here with . The building was returned to Koetaradja (now Banda Aceh) in Aceh, and since August 31, 1915, it was officially opened on the Esplanade of Koetaradja with Stammeshaus as the first curator of the museum. Stammeshaus remained a curator of the museum until 1933. After his retirement, Stammeshaus sold his personal collection of 1,300 ethnographic objects to the Colonial Institute in Amsterdam, now the Tropenmuseum. In this collection were many highlights of Aceh artefacts, including gold jewellery, Acehnese weapons, amulets, photographs and everyday utensils. The most famous sold to the Tropenmuseum is the personal coat of Teuku Umar. =Post-independence period= Acehnese traditional house After the independence of Indonesia, the museum became the property of the Regional Government of Aceh. In 1969, under the initiative of Teuku Hamzah Bendahara, the Aceh Museum was moved from the old place (Blang Padang) to its present location in Jalan Sultan Alaidin Mahmudsyan on a 10,800 m2 land. In 1974, the museum received a fund to rehabilitate the museum. The fund was used to restore the original pavilion building and to construct a new building for the museum complex. This new building contains room for permanent exhibition, a conference hall, a laboratory, a library, and an office. The fund was also used to add the collection for the museum and for related research. On September 1, 1980, Aceh Museum was officially made a provincial museum under the name Aceh State Museum (Indonesian Museum Negeri Aceh). The official inauguration was made by the Minister of Education and Culture at that time, Dr. Daoed Yoesoef. The historic Rumoh Aceh has survived from the 2004 earthquake and tsunami. Rumoh Aceh The Rumoh Aceh is a typical Acehnese traditional stage house with wood as main material. The house contains three rooms, the front room (Ruang Depan), the middle room (Tungai) and the back room (Seuramo Likot). The middle room is about 50‚Äì75 cm higher than the back and front room. Collection Some of the original collection of the Aceh Museum has been maintained by the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, some of the most famous of this is the personal coat of Teuku Umar.

The parish is part of the Diocese of Des Moines. The church building, which is built of stone in the Gothic Revival style, and the rectory were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. History The Rev. James Brazil from St. Ambrose Church in Des Moines offered the first Mass in Perry in 1871. He and other priests celebrated Mass in the homes of Catholic people in town. The property at the corner of Third and Lucinda streets was purchased in 1874 and a small frame building was constructed for a church. At the time it was part of the Diocese of Dubuque. Father Brazil celebrated the first mass in the new church, and the Rev. Charles Toner became the parish's first pastor the same year. The parish became part of the Diocese of Davenport when it was established in 1881. As the Catholic community increased in size the church became too small. Plans were drawn up for a red brick church that was completed in 1883. By the time the Rev. James Cleary became the pastor in 1898 the second church was also becoming too crowded. The parish voted to build a third church in 1900. It was designed by Rock Island, Illinois architect George Stauduhar in the Late Gothic Revival style. He was responsible for designing over 200 churches between 1890 and 1928. The old church was taken down by Hollenbeck and Sons of Des Moines before the new church could be built. The cornerstone was laid in 1901 and it was completed the following year by McCavick and Squires of Marshalltown, Iowa. The parish joined the Diocese of Des Moines when it was established in 1911. Renovations to the church were done in 1930, 1940, 1954, and 1980. The most recent interior renovations were undertaken from 1993 to 1999. The original slate roof was replaced by an asbestos shingle roof around 1970. In 2010 it was replaced by a new slate roof. The old frame rectory was replaced by a 1¬Ω-story concrete block structure with a Lannon stone veneer. It was designed by Des Moines architect Amos Emery and built by Ringland Johnson of Des Moines. Architecture The church building is largely rectangular in shape measuring , with a bell tower. The hexagonal structure on the north side of the main facade originally housed the baptistry. Its exterior walls are composed of Stone City limestone. Above the main entrance is a large pointed arch window flanked by two smaller pointed arch windows. Buttresses divide the side elevations into seven bays. The nave is marked by stained glass windows that alternate down each side elevation. Larger windows are located in the bays with wall dormers. The bays in between have paired lancet windows. The back wall is flat, concealing the rounded apse within. The interior features a rib vaulted ceiling that is supported by ten heavy hardwood hammer beams. The beams are embellished with trefoil, quatrefoil, and circular tracery. A large pointed arch frames the main altar area, and it is flanked by two smaller arches that frame the side altars. The side altar on the right has a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the one the left a statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. On the apse ceiling are paintings of nine saints added during the 1954 renovation. They cover what had been windows. The columns that frame the arches are adorned with capitals in the Corinthian order. The modified U-shaped rectory is connected toward the back of the church's west elevation by a hyphen. Its main entrance is on the west elevation facing a large yard. The stone and the steeply pitched slate roof were designed the match the church. The building provides living space for the priest in one section and office space for the parish in another.

It is one of the rare monuments which reached us safely. It is located in a small square-shaped territory surrounded with a cob wall. Architecture The mausoleum consists of a 10 m diameter cylinder, with a 14 m of height (till the upper layer of a cupola). It also consists of an underground sepulcher and inner decahedron cell with exits. Structure of the inner space of its aerial part is very interesting. Its lower part is a cylinder that becomes a decahedron with 8,7 meters high niches at a height of 2 meters. At the upper part the decahedron becomes a circle. The mausoleum was built of burnt and green-blue colored glazed bricks, which makes the word ‚ÄúAllah‚Äù for more than 200 times. Like in Garabaghlar Mausoleum, unglazed red facing bricks of this mausoleum are laid horizontally, but green-blue glazed bricks ‚Äì vertically. Affluently decorated portals and the main architectural and compositional accents of the mausoleum should also be noted. The mausoleum is a cylindrical tower with a height of 14 m. It consists of two parts over ground and underground (or basement). The underground part of the tomb has cross-shaped view and the grave located in this part. This part of the tomb was once covered with dome, and the interior was decorated with ornaments. The over ground part of the tomb is made up of three main architectural structures: keystone, circular ground form and tent- shaped dome. The diameter of the tower is 10 m. In the southern portal of the mausoleum the inscriptions indicates the date of construction: ‚ÄúShawwƒÅl (is the tenth month of the lunar based Islamic calendar) second and twentieth and seven hundred years‚Äù (that is, 722 AH or 1322). The inscription on the northern portal shows the name of the architect: ‚ÄúAhmad ibn Ayuub al-Hafiz Nakhchivani‚Äù. There are two entrances lead to the mausoleum (from north and south). The exterior of tomb was made of glazed bricks which included greenish-blue color and usual good quality red bricks. Glazed bricks were set vertically and horizontally. The entire surface of the tower is covered with the repeating word ‚ÄúAllah‚Äù, rotated at an angle of 45 degrees. The word \\"Allah\\" is repeated over 200 times. The upper frieze of the mausoleum is composed of four belts. Two lower belts and one upper are covered with ornaments, and the fourth wide belt located between them bears inscriptions. The entrances to the mausoleum from the north and the south are underlined by portals that stand out clearly against the general smooth background of the tower. The northern entrance to the mausoleum is accentuated by a richer finish and protrudes 30 cm from the body of the tower. Portal profiles, stalactites, archivolts and tympanums were decorated with geometric and vegetative ornaments in accordance with the patterns.  Reconstruction  The restoration process of the tomb stated in the 1960s. However, due to negligence during restoration the original appearance of the tomb changed (the inscriptions were erased, and the heavy concrete slab that placed on the roof caused cracks). In 2012, the restoration of the tomb started again 2012 and continued till 2018. The roof tomb (which was initially made of concrete during the first reconstruction period) was completely dismantled and reconstructed by tiling over bricks. In approximately 427 m¬≤ area simple and sophisticated tile elements were designed and applied. Ayatul-Kursi Surah and inscriptions with the Kufi alphabet that placed on the walls of tomb while construction (in 14th century) were restored. In addition, the mortar joints between tiles were cleaned and refilled with a special mix of mud. Cracks on the wall have been completely regenerated. The stairs have been covered with a glass cover, and there is a marble coffer inside the tomb. The restoration works were carried out by the order of the State Service for Cultural Heritage Protection, Development and Rehabilitation under the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Azerbaijan by \\"Azerbarpa\\" Scientific-Research Project Institute. The reopening took place on March 25, 2018.  History  Historically, two tower-shaped tombs were built in Barda city in the 14th century, and only one of them remained until the modern era. As its name in scientific literature Barda tomb was erected in 1322 according to the inscriptions which illustrates when and by whom the monument was built. Due to its architecture tomb has attracted the attention of researchers since the 19th century after the invasion of South Caucasus by the Russian empire. Famous orientalist Khanikov, who visited Barda in 1848, read the inscriptions on the monument and these inscriptions were later published by academician Dorn in Barda in 1861. Academician Dorn also published also the appearance of the Barda tomb. This inscription in the Barda tomb is an extremely valuable example of the Nakhchivan architectural school, which confirms that the architects of Nakhchivan were invited to other cities to build important buildings in the XIV century.

He was the son of Beno√Æt de Cornouaille and the father of Hoel II, Duke of Brittany. His family name, Canhiart, is understood to be derived from the old Breton Kann Yac'h and was translated into the Latin texts of his era as Bellator fortis. Life According to Paul Le Baud, Alain was a descendant of Rivallon Mur Marzou and therefore was a male line descendant of the early Kings of Brittany. As Count of Cornouaille he inherited his regnal rights from the family that appears to have ruled the Cornouaille region of Brittany from about the 10th century His father Beno√Æt (or Benedic) died between 1008 and 1029. He was the Count-Bishop of Cornouaille; he had been elected Bishop of Quimper circa 990 and exercised the offices jointly but kept them separated. His mother was Guigo√´don (or Guiguoedon); she was the daughter of Orscand le Grand, the Bishop of Vannes She was a member of the family of Alan I, King of Brittany. Alain became Count of Cornouaille circa 1020 when his father renounced this title. Alain's brother Orscand succeeded their father as Bishop of Cornouaille. At one point Alain supported rebels who opposed Alan III, Duke of Brittany. Alan III prevailed and punished Count Alain by confiscating his territories, in particular Belle-√éle-en-Mer. Alain returned to the Duke's good graces by facilitating his marriage to Berthe of Blois, the daughter of Count Odo; the duke allowed Alain to recover the property that had been seized that belonged to the dowry of Alain's mother. Alain married Judith of Nantes and through her gained a claim on the County of Nantes. In part as a result of his rising power, he was attacked by Alan III but was able to push back the Duke's army in 1031 in a battle near Locronan. In this battle Alain was assisted by Saint Ronan. Alan III and Alain were again reconciled. Quimperl√© with a view of the Romanesque Basilica from the Abbey of Sainte-Croix, founded by Alain After this second battle with the Duke of Brittany, Alain faced difficulties with his vassals in the Viscounty of Leon, most notably Guyomarch I. Guyomarch I allied with Morvan, Viscount of Faou, to oppose Alain. Alain was successful in putting down these revolts. Around 1029, after a serious illness, Alain founded the Abbey of Sainte-Croix of Quimperl√© with the assistance of his brother Orscand, the Bishop. He included Belle-√éle in his donation to the Abbey. In 1050, at the death of his wife's nephew, Mathias I of Nantes, Alain confirmed her inheritance and his rights to rule Nantes as regent for his son Hoel, the eventual Count of Nantes. Family Around 1026, Alain married Judith of Nantes, the daughter of Judica√´l of Nantes, who became the heir to the County of Nantes after the death of her nephew, Matthew, in 1050. As was the custom of the period, under the dowry arrangements Alain obtained five villages in Quistillic and half of the church of Cluthgual with the sepulcher and all appertaining rights.

The cinema is based in the rear side of the Palace Hotel complex on City Hall Square. The building was completed to an Art Ceco design by Anton Rosen in 1910. It was listed in the Listed buildings in Copenhagen#R|Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1093. History The Empire Theater shortly after its opening in 1913 The cinema is located on the rear side of the block which also contains the Palace Hotel on City Hall Square, Copenhagen's most fashionable hotel at the time of its opening in 1910. The entire block was designed by the architect Anton Rosen. The first cinema at the site opened on 26 December 1913. It was known as Empire Theatre and based in Palace Hotel's Grand Hall which had originally been built as a concert hall accessed from Mikkel Bryggers Gade. The director was Walter Christmas. The cinema changed its name to Metropol Theatre the following year, now with Sofus Madsen as managing director. Grand Teatret photographed on 16 August 1939 by Holger Damgaard In 1923, Metropol Theatre moved to Frederiksberggade. Its old premises were taken over by the film director Urban Gad who had recently returned to Copenhagen from Germany where he had worked since 1911. He reopened the cinema under the name Grand Theatre on 2 April as a venue for quality film. In 1939 the cinema was temporarily closed while the Grand Hall was converted into the auditorium today known as Grand 3. After Urban Gad's death in 1948, his wife Esther took over the cinema. On 1 August 1974, Peter Emil Refn and Kai Michelsen took over the Grand Teatret after Esther Gad. They had previously founded Camera Film, a distribution company specializing in import of Japanese, Swedish and French films to the Danish market. In 1976, they expanded the cinema with two new auditoria in addition to the old one which became known as Grand 3, and in 1977 it was followed by Grand 4 and Grand 5. Kai Michelsen left the management in 1979. Up through the 1970s and early 1980s, Grand gained a reputation as the \\"French\\" cinema in Copenhagen. The editor Palle Fogtdal bought a fifty percent share in Grand Theatre/Camera Film in 1984 but sold it again to Annette Trampedach in 1991. After Peter Emil Refn's death in 1994, Kirsten Dalgaard and Annette Trampedach took over the responsibility for the cinema. They were succeeded by Kim Foss in 1996. All six auditoria underwent renovations and modernisations between 1998 and 2012. Auditoria The cinema has six auditoria with a total of 773 seats. The largest auditorium (Grand 3) seats 326. Repertoire The repertoire consists mainly of European quality films. It is a member of the EU supported Europa Cinemas collaboration. Some of its films are imported directly through its own distribution company, Camera Film, which is represented every year at the Cannes Film Festival. Awards In 1993, Peter Emil Refn received an Honorary Robert for his contribution to Danish cinema through the Grand Theatre and Camera Films. In 2006, Grand Theatre received the award for Europe's best cinema at the Europa Cinemas Awards. In 2011, Kim Foss received the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in recognition of his contribution to French culture.

He is a seismologist, author, polymath, and historian of science. He coauthored with Sarvajit Singh, \\"Seismic Waves and Sources: the mathematical theory of seismology\\", a pioneering treatise since the nascent of this discipline at the turn of the 20th century. Ben-Menahem was born in Berlin, Germany on November 4, 1928. He received his master's degree in physics in 1954 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and his doctoral degree from the California Institute of Technology (CIT) in 1961. He did his post-doctoral research at CIT, where he worked with Hugo Benioff and Frank Press (1962-1965). In his doctoral thesis he pioneered the birth of modern seismic- source elastodynamics based on his theory of wave radiation from a finite rupturing fault with subshear or supershear velocity. His theory was confirmed through the observed asymmetric radiation of long-period surface-waves from the great Chilean earthquake of May 22, 1960, where he introduced the fundamental concepts of 'Directivity' and 'Potency' from which the moment tensor is derived. Since then, rupturing fault length, rupture velocity, moment-magnitude and moment energy are routinely calculable from spectra of recorded seismic waves-forms. In 1975, Ben-Menahem used seismic and barometric recording of the Tunguska event of June 30, 1908, to derive the height and energy of the explosion, demonstrating for the first time a feasible non- cometary mechanism of this extraterrestrial bolide encounter with earth.

It one of the oldest and most elaborate passion plays in Mexico as well as the best known, covered by media both in Mexico and abroad. Unlike others in Latin America, its origins are not in the colonial period but rather in a cholera epidemic in the 19th century, which gave rise to a procession to petition relief. Over time, the procession included a passion play which grew to include various scenes related to Holy Week. Today, the play includes not only hundreds of actors but also thousands of men called ‚ÄúNazarenes‚Äù who carry their own crosses to follow the actor chosen to play Jesus to the site where the crucifixion is reenacted. While the event is still primarily religious, it has also become a rite of identity for Iztapalapa (only residents of certain communities may participate) as well as a major tourism attraction for both the borough and the city. Description of event A \\"Nazarne\\" carrying cross during Holy Week in Iztapalapa In Mexico, many communities stage processions and passion plays for Good Friday, which in some places extends into other days of Holy Week. The Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa holds the largest and most elaborate of these, with up to 5,000 people participating and 150 of these with speaking roles. While a religious event principally, it is also a community event, as only residents of the eight original communities of the borough (San Lucas, Santa B√°rbara, San Ignacio, San Pablo, San Jos√©, San Pedro, La Asunci√≥n and San Miguel) can participate. The event is popular, drawing crowds of anywhere from 2.5 million to four million from Mexico and abroad during the week that scenes are performed. The play is also accompanied by news media helicopters and rows of police to keep control of the crowds. The performances do not adhere strictly to the Bible as there are influences from other religious writings and even secular stories. While it is claimed that the original script for the play still exists, its performance has evolved over the years. Unique features to the Iztapalapa event include a character called the ‚ÄúWandering Jew‚Äù, a harem belonging to King Herod, and a spy and dog that accompany Judas Iscariot who personally brings Jesus to Pontius Pilate. Costumes are elaborate. The Roman soldiers wear leather sandals, bright tunics, plumed helmets, and carry javelins and swords. A number of these ride horses lent by the Mexico City police who train them to ride. The performances begin on Palm Sunday with a procession along Calle Aztecas to the local parish church, where Mass is held. Then the recreation of Jesus‚Äôs entry into Jerusalem is held. On Holy Tuesday, a scene depicting the miracle of the loaves and fishes is held. Crowds grow for Maundy Thursday at the Cuitlahuac Plaza, which begins with a procession that finishes with the reenactment of the Last Supper, the washing of Jesus‚Äô feet, and Judas‚Äô betrayal. When Jesus is arrested, Aztec drums and flutes announce the event. There is also a Procession of Silence which winds its way through the eight communities. The play is intense and emotional, especially on Good Friday. The scene of Jesus being tried by Pontius Pilate occurs at midday at the Cuitlahuac Plaza. He is then turned over to the Pharisees. After this, about 10,000 take part in the procession to Calvary, carrying crosses of different sizes. This procession is an enactment of the Stations of the Cross. Jesus is kicked, beaten, and whipped, and cinematic blood used. When he stumbles and falls, the crowds react. Judas walks through the streets and the crowd calls out ‚Äútraitor‚Äù, as the actor throws fake coins from a bag. At the top of the Cerro de la Estrella, which doubles as Mount Calvary, the sound of nails being hammered comes across the loudspeakers, and the crowd becomes very quiet. The actor is really bound to the cross and remains there for about twenty minutes. As the cross with Jesus is lifted it is not unusual to see people crying. After the crucifixion, the representation ends with Judas hanging himself alongside Jesus. In addition to the man and women chosen to play Jesus and Mary, hundreds of young men called Nazarenes follow in the procession to the Cerro de la Estrella, barefoot, with crosses of varying sizes and often with crowns of thorns. They are accompanied by ‚ÄúV√≠rgenes de Pueblo‚Äù (Town Virgins) . The annual passion play has become an important tourist attraction for Mexico City, especially for the borough of Iztapalapa, which promotes tourism to the area during this time, offering guided tours of local museums, landmarks and green spaces. There are also specials in local hotels and restaurants. Around the staging areas, there is a carnival atmosphere with street vendors, amusement rides, and those selling religious items. Many of the scenes take place on the esplanade in front of borough hall. In 1992 the city published a book about it called Semana Santa en Iztapalapa (Holy Week in Iztapalapa). In 2009 a cultural festival called the Festival Cultural Pasi√≥n por Iztapalapa was created to run alongside the religious event. In the same year, two monumental sawdust carpets were created related to the event for a photographic exhibition on the plaza in front of borough hall. However, in remembrance of the solemnity of the occasion, the sale of alcohol in all venues, including bars, restaurants, and nightclubs is banned for the entire week. Preparations The production of the event is a massive undertaking. It requires the coordination of people from the eight original communities (barrios) of the borough, which amount to thousands of people who devote months rehearsing, creating costumes and sets, and then decorating churches and streets and more. A number of the tasks as well as certain roles have been passed down for generations, such as providing first aid, creating the cloth Veronica uses to wipe Jesus‚Äô face, and certain acting roles ‚Äì although this has been challenged as more people want to participate. There are 136 principal actors that rehearse for 37 days, along with another 275 actors, 500 extras, and about 2,000 Nazarenes that follow the actor playing Jesus when he carried the cross to his crucifixion. In addition, there is coordination with borough and city authorities who provide logistics in terms of thousands of police for crowd control, as well as ambulances, doctors, helicopters and water stations. Direct costs run in the hundreds of thousands of pesos, with millions more in city services. All of this is coordinated by a committee of Iztapalapa residents, called the Comit√© Organizador de la Semana Santa en Iztapalapa. It has over fifty members and its organization is partially based on indigenous traditions. Police line streets for the Good Friday procession to Cerro de la Estrella Another important role for the committee is to select the people to play the most important roles, especially the man and woman to play Jesus and Mary respectively. Tradition demands that those chosen to play these two roles may not date, drink, smoke or go to parties until they have finished their commitments, along with two newer traditions: no tattoos or piercings. The candidates must also show that they have the economic means to buy the costumes. The candidates are investigated to ensure they meet these requirements. In addition, candidates to play Jesus must also show that they have the physical endurance for the beatings and for carrying of a 100 kilo (220 lb.) cross for four kilometers. Once the chosen candidate passes the two rounds of the selection process, he is then required to remain celibate for the intervening year before the performance, and begin physical training six months in advance. History A \\"Nazarene\\" resting during the procession The event is one of the most elaborate and oldest of its kind in Mexico. However, unlike most passion plays in Latin America, this does not date from the colonial period. Its origins are in a cholera epidemic in 1843 when the Iztapalapa area, outside of Mexico City proper, had a population of about 20,000, mostly indigenous. As a petition to ease the pestilence, the area began a procession to the ‚ÄúSe√±or de la Cuevita‚Äù ( Lord of the Small Cave), an image of Christ entering Jerusalem on a donkey which is found in a small natural cave in the community of Pueblo Culhuac√°n. When the epidemic ended it was seen as a miracle and it became a permanent annual event. Soon after, the procession included a reenactment of the crucifixion on Good Friday, and over time the passion play grew to cover almost all of the events associated with Holy Week. Although its origins are in the 19th century, there is evidence of syncretism with indigenous traditions. The procession changed from the image in the cave to Cerro de la Estrella in 1920, after a heavy rain inundated the original site. This site was that of the Pyramid of Mixcoatl, associated with the New Fire ceremony. Aztec drums and flutes appear in the event as well. Catholic authorities have alternatively banned and approved the event since its inception. There is a letter dated 1867 asking Benito Ju√°rez for help in its preservation against hostile church authorities. During the Mexican Revolution, the event was suspended due to clashes between governmental and church authorities. However a legend states that Emiliano Zapata lent his horses and ordered the renewal of the event in 1914. Church criticisms of the play have included that it deviates too much from the Biblical account, and it does have elements of other stories such as Dante‚Äôs Divine Comedy. Examples of deviation include King Herod‚Äôs harem which performs a sensual belly dance. However, the play has survived not only church prosecution but also governmental opposition to public displays of religion and Iztapalapa‚Äôs demographic change from indigenous to mestizo. The popularity of the performance began to significantly increase after World War II, attracting tourists first from within Mexico then from abroad. Popularity increased in the 1960s, when Vatican II legitimated passion reenactments. It has become the most famous passion play in Mexico. Television coverage of the event began in the 1980s, and since has regularly been broadcast to the Spanish-speaking world, as well as covered by media in the United States and Europe. While it remains first and foremost a religious event, it has also become a rite of local identity and has brought attention to the poverty of the borough. A documentary about the event called \\"Iztapalapa, memoria y tradici√≥n\\" was directed by Francisco Alatriste Torres of the Escuela Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia. The city government has declared the event to be an intangible cultural heritage of Mexico City, as part of an effort to gaining similar recognition from UNESCO. The increased tourism, as well as ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù and influence from other passion plays, have had an effect. The urban space where the play takes place has changed to accommodate its growth. Passion plays in the Philippines have had an influence leading to more realism in the violence, both in the flogging and the crucifixion. The actors have become younger, as well as the Nazarenes which now include some children. =Passion Play 2020= Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, the play was moved indoors for the first time in its 177-year history and it was broadcast on television. Fairs, commercial events, pilgrimages, and shows associated with Holy Week in Mexico were suspended. Schools were closed and vacationers were advised to stay away from beaches and other tourist attractions. The broadcasts, the first to be aired nationwide on television, were co-produced by the borough government and public stations Channel 14 and Channel 11, as well as the city-owned Capital 21 (with broadcasts online to viewers abroad as before, but with the added first of international broadcasts via satellite).

Potentiality of climate change adaptation Response to climate change in Nepal has been growing in recent years with an effort to cope with the changing situation and build resilience capacity into adaptation to climate change. In climate induced vulnerability context, Nepal developed policy level provision regarding to adaptation policy called National Adaptation Programme of Action to climate change (NAPA).NAPA 2010 National Adaptation Programmes of Actions: Ministry of Environment/GoN,http://www.moste.gov.np/elibrary?page=3#.USZNYR3Is1I The NAPA document opened the door to act adaptation activities into country.

However, this document is still silent to provision of implementation mechanism at community level. Though there are still silent to act adaptation implementation mechanism at community level, some community level adaptive strategies are being implemented as community based adaptation plan for poor & vulnerable communities and who have less capacity to cope with disaster and are more dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods. Adaptation in the agricultural sector Adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector and allied sectors is a major current and future challenge for Nepal. The majority of the population is still dependent on highly climate-sensitive agriculture. In recent years, long drought spells during the monsoon season and increased temperatures and unseasonal heavy rains during winter have caused serious distress to agriculture-dependent communities in many locations. If the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of ending poverty, achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture are to be realised, climate change adaptation interventions need to be implemented in earnest.Climate-smart agriculture in Nepal, Climate & Development Knowledge Network, 31 July 2017 Goods and services from community forest After 3 decades of CF in Nepal, more than 1.652 million forest lands handed over to 1.45 million households of 17685 community forest user group (CFUG)Department of Forest/GoN from http://www.dof.gov.np/division/community-forest- division/community-forestry to conserve, manage and utilization . CFUG as a common property resource management program in Nepal have resulted in improving forest cover and condition. By institutionally, Community forest user group is autonomous, independent and accountable institution for conserving, managing and utilizing of natural resources in Nepal legitimized by Forest Act 1992 and Forest Regulation 1995 of Nepal. The additional advantages are as effective protection, wise use of resources, plantation, forest fire control, and more effective contribution to local development and economic generation. It enhanced biodiversity, water flow and soil stability. More than 90% of villagers report that their forests are in better condition than a decade ago. Furthermore, CFs are able to meet poor & vulnerable household's daily subsistence needs for forest products such as firewood, fodder, & timbers. Apart from this, growing forests capture and store carbon that are contributing to both mitigation and adaptation to CC. Because of, user groups have institutionally developed after CF handed over. Furthermore, the landscape of hills of Nepal drastically transformed into greenery.Community based Conservation Is It make effective, efficient and sustainable? from http://www.future.org/publications/community-based- conservation-it-more-effective-efficient-and-sustainable Such types of changes have positive impact on carbon sequestration which has contributed in reducing effects of climate change. It is not only the CF contributing in climate change adaptation by providing goods and services, the CFUGs have also been used as local institutions for adaptation planning. Conclusion Traditional top-down decision-making processes have become inadequate, due to their inability to create appropriate solutions for local communities. Nepal's forest cover, condition and quality are being improved. This is the success of only through three way partnership such as communities from bottom-up function, government & donor from top-down function and NGOs, civil society network from outside-in. In this situation, CFUGs have to be involved in mainstreaming to implement climate change adaptation. It is due to they are playing the key role in proactive in investing their funds, climate change knowledge transfer and policy feedback to adopt to the impact of climate change. Policy shall be emphasized the establishing groups around the resources that are indispensable for the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable groups to access diversification opportunity. It is necessary to bridge this gap; bottom-up approaches may produce the best results by building on local experiences and knowledge. For this, building-up the capacity of groups and their poor and vulnerable communities on climate change mitigation and adaptation is pertinent. In addition to this, focus needs to be given on institutional development, capacity building and awarding CFUGs for their good work on forest development and bio-diversity protection which ultimately contributes to ecological and environment balance.

This page should not list all chance involved in all discoveries (i.e. it should focus on discoveries reported for their notable circumstances). Overview Royston Roberts says that various discoveries required a degree of genius, but also some lucky element for that genius to act on.Roberts, Royston M. (1989). Serendipity: Accidental Discoveries in Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. New York. Richard Gaughan writes that accidental discoveries result from the convergence of preparation, opportunity, and desire. Major everyday discoveries that were helped by luck in some way include products like vulcanized rubber, teflon, nylon, penicillin, cyanoacrylate (Super Glue), the implantable pacemaker, the microwave oven, Scotchgard, Saran wrap, Silly Putty, Slinky, safety glass, propeller, snowmaking, stainless steel, Perkin's mauve, and popsicles. Most artificial sweeteners have been discovered when accidentally tasted, including aspartame and saccharin. Ideas include the theory of the Big Bang, tissue culture, radio astronomy, and the discovery of DNA. Such archeological discoveries as the Rosetta Stone, the Dead Sea Scrolls and the ruins of Pompeii also emerged partly out of serendipity. Many relevant and well known scientific theories were developed by chance at some degree along history. According to a legend, Archimedes realized his principle on hydrostatics when he entered in a bath full of water, which overflows (he then shouted out his famous \\"Eureka!\\"). And the unexpected, negative results of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment in their search of the luminiferous aether ultimately led to the special theory of relativity by Albert Einstein. The optical illusion called the \\"flashed face distortion effect\\" suggests a new area of research in the neurology of face perception. Detailed examples=Newton and gravity= Newton's reflections that led him to his theories about gravity started when he saw an apple fall from a tree In his book, Roberts recounts Sir Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity (using Newton's own descriptions and notes). Newton was sitting in his yard when he noticed an apple fall from a tree. The apple fell straight down, perpendicular to the ground, and Newton found himself wondering why the apple never falls upward or off to a side. Newton soon realized that it was a property of all matter to have an attractive force, including the apple, and even the moon ‚Äì which moves as one would expect if it was passing the earth but nevertheless being attracted. It was another 20 years before Newton published his detailed theory of gravity, but he later visited the tree that helped him provoke the idea. Gaughan elaborates that Newton only had the opportunity to reflect on his orchard because of other chance circumstances: Newton was home because his university was shut down due to an outbreak of plague. =Nobel and blasting gelatin= According to Roberts, the common story that Alfred Nobel's discovery of dynamite was an accident may not be true. On the other hand, Roberts says, Nobel did make a discovery with the help of luck soon after that. Nobel cut his finger on a piece of glass one day at work and subsequently applied collodion in order to form a protective layer over the wound (similar in principle to liquid bandage). Nobel was kept up at night by the pain in his finger, so he started to think about a problem he was having back at work: Nobel was trying to create a powerful explosive using nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine, but the two would not combine. Roberts reports that Nobel then realized that collodion (which he was using to dress his wound) could allow the two substances to combine, which led to the invention of blasting gelatin (as powerful as dynamite but much safer to handle). =Pasteur= Pasteur was lucky to be using a particular kind of acid salt, but also lucky that he left his solution on a window sill overnight. Otherwise there would have been no chemical reaction, and his genius would have had nothing to notice and interpret. The French scientist Louis Pasteur is responsible for various discoveries, some of which involved serendipity in some way. This seems to be the case with both his discovery that chemically identical molecules can have chirality (the way a right handed baseball glove will not work with the left hand), as well as his discovery of the chicken cholera vaccine. Chirality Roberts writes \\"Pasteur was puzzled: the salts of tartaric acid and racemic acid were said to be identical in chemical composition and crystalline shape, but they had different effects on polarized light.\\" Pasteur later prepared a solution of only racemic acid and found that it itself contained salt crystals with chirality and which affected light differently. This was somewhat lucky because the type of salt crystals that Pasteur was studying (sodium ammonium salt of racemic acid) is one of few salts that would be visibly different in Pasteur's time. Moreover, the salts only differentiate if the solution reaches a temperature below ; Pasteur did not know about this temperature requirement, but he did happen to store the solution on a window sill over night and the cold Paris air activated it. Chicken cholera vaccine Pasteur and his assistants had succeeded in isolating a microbe from chickens sick or dead from cholera. Chickens injected with the isolated microbe invariably died ‚Äî a key element in Pasteur's reasoning that the microbe was responsible for the disease, rather than a result of the disease, as many thought. Pasteur was searching for a method of preventing the disease, but no matter what he did to the \\"broth\\" of microbes or to the chickens, all injected chickens died. Gaughan writes \\"Finally Pasteur had had enough, he needed a vacation. He told [his assistant] to take care of injecting more chickens with the next batch of bacteria.\\" His assistant neglected the task, electing to go on vacation as well. When the men returned and injected chickens with the batch of bacteria that had sat around for a few weeks, none died, indicating to Pasteur that the batch of bacteria had been ruined. But when those same chickens were injected with a new batch of bacteria, none of them died, while chickens that hadn't previously been injected with the \\"spoiled\\" batch all died. Pasteur reasoned that the \\"attenuated\\" microbes in the spoiled batch \\"'used up' something within the body; something that wasn't there for the fully functional bacteria to eat.\\" His explanation was wrong, but his chance creation of attenuated bacteria resulted in the first intentionally created vaccine.

Methanol is extremely toxic to humans. If as little as 10 ml of pure methanol is ingested, for example, it can break down into formic acid, which can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerve, and 30 ml is potentially fatal, although the median lethal dose is typically 100 ml (3.4 fl oz) (i.e. 1‚Äì2 ml/kg body weight of pure methanol. This does not happen with ethanol, which breaks down into acetic acid, which is non-toxic on small amounts. Reference dose for methanol is 0.5 mg/kg/day.Methanol (CASRN 67-56-1) Toxic effects take hours to start, and effective antidotes can often prevent permanent damage. Because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to ethanol (the alcohol in beverages), it is difficult to differentiate between the two. Australia In 2016 three people died and one suffered partial blindness when they ingested a home-made beverage containing methanol. In 1997 two people from Central Australia died and two survived after ingesting a drink made from methanol and other alcoholic beverages. Brazil In 1999, 35 people died, in ten cities of the state of Bahia as a result of drinking cacha√ßa contaminated with methanol. Further investigation revealed concentrations as high as 24.84% methanol. As other different cases have also been related, in a 20 day window there have been 450 people hospitalized with the toxicity symptoms of methanol ingestion. Cambodia In 2012, 49 people died, and more than 300 people were hospitalized, after drinking rice wine contaminated by methanol.Xinhua 49 Cambodians die, 318 hospitalized by home-made rice wine February 15, 2012 Costa Rica 25 persons died in August 2019 due to methanol poisoning. Czech Republic Customs Administration of the Czech Republic monitors observance of the ban in Prague, September 13. The 2012 Czech Republic methanol poisonings occurred in September 2012 in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. Over the course of several days, 38 people in the Czech Republic and 4 people in Poland died as a result of methanol poisoning and several tens of others were taken to hospital. El Salvador In El Salvador, as many as 122 people died in 2000 as a result of drinking low quality liquors sold in unauthorized shops that were found to be adulterated with methanol. The incident prompted the authorities to declare a 10-day emergency prohibition and a massive inspection of alcohol-vending establishments. The root cause was believed to be an act of terrorism, possibly a social cleansing campaign targeted against alcoholics, as the offending distilleries were not found to be responsible for the methanol contents that were present in the affected liquors. Estonia The P√§rnu methanol poisoning incident occurred in P√§rnu county, Estonia, in September 2001, when 68 people died and 43 were left disabled after contents of stolen methanol canisters were used in production of bootleg liquor.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, nearly 300 people died and over a thousand became ill from drinking methanol in the belief that drinking it can kill the virus in the body. Italy In 1986 the methanol-tainted wine scandal was a fraud perpetrated by adulterating table wine with methanol, poisoning hundred of people, with 90 hospitalized, 23 deaths, and many others heavily injured (blindness and neurological damages). Libya At least 51 people died in Tripoli in 2013. The consumption and sale of alcohol is illegal in Libya. Madagascar The Madagascar methanol mass poisoning occurred in 1998 when 200 people died.  Malaysia  From September until October 2018, 45 people have been reported died of methanol poisoning from drinking fake liquor. In this incident, the methanol content was up to 50 times more than the permissible amount. Cases of toxic alcohol poisoning have been reported in Selangor, the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, Perak and Negeri Sembilan. The deaths comprised various nationalities mostly of foreign workers from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar and Nepal. Around 30 people including three Indian nationals, believed to be responsible for the distribution of cheap counterfeit liquor to retailers around Selayang and Desa Jaya which led to the methanol poisoning incident have been arrested. Nigeria Between April 14 and April 26, 2015, 23 deaths were recorded in relation to methanol poisoning in Ayadi and Ode-Irele towns of Irele Local Government Area in Ondo State. 66 people in Rivers State died over a few weeks that started in April 2015 due to methanol-contaminated ogogoro. Norway Between September 2002 and December 2004, 51 people were admitted to hospital with symptoms of methanol poisoning, of whom 9 died. A further 8 people who died outside hospital were found to have died from methanol poisoning following autopsy. The liquor responsible for all of the cases contained 20% methanol and 80% ethanol and probably came from the same source in southern Europe. Russia In December 2016, 72 people died in a mass methanol poisoning in Irkutsk, Siberia. The poisoning was precipitated by drinking counterfeit surrogate alcohol‚Äîactually scented bath lotion that was marked as not safe for consumption. Named Boyaryshnik (\\"Hawthorn\\"), it was described by the Associated Press as being counterfeit.  Spain  In 1963, methanol was used in the preparation of bottled mixed alcohol drinks such as coffee liqueur.

Many of the deaths were blamed on the reluctance of people to openly admit their relatives had been drinking it, allowing the abuse of the substance to continue. When revelations came about houses were searched, with around 120 jerrycans uncovered. United States In December 1963, a rash of 31 deaths in Philadelphia's homeless population was traced to a local store that knowingly sold Sterno to people for them to consume and get drunk. In January 2016, consumption of a mixture of Mountain Dew and methanol, referred to as Dewshine, resulted in the reported deaths of two Tennessee high school students. The methanol in this case was believed to come from racing fuel. In April 2018 a Massachusetts man died after ingesting alcohol that was contaminated with methanol.

It arranges the collection, and delivery of its customers‚Äô items, through major couriers for the more lower cost, compared to customers booking transportation directly.  History  The courier service was founded by entrepreneur Paul Stewart, in November 2009, after he had experienced difficulties moving his personal belongings, from his home in Northern Ireland, to where he was studying, at the University of Edinburgh. Stewart established the business, in his second year of studying an engineering degree at the University, using his student loan as funding. The company is now currently based in Belfast. Since it was founded, My Baggage has expanded into worldwide shipping, and since May 2015, it currently offers the services of DHL Express and Parcelforce.

Life Beckman was born in Stockholm, the son of Melcher Beckman and his wife Chistiana van Benningen. He left Sweden around 1645 to serve Charles I during the English Civil War. His brother, also a military engineer serving Charles, was taken prisoner by the parliament forces in 1644, but after some time on bread and water, was released in a poor state of health. In 1653 he joined the royalist exiles at Middelburg, the bearer of important information from England, and died before the Restoration. Martin Beckman in 1660 petitioned Charles II for the place of royal engineer, formerly enjoyed by his brother, and mentioned that he \\"was ruined and severely injured by an accident at an explosion in the preparation of fireworks to be shown on the water in the king's honour.\\" He was accordingly employed as an engineer, and his skill in laboratory work led to his appointment on 6 June 1661 to the expedition under Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich as \\"firemaster with and in his majesty's fleete\\". He sailed from Deptford with the fleet on 13 June in the ship Augustine, and, after a short time at Alicante, proceeded against the pirates of Algiers; but, the enterprise failing, the fleet bore away for Tangiers, of which possession was taken as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza on 30 January 1662. A governor and garrison were left there, and the fleet proceeded to Lisbon to escort Queen Catherine to England. Plans of the actions at Algiers were made by Beckman and later engraved. In Tangier, Beckman made plans of the place and proceeded to erect a number of fortifications, mainly outlying fortlets. A plan of Tangiers was sent home before the fleet returned, and Samuel Pepys mentions in his Diary under 28 February 1662, that he presented to the Duke of York from Lord Sandwich \\"a fine map of Tangiers, done by one Captain Martin Beckman, a Swede, that is with my lord. We stayed looking over it a great while with the duke.\\" This map is in the collection of George III in the British Museum. In 1663, the new governor of Tangier, the Earl of Teviot, pressed Beckman to design such fortifications as he considered necessary, estimated to cost ¬£200,000, but dismissed him within days with a promissory note on two Dutch merchants in lieu of pay. Beckman was so infuriated at his treatment by Teviot that he went to Spain and offered to betray Tangier to the Duke of Medina-Sidonia in exchange for a \\"Regiment of Foot\\" and money. Having had chance to reflect on his actions, he realised that Spanish occupation of Tangier would result in his colleagues being imprisoned. He returned to England and was to confess all to the king, but was betrayed by the same Dutch merchants. He was committed to the Tower, but wrote to the King of Sweden, begging his intersession. He was released and went to serve the King of Sweden in Stade. A plan of Tangier was sent to Sweden. As noted, in 1663 Beckman was committed a prisoner to the Tower of London. He stated, in a petition to the king and council for a trial, that he had been half a year a close prisoner through the malice of one person for discovering the designs of the Spaniards and others against his majesty. He thereupon left England. After the raid up the Medway by the Dutch fleet under Michiel de Ruyter in 1667, he wrote on 24 June to the king from Stade in Bremen, that he had brought to perfection a mode of firing ships which he offered for service against the Dutch, who had done him infinite wrongs. He was then recalled, and consulted as to fortifications at Sheerness to guard the Medway. He was placed in charge of these defences until on 19 October 1670 he was nominated engineer to the office of ordnance, and third engineer of Great Britain from 1 July of that year. On 9 May of the following year, when Colonel Thomas Blood and his accomplices stole the crown and sceptre from the jewel-house in the Tower of London, Beckman, whose official residence was in the Tower, heard the alarm, and after a severe struggle made Blood a prisoner. Beckman was awarded ¬£100 for his share in the capture. In 1672 he visited Carlisle and Clifford's Fort at the mouth of the Tyne, plans of which and some cleverly executed water- colour views are in the British Museum.See Walpole, Anecdotes of Painting, 1888, ii, 235. In the following year he was an engineer of the ordnance train in the expedition against Holland under Prince Rupert, and took part in the naval engagements of 28 May, 4 June, and 11 August. At the end of 1674 Charles II gave verbal directions that his salary should be increased by ¬£150 per annum. In January 1678 he was appointed with Sir Bernard de Gomme and Sir Jonas Moore on a commission to strengthen the fortifications of Portsmouth and to fortify Gosport, and buy land for the purpose. On 3 March a royal warrant secured to him the reversion of chief engineer of Great Britain on the death of Sir Bernard De Gomme. About this time he was promoted to be major in the army. On 7 February 1681 he was appointed second engineer of Great Britain, and went to Hull as a commissioner to carry out the defence works there, and also reported on the defences of Holy Island and Berwick-on-Tweed in 1682 and 1683. In April 1683 he was recalled from Hull to join Lord Dartmouth's expedition to Tangier as chief engineer. Samuel Pepys sailed with this expedition, and his narrative of the voyage was published in 1841. On 29 August, when at sea, Pepys read Beckman's project for the destruction of Tangier. The object of the expedition ‚Äì the destruction of the mole and defences of Tangier and the withdrawal of the garrison ‚Äì having been satisfactorily accomplished, Beckman went to Gibraltar, and made a plan of the Rock of Gibraltar in two sheets, which is now in the King's Library, British Museum. After his return to England he was sent to Scotland to design works for strengthening Stirling, and he also reported on the defences of fortifications across England: Carlisle Castle, The Castle, Newcastle, Tynemouth Castle, Scarborough Castle, Chester Castle, Yarmouth Castle, and Landguard Fort. Shortly after the accession of James II, he was knighted (20 March 1686). On 11 June 1685, when Lord Dartmouth raised his royal regiment of fusiliers, Beckman was given a commission as captain in it, the regiment being generally quartered at the Tower of London. On 23 December 1685 he succeeded De Gomme, who had died, as chief engineer of Great Britain. On 14 February 1688 he supervised by royal command a display of fireworks from his own design on the occasion of the queen's delivery of a son. On 11 August he was appointed \\"comptroller of fireworkes as well for war as for triumph\\", with an allowance of ¬£200. a year. He thus became the first head of the royal laboratory at Woolwich and principal storekeeper. On 15 October he was appointed chief engineer of the king's train against William of Orange, but no action was necessary, and he returned to London and served under William. During the absence this year on account of ill-health of Sir Henry Sheeres, Surveyor-General of the Ordnance, Beckman acted for him. In 1689 he was busy with the defences of Hull and Berwick-on-Tweed, and obtained a royal warrant (23 August) for the execution of his proposed fortifications in the Isle of Wight. In 1691 he accompanied Major-general Thomas Tollemache to Ireland, landing at Dublin at the latter end of May, and took part under Godart de Ginkel in the Siege of Athlone in June, the Battle of Aghrim on 12 July, and the Siege of Limerick in August and September. He was appointed on 28 February 1692 to be colonel commanding the ordnance train for the sea expedition, and in April he sat as a member of General Ginkel's committee on the organisation of the train. In June he embarked with the train and a force of seven thousand men under the Duke of Leinster, for a descent upon the French coast; but the French troops proving too numerous in the vicinity of La Hague, the troops were landed at Ostend. They captured Furnes and Dixmude, which Beckman strengthened with new works. He returned to England at the end of October. In 1693 he again commanded the ordnance train in the summer expedition. At the end of May 1694 he sailed in command of the train and of all the bomb-vessels and machines, with the troops under Thomas Tollemache, and arrived with the fleet at Camaret Bay on 7 June, when the land attack failed. Dieppe and Le Havre were then reduced to ruins by Beckman's bomb-vessels, and the whole coast so harassed and alarmed that the inhabitants had to be forcibly kept in the coast towns. Having returned to St. Helens on 26 July, Beckman and his bomb-vessels went with the fleet under Sir Clowdisley Shovell to the attack of Dunkirk and Calais in September, and then returned to England. Castle Cornet He afterwards visited the Channel Islands and reported on the defences of Guernsey. His plans of St. Peter's, Castle Cornet, and the Bouche de Vale, with water-colour sketches, are in the British Museum. On 22 May 1695 Beckman was appointed to the command of the ordnance train and the machine and bomb- vessels for the summer expedition to the straits of Gibraltar, and took part in the operations on the coast of Catalonia, returning home in the autumn. His demands for projectiles for his bomb-vessels were so large that the board of ordnance represented that parliament had made no provision to meet them. He exercised a similar command in the summer expedition under Lord Berkeley, which sailed at the end of June 1696 to \\"insult the coast of France\\". On 3 July Berkeley detached a squadron of ten ships of war under Captain Mees, E..N., and Beckman with his bomb-vessels. They entered St. Martin's, Isle of Rh√©, on the 5th under French colours, which they struck as soon as they had anchored. They bombarded the place all that night and the following day, expending over two thousand bombs and destroying the best part of the town. On the 7th they sailed for Olonne, where a like operation produced a similar result, and then rejoined the fleet, returning to Torbay. These enterprises created such alarm that over a hundred batteries were ordered by the French ministry to be erected between Brest and Goulet, and over sixty thousand men were continually in arms for coast defence. Early in 1697 Beckman surveyed all the bomb-vessels, ten of which he reported to be in good condition and fitted to take in twenty mortars \\"which are all we have serviceable\\". On the general thanksgiving for peace on 2 December Beckman designed the fire-work display before the king and the royal family in St. James's Square, London; his drawing representation of it is in the King's Library, British Museum. Beckman took painting lessons from the Dutch painter Jan Wyck.Katharine Gibson, ‚ÄòWyck , Jan (c.1645‚Äì1700)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 10 Oct 2015 Lack of money for defences caused Beckman as much difficulty as his predecessors and successors in office. Representations of insecurity ‚Äì in regard to Portsmouth, for example, in 1699 ‚Äì led to many plans and reports, but nothing was effected. Beckman died in London on 24 June 1702. He appears to have married Elizabeth, daughter of Talbot Edwards, keeper of the crown jewels. She was buried at the Tower of London on 12 December 1677. Two sons, Peter and Edward, were also buried there on 7 February 1676 and 29 June 1678 respectively. The board of ordnance wrote to Marlborough that Beckman's death was a very great loss. The post remained unfilled for nine years.

Asher is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist and son of musical parents. After releasing a solo CD in 2004 and teaming with vocalist Joshua Huff in the band Illbreak in 2005 to release a CD, followed by an album under his own name 2007, Asher assembled what was to become the Earthlings and recorded his best- selling album to date in 2010. Using revenues from a successful Kickstarter project concluded June, 2011, Gareth and the Earthlings toured venues throughout the Southeastern United States in 2011. The first public appearance of the band under the name Gareth Asher and the Earthlings was at The Park Tavern in Piedmont Park, Atlanta, Georgia on June 16, 2012. Gareth Asher and the Earthlings have appeared at venues throughout Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. Asher was named Musician of the Year at the Atlanta Chozen Awards in 2010. The band's music and lyrics are written by Gareth Asher, although they frequently cover other artists in the Southern Soul genre. Musical style Asher is notably terse in comments about his personal life. For examples, see his Str8tshootermusic and Atlanta Music Guide. However, in an interview with When We Speak TV he discusses his musical influences and interests. In this interview, Asher credits his interest in music to having grown up in an atmosphere of rock and funk music -- Jackson Browne in particular. He credits the honing of his vocal talents to Jan Smith, coach for Rob Thomas of [Matchbox 20] and [Usher]. The Earthlings' style, identified as Southern Soul, has been connected with outstanding examples of that genre. Asher readily expresses his admiration for the pop/rock tradition connected with other Georgia natives Ray Charles and James Brown. In comments likening Asher's voice to that of famed tenors such as Jeff Buckley, Ray Lamontagne, and even Cat Stevens, record and session producer Charlie Peacock describes Gareth Asher and the Earthlings as \\"solid in all the ways we need a decidedly American singer-songwriter to be. What do you get? To begin with there‚Äôs loopy grooves, big wide tambourines, and a by- the-book folky, rock mix. All the usual Americana instruments are up front and in the shadows: Acoustic guitars, B3, Wurlitzer electric piano, drums, bass, and electrics.\\" Peacock adds \\"I like this. Good job. But that doesn‚Äôt matter much. What I hear is that the femmes really like them some Gareth. Who needs one reviewer in your court when you‚Äôve got 3.5 Billion females on your side? Carry on Gareth.

Biography=Early life and career= Seabury Stanton was born on Oct. 9, 1892 in New Bedford, Massachusetts. His father and grandfather had been Yankee whaling captains in New Bedford. He attended the local schools, the New Bedford Textile School, and Harvard University, where he graduated in the class of 1915. The following year he married Jean Kellogg Austin (1892-1976) and began work in textile manufacturing as the treasurer for the Hathaway Manufacturing Company. Hathaway Manufacturing eventually became Berkshire Hathaway after merging with Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates in 1955, becoming the largest surviving textile manufacturer in New England with 15 mills. The company was founded in the nineteenth century with Horatio Hathaway's profits from whaling and the China Trade, but the textile industry in New England declined after World War I and didn't recover until after the Great Depression with the outbreak of World War II. In the late 1950s the industry was again in decline, facing low-cost competition from elsewhere in the United States and abroad. Stanton managed the company as president and his son Jack served as treasurer. Jack Stanton was expected to take over as president, but the Stantons were ousted before that took place. Seabury's brother, Otis Stanton, managed sales at the company and often conflicted with his brother, eventually selling his shares to Warren Buffett after a meeting at the Wamsutta Club. Seabury Stanton was a miller and a manager with an overriding aim to keep the business going but he was not a financial expert and he continued to plough back most of the company‚Äôs earnings into working capital, despite ever decreasing cotton prices, resulting from increased competition at home and abroad. =Ouster of Stanton by Buffett= In 1962 Warren Buffett began buying shares of Berkshire because he thought the company was selling at a discount to its actual value after noticing a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill. Eventually Buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company's financial situation was not going to improve. In 1964 Stanton made a verbal tender offer of $11 per share for the company to buy back Buffett's shares. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11. Buffett later admitted that this lower (undercutting offer) made him angry.Buffett's Worst Trade. CNBC (February 26, 2009). Retrieved on July 8, 2011. Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton. Personal life Seabury Stanton was Chairman and Director of the Northern Textile Association for many terms and an avid sailor in his free time. Stanton also published a book on Berkshire, titled \\"Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. A saga of courage.\\" Stanton died on October 19, 1971, and is buried in Dartmouth, Massachusetts.

He was born in Waltham Abbey, Essex, where he was baptised on 11 June 1743,Winters 1885, p.203 the son of the builder Lancelot Leverton. Having learned his father's trade he acquired the skills of architecture with the help of patrons. He built houses both in London and the countryside, including Watton Wood Hall (now Woodhall Park), Hertfordshire, built in 1777‚Äì82 for Sir Thomas Rumbold, which includes a hall decorated in the Etruscan style. In 1780 he designed Plaistow Lodge (now Quernmore School) for Peter Thellusson at Bromley, Kent in a style suggestive of Adams. His domed refit of Scampston Hall near Malton, Yorkshire (1803), reflected the work of Wyatt. Other houses by Leverton, now demolished, included Woodford Hall, Essex, built in 1775 for William Hunt, and Riddlesworth Hall, Norfolk, built in 1792 for Silvanus Bevan III.

Leverton showed the design at the Royal Academy in 1781.Pastscape; Graves 1905. The inscription on the arch is dated two years later:\\"LIBERTY IN N AMERICA TRIUMPHANT MDCCLXXXIII\\". He has sometimes been credited with the design of Bedford Square in London: while this is uncertain some of the individual houses are attributed to him, and interiors, including those at No 13, where he lived from 1795. His chief skill lay in the innovatory design of small-scale interiors. Describing his work at Woodhall Park, Nikolaus Pevsner said that Leverton's interiors \\"have a style, decidedly their own, different from Adam's or Chambers's or Hollands's\\" their character coming out most clearly in the central staircase hallway, \\"profusely but very delicately decorated with plaster √† la antique\\".Pevsner 1953, p.278 Leverton was surveyor to the Grocers' Company, for whom he built a new hall, completed in 1802. A brick building with stone facings (including a rusticated basement level and Tuscan pilasters), it was described in a contemporary account as \\"though not a splendid fabric ... well adapted to its enclosed situation.\\" The foundations proved inadequate, and by 1814 cracks had developed in the building. He was also surveyor to the theatres royal in London and the Phoenix Fire Insurance Company, London, for which he built offices in Lombard Street in about 1787 and a fire engine house at Charing Cross, both later demolished. He took over as architect at the Department of Land Revenue after the retirement of John Marquand. In this capacity he, along with his pupil, Thomas Chawner, submitted a plan for the improvement of the crown property of Marylebone Park Farm (now Regent's Park) in July 1811, although John Nash's plans were preferred.ref typ Stephen Geary, founder and architect of Highgate Cemetery, was Leverton's pupil between 1811 and 1818. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1777 until 1803.Graves 1905 He was a Justice of the Peace (JP) for Westminster, Middlesex, Surrey and Kent. Family He was married twice, firstly in 1766 and then, in 1803, to Rebecca Craven of Blackheath, but his only son predeceased him. His niece married a pupil, James Donaldson, and was the mother of Thomas Leverton Donaldson, who became Professor of Architecture at London University. Death and legacy Leverton died at 13 Bedford Square, London, on 23 September 1824. He was buried at Waltham Abbey. The Thomas Leverton Charity, founded by money left in Leverton's will, is intended to aid deserving women in distress, preferably widows resident in the united parishes of St Giles and St George. It has since been amalgamated into the St Giles-in-the-Fields and Bloomsbury United Charity.

Life Beale was the only son of Frederick Beale (d. 1863), of the music publishing firm of Cramer, Beale, & Addison of Regent Street. He was admitted student of Lincoln's Inn on 18 April 1860, and was called to the bar in 1863; but music claimed his interests, and, having received lessons from Edward Roeckel and others, he managed operas in London and the provinces, and toured with some of the most notable musicians of his time. As 'Walter Maynard,' he wrote an account of one of these tours, with reminiscences of Mario, Grisi, Guiglini, Lablache, and others, entitled 'The Enterprising Impresario' (London, 1867). Beale originated the national music meetings at the Crystal Palace with the object of bringing meritorious young musicians to the front, and took a leading part in the institution of the New Philharmonic Society, at which Berlioz conducted some of his compositions by Beale's invitation. It was under his management that Thackeray came out as a lecturer. He wrote a large number of songs and pianoforte pieces, besides Instructions in the Art of Singing (London, 1853), and a series of Music Copy Books (London, 1871). In February 1877 he produced at the Crystal Palace a farce called The Three Years' System, and a three-act drama, A Shadow on the Hearth; an operetta, An Easter Egg, was produced at Terry's Theatre in December 1893. His autobiography, The Light of other Days as seen through the wrong end of an Opera Glass, was published in 2 vols., London, 1890. He died at Gipsy Hill on 3 Oct. 1894, and was buried at Norwood Cemetery. Late in life he married the widow of John Robinson of Hong Kong ; she was a good singer and musician.

Jawi temple (, original name: Jajawa) is a syncretic Hindu-Buddhist candi (temple) dated from late 13th century Singhasari kingdom. The temple is located on the eastern slope of Mount Welirang, Candi Wates village, Kecamatan Prigen, Pasuruan, East Java, Indonesia, approximately 31 kilometers west of Pasuruan city or 41 kilometers south of Surabaya. The temple located on the main road between Kecamatan Pandaan ‚Äì Kecamatan Prigen and Pringebukan. The temple was thought to be a Hindu-Buddhist place of worship, however the temple actually was dedicated as mortuary temple to honor King Kertanegara, the last king of Singhasari. It is believed that the ashes of the late king were also placed in two more temples, the Singhasari and Jago temple. The Nagarakretagama canto 56 mentioned this temple as Jajawa. King Kertanegara of Singhasari ordered the construction of this temple to provide a place of worship for the adherents of Shiva-Buddha sect, a syncretic religion patronage by the king.  Architecture  The temple compound measured 40 x 60 square meters, enclosed within 2 meters high red brick wall. The temple is surrounded by a moat filled with flowering lotus plants. The temple measures 24.5 meters high with the base of the structure measured 14.2 x 9.5 meters. The temple structure is tall and slender with the tall receding towering roof crowned with the combination pinnacle of cube and stupa. The door of the main cella and the main stairs faces east.  Nagarakretagama descriptions  A maquette of Jawi temple in Trowulan Museum. According to Nagarakretagama, in the year 1359 CE, on his return from an extended tour of the eastern provinces, King Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit stopped off at the temple of Jajawa (Jawi) at Pandaan, in the foothills of Mount Welirang. His purpose was to place offerings at the shrine of his great- grandfather Kertanagara, last king of Singhasari, in whose memory the temple had been built. The Nagarakretagama describes in great detail the magnificence of the sacred compound. The principal monument, in particular, was unique in that it was a Shivaite sanctuary crowned with a Buddhist ornament. It thus reflected clearly the advanced religious philosophy expounded by Kertanagara, who is said on his death, have returned to the realm of 'ShivaBuddha'. The shrine further contained two mortuary statues of the king, representing the essence of both religions. Yet, as Prapanca explains in his poem, the image of the Buddha Akshobya had mysteriously disappeared at a time when the monument had been struck by lightning in 1331. While regretting that the statue had vanished, it was accepted as a sign of the Buddha's supreme manifestation, ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ that of non-being or nothingness. There were also other Shivaite statues discovered in temple's niches, such as the image of Nandisvara, Durga, Ganesha, Nandi and Brahma, however these statues has been removed and stored in the museums. The statue of Durga is stored in Mpu Tantular Museum, Surabaya, while the rest are stored in Trowulan Museum. The Brahma statue however is missing, probably broken to pieces since fragments of the statue can be found in temple's store room. The temple had undergone restoration projects twice, the first was conducted between 1938‚Äì1941 and the second was in 1975‚Äì1980. The temple reconstruction project completed in 1982.

Life Bedford was born at Paddington, London, on 18 June 1799; his father is believed to have been a courier attached to the establishment of George III. At an early age he was sent to school in Yorkshire, and on his return to London his guardian, Henry Bower of 38 Great Marlborough Street, apprenticed him in 1817 to a bookbinder named Haigh, in Poland Street, Oxford Street. Only a part of his time was served with Haigh, and in 1822 he was transferred to a binder named Finlay, also of Poland Street, with whom his indentures were completed. At the end of his apprenticeship Bedford entered the workshop of one of the leading bookbinders of the day, Charles Lewis, of 35 Duke Street, St. James's, with whom he worked until the death of his employer, and subsequently managed the business for Lewis's widow. Bedford attracted the notice of William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland, who became a patron and friend. In 1841 Bedford, who had by then left Mrs. Lewis's establishment, entered into partnership with John Clarke of 61 Frith Street, Soho, who had a reputation for binding books in tree-marbled calf. Clarke and Bedford carried on their business in Frith Street until 1850, when the partnership was dissolved. In 1851 Bedford went to the Cape of Good Hope for the benefit of his health, where he remained for a time, the expenses of his journey being defrayed by the Duke of Portland, and on his return to England he established himself in Blue Anchor Yard, York Street, Westminster. He later added 91 York Street to his premises, and remained there until his death, which took place at his residence at Shepherd's Bush, Hammersmith, on 8 June 1883. Bedford was twice married, but had no children by either of his wives. Works Bedford respected margins, and was a skilful mender of damaged leaves. Many of his productions were imitations of the major French bookbinders of past centuries, for example the bindings of Samuel Rogers's Poems and Italy, of which he bound several copies in Morocco inlaid with coloured leathers and covered with gold tooling in the style of Antoine Michel Padeloup. Bedford himself considered that an edition of Dante, which he bound in brown Morocco and tooled with a Grolier pattern, was his chef d'oeuvre, and wished it placed in his coffin; but his request was not complied with, and it was sold. He obtained prize medals at several English and French exhibitions. His books were disposed of by Sotheby, Wilkinson, & Hodge, in March 1884.

Music videos The original video for A Jagged Gorgeous Winter was shot and edited within 24 hours by John Drake, the band's drummer. It was released in January 2007, and filmed in the same place the song was originally recorded - exactly one year later. In summer 2009, a music video was made for A Jagged Gorgeous Winter (\\"Rock Band 2\\" Remix) which was directed by Isaac Ravishankara. The video featured a prominent homage to the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, with Arrigo dressed as Calvin and Boch as Hobbes.JBTV interview about the Hobbes costume The band has said that there are plans for music videos for the tracks Love During Wartime and Talk Them Down. The Main Drag worked with French-Swiss directors Ben & Julia to create a surreal and psychedelic music video for the song Dove Nets (from Yours As Fast As Mine) which was released in November 2009. The music video was accompanied by a website, Dove Lovers, which featured behind-the- scenes information and other bonus features.Dove Lovers website about the Dove Nets music video Track listing #\\"How We'd Look on Paper\\" ‚Äì 4:31 #\\"Swine Houses\\" ‚Äì 4:12 #\\"A Jagged Gorgeous Winter\\" ‚Äì 3:51 #\\"Love During Wartime\\" ‚Äì 4:07 #\\"Car Windows\\" ‚Äì 3:27 #\\"Montana\\" ‚Äì 3:25 #\\"What's Your Favorite Dinosaur?\\" ‚Äì 3:26 #\\"Dove Nets\\" ‚Äì 2:53 #\\"Taking Apart a Gigantic Machine\\" ‚Äì 4:54 #\\"Even Seconds\\" ‚Äì 4:51 #\\"Goodnight Technologist\\" ‚Äì 5:25 Personnel *Adam Arrigo: vocals, production/programming, guitar, keyboard, glockenspiel *Matt Boch: vocals, guitar, bass, keyboard, trumpet *Jon Carter: guitar, bass, keyboard *John Drake: drums *Matt Levitt: violin/string arrangements *Dan Cardinal: bass, engineering *Tom Keidel: trumpet (track 1), guitar (track 2) *Molly Lorenzo: marimba (track 1), additional songwriting (track 4), backing vocals (track 8), wine glasses (track 10) *Rich Wilner: drums (track 2) *Sweatpants and Zach Robbins: backing vocals (track 2) *Debbie Neigher: backing vocals (track 3, 7) *Max Lewis: programming (track 4), shaker (track 6), additional programming (track 6) *Cory Levitt: bass (track 5) *Sarah Arrigo: backing vocals (track 9) *Erina Suto: cello (track 9) *Omar Tuffaha: double bass (track 9) *Nate Raticker-Flynn: drums (track 9) *Andy Zimmerman: cello (track 10) *Jim Devane: additional sound manipulation (track 11) *All tracks recorded, produced, and mixed by The Main Drag *Mastered by Jeff Lipton at Peerless Mastering *Artwork by Hayes Roberts, CD artwork by Molly Lorenzo External links *The Main Drag's official website *The Main Drag's MySpace References 2007 albums ","title":"Yours as Fast as Mine"},{"id":"38597198","text":"The Polish 1st Heavy Artillery Regiment (1 Pu≈Çk Artylerii Najciƒô≈ºszej) was formed in mid-1920 and saw limited combat at the end of the Polish-Soviet War in 1920.

Members of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (PC) as well as the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) also voted to cancel the power plant. The Mississauga cancellation was made as a late campaign promise in the 2011 general election. From immediately following the election until March 18, 2013, the Liberal government stated that the cost of the cancellations was $230 million -- $190 million for the Mississauga plant and $40 million for the Oakville plant. A final report by the Auditor General of Ontario that was released on October 8, 2013 found the total cost of the cancellations was $950 Million ($275 Million for the Mississauga plant and $675 Million for the Oakville plant). This cost included estimates of future costs to the rate payers. The scandal contributed to the resignation of Premier Dalton McGuinty and Energy Minister Chris Bentley. Tendering and bidders In April 2005, the McGuinty Government closed the coal-fired Lakeview Generating Station in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). This closure created a need to establish new power plants to support the electricity needs of the GTA. In 2007, the Ontario Power Authority's (OPA) Integrated Power System Plan report recommended new natural gas-fired electric power generation plants (gas plants) be constructed. In August 2008, the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure directed the OPA to competitively procure a combined-cycle gas generation facility in the southwest Greater Toronto Areas with a capacity of up to 850 megawatts (MWs). These plants were to be in operation no later than December 31, 2013. Under this procurement the contractors would continue to own and operate the asset, not just build it as had been typical in the past. In the May 2009 information to bidders, the OPA stated that the constructors' proposals would need to consider municipal requirements for their proposed sites that were in effect on January 16, 2009. The constructors were responsible for obtaining local permits, not the government. In September 2009, the OPA announced it had accepted a bid by TransCanada Energy (TCE) to build a 900-megawatt natural gas-fired power generation facility in southeast Oakville. Local opposition In December 11, 2009, the fast-growing Citizens for Clean Air coalition in Oakville stepped up opposition to the project with campaign slogan: 'It just doesn't make sense.' By June 2010, TCE had missed the contract's milestone dates for obtaining pre-construction approvals and permits from the Town of Oakville. On October 1, 2010, local opponents rallied at the Ontario legislature and brought in American environmentalist Erin Brockovich to help generate publicity for their fight with the government. Liberal MPP for Oakville Kevin Flynn battled his own government's plan for the gas plant. On October 7, 2010, Liberal energy minister Brad Duguid announced the cancellation of the Oakville gas plant. Ceding to increasing opposition, Duguid proposed to feed the GTA's power demand by improving transmission lines. In the 2011 Provincial election, the Mississauga candidates of all three parties openly expressed opposition to the Mississauga power plant in pre-election debates. NDP candidate Anju Sikka wrote in an open letter to Dalton McGuinty \\"An NDP government would never allow construction to begin before a thorough and independent Environmental Assessment has been completed\\", and PC candidate Geoff Janoscik stated in a press release \\"A Tim Hudak Government will cancel this plant\\". Oakville cancellation On October 9, 2009 the OPA and TCE signed a contract for the Oakville plant. Amid local protest and opposition from the Town of Oakville, in June 2010 TCE missed the milestone date under the contract for obtaining all pre-construction approvals and permits for the Oakville plant from the Town of Oakville. On October 7, 2010 the Government announced the cancellation of the Oakville plant. The Ministry communique stated that TCE was entitled to reasonable damages and the anticipated financial value of the original contract. On the same day the Minister sent a letter to the OPA advising them of his directive. This commitment to make TCE \\"whole\\" became central to the massive cost escalation of the project. Minister Kathleen Wynne, later Premier, signed the Cabinet directive. Mississauga cancellation On September 28, 2011, a week prior to a general election, the Ontario Liberal Party's campaign announced that if elected, the government would cancel the Mississauga gas plant. Former Premier Kathleen Wynne was co-chair of the Liberal campaign. Editorials questioned the role politics should play in controlling electricity policy. The election On October 6, 2011 the Liberals won the most seats in the new legislature but not a majority. The lack of a majority would allow opposition parties to use legislative committees to probe the gas plants scandal. On October 7, 2011 the Minister of Energy announced the Mississauga project had been cancelled by the Cabinet. Oakville negotiation The OPA directed to negotiate a settlement with TCE. However, the Premier's direction to guarantee the full financial value of the contract would greatly increase the cost of cancellation. The contract's force majeure clause allowed for cancellation of the contract without costs if the project lagged by more than 24 months due to a failure to obtain municipal permits. TCE had already missed key dates and the Town of Oakville was threatening to fight the project to the Supreme Court of Canada if necessary. These delays might have allowed the government to exit the contract without penalty. Alternatively, another contract clause limited the government's liability to costs paid in the event that the government unilaterally terminated the contract. However, enforcement of the contract was not pursued. Negotiations took place on the Premier's Office's terms‚Äîa commitment to make TCE \\"whole.\\" An initial proposal was developed by TCE to build a replacement power plant in the Kitchener-Waterloo or Cambridge area. A memorandum of understanding on the project was signed. However the MOU expired in June 2011 with no plan adopted. On August 5, 2011 TCE and the government met to arbitrate the settlement. According to the Auditor-General's report \\"as with the Premier‚Äôs Office‚Äôs commitment to TCE the year before, the [arbitration] framework waived the clause in the Oakville plant contract that gave the OPA a defensible claim of not owing TCE lost profits (that is, the clause stating that only if the Government took discriminatory action through legislation or similar means would the OPA be liable for damages such as loss of profits, with the OPA‚Äôs cancellation of the plant not meeting the definition of discriminatory). In March 2012 OPA offered a $462 million settlement to TCE, which was rejected. In April 2012, under Cabinet direction, the OPA offered a settlement of $712 million, which was also rejected. Energy Minister Chris Bentley announced an agreement was reached on August 24, 2012 but still maintained the cost of the cancellation would be $40 million. On Oct 15, 2012, Premier Dalton McGuinty announced he would resign after the selection of a new leader by the Liberal Party. On the same day he prorogued the legislature, shutting down the investigative committees. Later in October 2012, Premier McGuinty rejected a media report citing research by energy consultant Tom Adams estimating the cancellation costs of the Mississauga and Oakville plants at $1.3 billion. Premier McGuinty continued to claim the cost of cancelling the Oakville plant would be $40 million and Mississauga plant cancellation would cost $190 million -- for a total of $230 million. The Ontario Liberal party elected MPP Kathleen Wynne as its leader on January 26, 2013. On February 7, 2013, Premier McGuinty requested the Auditor-General review of the costs associated with the cancellation of the Oakville gas plant. Wynne became Premier on Feb 11, 2013. On March 18, 2013 the Minister of Energy for the first time stated that the $40 million estimate of the cost for cancelling the Oakville plant \\"could be wrong.\\" Final accounting of costs On Oct 8, 2013 the Auditor-General reported the cost to cancel the Oakville plant at $675 million. The Auditor-General noted that had the premier's office not become involved, the OPA may have been in a position to simply wait and then exercise an option to break the contract without penalty: \\"We believe that the settlement with TCE will not only keep TCE whole, but may make it better than whole,\\" Lysyk said. The report estimated the Premier's Office directive to make TCE \\"whole\\" increased the payout to TCE by $225 million over what was due under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of the net $675 million cost of cancelling the Oakville plant and replacing it with the Napanee plant relates to the decision to locate the replacement plant farther from the location of power consumption in the GTA and farther from natural gas supplies. The Auditor General calculated increased gas supply costs and additional line transmission losses totaling of $609 million (included in the $675 million total), which are wholly or partially off-set by a savings of $275 million through a lower negotiated price for the Napanee plant. Opposition contempt charge As the questions arose concerning the accuracy of the Liberals' claim that the two gas plant cancellations only cost $230 million, opposition members of the Legislative committee asked new Energy minister Chris Bentley to hand over all documents related to the gas plant cancellations. On May 16, 2012, the Estimates Committee of the Ontario Legislature adopted a motion directing the former Minister of Energy, the Ministry of Energy and the OPA to produce \\"all correspondence, in any form, electronic or otherwise, that occurred between September 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011 related to the cancellation of the Oakville power plant as well all correspondence, in any form, electronic or otherwise, that occurred between August 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011 related to the cancellation of the Mississauga power plant.\\" On May 30, 2012, the former Minister of Energy declined to disclose the records requested by the Estimates Committee, citing ‚Äúthe confidential, privileged and highly commercially sensitive nature of the issues.‚Äù On July 13, 2012, 500 pages of emails, letters and PowerPoint presentations were released to the Estimates Committee. Members of the opposition were not satisfied with the 500 pages of documents that were produced On August 27, 2012, a member of the Estimates Committee sought a ruling from the Speaker on whether privilege had been breached by the failure of the former Minister to provide the documents ordered. On September 12, 2012, Energy Minister Chris Bentley stated he would comply with the Speaker's order to provide gas plants documents but asked for six weeks more time so as to not jeopardize negotiations with TCE. However, an agreement had been made with TCE on August 24, 2012. On September 13, 2012, the Speaker found in favour of members of the opposition that there was a prima facie case for contempt by the former Minister and, through the issuance of a Speaker's ruling, ordered the former Minister to comply with the Estimates Committee motion. On September 21, 2012, Don Guy, the Manager of the Liberals' 2011 campaign, emailed Premier's Office staffer Laura Miller and the brother of the Premier saying the Speaker needs to \\"change his mind\\" on his ruling. Miller emailed back to Guy stating Premier's Office staffer Dave Gene \\"is putting the member from Brant [ie: Levac] on notice we need better here.\\" On September 24, 2012, the Liberals release 36,000 documents. On September 25, 2012, the Progressive Conservatives introduce a motion of contempt to the legislature. On October 12, 2012, an additional 20,000 previously undisclosed documents were released by the Liberals. However, not a single document originated from any of the political staff in the office of the Minister of Energy. Prorogation and Premier McGuinty's resignation On October 1, 2012, Government House Leader Office (GHLO) staffer David Phillips emailed the Premier's Chief of Staff (Livingston) and Deputy Chief of Staff (Miller) with his \\"very rough views/pitch on prorogation.\\" The email noted the various scandals enveloping the Liberals and being pursued by various legislative committee meetings. \\"If we prorogue... these will not take place for the next five months.\\" On October 15, 2012, Dalton McGuinty prorogued the legislature and announced his resignation pending a leadership convention. On October 20, 2012, Liberal government staffers used a media source to present the false- flag story that McGuinty may be quitting to pursue the leadership of the federal Liberal party. Don Guy added that a polling firm included the false McGuinty federal candidacy in a poll to be reported in the media. New contempt charges On Thursday, March 7, 2013, the Standing Committee on Justice Policy began their review of the contempt charge against Chris Bentley as well as \\"observations and recommendations concerning the tendering, planning, commissioning, cancellation, and relocation of the Mississauga and Oakville gas plants\\". Conservative committee members called the Honourable Peter Milliken PC, former federal Speaker of the House of Commons, as a witness. Milliken stated \\"This [contempt charge] didn't meet the standards for a contempt motion. I found the (Tories') request at the time reckless,\\". Cover-up discovered Although 56,500 documents had been tabled from the Ministry of Energy and the OPA to comply with the May 16, 2012 motion of the Estimates Committee of the Legislature, none of the documents came from the political staff in the Minister's Office. The Justice Committee asked the former Chief of Staff Craig MacLennan to give testimony. At a meeting of Justice Policy Committee of the Legislature on April 9, 2013 NDP MPP Peter Tabuns asked the former Chief of Staff to the Minister of Energy why the political staffer had provided no documents. MacLennan replied: \\"I didn‚Äôt have any responsive documents. I regret that I didn‚Äôt have any responsive documents. My colleague coordinated the search in the office. All I can speak to is what my work habit is, which is to keep a clean inbox. I always have worked that way.\\" On April 12, 2013 NDP MPP Peter Tabuns lodged a complaint with the Ontario Privacy Commissioner asking her to investigate \\"what appears to be a breach of protocol and a violation of the Archives and Recordkeeping Act and the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.\\" The Privacy Commissioner's report was tabled June 5, 2013. In the report, the Commissioner stated \\"While I cannot state with certainty that emails had been deleted improperly by the former Premier‚Äôs staff during the transition to the new Premier in an effort to avoid transparency and accountability, it strains credulity that no one knew that the practice of deleting all emails was not in compliance with applicable records management and retention policies.\\".Deleting Accountability: Record Management Practices of Political Staff - A Special Investigation Report The report found \\"the practice of indiscriminate deletion of all emails sent and received by the former Chief of Staff was in violation of the Archives and Recordkeeping Act, 2006 (ARA) and the records retention schedule developed by Archives of Ontario for ministers‚Äô offices. In my view, this practice also undermined the purposes of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act F(FIPPA), and the transparency and accountability principles that form the foundation of both Acts. It truly strains credulity to think that absolutely no records responsive to the Estimates Committee motion and the Speaker's ruling were retained.\\" The Privacy Commission met with information technology staff at the Ministry of Government Services (MGS) to inquire about the possibility of retrieving the deleted emails from MGS's central server. According to Cavourkian's report \\"MGS IT staff described the difficulty and complexity of reconstructing data from a search in the email RAID server into a useable file. Specifically, MGS IT staff stated that while searching for a deleted email from yesterday would require a great deal of effort, searching for data from two or three months ago would be ‚Äúfruitless, as the data no longer exists.‚Äù MGS IT staff further stated that reconstructing the data from a search in the RAID server into a usable file would be ‚Äútantamount to reconstructing a single shredded document from a bin of shredded documents.‚Äù The Commission also found there was \\"a culture of avoiding the creation of written documentation on the gas plants issue.\\" While probing the appropriateness of the staff of the Minister of Energy, the Commissioner was told Premier McGuinty's Chief of Staff, David Livingston, had asked the Cabinet Secretary about ways to permanently delete emails from computers in the Premier's Office. This fact was included in her June 5, 2013 report and led to the launch of an OPP investigation into the Livingston and the Premier's Office two days later. On Aug. 20, 2013 Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian said the Wynne government had provided \\"inaccurate and incomplete information in my initial investigation\\" about the ability to retrieve deleted emails. \\"As a direct consequence of the incomplete response, the public has been misled‚Ä¶about the ability of staff to retrieve potentially relevant information.‚Äù On March 27, 2014 a court document became public in which the OPP stated they had probable cause to lay criminal charges against David Livingston, McGuinty's last chief of staff. The document alleged Livingston hired an IT contractor to the Liberal Party, Peter Faist (who was also the common-law partner of the Premier's Office staffer Laura Miller), to wipe clean the hard drives of computers in the Premier's Office that contained information about the gas plant scandal. Police say the hard drives will ‚Äúafford evidence‚Äù of breach of trust. Mr. Faist and Ms. Miller had since moved to British Columbia where Ms. Miller became the Executive Director of the BC Liberal Party. They were scheduled to give evidence to the Justice Policy Committee of the Legislature when an election was called, suspending the activity of the committee. Criminal trial and conviction On December 17, 2015 the Ontario Provincial Police announced three criminal charges each against David Livingston and Laura Miller: breach of trust, mischief in relation to data, and misuse of a computer system to commit mischief. Both entered pleas of not guilty as to all counts. The trial was heard by the Ontario Court of Justice at Old City Hall in Toronto, and commenced in September 2017. At the close of its prosecution on November 3, 2017, the Crown advised that it would not pursue convictions on the breach of trust charges, seeing no reasonable prospect of conviction. The defence subsequently advised that it would not call any witnesses, and applied for a directed verdict of acquittal as to the remaining counts. Justice Timothy R. Lipson ruled against acquittal as to misuse of a computer system to commit mischief, but downgraded the other counts to attempt to commit mischief to data, ruling that: \\"...it would be speculative to conclude that data relevant to the prosecution case was destroyed. To draw an inference that the deleted files did, in fact, contain business or work-related material would, at best, amount to an educated guess and that is impermissible.\\" Following closing arguments, the Court handed down verdicts on January 19, 2018. David Livingston was found guilty of the remaining counts, mischief in relation to data, and attempted misuse of a computer system to commit mischief. The ruling stated that \\"Mr. Livingston's plan to eliminate sensitive and confidential work-related data, in my view, amounted to a 'scorched earth' strategy, where information that could be potentially useful to adversaries, both within and outside of the Liberal Party, would be destroyed.\\" Laura Miller was found not guilty on both counts. The Court found that there was evidence suggesting that Ms. Miller was a party to the offences, having been deeply involved in the government's communication strategy with respect to the power plant controversy, and having assisted David Livingston in selecting hard drives to be wiped. However, the Court held that there was reasonable doubt as to her guilt. The Canadian Press reported that Miller's acquittal \\"drew an audible gasp\\" in the packed courtroom. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for February 26, 2018. In response to the verdicts, Premier Wynne's office issued a statement: \\"We've been clear from the start that this is not how anyone in government should operate, and it is not how a premier's office should operate... Upon coming into office, we introduced a number of significant measures to strengthen the document retention protocol and ensure that all staff are aware of their responsibilities.\\" The (then) Opposition leader MPP Patrick Brown stated that \\"[t]he guilty verdict is an indictment of the 15 years of Liberal political corruption that has long been rooted in the premier's office.\\" David Livingston was sentenced on April 11, 2018 to four months in jail, one year of probation and 100 hours of community service. During sentencing, Justice Timothy Lipson stated that Livingston ‚Äúabused his position of power to promote the interests of the governing party at the expense of the democratic process.‚Äù References Ontario political scandals Ontario electricity policy Corruption in Ontario Political scandals Trials of political people ","title":"Ontario power plant scandal"},{"id":"38597239","text":"Rev Alexander Beith's grave, Valley Cemetery, Stirling Very Rev Dr Alexander Beith DD (1799-1891) was a Scottish divine and author who served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland 1858/59. Life He was born at Campbeltown, Argyllshire, on 13 January 1799. His parents were Gilbert Beith and Helen Elder. Beith's father was a land agent and farmer in the Kintyre district of Argyleshire, and was a man of wide reading, especially in theology and church history. After the usual course of education at Campbeltown young Beith entered the Glasgow University with a view to the ministry of the church of Scotland. He was licensed by the presbytery of Kintyre on 7 Feb. 1821. Called to the chapel-of-ease at Oban in June following, he laboured there until November 1824, when he was transferred to Hope Street church, Glasgow. There for two years he ministered to a large congregation. In 1826 he removed to the parish of Kilbrandon, Argyllshire, and in 1830 to the parish of Glenelg, Invernessshire. In 1839 he was called to the first charge of Stirling. When the agitation on the subject of spiritual independence was reaching a crisis in the church of Scotland, Beith was one of the seven ministers appointed in 1842 to preach at Strathbogie in spite of the prohibition of the civil courts. Beith was one of the 474 ministers who in 1843 left the established church and formed the Free Church of Scotland. He and his congregation removed to a handsome place of worship which was subsequently erected in Stirling and named the Free North Church. In 1847 Beith gave evidence on the question of sites before a committee of the House of Commons, some landowners having refused sites for the erection of buildings in connection with the free church. He took a prominent part in educational and other matters affecting the new religious denomination. The honorary degree of D.D. was conferred upon him in 1850 by Princeton University, U.S.A. In 1858 he was elected moderator of the general assembly of the free church, in succession to Very Rev James Julius Wood. This Assembly was the first to deal with the famous Cardross case. Beith retired from the active service of the church in Stirling in 1876, but continued to take part in the general work of the denomination. He was a fluent speaker and able preacher; his theological position was broad and liberal. When the deposition of William Robertson Smith was first moved in the assembly, Beith proposed and carried a motion that the charges be withdrawn and the professor be restored to his chair at Aberdeen University. 'He held that critical study of the scriptures was not inconsistent with reverence for them and belief in their inspiration. He died at Edinburgh on 11 May 1891 in his ninety-third year. He is buried in Valley Cemetery attaching the Church of the Holy Rude in Stirling near the southern roundel. By his wife Julia Robson (d. 25 Sept. 1866) he had fourteen children : six sons and eight daughters. His eldest son, Gilbert, was member of parliament for Glasgow Central, 1885, and for Inverness Burghs, 1892-5. Another son, John Alexander, was a justice of the peace and closely connected for many years with philanthropic and educational work in Manchester ; he died in October 1896. Both brothers were partners in the well-known firm of Beith, Stevenson, & Co., East India merchants, Glasgow and Manchester.

It is sold as Anadin Extra in the UK.  Adverse effects  The recommended dosing has a low risk profile when taken occasionally in a well hydrated state. As with all medications containing paracetamol (acetaminophen), concomitant use with alcohol carries a significant risk of hepatotoxicity. The combination of paracetamol with aspirin also creates the risk of renal papillary necrosis if large doses are taken chronically. This is because paracetamol yields a toxic metabolite that can accumulate in the kidney while aspirin works to deplete the glutathione stores necessary to oxidize it. Additionally, chronic aspirin usage is associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Chemical detection The combination of these three compounds can be detected in pharmaceutical formulations, urine and blood serum in trace quantities using electrochemical methods. Other trade names The combination was introduced in 1964 under the trade name Vanquish by Sterling Drug, which after a series of mergers and acquisitions became a unit of Bayer AG.

The first story of the home is built of native limestone, from a quarry owned by William and Edward Ulrich. Wharton moved to Manhattan from Pennsylvania in 1880; his wife was a native of Manhattan. He opened the New Dry Goods Store on April 1, 1887 and operated the business until he sold it in 1909. Wharton was also active in local politics. He was elected one of three trustees of Manhattan Institute on January 15, 1903 and was elected March 26, 1903 to represent Ward IV on the Manhattan City Council. E. A. Wharton died in 1939 and Ura died in 1941. The house was willed to Ura's sister, Lillian M. Greene with the stipulation that it was to be given to the Christian Scientist Church of Manhattan upon Lillian's death. Lillian died in 1955 and the house was used by the Christian Scientist congregation until their own building was completed in 1956. The house was then purchased by Helen and Alex McManis in Autumn 1956; Helen McManis was listed as the owner when the NRHP request was filed in April 1995. It has been speculated that J. D. Walters, professor of architecture at Kansas State Agricultural College was the architect, but no evidence exists to prove this speculation. His involvement with the construction of the Wharton House is inferred in a 1902 article from The Industrialist (the KSAC student newspaper), wherein he has taken his students in his class to view the \\"model residence of Mrs. Wharton's. The students were delighted with the perfect arrangement of modern conveniences of the beautiful home, and voted it the best arranged home they had ever seen.\\" See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Riley County, Kansas * National Register of Historic Places listings in Kansas References Houses in Riley County, Kansas Houses completed in 1897 Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Kansas National Register of Historic Places in Riley County, Kansas Manhattan, Kansas ","title":"E.

As to its behaviour, like other scorpions the female will carry its offspring on its back ‚Äì up to 24 at one time. It is related to other creatures in the same genus and/or family such as the Vaejovis janssi, Hoffmannius spinigerus and H. coahuilae.

The site lies some in straight-line distance northeast of Quito in Pedro Moncayo Canton in Pichincha Province at above sea level.Google Earth The archaeological park of Cochasqui covers and consists of 15 truncated pyramids and 21 burial mounds, locally called tolas. The site also has several small museums: an archaeological museum, two ethnographic museums, a botanical garden, and a museum with musical instruments and other items. The Mojanda volcano with a maximum elevation of looms over the site. The ruins at Cochasqui and the expansive views from the site attract both Ecuadorian and foreign tourists. Description The pyramids and other features of Cochasqui were constructed between 950 CE and the Spanish conquest in the 1530s. Their construction is attributed by archaeologists to the Quitu- Cara culture of the Cara people and/or the Caranqui people. The Cara and the Caranqui may have been the same people. Prior to the Inca conquest in the late 15th century, the Andes area of northern Ecuador seems to have been divided into many chiefdoms or statelets made up of people with similar languages and cultures. The Cayambe chiefdom may have controlled the Cochasqui area when the Incas arrived.\\"Cochasqui guarda evidencias de la civilizaci√≥n preinca,\\", El Telegrafo, http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/regional-norte/1/cochasqui- guarda-evidencias-de-la-civilizacion-preinca, accessed 23 May 2017 The 15 pyramids at Cochasqui include nine with ramps and six without ramps. The largest pyramid is number nine which is north to south and east to west. It is high. The ramp leading to the pyramid is long.Benavides, p. 4 The primary construction material used in the pyramids is a soft volcanic stone called cangahua. Vulnerable to weathering and erosion the pyramids have survived because they were overgrown with grass.Skurdenis, Julie (1987), \\"Ecuador's Precolumbian Heritage\\", Archaeology, vol, 40, No. 4, p. 65 Archaeologists have theorized that Cochasqui was a ceremonial and astronomical center, used for meteorological purposes to calculate solstices and aid in determining when crops should be planted. Leaders and the elite may have lived on the flat- topped pyramids and the site may have had military and political importance. The tolas were used as burial mounds as many skeletons have been discovered there.Skurdenis, pp. 65-72 Archaeologists estimate that the pre-Columbian community of Cochasqui, including the intensely-cultivated farmland surrounding the pyramids and tolas, supported a population of 3,000 people.Newson, Linda A. (1995), Life and Death in Early Colonial Ecuador, Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, p. 38 Importance The Inca assault on Cochasqui probably began at the same time of just after the Inca victory, after a long struggle, at the Pambamarca Fortress Complex, to the southeast. In the opinion of one scholar, Pambamarca fell to the Incas about 1505. Cochasqui has acquired a symbolic importance in the history of Ecuador. A legend describes the Inca conquest of Cochasqui, including the union of Quilago (born c. 1485), the Queen of Cochasqui and the Inca Emperor, Huayna Capac. For a two-year period, the Incas were unable to defeat the armies of Quilago. Finally overcome, Quilago was taken captive and forced to marry Huayna Capac. In some accounts, the offspring of this union was the future emperor Atahualpa. Quilago prepared a trap to murder Huayna Capac in her bedchamber, but was betrayed by her servants and executed. The defeat of Quilago enabled the Inca to extend their conquests to northernmost Ecuador, defeating the Caranqui in the battle of Yawarkucha.Benavides, pp 70-71; http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/regional-norte/1/cochasqui-guarda- evidencias-de-la-civilizacion-preinca This legend has deep roots in Ecuador. A Spanish chronicler described a performance in Quito in 1613 portraying the struggle between the Inca invader and Cochasqui and the relationship between the Inca Emperor and the warrior queen. The legend explains the national origin of Ecuador as a union between the conquering Incas and the Ecuadorian Indians who struggled against foreign domination and repression, first against the Incas and later against the Spanish. Cochasqui is an important place for ceremonies, traditional dances, shamanistic rituals, and marriages with the emphasis on getting in touch with the ancestry of the modern-day country of Ecuador.Benavides, pp. 72-79 References Buildings and structures in Pichincha Province Archaeological sites in Ecuador Museums in Ecuador Tourist attractions in Pichincha Province Archaeological museums in Ecuador Inca Empire ","title":"Cochasqu√≠"},{"id":"38597456","text":"thumb Eliezer Igra (born 1954/5714) is a rabbi, dayan of the Upper Beit Din of Israel, the Av Beit Din of the Beersheba Beit Din, and the Moshav Rabbi of Kfar Maimon.

King Ferdinand II of Aragon left C√≥rdoba with an army of 20,000 horsemen, 50,000 laborers, and 8,000 support troops. This contingent joined the artillery commanded by Francisco Ram√≠rez de Madrid that left √âcija. The army decided to first attack V√©lez-M√°laga, and then continue west to Malaga. Nasrid spies gave word of the movements of the Christians, and the inhabitants of V√©lez fled to the mountains and the Bentomiz castle. The Spanish reached V√©lez-M√°laga on 17 April 1487 after a slow advance through difficult country. A few days later the lighter siege engines arrived. It had proved impossible to move the heavier ones along the poor roads. Muhammad XIII of Granada (El Zagal) made an attempt to relieve V√©lez, but was forced to retreat to Granada by the superior forces of the marquis of Cadiz. On his arrival there he found that he had been overthrown in favor of his nephew Abdallah Muhammad XII. Seeing no hope of relief, V√©lez capitulated on 27 April 1487 on condition that the lives of the people would be spared, and they would keep their property and religion. Smaller places also surrendered along the road to M√°laga, the next objective.  City of MƒÅlaqa  The Moorish city of MƒÅlaqa was the second city in the emirate after Granada itself, a major trading port on the Mediterranean. The city was prosperous, with elegant architecture, gardens, and fountains. The city was surrounded by fortifications, which were in good condition. Above it was the citadel, the Alcazaba of M√°laga, connected via a covered way with the impregnable fortress of Gibralfaro. A land-side suburb was also ringed by a strong wall. Towards the sea were orchards of olives, oranges, and pomegranates, and vineyards from whose grapes the sweet fortified Malaga wine, an important export, was made. The city was well-supplied with artillery and ammunition. In addition to the normal garrison it contained volunteers from other towns in the regions and a corps of Gomeres, experienced and disciplined African mercenaries. Hamet el Zegr√≠, the former defender of Ronda, was in command of the defense.  Siege (7 May ‚Äì 13 August 1487)  Modern M√°laga from the ramparts of Gibralfaro, looking towards the citadel, visible below While still at V√©lez, Ferdinand attempted to negotiate a surrender on good terms, but his offers were refused by Hamet el Zegr√≠. Ferdinand left Velez on 7 May 1487 and advanced along the coast to Bezmiliana, about six miles from MƒÅlaqa, where the road led between two heights defended by the Muslims. A fight ensued that continued until evening, when the Christians managed to turn the position and the nasrid retreated to the Gibralfaro fortress. The landward height was converted into a Christian strong point, and they began construction of works encircling the city. These were either a trench and palisade, or an earth embankment where the ground was too rocky for excavation. A fleet of armed ships, galleys, and caravels placed in the harbor cut off all access to the city from the sea. The first attack was against the landward suburb. They breached the wall, and after strong resistance the Muslims were driven back into the city. King Ferdinand II sent an expedition to the ruins of Algeciras to retrieve stone balls used in the Siege of Algeciras (1342‚Äì44) so they could be used against MƒÅlaqa. Queen Isabella joined her husband, accompanied by her court and by various high clergymen and nobles, a move that helped to boost morale. The Muslims kept up fire from the city on the opposing lines, and made repeated sallies, sometimes in strength. There were also attempts to relieve the city. In one case El Zagal sent a body of cavalry from Guadix, but a stronger force sent by Abdallah intercepted and defeated it. Abdallah followed up by sending costly gifts to the Catholic monarchs and assuring them of his friendly disposition. In return, the monarchs agreed to leave his subjects in peace and to allow non-military trade between Granada and Spain. M√°laga began to run short of food supplies. The Holy Roman Empire sided with Castile and Aragon by Maximilian I sending two Flemish transports with military supplies. Ferdinand II of Aragon Ferdinand had intended to starve the city out, but became impatient with the delays and began construction of mobile siege towers that could be used to bridge the walls, and mines to enter the city from below or to undermine the walls. The Muslims attacked and destroyed the towers, counter-mined and drove out the Castillian and Aragonese forces and sent out armed vessels against their fleet. However, after three months they managed to take possession of an outlying tower attached with a bridge of four arches to the city wall, a key point from which to advance into the city. By this time the population had run out of stores of food and had been reduced to the extremes of eating dogs and cats, eating the leaves of vines and palms, and chewing hides. Seeing their extreme suffering, Hamet el Zegr√≠ eventually agreed to withdraw with his forces to the Gibralfaro, and let the population make terms with the Christians.  Capitulation (13‚Äì18 August 1487)  After unsuccessful attempts to negotiate terms, the representatives of the city eventually capitulated without conditions, throwing themselves on Ferdinand's mercy. The city surrendered on 13 August 1487. The citadel held out until 18 August 1487 when its leader, the merchant Ali Dordux, surrendered on the basis that his group of twenty-five families would be allowed to stay as Mud√©jars. The monarchs entered triumphantly on 18 August 1487. The fortress of the Gibralfaro, under the command of Hamet el Zegr√≠, surrendered the next day.  Aftermath  The conquest of M√°laga was a harsh blow to the Nasrid kingdom of Granada, which lost its principal seaport. King Ferdinand II of Aragon had tried to negotiate the surrender of the city several times during the siege, but the defending forces declined it. As a result, the conquerors imposed a harsh penalty to the defeated side: the population was condemned to slavery or death, other than the group led by Ali Dordux. Hamet el Zegr√≠ was executed. The survivors, numbering from 11,000 to 15,000 excluding the foreign mercenaries, were enslaved and their property confiscated. Some were sent to the North of Africa in exchange for captives, some were sold to defray the costs of the campaign, and some were distributed as gifts. The task of reorganizing the territory was given to Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez Manrique, who had captured the fortress, and to Juan de la Fuente, two experienced administrators. Manrique made use of the help of Ali Dordux. Land was given in payment to the troops that accompanied the conquistadors. Between 5,000 and 6,000 colonists from Extremadura, Le√≥n, Castile, Galicia and the Levant repopulated the province, of whom about a thousand settled in the capital.

He described 26 new species. While researching tropical diseases in Uganda, he was speared to death by tribesmen who believed that he would use their blood samples for witchcraft.  Background  Ernest Gerald Gibbins was born in Liverpool, England. Despite his early enthusiasm for natural history, he was not formally educated in biology. At Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, part of the University of Liverpool, W.S. Patton and D.B. Blacklock noticed his devotion. They became his mentors and in 1930, they enabled him to take part in an entomological course. Gibbins remained closely tied to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.  Career  During the interwar period, Gibbins was recruited to the Colonial Service. Along with other entomologists and field officers, he was sent to serve in the East Africa Protectorate. Gibbins was assigned to field and laboratory work related to tropical diseases. In 1929, he joined the Malaria Unit of the Uganda Medical Department. In his early years as a member of the unit, he worked simultaneously on mosquitos and black flies. Work on the former brought led to his acquaintance with the mosquito expert Frederick Wallace Edwards. Gibbins was elected Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society. Gibbins accompanied Edwards on the 1934‚Äì1935 expedition to the Rwenzori Mountains, sponsored by British Museum (Natural History). He published papers on tsetse fly bionomics and control, enhanced by figures he himself drew. A 1939 paper written jointly with Edwards, concerning their findings, was among his last publications. His work on the black fly family (Simuliidae) was recognised in 1939, when he received an honorary Master of Science degree.  Death and legacy  On 3 November 1942, Gibbins was travelling to spend Christmas at his home in Entebbe, Uganda, when his car was ambushed by Lugbara tribesmen, who speared him to death. Gibbins had taken human blood samples for his research into human African trypanosomiasis and yellow fever, but the tribesmen were convinced that he intended to use them in \\"white man's witchcraft\\". The investigating police officer described his body as being \\"as full of spears as a bloody porcupine\\". A year later, his insect collections were sent to British Museum (Natural History), now known as Natural History Museum. Starting in 1933, Gibbins described 26 new species in 15 publications. A synonym for Byssodon, a subgenus of the black fly genus Simulium, was named Gibbinsiellum by I. A. Rubtsov in 1962 explicitly after Ernest Gibbins and in honour of his faunal and taxonomic studies. The mosquito species Anopheles gibbinsi and Aedes gibbinsi also bear his name.

Curriculum Modern schools offer training in how to deal with drunk driving, underage drinkers, and aggressive customers.American Bartender Association Benefits of Bartender Certification This is often required for certification. Students also learn how to run a bar including setup and cleanup. In addition, students learn the basics about glassware and bartending equipment, as well as brands of liquors and liqueurs, recipes for the most popular drinks (mixology), and drink presentation. They may also trained in customer service, up-selling to customers, and procedures in taking payment. Most schools also offer training in resume preparation, how to act at a job interview, and where they should start looking for employment. Many bar schools have their students train using colored water to simulate the various types of alcohol. Others use the real thing. Some schools also have mock bars behind which their students can train in a realistic way.Katie Corrado Exclusive look inside unique bartending school in Baldwinsville CNY Central, Feb 20, 2013 History Bartending has been a profession since ancient Roman times. There was no need for a bartending school up until the 1700s because alcohol only consisted of beer, wine and ale rather than mixed drinks. The owners of ale houses and taverns would serve alcohol and train new service staff themselves. Dale DeGroff; The Craft of the Cocktail: Everything You Need to Know to Be a Master Bartender, with 500 Recipes, Clarkson Potter, 2002 After the repeal of prohibition in 1933, stand alone bars and bars in restaurants reopened, and it was necessary for businesses to hire bartenders en masse. It was no longer possible for an individual barman to educate the new workers, and so for the first time bartending schools were founded. According to a brief news blurb in Reading Eagle from 1934, \\"bartender schools are mushrooming in the manor of Tom Thumb golf courses a while back\\".

Life Ptolemaios Sarigiannis was born in Piraeus in 1882. He entered the Hellenic Army Academy in 1900 and was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant of Engineers on 9 July 1903. He later completed his studies as a staff officer in the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Guerre. In 1906‚Äì1908 he participated in the Greek Struggle for Macedonia against the Bulgarian-sponsored Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), serving in the Greek consulate of Monastir under the assumed name Kalamidis. In 1909 he was promoted to Lieutenant, and participated in the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913 as Commander of Engineers of the 3rd Infantry Division.

Cenci was founded by five graduates from Beijing Foreign Studies University, including Xia Kang and Zhe Qu, on August 6, 2011. The goal of Cenci was to eliminate the language barriers in news reading, create an alternative reading perspective in visualized reports, and provide sources for comparative news. Its founders wished to tie understanding of news closer to truth. When the website was first launched, Cenci‚Äôs slogan was ‚ÄúSame Events, Diversified reports‚Äù, which was modified to ‚ÄúAny Language, Any Perspective, Anything Cenci‚Äù. As Cenci transitioned into version 3.0, the new slogan was set to be ‚ÄúReporting another Dimension of the World‚Äù. On July 14, 2014, the Cenci Journalism Project website became inaccessible from mainland China. At the same time, multiple web-related services used by the project contributors also became inaccessible, including Weibo accounts, WeChat accounts, Douban.com accounts, and QQ chat groups. It is assumed by founding member Kang Xia that these disruptions were coordinated acts of censorship by the Chinese government.http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2014/07/eulogy-cenci- journalism-project/  History  The Cenci Journalism Project was founded on August 8, 2011, by Xia Kang and Zhe Qu. Until 2012 November, Cenci Journalism Project has been available via RSS . The number of participants of the project has reached to 400, and over 2,000 pieces of news have been translated and edited into English, Arabic, German, French, Russian, Japanese, Italian, Spanish and Korean and more than twenty other languages like Polish, Icelandic, Serbo-Croat and Albanian.  Operating pattern  Cenci Journalism Project does not accept any donations from foundations or individuals. The founders provided funds to cover all of Cenci‚Äôs expenses generated by the server, operations, and activities. Cenci‚Äôs Editor-in-Chief, section directors, section editors, associate editors and translators are all volunteers who work online. When reporting, Cenci adopts new media methods such as crowd-sourcing news, crowd-sourcing translation, and collaborative reporting. The content is edited using the traditional ‚Äúthree levels of editing‚Äù method. In Cenci 3.0, the ‚Äúinverted pyramid‚Äù structure is replaced by ‚ÄúThe News Diamond‚Äù model, which makes use of audio, video, data visualization, interactive design, all media platforms, and ‚ÄúNext Plan‚Äù media cooperation projects to provide a more complete form of convergent reporting in Chinese media. Cenci Journalism Project has about 400 volunteer translators, a group that translates languages such as English, Arabic, German, French, Russian, Japanese, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Polish, Icelandic, Slovene, Serbian, Croatian, and Albanian into Chinese. Cenci is able to follow 54 media outlets in a variety of countries.  Cenci stories  In May 2012 Cenci Journalism Project launched its first sharing session. Up to March 2014, Cenci Journalism Project had around 140,000 subscribers, including 3,200 Chinese scholars and media professionals. According to a readers‚Äô survey in mid-2013, subscribers to Cenci have more educated backgrounds in general (47% of the subscribers hold master's degrees or above; 54% of the subscribers earn annual salaries of RMB 250,000 and above). Since it was founded, Cenci has provided more than 6,000 translated articles from medias around the world and original stories. Cenci maintains good relationships with both Chinese mainstream media and new media. During the 2012 National People‚Äôs Congress and Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference (The Two Conferences), with the assistance of Wei Han (Head of PressMine), Cenci Journalism Project cooperated with Sohu Business to follow foreign reports on the event, in which articles by Cenci were published on Sohu Business Channel first. Within the 7 days of The Two Conferences, translators at Cenci provided Chinese readers with more than 30 relevant articles from 7 different languages. After the online version of Cenci Journalism Project was launched in 2012, its articles were recommended by Fangzhou Jiang (Associate Editor-in-Chief of New Weekly), Yu Liu (Cambridge University Lecturer in Politics), and Mark H. Rowswell (known as freelance performer ‚ÄúDashan‚Äù in China, famous for his appearances on CCTV New Year‚Äôs Gala). Its articles also stirred heated discussions on the North Korean issue among users of Weibo. During the Taiwanese presidential election in January 2012, Jianzhuang Wang (Editor-in-Chief of China Times in Taiwan) authorized Cenci Journalism Project to publish his commentary ‚ÄúIng-wen Tsai‚Äôs Pie‚Äù, and Xinzhong Liao (bestselling author in Taiwan) also authorized Cenci to publish his story, ‚ÄúMainlander‚Äù. The following people also provided authorizations for Cenci Journalism Project: media professionals such as Shuo Wang (Editor-in- Chief of Caixin Media), Ti An, Xiao Yang (chief commentator at Nanfang People Magazine, Harvard Nieman fellow), Baowei Zheng (Director of Chinese Journalism Society), foreign authors such as Kiyoshi Takai (honorary professor at Hokkaido University), Codenonme (Russian media professional who worked in RIA Novosti and Information Telegraph Agency of Russia), Mark Kitto (author of China Cuckoo), Stuart Ramsay (chief correspondent at Sky News), and scholars such as Zhaofeng Xue (economist), Junfeng Yang (law professional), and Junli Du (historian). As a learning project that focuses on multi-lingual reporting, Cenci Journalism Project provides more sources of information for media professionals in China. At the same time, many journalism professors and language professors in Chinese universities also use Cenci Journalism Project for case study in class.

Rogers began his career in Houston, Texas as a member of the 1990s Texas poster-art scene, which featured fellow artists Frank Kozik, Uncle Charlie, and Lindsey Kuhn. Since 1995, Rogers has designed posters for a wide variety of musical acts, including Queens Of The Stone Age, Neil Young, Tool, Deftones, Radiohead, Tori Amos, David Bowie, Morrissey, The Cure, Mars Volta, Public Enemy, Them Crooked Vultures, and many others. His work is viewed as influential in the modern resurgence of the art form, \\"continuously crafting images that push boundaries, whether social, cultural, or aesthetic\\". His work is cataloged among the permanent collections of the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio as well as the Experience Music Project in Seattle, Washington. His work has been featured in various media, including print, television, and feature film. Rogers currently resides in Houston, TX. USA. Influences Rogers artistic style is greatly influenced by American underground comic book artwork, as well as advertising artwork of the 20th century. He has cited painters Vincent van Gogh and Egon Schiele, as well as 1950s EC comic artist Graham Ingels, and seminal 'punk rock' poster artists Raymond Pettibon and Frank Kozik as major influences. Jody Goodall, curator of Richard Goodall Gallery in Manchester, England, which features such artists as renowned photographer Anton Corbijn (iconic U2, Miles Davis and David Bowie pics), says Jermaine \\"took the mantle from Kozik and created a new world of poster art.\\" Rogers advocates what he has called 'culture hijacking', juxtaposing various aspects of pop culture with a plethora of unrelated and classical ideas. Designer/Urban Vinyl Figures Rogers is also recognized in the 'designer vinyl' or 'urban vinyl' scene. This involves the creation of limited edition 'art toys': vinyl figures that are marketed to contemporary art collectors and have risen tremendously in value. In 2004, Rogers released his first figure on the vinyl market, 'Dero'. The figure was an immediate critical success and introduced Jermaine as a player in the blossoming movement. His next figure, 2005's 'Squire', was based on a creature that previously appeared in Jermaine's rock-and-roll posters for the bands AFI and Death Cab For Cutie. This figure was well received and cemented Jermaine's place in the genre. Of these toys, Vinyl Pulse stated, \\"Rather than simply dreaming up interesting characters...Jermaine weaves a storyline which ties them into a larger universe of struggle and deceit.\\" Rogers enjoyed subsequent 'designer vinyl' releases through Strangeco, Jamungo, and Kidrobot. Rogers has additionally released resin, fiberglass and bronze sculptures of his creations. Mentions Rogers artwork has been featured in various books including The Art Of Modern Rock, Juxtapox: Poster Art, SWAG: Rock Posters Of The 90's, Gigposters Vol.1: Rock Show Art Of The 21st Century, The Art Of British Rock, Rock Poster Art and others. His vinyl figurines, sculptures and toys have also been mentioned and shown in books such as TOYGIANTS, MTV Overground: Toys, I AM PLASTIC, and I AM PLASTIC, TOO.

He attended Quranic school followed by the Ferdinando Martini School for his elementary education. At the age of 18, Kebire left for Egypt for pursuit of education and it is where he witnessed the revolution of Saad Zeqlul against the British, an incident that left its mark on him and shaped his rebellious character. A self-educated person, Kebire become more interested in politics and was determined to make a change in his country to improve the livelihood of his people., Sheikh Abdulkader KEBIRE, THE FATHER OF MARTYRS, By Saleh J. Gadi Coming back to Eritrea, Kebire worked as a writer in Asmara and Massawa and as translator for the Italian delegation to Hodeida in Yemen. It was a great opportunity for him to acquaint himself with notable politicians and intellectuals of the era. He became a respected socialite around the diplomatic circles in Yemen and gained many friends. His importance was noticeable to the extent that he participated in the team that was set to broker a peace deal between Saudi-Arabia and Yemen over a border disagreement between the two countries. The team included important personalities of the era: Shiekh Amin Al-Hussaini of Palestine (the leader/Martyr of the famous Palestinian uprising); The notable writer Hashim AlAtassi from Syria; and Prince Shekib Arselan of Lebanon. During his trips to Saudi Arabia to negotiate peace, he met and befriended the Saudi Prince, later King, Faisal Bin AbdulAziz, who used to call him ‚ÄòAl Messewe‚Äôe‚Äô. Political life On 5 May 1941, after the defeat of the Italians in the Second World War and the occupation of Eritrea by the British, Kebire co-founded and became one of the executive leaders of Mahber Fikri Hager (Association of Love of Country), which was seeking social, economic, and legal rights for Eritreans. The Mahber Fiqri Hager (Love of the Nation Club) leadership was composed of twelve members of whom six were Muslims., A brief history of an Eritrean hero After the war, the Mahber Fiqri Hager called for a peaceful demonstration. Around 3000-4000 people had gathered to take part. They marched to the governor‚Äôs palace in Asmara where the military administrator of Eritrea, Brigadier General Kennedy Cooke, lived. The demonstrators demanded to communicate through their leaders from the Mahber Fiqri Hager. Because of his educational background and nationalistic feelings, Kebire was selected by MFH to represent the people of Asmara before Brigadier General Cooke. Approaching the British military authorities, Kebire forwarded a ‚Äòwelcome‚Äô speech and proceeded systematically to remind the British of their wartime promises of freedom and self-determination. He also explained that the people of Eritrea were awaiting their response with optimism. However, Cooke‚Äôs reply was discouraging and degrading, Eritrean independence Haile Selassie plan to unify Eritrea with Ethiopia was intensified, aware of this development, concerned nationalist Eritreans, including Kebire and other prominent figures, organized the Wa‚Äôela Biet Ghergis (Treaty of Biet Ghergis) in November 1946. The treaty was aimed at avoiding the permanent division of the MFH and to propose a conditional union with Ethiopia. It was conducted twice. Though the first was in some way successful, the latter proved failure. Its failure initiated a fertile ground for the successive formation of political parties. One month later, in December 1946, the Muslim League party or commonly known as Al Rabita Al Islamia was founded in Keren. Sheikh Ibrahim Sultan, Haji Suleiman Ahmed, Sheikh Abdulkadir Kebire and others were among the founders and decision makers of the party. In addition to that, Kebire was the head of Hamasien and Asmara branch of Al Rabita. On 10 June 1946 thousands of members of the Islamic league and other Eritreans gathered to listen to Kebire‚Äôs political speech. As in previous times, in that speech, Kebire emphasized the importance of education, ‚Äú...I repeated the words ‚ÄòFreedom‚Äô and ‚ÄòIndependence‚Äô excessively, but I didn‚Äôt mention the means. That is because the means [to freedom and independence] is obvious and they have only one door: it is education. If we are truly demanding freedom and Independence, we have only one means to achieve that: education alone, education alone‚Ä¶.‚Äù, he said. After that long speech in which Kebire outlined his party‚Äôs goals and demands, Kebire become the most admired and the most Charismatic leader of the age. His oratory skills and sound vision were confirmed. Fluent in Arabic, Tigrigna, Tigre, Afar and Italian, Kebire was a trusted politician and an admired orator. He was known for his bravery and respectful character. His speeches were bold, yet diplomatic. His personality was expressed candidly is a song of the time: ‚ÄúKebire‚Äôs mouth that drips words of honey‚Äù became a household jingle. In a letter he wrote to an Eritrean friend residing in Somalia, Kebire once disclosed the terrible situation of Ethiopian Muslims and assured Al Rabita‚Äôs rejection to any federal union with Ethiopia. He also confirmed to his friend that Al Rabita was a nationalist party free of sectarian inclinations. Referring to the life-threatening dangers that he and his colleagues were facing, he commented, ‚ÄòIf, unfortunately, we are not victorious, at least our aim will be broadly known by the Almighty and his creatures and history will attest to it. Living one year with dignity is better than living one thousand years with humiliation.‚Äô He mentioned to his friend the Italian proverb which he is said to have frequently used, ‚ÄòMeglio vivere un giorno Leone Che Cento anni come Pecora ‚Äì better to live one day as a lion than one hundred years as a lamb.‚Äô United Nations When the UN sent its inquiry commission to Eritrea, Kebire and five other prominent members from Al Rabita appeared before the commission and affirmed the party‚Äôs solid stance for independence. In March 1949 the UN sent an invitation to the leaders of the major political parties to give their views on the future of Eritrea at the Lake Success sessions. Each party chose its delegates and Kebire was appointed to be among Al Rabita‚Äôs delegation. Unfortunately, fearful of his courageous speeches and the difference he would make at the conference, the pro-unionists shot Kebire on Sunday 27 March 1949. After three days, on Tuesday 29, he was pronounced dead to become the first prominent Eritrean martyr in the cause for Eritrea‚Äôs independence. His killer, a known thug in the streets of Asmara, was shipped to Harar in Ethiopia where he lived in fear until his death Kebire out of the game, Aklilu HabteWeld team had to debate Ibrahim Sultan weakened and saddened team. Omar Qadi, another Eritrean independentist hero, a lawyer himself, commented on the absence of Kebire by saying that the ‚ÄúIndependentist Movement of Eritrea lost its brightest lawyer‚Äù. Ibrahim Sultan used to say, ‚ÄúI lost my right hand‚Äù in reference to the death of the great Kebire. First martyr Kebire's is also known as the first martyr of the Eritrean armed struggle for Liberation, his death touched and inspired many Eritreans, particularly his followers.

He was the brother of Michael M. Kaback, pediatrician and human geneticist, who developed a screening program to detect and prevent Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, a rare and fatal genetic disorder most common in Ashkenazi Jews.  Biography  Prof. H. Ronald Kaback was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He earned his BS at Haverford College in 1958 and his MD at The Einstein College of Medicine in 1962. He interned at the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center in Pediatrics and did pre- and postdoctoral research at Einstein College in the laboratory of Adele B. Kostellow. In 1964 he moved to National Heart Institute to the laboratory of Earl R. Stadtman. In 1970, he joined the Roche Institute of Molecular biology in Nutley, NJ where he later became Head of Biochemistry. In 1989 he became an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Professor of Physiology and Microbiology, Immunology & Molecular Genetics, as well as a member of the Molecular Biology Institute at the University of California Los Angeles.  Career  Ronald Kaback became interested in membrane transport at a time when studies on biological membranes were in their infancy, and in the early phase of his career, he developed a cell-free membrane system to study active transport. The system consisted of osmotically sealed membrane vesicles of defined orientation (right-side-out) that catalyze active transport essentially as well as intact cells, but lack subsequent metabolism of the solutes accumulated. These vesicles were dubbed Kabackosomes by the Dutch scientist Wilhelmus N. Konings, Kaback's close friend and early collaborator. In addition to transforming the field of transport from phenomenology to biochemistry, this seminal development caused him to forego the practice of pediatrics for a career in basic science. The use of membrane vesicles from various sources has become a standard tool for testing models and performing hypothesis-driven research. Kaback demonstrated quantitatively that an electrochemical H+ gradient is the immediate driving force for accumulation of many different solutes. Peter Mitchell who conceived and formulated the ‚Äò‚ÄôChemiosmotic Hypothesis‚Äô‚Äô considered these findings to be the most conclusive experimental support for the Hypothesis with respect to membrane transport. Kaback extended his interest to the molecular mechanism of membrane transport by focusing on the lactose permease of Escherichia coli (LacY; aka the lactose/H+ symporter), which is now a paradigm for the Major Facilitator Superfamily, arguably the largest group of membrane transport proteins. With the emergence of molecular biology, he and his colleagues pioneered Cysteine- Scanning Mutagenesis in combination with chemical modification, as well as a battery of site-directed biophysical/biochemical techniques to demonstrate almost incontrovertibly that LacY functions by a mechanism involving alternating access of sugar- and proton-binding sites to either side of the membrane. This general experimental approach is recognized today and has become a standard tool for membrane protein research. Without a crystal structure, Kaback and colleagues succeeded in using the approach to obtain essential information about helix packing, the organization of the sugar- binding site, and the residues involved in H+ translocation and coupling. He and his colleagues then obtained an X-ray crystal structure of LacY, an essential step towards understanding the molecular mechanism, which has had important impact on the field of membrane transport. Ronald Kaback gives lectures regularly at international meetings. His laboratory continues to extend studies on the evolution and mechanism of LacY and other symport proteins.
